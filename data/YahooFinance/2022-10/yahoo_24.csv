2887," We've heard a lot of chatter about whether or not capacity will exceed demand in the near term. How would you be monitoring the electric vehicle space and especially given some of the not just newer companies but legacy companies that have made swift movements into trying to make sure that they can bring up some of that production capacity in order to meet kind of this next wave of where the consumer is moving towards in a cleaner type of automotive offering on the market. Yeah, I mean, it's a challenge. You look at a lot of different electric vehicles and you simply can't buy them right now. The F-150 Lightning, the Tesla Model 3 long range until recently massively back-ordered. The reality is that demand can move faster than supply. Supply chains from lithium production to battery production can take years to really ramp up scale. Whereas a consumer can change their mind overnight. Let's say, you know, just ride an electric car for the first time. So absolutely we have a supply and demand a balance right now. But we are seeing so much investment from car manufacturers again from the US government and the $370 billion inflation reduction act. So there's a lot of money coming into this space, but it might take a few years to see that capacity increase. Jay, thanks for being with us. Good to see you. Black Rocks, the US head of the Maddick and active equity ETFs, Jay Jacobs. Well, come up next. What investors should be watching this month? So I was going to share his top three things to be bracing yourself for right now.... You September was the worst month for stocks since March of 2020 and October may not be much better. Right? Three reasons why your money is at risk this month. At pessimism, if we refine your take, thanks a lot. Thanks a lot, folks. But just to use a term for our friend, Joe, but swells on Friday, I think investors",https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yvHvxXHIc5I,1,2022-10-10 13:58:07
2888," This this month, pessimism is where we find your take. Thanks a lot, folks. I'm a hell out of folks, but just to use a term for our friend, Joe Berswellas, on Friday, I think investors have just been pulling from the Hopium pipe a little too much here, especially after that rally to kick off this quarter. A couple of reasons why I think investors need to be a little more concerned about the markets going in the back half of the year, or back half of the month, full story on this, on the Alphine's homepage, first inflation data. Well, we're going to get the CPI and PPI this week, in addition to some inflation expectation data from the Michigan consumer sentiment. The problem is none of this data is really supposed to slow or show marked deceleration month over month. A lot of the economists on the street are looking for really the core CPI, which the market will be very focused on and try to extrapolate what that means to Fed policy. That may not slow month over month over month over month. If we get another hot read, like we saw in the jobs report last week, you could very easily see another ugly market reaction, just one guy's thoughts there. Next up, the raw earnings numbers. We've seen previews so far from AMD, micron, Nike, FedEx. They've all been bad quarters. They've all been really bad forward outlook. In fact, FedEx just flat out pulled its outlook because of various inflation. Look, you can't even look at so ugly. Can't even look at so ugly. Yeah, wow, I didn't, yeah, put on the Yahoo purple blindfold. But you look at the raw numbers, excluding the energy sector. Goldman notes, earnings are expected to fall by 3%. And margins are supposed to decline about 140 basis points year by year into third quarter. Real big shift in tone compared to the first half of this year. And then also, of course, last year, hence, you're seeing margins come down. But a big concern. Last but not least, here, just the tone on these executive earnings calls. It's going to be hard to find really any team that's willing to come up here and set the bar high into a fourth quarter where you might still see a strong dollar in the impact on sales and profits, lingering inflation, problems getting workers, you name it. The tone on these calls could be very down beat. And you might see the stocks get hit as a result. Last but not least, here comes some whiplash. That's my take. I think there's been a little calm. That is, wow, that's really aggressive. Do I have an eyes? Well, that's aggressive. But nonetheless, there's been a little calm that has come to the market. We're seeing it today. Saw it a little bit before the Jaws of Por on Friday. But just be careful here. There's some, this earnings is going to be a lot rockier than I think a lot of folks are bracing. So clearly based on their graphic, move over laser eyes that we saw last year in 2021, here come the dizzy eyes. Yes, honoree, your pillow and hope for better days. Well, as always. I know you're taking the other sides. You're looking for earnings beats today. No, well, there will be earnings beats. Come on, they're always our earnings beats. It's about outlook, bubble block. But it matters what your investment horizon is. As always, if you're retiring next year, you may have a problem. If you're looking like J. Jacobs a little bit further in the future, maybe you don't freak out. Five to 10 years from now, taxes will be hard to be a big earnings headline. I'm just really in. Yeah, it's not going to work. The larger question is, how soon will markets fully price in the biggest risks of a recession perhaps? And because they typically priced that in months ahead of time, what does that actually look like in terms of setting in a bottom and when do we bounce off of that? And we're about to find out. Yeah, guys, come here. Why are next guests says that it's likely the Fed will stay hawkish for the foreseeable future? That's not good. For that bottoming out. I was just going to start on the other side.",https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yvHvxXHIc5I,2,2022-10-10 14:02:48
2889," to Welcome back to Yow Finance on this Monday morning on Brian Saas, alongside Julie Heimann and Brad Smith. Markets or mix, this trader's gear up from important reads on inflation this week and the start of earning season with results out of the big banks. You're seeing some mixed action across the board, the Dow slightly in the green. Now here are three things we're watching for you at this moment. On high alert for a recession, we'll talk one economic expert on the road ahead for the sputtering U.S. economy. And DC heats up. Yow Finance contributor Kevin Surley stops by ahead of the annual World Bank and IMF meetings later this week. And a key great recession player wins some new hardware for his trophy shelf. We'll have the details coming up shortly. Now let's get over to Yow Finance as an S for A over at the Wi-Fi Interactive. And Saas, we are looking at a mixed picture when it comes to equities. The bond market today is closed. But the NASDAQ is the one that is really underperforming right now, down 6.10% of a percent. That's because technology stocks are under pressure so you can see tech here under pressure, healthcare and consumer discretionary as well. Over on the NASDAQ on 100, we are watching a little bit of flatness when it comes to Amazon, Tesla, up about 7.10% of a percent. And Apple, down about 1%. Do you want to point out what's happening with the Chinese ADRs? Because we are seeing some of these Chinese ADRs under pressure. And this is because of some holiday shopping data also because of COVID cases in China. So that's putting pressure on these Chinese stocks. And also putting pressure on some of the gambling stocks as well. So just looking at our gambling chart, we are seeing some of these casinos and win resorts that are under pressure as well as some of the travel stocks guys. Alright, Yow Finance is on the NASDAQ. Thanks for breaking that down for us. Appreciate it. And as we continue to look ahead to what's on tap this week with the Fed Minutes and CPI data, let's bring in the co-founder of the Economic Cycle Research Institute, Loxman to Truth and to break it down. Loxman always a pleasure to speak with you and get some of your insights. Help us tee up this week. I mean, we've got a ton of data, of course. Last week was the big kind of employment reading across the board from private payrolls all the way into some of the Joltz data that we had seen, even though that's lagging a little bit more. And of course, the Monthly Jobs report. What is that setup for what the Fed is also going to be tracking on pricing more broadly this week and what consumers are actually paying? Great question. And thank you for having me. Good morning. Jobs data, CPI data this week, Jobs data last Friday, CPI data this week. Those are all what we would call from a cyclical kind of monitoring point of view, coincident data. And the Fed has declared for many years, kind of what got us into the.",https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yvHvxXHIc5I,3,2022-10-10 14:06:51
2890," So, all what we would call from a cyclical kind of monitoring point of view, coincident data. And the Fed has declared for many years, it's kind of what got us into this pickle in the first place that they're going to be tracking coincident data in order to figure out what to do. And every once in a while, you'll hear that their data dependent. And that's a little bit of an eye into that view. And so we look at the jobs data. Yeah, it was a pretty good report on the face of it. Your year of a year job growth actually is trending down. It's about a year and a half low in the growth rate. So cyclically, we know this direction we're going in, but the jobless rate at a half century low, three and a half percent on the face of it, that's hawkish, more hawkish Fed. It's not what they want to see at this point. They need more weakness in the labor market and they've said that in various ways. And then when you look to the CPI, coincident inflation data this week, probably too sticky, probably too hot. Our cyclical view, right, forward looking cyclical view, is that actually the peak is in, right? And a cyclical peak has already happened in inflation. We are trending down. The problem is that it's going to be very sticky. You might get some relief in the pace of goods related inflation, but the services side where most of the spending happens, including rents, for example, very, very sticky. And as a result, I in the earlier segment, the point was made that, you know, core is going to be sticky. They're looking at core coincident inflation. So again, kind of a hawkish, you know, angle to the Fed, trying to make up for the earlier mistake of missing the inflation cycle upturn, continuing to slow the economy. So Lakshman, you talked about where we are in the inflation cycle. What about where we are in the overall economic cycle, right? Because what we've been hearing from guests as of late is the tenor has started to shift a little bit from being pretty darn confident that it was going to be a mild recession if we get one to maybe leaning a little bit more into, well, maybe it's going to be a little bit more severe than we thought. Thanks. Excellent question. And I, this is how we edge into the realization that, yes, there's a recession. And markets are, and analysts can be kind of manic depressive, right? So they'll be like, no, it's not happening in all of a sudden as it becomes more obvious that something's a foot, they can overdo it and get more extreme the other side. Our analysis is that, yes, there is going to be a recession. To be clear, we will need to see job losses for there to be a recession. Also, to be clear, there have been several instances historically where recessions begin before job losses begin. One of the more extreme examples would be the 73, 75 recession, which was a very severe recession, which began and then jobs actually kept growing for eight months until you actually saw jobs to start negative. So the recession itself began a little bit earlier. This is getting into the weeds about how recessions are determined. And we may be seeing some of that here because it was so hard to find the people that you needed to work that businesses are very reluctant to let them go. Even when they're starting to see difficulty on earnings and you were saying in the earlier segment also I was watching about how this earnings kind of recession feeling is coming in. And FedEx, for example, it's just like, forget it, we can't even say anything. It's a global recession and we don't know what's going to happen. And global recessions to be fair, they are more severe than your kind of garden variety recession. So I think that's a reasonable thing to be thinking about in your scenario planning. Do you think the economy next year will start shedding jobs like you mentioned? Yes, look, if we're right and there's a recession and I think that we are correct here, then by definition there must be job losses. The question will be how much structurally there's a lot of issues in tightness in the labor market so that may limit it to some degree. We have seen as I mentioned in that inflationary kind of 70s period where the nominal numbers look pretty good. The businesses were slow to let people go. I mean, it's very, very expensive to hire someone and then let them go. You have to train them up.",https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yvHvxXHIc5I,4,2022-10-10 14:11:07
2891," slow to let people go. I mean, it's very, very expensive to hire someone and then let them go. You have to train them up and then you have to let them go. That's the last thing you want to do as a business manager. So I understand why that is and they're hopeful. Certainly you see all the time. There's a lot of hope in you use that. I was watching everything this morning. You're using the hope in order this morning. And there's a lot of this this comes up in them in the market talk. Oh, maybe they're going to pivot. Maybe they're going to be able to sell. I don't think that's going to happen. But that kind of talk probably is is keeping some of the jobs growth going to. Um, Lex, man, how does the Fed then react to all of this? Right? There is the talk of pivot has faded away a little bit. Yeah. But at some point, do we see the Fed sort of quickly trying to backpedal here and fix some of the economic damage that it looks like that the policy could cause? Yeah. I mean, I think that we wrote at the beginning of the year in January. We wrote that there's that they had a choice of two mistakes. Right? And meaning that they either had to take a recession or they had to let inflation run out of control. I'm being overly simplistic and they've chosen the recession. So the intention is the pain that is the goal. And I think Powell said as much in one of the Q and A things a week or two ago. And and so will they go too far? I mean, in the sense that there'll be a recession. I think yes. Uh, and they, I think believe that they have the tools to counterman that at some point and and and ease up on the on the typing. But by their own definition, they're saying that they want to see the pace of core. CPI growth, depending on various measures of looking at it, drop down. And by all the analysis and the now casting that we're hearing, this week's CPI is still going to be sticky. And and we think we understand why it's probably more in the services side that it'll be sticky. But the Fed is saying if it's sticky, we're going to stay the course. And that's not what the market wants to hear. So we probably have this slower grinding. And again, you, you had mentioned earlier. It's tempting because prices are down to start to look for bargains longer term bargains. But you're going to have to accept a lot of volatility because this chapter isn't over yet. Okay. So with that in mind and also given that you've studied previous economic cycles, we know that the markets try to price in the risk of a recession well ahead of time. But what would that bottom bottom out period look like in relative to now relative to the declines that we've already seen over the course of 2022. And when might we see that bottom? Hard to say magnitude wise, right? So if it's a global recession and the odds are high, I think of that, it could be more severe. So the recognition of that may be mean some more downside volatility. The question of then is where else do you put your money in? It's and it's hard to figure that out. So there's a lot of maybe this isn't the worst place even though it's going down. These bigger recessions, you could see larger retransments in equity prices than we've seen so far. So that's totally in the cards. The relationship between equities and business cycles, business cycle recessions is that they do tend to sniff out the recovery before the bottom of the recession by a few months. And I have no reason to believe this cycle wouldn't be different. Looking at other leading indicators of non equity related leading indicators, it doesn't look like the bottom is in sight yet. And so that's why we were very suspicious of the soft landing bottoming narrative that developed a few months ago. So I think that the S&P was like in 3600 right around there at 3660 and it was like, that's it. We're seeing the light at the end of the tunnel. We could see across the valley. And of course that was premature. I think we have another light down here. It sounds like that is indeed what we.",https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yvHvxXHIc5I,5,2022-10-10 14:15:21
2892," I think we have another leg down here. It sounds like. That is indeed what we call a head fake. Lachman, at your time. Economics, cycle, research, institute, co-founder. Always good to see you. Have a good rest of the week. Nice to see you too. Thank you. All right, before we head to break, let's highlight some cautious analysis on IBM. By Marcus down these Eric Woodring, head of its October 19th earnings report, notably Woodring expects IBM to miss consensus margin estimates says Woodring in a note to clients. We see downside two street margins and reduce our margin estimates as we expect cost pressures to persist in 3Q. Most of those margin pressures are seen coming from IBM's consulting and infrastructure businesses. Coming up, former Fed Chair Ben Bernanke is a big winner today, Julie is back with today's top headlines next. All right, I'm going to let you know Here are some of the other headlines that we are watching at this hour, at least 11 or 60 injured in Ukraine this morning. After Russia launched its biggest widespread assault on the country since the start of its invasion, this comes after Vladimir Putin accused the country of attacking a critical bridge to Crimea and promised a harsh response if Kiev were to conduct further terrorist attacks, his words on Russian territory. Ukrainian President Vladimir Zelensky says Russia wants, quote, panic and chaos, he cited attacks on the country's electrical grid and other civilian infrastructure. Former US Federal Reserve Chair Ben Bernanke and two other US economists, Douglas Diamond and Philip Dibvig, were recognized by the Nobel, Nobel panel at the Royal Swedish Academy of Sciences in Stockholm today. The three economists sharing the Nobel Prize for their research into the fallout from bank failures. The panel said the trio's research, quote, significantly improved the understanding of the role of banks and why avoiding bank lapses is vital. Credit Tweet shares extend.",https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yvHvxXHIc5I,6,2022-10-10 14:20:02
2893," The trio's research quote significantly improved the understanding of the role of banks, and why avoiding bank lapses is vital. Credit Tweet shares extended their rally to a third day after Bloomberg reported that bidders are lining up for the bank's Securitized Products Unit. That's a key pillar in the downsizing of its investment banking operations. A sale of that unit could prove an additional catalyst for the bank, which recently offered to buy back up to $3 billion of its own debt. It's a busy week down in DC highlighted by the annual IMF and World Bank meetings. The Alphine's contributor, Kevin Surley, has some analysis for us on these events. Kevin, what's on your radar screen? T minus 30 days until the midterm elections, and this week we're going to get two crucial debates that really could be indicative not just of what's happening in Ohio and in Georgia, but the broader country as a whole. In Ohio, the late night senate, J.D. Vance, the Maga Republican, challenging former Democratic congressman Tim Ryan. Remember, he ran for president last cycle as well. This is a debate that is going to be the first of two for them leading up to the midterm elections, but let's not forget that early voting has started in multiple states. And now it is when voters are going to be paying more careful attention. And then of course down in Georgia, Rafael Warnock, the Democrat Governor incumbent, challenging being challenged rather by Herschel Walker. Now he of course has been played by a series of allegations that he denies a chief among them that he advocated for his former girlfriend to have an abortion. Walker has made being anti-abortion part of his platform. So this is really the first time and potentially the last time where these two politicians and the Georgia governor race will come face to face. And mind you, this comes at a time when abortion has risen to the top of the polls as to what Democrats are paying attention to. But this debate really could reverberate outside of Georgia. A lot of folks paying attention to what's going on there. Yeah, indeed, a lot of eyes on that state and the race there, Kevin. Also, we got to talk about jobs and how the recent jobs report that impacts Thursday's inflation print as well. Well, precisely, and not just what happened with the jobs report, record low unemployment rate, 50-year low, 3.5%. But juxtaposed with what happened with OPEC, that has many economists worried that inflation in the United States might continue to rise as consumers face more pain at the pump. But while abortion has risen to the top of issues that Democrats are paying a careful attention to, amongst independent voters and Republicans, it's all about the economy. And that's why the inflation report coming on Thursday, the final report ahead of the midterm elections will be so incredibly crucial and carefully watched. This is been something of an economy, rather, that both parties that strive to seize upon, Democrats saying that there's record low unemployment. But of course, Republicans looking at inflation and saying that it's a sign that we're heading even further into a recession. And then finally, you're watching the January 6th Committee. And this, I guess, also has implications going back to the first item you're watching the midterms potentially. When can we look for the January 6th Committee's report? Nobody knows, Jules. I mean, that's what I've been and truthfully, though, I mean, I'll be honest, I was just, you know, talking to folks yesterday, and, and Julie, that's the biggest question here is, all right, now we're having another hearing. It's going to be in the afternoon. CBS News released a poll just a couple of weeks ago ahead of this hearing where they found something like 31 percent of folks who have been paying attention to this say that this is going to make them more likely to vote for Republican 40 percent who are following the hearing. Say it's going to make them more more likely to vote for Democrats. But the timing of the release of this report and the expectation here in the beltway is that this is the final hearing ahead of the midterms. That's going to be incredibly, incredibly watched if it's after the midterms, which is looking like potentially what it could be. How will that see up 2024 candidates who are looking to to launch their campaigns? We'll be watching. All right, Kevin Sir, really, Yahoo Finance's own joining us here to really discuss and break down. We're watching in the beltway and beyond. Well, Kevin, appreciate it. Anytime. Thanks, guys. Definitely coming up. Why are next guests?",https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yvHvxXHIc5I,7,2022-10-10 14:24:09
2894," Let me go see here to really discuss and break down where we're watching in the belt way and beyond. Well, Kevin, appreciate it. Anytime. Thanks, guys. Definitely. Coming up, why are next guests that continue to uncertainty in Europe will cause the US dollar to remain strong. We'll discuss that next. The strong dollar might be here to stay as war and uncertainty in Europe and the UK abroad make the USA comparatively better place to invest. This plus a spendy consumer here at home could mean inflation is set to remain higher for longer for more. Let's bring in Joseph Lewis who is the Jeffries head of corporate hedging and FX solutions. Joe, great to have you here with us today. First and foremost, we've already heard a lot of tech companies, especially, really give their insight or at least forecast into how much FX headwinds would continue to impact them. Is it going to be in par or in line with or even greater than what they anticipated? First things to remember about companies and how they think about foreign exchanges is that it's an averaging process. What you see immediately today will take some time to flow through their earnings. I think what you'll expect is that if the dollar continues to be strong, which is generally the expectation, you're going to see this show up probably Q1, Q2 next year. As the move recently has been so quick that companies haven't had the time for that to flow completely through the income statement. Look, what we're telling companies is what I spend most of my days doing is to give people advice around strong dollars probably here to stay. You summed it up correctly, which is when you think about your alternatives, the UK, Europe, Asia, the US continues to make a ton of sense in terms of...",https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yvHvxXHIc5I,8,2022-10-10 14:28:30
2895," summed it up correctly, which is when you think about your alternatives to UK, Europe, Asia, the U.S. continues to make a ton of sense in terms of where people want to keep assets going forward. So, Joseph, you said that things, you're employing things are going to get worse because the dollar keeps on going up and there's a delayed effect. This is what companies do, right? They hedge currencies. When they're going up, they're going down. This is part of their operations. As you said, you helped them do that. What is it about this current environment that is so tricky for them? Is it the speed of the move in the dollar, the persistence of it? Is there something unique about this point in time? Well, it's two parts, right? I think it's the speed. And then what you have is the persistence, right? And I think for companies, the hard part right here is companies are hedging six to 12 months out. And for a year at most, 18 months for the companies that are a little bit more aggressive. And so the decision to make is if I go and hedge now and go and lock in what is potentially a problem that may bounce back, right? And so the hardest part for companies right now is to really determine will this persist? And when you have this discussion back and forth about, there's going to be a recession in the US which probably could mean the dollar could weaken, it's hard for companies to make decisions, right? You can take 10 economists and you've probably had two or three people on. They'll say slightly different things have slightly different forecasts. And I think that's been really challenging for my clients is sort of, there is an consistency in view. And a lot of times the views have changed so rapidly, right? Six months ago, the view was very different than it is today. And so, you know, it's summed up. I think it's just hard for companies to make decisions in this market when you have this much volatility. And, you know, the outcome is so determined, really not by fundamentals, but really by policy. Joe, what sectors are doing a good job of hedging in this environment? Well, it's funny. I would say, you know, I wouldn't say some sectors. I think it's the size of companies that are doing better. The larger companies just have much more developed policies. They're just doing more. They've got a history of hedging. They've just been global longer. I think it's the new companies that over the last five, 10 years have seen rapid growth. You know, that growth has been faster than their ability to put policy in place, right? So, you know, I wouldn't say it's a sector, right? I think it's, I would say companies that are seeing, you know, have seen meteoric growth over the last 10 years are probably a little bit behind the April. The companies that have been global for 10, 20 years and to be, then to have policies and tend to be managing effects already. Smaller companies are also a little bit troubling, right? Because they, you know, for them, they're still growing, right? And you kind of want to grow and then have hedges in place. So I would say, you know, companies that are big and have grown rapidly recently and smaller companies. I probably worry the most about. And so with the size of those companies that you're really studying across and researching around, it also comes down to their employee base in all of these countries too. What role does the workforce, the employment and the wages across those different entities? What does that play as well in some of the FX considerations? Look, if you can have earnings and costs locally, that's your best outcome, right? So if I can sell my goods in a country and hire locally, that gives me cost to offset revenue. The companies that have the most issues will tend to be companies that have a lot of intellectual capital in one country and then sell goods in the other. So think about tech. Well, if all your programmers are in one country but you're selling goods globally, you don't actually have cost to offset. So companies are starting to think about that, right? How do I create natural offset? Where do I want to have my labor force capital to offset some of my FX risks? That's the ideal situation. Most companies aren't set up that way. They tend to have what you tend to find and you look at a tech sector, you tend to have a lot of costs in the U.S. for the U.S. companies.",https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yvHvxXHIc5I,9,2022-10-10 14:32:53
2896," Most companies aren't set up that way. They tend to have what you tend to find, and you're going to tech sector, you tend to have a lot of costs in the US, for the US companies, and a lot of net income overseas. And so that's always a challenge. Just bottom line, what do you think the magnitude of the effect of stronger dollars going to be in terms of the hit to US corporate earnings? You'll look, I get the benefit, I would say, of not having to look and try to estimate that. The answer's far. That's a very hard question, because companies man it, and when you think about the market, the largest companies that dominate the S&P into Dow, they have FX policies in place, right? And so I think overall, it's probably bigger than people are going to expect. And companies will come out and tell you, they'll say on a constant currency basis, we are X, but I, you know, I wouldn't, I wouldn't have an exact number, but I would say is I do probably at this persistence the next year, that it's probably going to be larger people expect. Good analysis here. Joseph Lewis, Jeffries head of corporate hedging and FX solutions. Have a good rest of the week. We'll talk to you soon. Thank you. Coming up, Netflix stands to mint money from its new ad tier servers to awesome calls of the day. Coming up next. Welcome back. Let's fire off a few calls on the day on this Monday morning.

You can see that in the stock price. Netflix shares up about 22% in the past three months is really cut fire overall still down 63% year or a day, but still a lot of optimism around the financial potential of this ad service. Anmouth is putting this at potential almost $3 billion by 2026 and maybe 22 million subscribers just in this ad service loan by 2026 next year looking at potential 600 million ad sales from the service. Right. A tear that they moved up in terms of the launch and saying now we're pointing now to November to actually bring the launch into market and it's really going to be a question of when the subscribers really kind of in mass start to latch on to what that new offering could give them in terms of an experience that is lower price. Perhaps yeah, you're still going to get some ads. We know that. Of course, but that's been successful for launch of even the streaming landscape years back. We think back 10 years ago, even when Hulu had some of their ad supported tears, that's really what got some of the introductory members into the streaming services back then. And so now for Netflix, knowing that they've already really capitalized on that high end of pricing mechanisms. Now it's just trying to retain and not turn as many users. And so we could see potentially some of those users kind of downgrading the pricing at least that they're willing to pay at this point. I mean, expectations game for next blix has been the like roller coaster. It's been so fascinating, right? As you mentioned, the beginning like really people not expecting anything from the company. And now as as modeling for its ad platform has leaked, we've seen the expectations really go back up again. So it's hard to see where this goes if it's really going to meet or exceed those those new more sanguine estimates. Yeah, it's a big tell and that didn't exist for Netflix coming into coming into this year. That's for sure. Yeah, they're going to have to compete as well. Disney, even looking at exploring some of their own ad supported tears within Disney Plus, that could be a major competitor for a company that's already seen a massive subscription adoption and has quickly catapulted itself into one of the most powerful streaming services. And that's even pre a massive bundle from Disney too. Yeah. Also here we're tracking shares of craft hines. Yeah, we're going into the kitchen and into the, well, wherever you're starting to catch up and mustards that into the pantries perhaps. After Goldman Sachs made a bullish call on the company upgrading it to buy from neutral with a $43 price target, they're saying that this is one of the consumer staples out there where higher margins, profit margins, it's not fully baked in at this point. So for anybody who's looking to stock up on some catch ups or some mustards, perhaps craft hines is that option. But there's so many other categories that craft hines has been able to really deliver for investors, especially as consumers are really monitoring where they can either buy and bulk in some cases or just get that value that they had seen over many years. And you go back to some of the household names that have the largest brand equity. We'd seen that in some of the other fashion and apparel calls out there on the street. And craft hines is certainly one of those right now with the largest brand equity too. So for those folks last week when those conaggrant earnings numbers hit, you said watch what they said, look what they sent on prices. They had a lot of success despite people becoming more mobile again, pushing through price increases. And that is the same theme that we are seeing in this upgrade from craft hines, which is despite price increases, they're expecting all these price increases that craft took just like conagra, they are likely to stick in coming quarters. Now that comes against a backdrop of CEO Miguel Patricio, probably enough credit for taking this, getting this company off life support, being I think he's passed his two year market CEO, but he's out there cutting a lot of costs from this business. So if you have higher prices, lower costs, that's a pretty good set up for profits. Yeah, it seems that way investors are believing that today also. I'm taking a look at grab holdings. The stock has had been on the move lower down 7% right now after Barclays initiated coverage of the Asian delivery app without over its long term profitability. Now it's an equal weight rating here. It's a neutral weighting. So it's interesting to see it taking such a hit, the price target being set at $3 as you see there. And the analysis car rental costs are a substantial burden for drivers and push up fares.

2898," says car rental costs are a substantial burden for drivers and push up fairs. The analyst does say that the company is a category leader in food delivery and ride-hailing in Southeast Asia with a very strong competitive position. So, hence the equal weight, a little bit of good, a little bit of bad, that said, grab also might be getting caught up to some extent in just the selling that we're seeing in Asian trading. But this is a company I believe it came public through a SPAC if I'm not mistaken. And the stock has not done very well since it did come public through that. Yeah, you think about the ride-sharing environment. Not just here in the U.S., but internationally and that's where grab really gets pulled into the conversation there in the markets that they operate where consumers right now for either the pricing that they're seeing higher or the options that are on the market in getting into micro-mobility or other forms of mobility within a broader parent app, if you will, as Uber and Lyft has tried to add on some of that micro-mobility element for grab. It's very similar, but in a market where there is much more of that micro-mobility, that is actually taken advantage of by the consumers here. So, it's going to be how do you reach profitability while building up some of the other mobility mechanisms for consumers and knowing that you still have to make a lot of investments to retain drivers in one sense, but also decrease the operating per mile costs. And that's going to be a significant headwind still for all of these companies as they try to either dabble more in autonomous technology and how quickly that comes forward is a question Mark's still up in the air at this point as well, but for grab that is going to be something that they have to consider similarly as Uber and Lyft do. Well, I haven't bothered with this. It's a $2.50 stock. Most people I would say watching this have never even heard a grab or taken a grab. If you were that hell bent on using or investing in a ride-sharing business, go with Uber. We used to have Brad Arxson saying Uber is starting to really take market share from its largest competitor in the United States lift. That might be the better way to play this space if you really want to. Well, from one mechanism of riding and ride-sharing to another one in owning a vehicle perhaps, we're also watching shares of Tesla this morning after Morgan Stanley's Adam Jonas cut his price target on Tesla from $383 to $350. Warning of continued headwinds into the fourth quarter and 2023. One of the notables here, the fiscal year 2023 delivery forecast, cut to $1.8 million versus the $2 million previously out there saying that they believe the buy-side consensus range for fiscal year 2023 in deliveries is in the $1.7 million to actually $1.9 million range there. Is that how Adam Jonas actually exists? He's got his notes. I've actually never seen his face. I've been sending him emails for over 10 years. It doesn't really get back to me at all. But look, his notes are really good. He's a market mover, auto-stocks. I appreciate his work, appreciate his diligence on Tesla, which is love to see his face. Is he a sister-shoot? Maybe. Just a few more things from the note, if I may. So he says the company is going through peak auto margins right now, which is interesting. He talks about margin headwinds from ramping up to gigafactory zone, two different continents as something that can be a negative for the company. He also says the company could be experiencing demand destruction, which is really interesting here, and also flies a little bit against what I feel like is the conventional wisdom around Tesla, which is that demand is inexhaustible, right? But that it's supply stuff that is maybe held constrained profits. So it's interesting that he's saying there is a little bit of demand destruction going on there. And while they're also trying to ramp up the capacity and production, and so even if you've got the ability to ramp up all of the output at Shanghai Gigafactory at Austin and Berlin, sure that's more capacity that's coming online, but at what cost if the consumers are either opting for a different brand that's coming into market, or if they're just saying we don't like the price of the Tesla's put out their own street. I'm actually Adam Jonas, I wrote that note. You are. All right, coming up, we're listening investment trust. You would think that they would be vulnerable in a high interest rate environment. Our next guest says they are indeed well prepared. I hope you with us next.",https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yvHvxXHIc5I,12,2022-10-10 14:45:55
2899," Good luck! Sure! you you Yeah you're National Association of Reads, Economist John Worth, joined us now. John, you know, I think of reads as a group that are vulnerable when there's a rising interest rate environment for a number of different reasons. They tend to carry relatively high levels of debt, right? So their services in costs are higher. And they're seen as sort of because of their high dividend yields as almost a competing asset for something like treasuries as their yields are going higher. So talk us through why you think they're well positioned here. Absolutely. Happy to do it. You know, I think the view of reads as being high leverage players is one that is a little bit out of date, frankly. What we've seen is that reat leverage has been coming down for basically a decade. So today we've got leverage ratios near all time lows. The debt that reads are holding is quite well termed out. They've got a weighted average term to maturity today of about seven years plus net interest expense as a share of their operating income is at all time lows. And about 85% of their debt is fixed rate. So they're really quite well positioned for a period of rising interest rates. And just as we compare them to other income-generating alternatives, it's important to keep in mind that reads provide income, but they're not fixed income, right? So they provide both income through their steady dividends as well as capital appreciation opportunities. And typically what we see is that in a period where you're coming out of a, where you're coming out of a potential period of slow growth as we might be in about a year that we see reads do quite well. So why would someone look at reads versus say high growth internet at this point, even though high growth internet is perhaps being redefined, reads still have to compete for the same attention when investors are looking to get back into the market as they do against technology or some of the other more flashy names. Yeah, and I think it's important to think about that from a point-",https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yvHvxXHIc5I,13,2022-10-10 14:49:54
2900," into the market as they do against technology or some of the other more flashy names. Yeah, and I think it's important to think about that from a portfolio construction perspective. One of the things we see is that commercial real estate is such a fundamental piece of the overall economy that's really critical for investors of all types. But is commercial real estate still as necessary if you have less people that are going into offices or there's more of a hybrid work approach? Is it still carrying the same weight? Absolutely. I think you really need to think about the breadth of commercial real estate. Commercial real estate, I think many investors think about it as office and retail, but it's a really much broader space. So for example, in REITs, you have data centers, cell phone towers, logistics facilities. So you're getting the breadth of the economy that's housing the modern, the breadth of the real estate that's housing the modern economy. So you may feel like hybrid work is going to have people in the office less. That means you're going to have more activity through data centers, cell phone towers, logistics facilities. It reads, provide a way to grab the whole breadth of the real estate space. John, maybe I'm looking at it too simplistically here, but if we are going into recession next year, that might kick people out of their homes. Doesn't that mean some of those public storage names should do well? Like they did in the Great Recession. Yeah, and I don't think public storage and the other self-storage places are really going to benefit significantly from people maybe losing their homes. What we see is that that's a sector where we saw a huge bump during COVID, a huge bump in demand as people used the space they had differently. So they cleared out the guest room. They cleared out the garage and turned those into gyms and maybe school rooms in some cases. That gave a huge bump to self-storage demand. Then that was got another dose of demand as the residential real estate market heated up. As that market falls down, we may see some diminution in demand. Whenever you have people making transitions in their lives, whether that that's moving, sending kids to school, bringing kids back into the household, what you see is that you they're using self-storage as part of that. All right, you gave me a whole new reason to rewatch storage wars. National Association of Reats Economists. John Worth, John, appreciate the time here today. Thanks. Coming up everyone, Black Friday deal season. It's kicking off. Wait a minute, it's October 10th, early a target.

2901," the It is time for Cut for Time. Three stories, one minute each. We start with this. Another controversy for Ye, the rapper formerly known as Kanye West, faced social media restrictions over the weekend after users accused the rapper of posting anti-semitic content leading to a block on both his Instagram and Twitter accounts. The reaction from this was interesting, that was reaction from Elon Musk and Elon of course has been noted to say that he is going to do more post acquisition to try and let everybody back on the platform. Raises a larger question of what Twitter will actually be if you still just have this cesspool of some of the harmful or derogatory statements that are coming back onto the platform from either Ye or even former president Donald Trump. Yeah, and I have a lot of questions about the companies that have just had to partner with Ye in various business ways. I mean, we saw it having with Gap and the fallout from that. You see now Adidas is assessing its relationship with him. And I think, you know, when they're trying to tap into his creativity, his place in the zeitgeist, right? At the same time, they have to be cognizant of some of the potential disadvantages of partnering with somebody who can be very volatile. Good point. Black Friday is coming early for target shoppers. Retailer announced it's adding an additional three weeks to its Black Friday deals, extending the discount offerings of up to 50% off to seven weeks total. This is, I think, target just being target. Also, I should mention we got some Adobe sales data out today predicting the holiday season sales rise to and a half percent. You're not great. But this will be one of the most aggressive discounting seasons yet. Holiday seasons, according to Adobe. So there's lots of big deals out there. Lot of retailers, even target Walmart, sitting on a lot inventory. They have to move this stuff. They're going to start moving it early. I mean, if you go to that target website today, Black Friday is like plastered across the deals page. It's pretty interesting. Move over Lululemon's we made too much. And here is we've got way too much over a target. And that's going to be the story for a lot of retailers over the course of this holiday season. How do they turn through inventory at a massively accelerated clip in order to get back into a decent position come the start of 2023 as well? And for the consumer, how are they spending? Is it cash that they're willing to spend right now? Or is it, hey, let's just put it on the credit card. Let's figure that out later. It's going to be great. Target gets half of my paycheck. That place is just so addicted. You go in there and you just look to spend 20 bucks and you're down 150. You don't even know what you got. Tarje. Crazy. What? All right. And I anticipate it's side effect of Apple's new crash detection features come to light. The Wall Street Journal reporting several incidents of iPhone 14 users triggering 911 calls while riding roller coasters. So what's the deal here? Is that the iPhone automatically calls 911 with like an automated message if it thinks you've gotten into a car crash? Well, I guess being on a roller coaster feels like that you've gotten into a car crash. So they keep calling 911 and police keep showing up to various amusement parks around the country. Yeah. I mean, Swift responses that we're actually seeing triggered from the devices. So we know it works. It's just a question of, okay, how do you rein that in a little bit more? Because this is some of the technology that's featured not just in Apple's new iOS for their iPhones, but also within the watch itself. So if you have enough people that have those companion devices, you're going to see a lot of those errant, triggered calls to 911. Well, it says this out real time. No, shake it, shake it. No, I don't have an auto. I don't have a new iPhone. And no, no, I don't. Well, if you like fall down, I don't know how sensitive. Police are showing up to your house. Yeah. And how is the sensor different in this case versus when you're, say, running on a treadmill or doing some other activity? All good questions. All right.

Welcome to Yahoo Finance Live. And happy Monday to all of you. It is 11 a.m. here in New York City. I'm Akiko Fujita. Here's what we're watching at this hour holding pattern and inflation data in the start of results. It's another critical week for financial markets. We're going to be discussing fighting the Fed with all springs, George Borey. Treasury Secretary Jenna Yellen warns about the economic impact from OPEC's latest production cut. We're tracking the fallout as Washington waves a response. Frank MacCurello with the American Petroleum Institute is going to be joining us this hour with his take on the oil cartels decision.

Take a look at the bottom of the screen there. The NASDAQ now hitting a two year low. Down about 1.3% a lot of this coming on the back of still reaction coming from the White House and the administration's very latest efforts to crack down on semi-conductors or specifically crack down on Chinese ship makers.

Named Vidya, Intel, Texas Instruments, Qualcomm, AMD, you get the picture, all of them down today on the back of that extended reaction. Of course, we sell the Chinese shipmakers down in a big way overnight in Asia trading as well. Well, there is a very busy week ahead of us for the markets. This is earning seasoned approaches and more key economic data rolls in. And we've got our very own Yahoo finances and Ned's for a kick things off for us this hour and Ned's. We're talking about earnings, economic data, certainly a lot to process in the week ahead. Yeah, that's right. A lot of data that will be watching that the markets are going to be watching. PPI, the producer price index will be coming out this week. Now this is the change in price which producers receive for their services and goods. So that's expected to come in at 7.3%. The prior reading was 7.3. But the CPI, the consumer price index, that's the really big one on Thursday which will be coming out. And that is expected to, on a year over year, expectation is that's for 8.1%. The core CPI, that's excluding food and energy, that's expected to come in at 6.5%. Now, the big thing here with this, with PPI, with CPI is that the numbers, although they may be well for the core CPI, it's actually that would be up from the previous one. But as far as the expectations, the numbers may not be coming down fast enough. And so if they're not coming down fast enough, then the Fed certainly has room to keep hiking. Also this week, you've got the FBOMC minutes that are coming out. And that will be interesting because the Kiko, we will be able to also see, if there's any discussion in those minutes about the size of the rate increases, if at any point the Fed is considering to sort of put a little bit of a break on those rate increases. Yeah, and the income is at a time, and obviously there's a debate about weather. In fact, the Fed needs to pause a bit because they've been moving so quickly, is it going to be 50 basis points? Is it going to be 75 come November? And of course, the administration's watching it closely. One more FBOMC meeting before the midterm. So a lot today, just there on that front. And as thanks so much for that. Well, U.S. Treasury Secretary Jenner Yellen is warning about the impact OPEC's oil production cut will have on the global economy, telling the financial times the decision is in her words unhelpful and unwise. This, of course, reinforcing the Biden administration's criticism over this move as questions arise on the repercussions that lie ahead. Let's bring in Frank McEarrula. He is API senior vice president of policy, economics, and regulatory affairs. Frank, it's good to talk to you today. We have heard several officials from the administration push back against OPEC's decision from last week. The White House saying it was short-sighted, saying that they will, in fact, respond moving forward. What is that decision meant for U.S. oil producers? Sure. Thanks for having me on. Look, you know, first off, it's a reminder, again, of how important it is to produce energy here in the United States and not have to rely on foreign countries like the OPEC plus nations for our energy. We have the capacity to continue to strengthen our energy security by tapping into the resources we have right here at home. And the more we do that, the less we're reliant and driven by decisions that are made somewhere else. And we did hear your president and CEO Mike Summers put out a statement on the back of that OPEC decision last week saying specifically, we urge the administration to adopt sound public policy that enables American energy to benefit Americans. What specifically does that sound policy look like? Sure. At API, we released a plan called the 10-22 that would open up federal lands and waters for oil and gas production. The Biden administration at the outset of their term closed new leasing for oil and gas development. So we would propose to open it up and continue to produce more here in the United States. The plan also calls for more energy infrastructure. Biden administration canceled critical.",https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yvHvxXHIc5I,17,2022-10-10 15:07:25
2904," those to open it up and continue to produce more here in the United States. The plan also calls for more energy infrastructure. The Biden administration canceled critical pipeline projects. We think the process for permitting of pipeline projects needs to be reformed so we can get energy from where it's produced to where it's needed. We also call on the plan to lift the barriers that are created by tariffs. We know that there is a supply chain issue currently in being able to produce more energy. And so we need to knock those barriers down. Finally, we think it's important to expedite LNG exports. The administration has made a commitment to Europe to export natural gas to provide relief from their reliance on Putin's natural gas. And so we think we need a strong policy that expedites LNG exports. And how quickly would you be able to move on that specifically on LNG? Well we're urging Congress and the administration to act quickly on all components of this plan. I think on LNG, it's really a question of a commitment from the government to expedite applications, a commitment from Europe to build down the necessary infrastructure to take the natural gas into its countries. But there is a commitment there on both sides. And so what we need is an acceleration of that. The oil and gas industry stands ready to help. There is another legislation that's been floating around for some time. And this is no pack specifically stands for no oil producing and exporting cartels act. This would essentially empower the Justice Department to go after OPEC under anti-trust rules if they are seen as setting or at least trying to attempt to control the price of oil. The Biden administration, at least in their statement, seems to suggest they want to revisit that. But I know API has specifically been very opposed to this idea. Why? This policy has been opposed on both sides of the aisle and from administrations in both parties. The real way to get OPEC is to produce more energy here in the United States. And the way to do that is to lift the pause that the administration has had on leasing. Look, at this point in the Obama administration, they had issued 60 leases for oil and gas development. This point in the Biden administration, they're just at six. And so if the administration wants to get serious about energy security and energy independence, it needs to look right here at home. And it needs to provide a pathway for more energy production here in the United States. But finally, Frank, you sort of alluded to the need for more exports coming out of the U.S. at a time when there are concerns about supply globally. You have put out a letter here saying that any kind of export ban we're talking about diesel, but also refined products would deplete inventory levels and it would put upward pressure on consumer fuel prices. Of course, the administration argument would be, we'll add a time when there was concerns about supply crunch, that supply should be left domestically. So walk me through your calculation. Why does this deplete supply in your opinion? And why would that push prices higher? Sure, it's not our opinion in July of this year, the American Council for Capital Formation studied this issue. They found that an export ban on refined product would end up cutting refinery capacity by 1.3 million barrels per day here in the United States. It would end up raising costs for fuel for consumers across the United States. It would cost jobs, about 85,000 jobs would be lost under such a policy. And finally, it would harm American GDP. And so for all of those reasons and for American energy security, the refined export product ban is a bad idea. Finally, this administration has made a commitment to our allies overseas, to other countries that we support, to Latin America, where we export an enormous amount of refined product. It's made a commitment to those allies that we're going to continue to provide the energy that we have right here in the United States. I see no reason why the administration should turn its back on that commitment. And it would certainly imposing such a policy would certainly...",https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yvHvxXHIc5I,18,2022-10-10 15:11:44
2905," here in the United States. I see no reason why the administration should turn its back on that commitment. And it would certainly, imposing such a policy would certainly not help the American consumer. And where are those conversations stand right now with the administration? I know there's been a bit of a back and forth. Oftentimes it has been reported as being a little more contentious. In terms of specifically an export ban, what's your understanding of where the administration stands? Well, we've made the case. We've laid out the data that shows that such a policy would have negative implications for the American people, for the driving public. I think the administration understands that. I think they understand that these are global products that require global markets. I think they also understand that the United States has world-class leading refineries. And they produce the fuels that the world needs. And so we're hopeful that the administration steps back from considerations of export ban, whether it's crude oil, refined product, or LNG. Frankly, looks toward American energy production as the solution. We've set all along the solution to the challenges that we face, actually lie under our feet. Because of innovation and technology, we've increased production here in the United States. From seven million barrels to 12 million barrels per day, we can do more. We need the policies in place to help us achieve that.

2906," I I am I am I am I'm We are on the cusp of yet another earning season and markets are turning to JP Morgan, City Wells Fargo and Morgan Stanley as they report during the most uncertain of economic environments for preview of what to expect. Let's bring in Yahoo finances, Alexandra Seminova. These are always, it's always a good bell leather, right? About where things are in terms of the economy, as we said, never been more uncertain. Yeah, absolutely a key go. Those four bangs among the six largest in the US by assets are set to be the opening act of the earnings season with Goldman Sachs and Bank of America set to release results next week. And some of the themes that we'll be watching closely are a slowdown in investment banking revenues, potential layoffs across their businesses, how demand for loans is holding up with higher interest rates, and any potential warnings about the economy that CEOs may deliver on earnings calls. And this quarter profits are expected to shrink, especially compared to a really robust 2021 for Wall Street. Profits are also likely to take a hit from higher loan loss provisions. Those are funds that aside by banks for any potential sour loans if customers don't make their payments. The six largest US banks are estimated to set aside a collective $4.5 billion this quarter that's according to financial times report today. And this is also a turnaround from a year ago when banks actually benefited from releasing those reserves as we were recovering from the pandemic. One notable thing to note too is that banks typically benefit from higher interest rate environments. Those often give them a nice boost on their net interest income. But investment banking revenue is likely to offset that. And some other things to look out for too are any comments that bank executives make. Jamie Diamond is always an interesting one on his earnings calls with his storm cloud warnings. Credit, Swiss, and the broad, what that means for the broader industry. And also a bank of American Morgan Stanley are estimated to lose a combined $500 million on Elon Musk's Twitter deal. You know, with noting the bar pretty low, going into earnings season, not just within banks, but overall. Thanks so much for that. I know you're going to be tracking those results really closely moving on here as we look ahead to. There you go. There's the prompt. Let's take a wider look on market. TD Ameritrade out with its investor movement index showing traders took a more risk off approach in September for more about what these results mean and what's driving the trends. Let's bring in Sean Cruz. TD Ameritrade head trading strategist Sean. These notes are always really interesting to me. A very good gauge of where the retail investor stands feels like it's pretty much tracking with the rest of the market. Things just aren't feeling very good. Yeah, I think right now, we got a little bit of a head fake back in August. There was actually recovery for the first time this year. We actually had that investor movement index tick higher. And I think that quickly got wiped off the table in September. So what we did see in what clients were buying, they were certainly being a little bit more conservative and that they weren't going out there buying some of the more speculative areas of the market, some of the more speculative names that maybe aren't profitable right now or just have some very high multiples. They're not really reaching for those right now. They're going back to some of the more familiar established names out there. In some cases, really looking at names with quality fundamentals be that solid revenues, solid cash flow, healthy balance sheets leverage was another thing that they certainly have been a little bit wary of as we're starting to see rates tick higher and higher that is going to impact.",https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yvHvxXHIc5I,20,2022-10-10 15:20:36
2907," Solid cash flow, healthy balance sheets, leverage was another thing that they certainly have been a little bit wary of as we're starting to see rates tick higher and higher that is going to impact some of those more highly leveraged companies versus the more fundamentally sound companies. So, they still found some opportunities out there, but they certainly are a little bit cautious right now and I think that makes sense. And we're going to get to some of those names we just showed on the screen there, but broadly speaking, what has led to the sell-off that you have seen exiting of positions? Is it really just about the Fed? I think that really was what drove that optimism in August and that light at the end of the tunnel from the Fed pausing or potentially even reversing some of those rate hikes gave it, drove a lot of optimism, but like I said, that light at the end of the tunnel ended up being a train coming your way instead. And that really drove that shift in sentiment in that not only were we getting some data that did indicate they haven't made significant progress, they are starting to have an effect, look at housing for instance, but the Fed kept coming out. Whenever the market would give a little bit of a pop of optimism, you would almost have a Fed speaker somewhere and somewhere come out and say, look, we're not stopping. This is something we are committed to. I think they're coming around to that notion and that's why we're trading down at these levels. I think the market's going to respond differently to maybe a hawkish Fed when we're trading at 3600 on the S&P 500 versus say trading up at 4,000 or 4,200. So I do think a lot of that is now priced in if things get significantly worse and that's why we just spoke about the bank earnings, that is going to be huge. The macro read through on what we hear from the banks, I think is really going to set the tone for the rest of earnings seasons and I think the market is also going to change their macro outlook based on what we hear. So let's talk about some of those names that we have seen big moves in. In terms of net buyers, we're seeing a lot of the chip makers, you could argue that's part of evaluation play, given just how far some of these names have pulled back. But in terms of those that are being sold, Exxon mobile and BP, an interesting one to me, because energy has been pretty strong is this sort of the expectation that we have reached the peak with some of these names and the pull back is coming. That is where we see that type of activity. I don't think anyone expects crude oil to completely fall apart anytime soon, but I do think they're looking at it from a little bit more of a valuation standpoint. And we have seen that where you get these energy companies trading towards the bottom of their range. That's where there's a lot of interest in buying when they recover and they start hitting towards the upper end of those ranges. That's where they rotate out of those. So I think it's an interesting strategy. It's more of a short term strategy. I think we see playing out, but they use those profits when they do decide to roll out and lower exposure in those names. We actually do see them going out there and trying to find opportunity elsewhere. And the semiconductors last month was that key spot. I think we saw a lot of interest on the buy side. Certainly today I think caught a lot of people off guard. If you look at the semiconductors that are really getting hit, it's the semiconductor companies that really have a lot of exposure to that relationship with China and just what goes on the entrepreneur offshore aspect of their supply chains. But I think what they were looking at, if you look at the charts, AMD, NVIDIA, Intel, all those names were hitting the support levels. And when you see the support levels, these ranges, they start to approach the lower end. That's where you get a lot of buying activity. I'm going to venture, guess what we look at this again next month. We're going to see a lot of selling as they broke through some of those. I was going to say, I wonder if some of that buying holds, especially as we get these warnings about demand, especially from a lot of these big chip makers. He has them see another one, or started to hear from this week. Sean Cruz, a TD Ameritrade, head trading strategist. Thanks so much for joining us today. Well coming up bullish call, Bernstein says Airbnb is on track to become the biggest Western travel platform. But what about recession fears? COVID and some competitors. We'll chat that next.",https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yvHvxXHIc5I,21,2022-10-10 15:24:51
2908,"... A.B. Bernstein is getting bullish on Airbnb. Initiating coverage and outperform what a $143 price target, saying it's rapid and profitable growth removes a key hurdle. It's valuation. Joining us now is Richard Clark, managing director at A.B. Bernstein. Richard, there's a number of things that you highlight here, but really the point being that this isn't just about Airbnb being able to protect its market share and the vacation rental business. Do you think they could really make a significant play on hotels and experiences as well? Walk me through that thesis. Yeah, I mean, I think that's absolutely right. So, I think the vacation rental market is still very exciting. I think it's a big market. It's going to gain share of the overall lodging market and Airbnb will think we'll gain share within that. But probably beyond that, even more exciting, is that ability to sell more than just vacation rental market. It doesn't market as much as other travel platforms, so it has a loyal customer following, as a very strong brand. And we think they can sell longer stays, hotel rooms, experiences, and they can add to its growth. The longer stays have been a real growth spot for Airbnb, something they've been highlighting, especially over the course of the pandemic. The hotels specifically, where do you see them making a play when you look at how fragmented the market is right now? Yeah, so I mean, I think actually the hotel market is fragmented. The distribution market is not that fragmented, you've got booking and expedior, they're quite dominant in their respective geography. So, I think the actual hotels are looking for other distribution channels to broaden their landscape a little bit. And I think Airbnb is unique in the sense that it does try and inspire the customer. You know, it's got this category-based search. It tries to find a way to match the customer and the product up in the way that we don't see in other companies. And I think that gives it a way to make a play in hotels. So you see the platform evolving into a place where hotels can also list their openings? Well, they're already on. I mean, there are already tens of thousands of hotels listed on Airbnb.",https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yvHvxXHIc5I,22,2022-10-10 15:29:19
2909," and also list their openings? Well, they're already on, I mean, there are already tens of thousands of hotels listed on on on Airbnb, Airbnb, bought hotels tonight. They signed a deal with side-minder. They signed a deal with OVO and that gave them probably somewhere around 70 to 80,000 hotels. But that's only just scratching the surface. There's probably 10 times that many hotels in the world. And I think through COVID, they focus on the core business. And hotels is one thing that they can try and reignite post the other side of COVID. And yet put it alongside the vacation rentals on its platform. Richard, we've been talking so much about a lot of these companies within the sharing economy, whether that's in Uber, food delivery, Airbnb, among them. You know, they all started after the financial, after the great recession. And it was sort of in earlier days used as a platform for a lot of people to make some extra cash on the side. Yeah. You know, how much of a catalyst do you think if we are looking at a further downturn in the macro picture? I mean, could that be a potential catalyst for Airbnb to bring in more hosts and really expand the platform in a way? Yeah, I think that's right. I mean, I think first of all, there's quite a lot of dormant hosts on Airbnb, like there's a lot of listings that haven't taken a booking in the last year. Maybe that's because of COVID, nervousness around that. So maybe part of it is bringing existing hosts back onto the platform. And then, yeah, I think beyond that, they're probably are other people that will need to supplement their income. They'll need to offset the fact that maybe they paid higher mortgage costs or higher rental costs. And that may bring entirely new supply to the market. Okay, Avery Bernstein, Managing Director Richard Clark, appreciate your time today. Thank you. Well, coming up, prepare for landing. The Fed attempting a controlled descent in stormy weather. This week, we'll get more clarity on the direction of travel through fresh inflation data. We've had bonds on the other side.",https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yvHvxXHIc5I,23,2022-10-10 15:34:59
2910," We'll start with the unionization movement kicking into high gear with talks, ramping up more than 200 stores nationwide have joined the movement. There's pressure on the coffee giant to engage. We're going to start scrolling from both workers, shareholders and regulators. Let's bring in Yahoo finances, Alexis Keenan. With a broad state of play right now and in many ways Friday was a big step. It was. It was. It was. It was. We're resolving. We are. Yeah, so let's talk about what happened. But first let's kind of look at the state of affairs for Starbucks and this unionization push by its baristas across its retail stores in the US. You have among its 900 or 9,000 rather corporate owned US stores. About 220 of them have unionized so far. Also the number of union votes that have been held as of Thursday, 309 ballot counts, 248 of those ending in yes votes to unionize. 54 of those saying no and seven under a challenge right now. But Friday was significant and there's two reasons for that. One is that it was the first time that workers in Arkansas have chosen to go ahead and petition to unionize and that brings the number of states that actually have unionized stores to 38 among the 50 states. And it also Friday was the first time that the NLRB, the National Labor Relations Board ruled that Starbucks illegally fired one of its workers and that was for taking part in unionization activity. So that's kind of a big deal right for the labor board to say for the first time among a lot of complaints that have been filed. There are 35 filed so far that yes Starbucks was in the wrong here. And as a consequence what Starbucks is going to have to do is going to reinstate that employees job, give that employee back pay, but also have a meeting with the Starbucks workers there and this is Ann Arbor Michigan by the way. The Starbucks workers, its management as well as government has to take part in the talks where it's going to have to read a notice about what exactly was illegal about its actions. So it's going to have to have this sort of mea culpa and get everybody together and say these are your rights. Now as for Starbucks part, we reached out to Starbucks, we haven't heard back yet but the company has told Bloomberg that these claims that were in this complaint for this Ann Arbor worker, they call them categorically false. So just a lot of changes here for Starbucks and the company is continuing to fight these challenges, these efforts by their workers across the country to unionize. So just a bit of pressure here, particularly on Friday, so kind of a big turn with this NLRB decision coming down. And you talk about the various pressure points that are sort of mounting against Starbucks. Another one coming from the New York City controller, what do we know about that? Right. So I will have to get back to you with more information on that. I haven't been focusing on that as much a key go, but certainly the New York has wanted a Starbucks to go ahead and follow the rules that the National Labor Relations Board lays out for these push, these petitions by workers to follow what is required under law for these elections to take place. Okay. Staying on top of it for us, Alexis Keenan, thanks so much for that. One of the Fed's biggest critics of late is that it again, speaking on CBS yesterday, Alianz's chief economic advisor, Muhammad Al Ariin, said he fears, quote, a very high probability of damaging a recession that was totally avoidable. He'll track higher in the aftermath of Friday's jobs, report him into indication the Fed will need to continue its hiking round. The next guest says a hard landing is likely. Let's get into the discussion with George O'Bouray. He's all spring global investments, chief investment strategies for fixed income and Georgia doesn't sound promising. Hi, Keigo. Thanks for having me on the show. It's a rough backdrop. It's a rough economic backdrop. And one of the challenges that the Fed faces is that at this juncture in the cycle, good news is effectively bad. And that's simply because the Fed is trying to fight inflation. We know that. They've been at it now for quite some time throughout this year. They still feel behind the curve. We're going to see the data. We're going to see a new set of inflation data on.",https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yvHvxXHIc5I,24,2022-10-10 15:37:51
2911," that they've been at it now for quite some time throughout this year, they still feel behind the curve. You know, we're going to see the data. We're going to see a new set of inflation data on Thursday with the CPI report. Expectations are, you know, headline CPI should come down a little, but core inflation is likely to keep rising. And it's really, when you take that inflation data, plus the strong, relatively strong employment data from Friday, it would suggest that the economy in the US is still, it's still expanding and it's still chugging along at a pretty good pace. And the Fed has told us very clearly that they want to slow that down. So from other commentators from us as well, the expectation is the Fed's going to get what they want. They need to slow growth. They will slow growth. And if you look into the first half of next year, the sort of lag defect of all these rate hikes should start to bite. And so the probability of a recession, it's going up. And we think it's actually going up fairly quickly. And that's likely to really start to unfold as we get into the beginning part of next year. So how does that set things up going into the next FOMC meeting? And there's certainly a debate on this sidelines that's happening about whether in fact the Fed should maybe pause a bit here to really allow for those rate hikes that have already been implemented to take root. Are we getting any indications of that potential pause, especially when you say the risk of a recession is growing? Well the Fed has kind of painted themselves into a box. They've said that they're going to respond to the data and they've sort of taken a much more of a near term approach. They need to see current data demonstrate that inflation is coming down on a sustained basis. That takes sort of multiple months. It's going to take time. It's also going to require a broadening out of the data. So the Fed doesn't have a lot of wiggle room in here from our perspective. They need to continue to tighten and tighten policy. The question is, is simply how fast a pivot at this point, at best case scenario from a pivot standpoint, is they're able to decelerate the pace of rate hikes. Now if, if, say Wednesday's data, surprisingly comes in below expectations on both the headline and a core basis, that might provide the window of hope or open the window, if you will, for a bit of hope that a pivot of sorts might be coming. But it's still premature in our opinion. You haven't seen that sort of clear evidence to give the Fed kind of cover to really start to pivot. Now the one thing that is not really discussed all that much is just market volatility. Volatility in the bond market is very high right now. And it's likely to stay high as long as these expectations for tighter policy continue. With high volatility, some comes sort of a lot of movement in prices by definition, but liquidity also tends to dry up. If the market kind of ceases to function, well then the Fed will have to do something. But we're not at that point yet. The market's functioning, it's functioning at a slow pace, but it is still functioning. George really quickly here, it is a holiday today, but when you look at where the 10-year yield has tracked, we're off of that level just being under four, but we're still up 3-8-8, based on Friday's close. Where do you expect it to track, at least in the near term? Sure, that's a good point. There's a big distinction between the front end of the curve and the longer end of the curve. We've repriced up, if you will, we're up about 25 basis points or so on the 10-year. As you mentioned, up around 3-88, 4% is sort of our number that we expect the 10-year to consolidate around that number. We would say plus or minus 25 basis points on each side of 4%. Is really our central case as we go into the end of the year. The front end, the Fed has also been pretty clear. They want to get the front end up to about 4.5% by year end. So a 50 basis point spread, say, between the two-year and the 10-year with the two-year above the 10-year, that would be pretty consistent with tight monetary policy, restrictive monetary policy, and that should help slow growth as we go into next year.

Thank you very much. Well, coming up, we're going to be discussing a different type of EV, probably supermanium, getting electric at the NADDA, across. Yeah, I keep going. We're here at the NADDA, a different type of EV, a solar powered one, the Sion by Sona Motors. We'll talk to the CEO after this. Well, German carmaker Sona Motors is on a mission to make mobility and growing megacities more sustainable. For more on that, the CEO of the EV startup, standing by with their very own proud supermanium, live from the NADDA. Well, German carmaker Sona Motors is on a mission to make mobility and growing megacities more sustainable for more on that, the CEO of the EV startup, standing by with our very own proud supermanium, live from the NADDA, across. That's right, if you can hear it, the NADDA, Sona Motors actually listed on the NADDA, their German company listed here. They have their Sion solar powered EV here, it's right behind us. And joining me now is CEO Lauren Han. So Lauren, talk to us about the Sion, you're hearing the states. What's going on exactly? Sure. Hi, everyone. Nice to be here. This is the first solar electric vehicle being affordable. We brought it the first time to the US, first hand, first day here. Incredible car, $25,000, family, apparently affordable solar cells in the whole car body, it's re-churching itself, and it's really meant to be that mass-market electric vehicle. So you know what I mentioned this to people before they talked to me about a solar powered car, that's not totally true, you still got to plug it into getting more power. You've got... What kind of solar power, what kind of range are we going to get capture from the sun for those GPS? Giving you an example, beautiful day here in the US, in New York. We have 12 miles per day being commuted in the city.",https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yvHvxXHIc5I,26,2022-10-10 15:48:02
2913," fun for those PPS. Giving you an example, beautiful day here in the US and New York. We have 12 miles per day being commuted in the city on average. This car is re-charging at 13 miles a day. It's 17 miles a week on average. That's amazing because that means no re-charging for most of the commuters. And that's the big assul about electric vehicles, right? Re-charging, we can park, we'll find a charging station, range anxiety, all that stuff. That's what people are worried about. And this car is sold, solving that issue. So we know, you know, this car has a total range of around 200 miles per charge. Right. But what you're saying is that given how people use the car normally, you can basically use, basically capture as much solar power as you need to use the car on a regular basis. Let's say your car needs to run by miles each way. Right. So you're saying it's for most people, it makes sense for solar. Exactly. Commuters. We're using the car to get from A to B to work, right? And they're not driving like 200, 300 miles to work. No, they're driving on average 12 miles as a set. And this car is re-searching itself. That's the biggest hurdle about electric vehicles, and we are solving it. So where are you guys going to launch in here in Germany? What's the rollout for this car, exactly? So the first launch is in Europe. We have 42,000 down payments and pre-hers in total from B2B and B2C. And we're right now, you know, bringing out the plan for the US. We have a great plan for the US. There's huge potential here. We see huge potential for suburban markets here. Family-friendly vehicles affordable $25,000. So take a kind of a step back with this car. $25,000, very affordable. Use a solar power element. Why did you guys decide that was the way to go for EVs? Not just the grid, but capturing from the solar power. We get every day. Well, because I, you know, myself asked myself, what's a great product? And I'm living in the furt floor and don't have an own house. I don't have a own garage. And I asked myself, where do I charge? Where do I charge my electric vehicle, right? And I came always through the conclusion, it's not working. I need something more than that. And that's why we integrate it solar, because we believe it's convenience. It's extending your range. It's highly affordable, because you don't have to pay for high electricity. Electricity builds there, right? And is there more incentives in places like Europe or something, or is it sort of across the board? Are you guys getting any kind of incentive? Well, there are incentives for electric vehicles, I think across the world. In every own country, you get certain incentives. There are countries starting to incentive by a solar electric vehicle. You take a Holland, in Holland, there is an incentive for solar electric vehicles. So on top of the electric vehicle centers, in centers, you get a solar electric vehicle center. So you see the whole industry is changing to solar electric vehicles. As we believe, the next big thing in the electric mobility. So what are we talking about in terms of free orders here for the car globally? And also you got some deals in the works with car sharing, right? Yes. Yes. As mentioned, 42,000 downpapers and free orders. It's 22,000 B2s BE and 20,000 B2C reservations. The B2C reservations being downpainted with amazing 2,000 euros and average. So sticky, real reservations. People putting down 2,000 euros for this car on the waiting list. Amazing. And with that, we have the full auto book already for Europe. Right now going on tour here. New York, Boston, Detroit, San Francisco, NLA. And we'll test the demand there. We already get great feedback. You also have this new fit, which I believe is a rental car company. Yes. How does that work? It's a subscription car company. They ordered just 12,600 cars. And it's an amazing order. We have so much more potential than the B2B sector. This is the perfect car for being an Uber driver, for being delivery service, for being a subscription car model. We believe there's so much more potential out there. So real quick.",https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yvHvxXHIc5I,27,2022-10-10 15:50:58
2914," In Uber driver for being delivery service, for being subscription car models, we believe there's so much more potential out there. So real quick, we talked about this, the deal with Finn. You guys using Valnet to actually snake the cars because he has cars with a third party manufacturer. How soon are we going to see these cars in the road? Our plan is to launch this car and produce this car in the second half of next year. We have a great partnership with Valnet there being very experienced over 50 years of building cars. They currently producing the Diammer GLC and GLA. So they know how to produce cars and we believe we will not have production hell as you call it. Because we have outsourced the production to someone who actually knows how to produce a electric vehicle. So second half of next year potentially in Europe and then maybe in the US we'll see the tourist happening right now across the United States. Exactly. Lauren Hunt, thanks so much for the motors. Back over to you, Kiko. I know there's a bit of a delay between us but really quickly I'm seeing people check out the car behind you. When Lauren will let you take a ride. Yeah, why don't we get a ride in this car Lauren? I'll soon. Oh yeah, you can actually tomorrow. Tomorrow. So today here's a little difficult but tomorrow we will have some test rides. So sign up on our website and you can come and grab a ride with this vehicle. All right, thanks Kiko for looking at that. Oh yeah, to deal with that. I know you've driven many of these EVs. I'm going to be curious to get your review on that. Across, thanks so much for that. A live for us from the NASDAQ Market signer thanks to Lauren as well. And for one EV maker to another Tesla's China Mates sales match their monthly record. That's at least according to the China passenger car association. For the month of September the company saw an 8% increase from August and set a record for Tesla's Shanghai Factory since production began. Back in December 2019. The plans of course was shut down in July for an upgrade although will only perform at 93% capacity through the end of the year according to Reuters. Meanwhile Elon Musk weighing in on China Taiwan relations suggesting Taiwan give China control over the island to resolve the cross-rate dispute. Taiwan officials have dismissed the comment as quote ill informs and belittling while the idea has unsurprisingly gained prey. Tesla shares currently up just slightly there about 1%. While coming up islands in the stream, maybe not for much longer as reports will at showtime could become integrated into Paramount Plus.

2915," weg Well, the streaming war has made claim another victim as reports a paramount is considering merging its showtime offering and to paramount plus the move comes as competition for eyeballs continues to mount what's bringing Yahoo finances to Ali Canal. The very latest one that alley. Hi, Kiko. That's right. And those reports have only been fueled by the latest executive departure at the company, David Nevin, who has run showtime since 2016 will be exiting his role at the end of the year. And that's shake up suggests that paramount is open to revamping showtime. Obviously has created some top series like you're seeing on your screen billions, yellow jackets, dexter among others. And the company can really leverage that programming to boost paramount plus subscribers. Currently paramount plus has 43.3 million subs with the expectation to reach 100 million by 2023. The exact number of showtime users is unknown, but across all of its properties paramount has about 64 million subscribers. So clearly paramount plus is the driving force on the streaming side paramount CEO Bob Backage confirmed last month that these talks were happening as a company looks toward the future. Court cutting obviously accelerating showtime lost about 500,000 subscribers in Q1 according to the CEO. So this is something that we've seen really across the sector as these platforms look to scale, look to compete. We have the combination of HBO Max and Discovery happening this summer. Stores is aiming to separate itself from Lionsgate to merge with other content providers. So consolidation is really just the name of the game at this point, especially as the streaming wars come to a head. But I have to shout out that next week we'll be discussing this and much more with paramount CEO Bob Backage during the young finance all markets summit. So make sure to tune into that. Kiko I'm very excited to talk to him because considering the news that we've been getting the past few weeks, there's a lot going on in this industry. Yeah, team things up for us. Ali for our big day, the all markets summit, of course set for Monday next week. Bob Backage among a long list of executives will be speaking to you throughout the day. Ali can now thanks so much for that. Let's do a final market check before we let you go. We are seeing all three majors still in the red right now. The NASDAQ coming off with the lows of the session, but we did see it hit two year lows there at least for intraday levels. The NASDAQ right now down about eight tenths of a percent. The S&P 500 down four tenths and the Dow trading pretty flat. The NASDAQ certainly in focus today in part because some of the sell-off that we've seen in those chip makers, this coming on the back of the latest export controls that were handed down by the Commerce Department on Friday, China, of course, responding to that. Certainly something we're going to continue to keep a close watch on. By the way, semiconductors have also been warning of some of the demand coming globally. So that's another thing that has been weighing on some of those names. As we said at the top of the show though, a lot to get through to this week with earnings on tap as well as economic data. We're going to continue to keep a close watch on all of that. That does it for me in this hour. We've got much more to come here. Yahoo Finance lies. Keep it right here.",https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yvHvxXHIc5I,29,2022-10-10 15:59:29

That fell a little bit below arguably some high estimates on the street. Have you seen any slowdown in consumer demand? No consumer demand has been very strong, Brian. In fact, our buy rate, which is the amount of times that a consumer goes to the store by how much they buy when they're there, is actually up both for our beer business and our high-end wine and spirits business. So we're very optimistic. You know, we have the benefit in this industry, in this category of being somewhat recession-resistant. And we certainly have seen no slowdown at a consumer level of purchasing against our brands. Bill, you always give it to a straight. So you call my attention with something on the earnings call. You mentioned you're going corona non-alcoholic. When does this stuff come to market? And why are you going into the non-alcoholic segment? Who's drinking this? We'll be out with that next year. But one of the things we found, Brian, was that a number of consumers who drink non-alcoholic products also drink high-end beer and high-end spirits. And we felt that this could be a natural extension, because it gives people another option on a night or an event where they, frankly, just don't want to consume, but they want to enjoy a great tasting product like we can bring from corona. But walk us through what it's going to take to continue to improve some of the depletion for constellation brands. And particularly what timelines you're tracking against for that? As you saw, our volumetric on the beer side was up almost 9% this quarter. And we see no suggestion of slowdown whatsoever. You know, Madello had its 36th consecutive quarter of double digit growth and continues to be just on fire as we extend the demographic beyond its core Hispanic base to more general market consumers. So we see just tremendous opportunity for growth. When you then add in some of the new things, you know, we just tested in three test markets, Madello Oro, which is the goal standard of light beer. We're going to roll that nationally, the beginning of next calendar year. And that we think, again, provides a very good opportunity to bring new consumers into the fold. It was very incremental in the test markets. Belle, I'm going to take a little bit of a look.",https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yvHvxXHIc5I,30,2022-10-10 16:04:22
2917," next calendar year. And that we think, again, provides a very good opportunity to bring new consumers into the fold. It was very incremental in the test markets. Bill, I'm going to take a little bit of a left turn here and go to the cannabis issue because we did have some news on that yesterday, obviously, with President Biden issuing federal pardons for people who have been convicted of simple possession of marijuana. As you saw, pot stocks went crazy on this, on the perception that this is going to have bigger implications beyond just that. You guys own that stake in canopy growth. Can you talk me through the implications in your mind of whether this does pre-sage a bigger push towards legalization? I think Brad said something right a couple of segments ago and you talked about this before, which is it's a step on the right direction. I think it remains to be seen where it goes or how quickly it goes. The important part, I think, from our perspective is the canopy is well positioned if the legalization occurs in the United States. You know, they have deals in place with Wana and Jettie and Aikorj that will put them in a superb position when and if we see a broader legalization. But I think we've seen steps in this direction before. So, again, it's early days, but certainly it gives us some more reason for optimism. Bill, the spirits industry is just on fire, notably to Killa. When I look at your portfolio, I say, wow, they can really add something here. Are the prices for some of these brands out there? Are they just too high and that's what gives you pause? Well, we have two to kill as there were quite pleased with Casanobley at the in the luxury area and Mekapo, which frankly is just on fire at the in the sort of $20 price point. So we're quite pleased with that. But yes, certainly the values and the price points across to Killa at this point, if you were trying to acquire, have gotten quite heavy, shall we say. But our to Killa business is up double digit and we're quite pleased with where it's going. The other thing is we have a couple of messgals in our venture arm that are also doing very well. So we're keeping our eye on that subcategory as well. You said something on the something else in the earnings call bill that you're about to release a new sustainability report. What's been the feedback when you talked to institutional investors? How important is this topic and how are you thinking about that will play in just reinventing your business? It's more important to more investors every day and we've been very careful about how we think about that topic and we try to do it in ways that is beneficial for the communities in which we operate as well as for the overall environmental impact. A lot of focus on water. We've reduced our water use at our Navajo facility over the last three years by 18% per unit. We'd by 13% at our overgone operation. We've also invested within the communities that we served there to help the infrastructure and to make sure good quality water is available in those communities where we operate. So we strongly believe that this is good not only good for the world but good for business. And I think everyone we hope everyone will take a hard look at what we've done. We've worked very hard on this topic and we think and we think we're contributing to the world around us while we're still doing good business. Bill, to paraphrase Jerry McGuire and Beyonce, you had me at Miss Cowell and so as I think about some of the spirits that you've looked across the brand portfolio with and seen some strength in this environment where some businesses are looking to just show up extra cash, extra capital and perhaps some acquisitions become ripe. Are there certain companies that you're looking at and kicking the tires to see where there are more brands that you could add to constellation? We always look to see where there are opportunities and we identify the white space within our portfolio where we might be able to add some things. But we're also smart about it I think in terms of how we think about where we can get a good return. And again, as I alluded to a moment ago, the Ventur arm has been a very good way for us to put our toe in the water with some great new ideas. And we've done it in a couple of interesting ways. Our focus on female founders program as an example. We said just a few years ago that we were going to spend $100 million against women owned and women run businesses over the next 10 years. We're already 76% of the way there.",https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yvHvxXHIc5I,31,2022-10-10 16:08:21
2918," years ago that we were going to spend $100 million against women owned and women run businesses over the next 10 years. We're already 76% of the way there. So, you know, we're seeing a lot of ways that we can get our toe in the water on some new and exciting ideas early on, maybe before it hits big, but we're there and ready to go when it takes off. Bill, real quick before I let you go, box wine sales on fires at the ultimate recession signal. When I see that, I think back to my college days, I had no money, but there I was with my box wine pouring into soul cups and playing some beer pong or wine pong. Box box has been a very strong sector. In fact, in our in the wine business, our woodbridge box wine was the number two growing skew in that particular sector. So, we're pretty pleased about that. And it's going well for us. But it is. And it's also a convenience thing. You know, you see more and more consumers looking for convenience and box can go places that glass can't as an example. So, you often see that and tailgating or beaches and things of that nature. So, uh, so it it covers a lot of angles for sure. And PS box wine gets a bad wrap. I remember years ago, my sister brought back box wine from Sicily. It was fantastic. So, there you go, Bill. www.secret correspondents.com Let's continue our conversation on the Job Support and the the market implications joining us now. John Tobin, Epic Investment Partners, Managing Director and Senior Equity Research Analyst. John, it's good to see you. So as we look at this, good news is bad, news is gone in jobs day. I mean, that's just very simply how we should look at it here that the Fed is going to be raising rates for the foreseeable future. I think that's right. I think the market it seems, and certainly the past few days we've seen evidence of it, it's looking for some reason, something to latch onto to justify the rally. They're hoping for some evidence that the Fed's about to pivot, the Reserve Bank of Australia's move early in the week, ignited that hope, and even on the Fed, speakers all week long pushed back on that pretty hard. I think the evidence today is...",https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yvHvxXHIc5I,32,2022-10-10 16:13:01
2919," Bank of Australia has moved early in the week, ignited that hope, and even on the Fed, speakers all week long pushed back on that pretty hard. I think the evidence today is from the jobs report. The jobs market still remains strong, and the Fed still has work to do. Now, as we've talked about it in our shop this morning on our morning call, there is clearly evidence of deceleration here. So if you're trying to find some good news here, that the numbers are moving in the right direction. And this is a 263K increase in jobs, but it shows continual deceleration over time. Average hourly earnings are up, but again, evidence of deceleration. So I think the main takeaway is, things are moving in the right direction, but the Fed still has a lot of work to do. Rates are still going higher. So John, should the other takeaway here, just looking at the market action in the early going is for investors to fade any rallies? Well, I think that would be my personal view that with each attempt to rally into this, I've continued to make the case that I don't see what the foundation is for a strong rally, for a sustainable rally. I mean, if you think about what the drivers of equity market returns are, its earnings growth, its dividends, and its multiple expansion. And if rates are going higher, that's a headwind from multiple expansion. And if the economy is slowing down and maybe headed for a recession, that's a headwind for earnings growth. So the main underpinnings that would support a sustainable rally just aren't there. I think to me, this is a market environment where investors need to keep some defensive exposure in their asset allocation. We've had a conversation, especially around the shift in the types of jobs, the employment situation really lays out, kind of sector by sector here. But for some of those businesses that are looking at the amount of people that post pandemic, they've realized they actually need to run the business. It also becomes a question of where some of those employees will find employment elsewhere, and in different sectors as well, as many people have upskilled over the course of the pandemic. I mean, does that drastically shape everything from wages all the way to what a solid baseline sector by sector actually looks like? Well, you're absolutely right. There are some sector trends that we're noticing here, where there's strength, where there's weakness, there's strength in leisure and hospitality, there's weakness in other sectors, there's weakness in energy, there's weakness in things related to building and construction, of course. But it's disruptive for the economy as you point out that people are looking for jobs and looking to move perhaps into new areas where there is job growth. So there is that friction, but that's not really something new, and that's a necessarily a post pandemic phenomenon. I think that's historically bending case. There's always a friction as people move and try to direct themselves into the areas where there's greater employment opportunities. John, bottom line when it comes to these markets, I think people are trying to figure out what the heck to do right now. And you have some interesting stuff in your portfolio, including consumer staples, things like Home Depot and Walmart. Do you think that a company like Walmart, for example, has gotten past its inventory troubles and is still gonna be able to benefit as we head towards the holiday season? So, it's absolutely true. The retailers have inventory issues to grapple with. And I wouldn't wanna say that for Walmart, it's all said and done and then they're behind it. I think our view on Walmart is more of a basic fundamental view that this is a business that historically is resilient in economic downturns. And if we're looking at a solar economic environment and we're looking at the possibility of recession and we think about where are we most likely to have the stocks and the companies that are most likely to hold up best in that environment? It is some of the defensive sectors, the traditional defensive sectors like staples, the Walmart's healthcare, for example, utilities, another area where we have exposure, even at the same time, even some financials will hold up better regional banks. There'll probably be some evidence of weakening loan demand and some pick up in credit quality issues, but we think that they're in a very strong position with good credit statistics today and with very strong capital positions today. So there are several defensive sectors that we have exposure.",https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yvHvxXHIc5I,33,2022-10-10 16:17:08
2920," very strong position with good credit statistics today and with very strong capital positions today. So there are several defensive sectors that we have exposure to, that we think these are sectors. It won't mean that they won't feel any pressure from a slowing economy, but rather that they will be more resilient in the face of a challenging market environment. Just trying to tie both inflation and employment together because one of that is an input cost into the prices that consumers are having to pay as well. For consumers and of course everybody who's in this economy and is working, there's still money that is going out the door out of your pockets both on a necessity basis or on a discretionary basis. So with that in mind, where then are we going to expect to see kind of wages stabilized at the same time that the Fed is trying to see inflation stabilized? Well, Fed is clearly trying to get inflation down and trying to get a way to growth down. And what that really means, even though they don't like to say it so much out loud is they need the unemployment rate to go up and they need jobs growth to slow pretty dramatically. So, but you're right, this implies pressure on the consumers. So there'll be pressure on the consumer in terms of weaker jobs growth. There'll be more people unemployed. There's more pressure on consumer pocketbooks because of inflationary pressures what people are paying at the pump for gasoline with their energy bill when they get their kind bill every month. So there's pressure on the consumer. This is all part of the narrative of an economy that is being forced to slow down by Fed policy. John, if I'm correct, you have some exposures to some big cap tech names, an Apple, Microsoft, and IBM, even a Broadcom, but in light of this AMD warning, which is pretty shocking. I mean, I missed their expectations by a billion dollars on sales are even trying to rotate out of big cap tech or you're gonna just try to just survive this volatility. Well, you know, the truth is, in the strategy that I help run, tech is a significant underweight for us. We actually have a hard time finding tech names that fit the characteristics that we see. We're looking for companies that have growing cash, that will pay attractive growing dividends and otherwise use cash to distribute to shareholders through share buybacks. So we do have exposure to some of those tech names that you mentioned, but we are underweight. We're underweight those names that are kind of by definition underweight Apple. Apple's over 4% of the index. So while we have Apple in the portfolio, it's an underweight Apple. And while we have tech in the portfolio, it's an underweight to the tech sector. I'm sure there'd be some names that we look at and will probably trim them and maybe even exit them, but there's nothing that we're thinking about doing right this minute. Welcome back. Job growth beating estimates by 8,000 in September as high rates and elevated costs per major US economy. But how will a stronger than expected labor report guide the Fed, all of this percolating through the markets today? Labor Secretary Marty Walsh is joining us now from Washington DC. And the Secretary, great to see you as all.",https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yvHvxXHIc5I,34,2022-10-10 16:21:21
2921," The Fed, all of this, percolating through the markets today. Labor Secretary Marty Walsh is joining us now from Washington, D.C., Mr. Secretary, great to see you as always. And so this number showing growth today in places like labor and hospitality, I'm always curious what you're hearing in your conversations with corporate leaders around the country, where they're having still trouble. Because on the other hand, we're also seeing some industries cut back. Give us a little color as to what you're hearing. Yeah, it really depends on where we are. You know, I think one of the areas when you think about cybersecurity and the tech space, that's where a lot of companies are still growing, some have cut back. So we talk about how do we create programs so we can get people skilled out working with community colleges in particular, working with colleges in the country. And really thinking about what employers are talking about now is not about the job market of right now, but they're talking about participation and anticipated growth in their companies and making sure they have the skill to work for us to be able to keep up with that growth. Mr. Secretary, is it a little surprising that we're still seeing some strong job growth like this and upward revisions to prior months? At the same time, the Federal Reserve is really trying to slow the economy down. Well, when you see the areas that we saw growth in this month, and we saw the hospital industry and medical growth fully recovered from pre-pandemic, you know, you're seeing that a lot of people hiring in those hospitals because there's a lot of electric elective procedures that were put off so they're hiring more people in hospitals. We're seeing an increase in manufacturing, certainly more jobs than pre-pandemic and manufacturing. And I think a lot of that has to do with what happened during the pandemic with supply chain. We're seeing more and more companies want to create more and build more here in the United States. We're seeing the President really focusing on that as well, doing more in the United States. We're seeing in this particular month, we didn't see, we saw actually a decrease in governments hiring around education. That's one number that was low, but companies are still looking for people. You're still hearing it every day. I mean, as you mentioned earlier, I think you might have been Julie saying, some people do eye-cutting back on their employees because they're anticipating what the future might bring, but a lot of companies are still hiring. And so with a cutback on employees yet hiring, also kind of decreasing or decelerating, if you will, what does that spell out for the people who, during the great resignation, had kind of put in that two-week notice and said, I've got another offer somewhere else. I've got a greater offer on the table. Is this still a job hopper's market, or from your perspective, is it something where that is decelerating so much to the point where it's very much shifting and employees should be considering exactly where they make those moves? I still think it's a good market for employees to look at for better opportunities, but I think what's happening is employers are realizing now they have to do a little more to keep their employees. Employers don't want to hire somebody and then have to six months lose them to another place for higher salary or better benefits. So I think employers are starting to, when I go around talking to companies, they're really looking to hybrid work, how does that work? They're looking at opportunities, childcare, and other things to encourage people to come into their companies. And I think companies are adapting to the change in the environment around workers today. And some of the folks we're talking to are saying some of these changes are going to be longstanding, right, that we're seeing a more profound shift in the workforce because of increased flexibility of being able to work from home, because of sort of life decisions people made during the pandemic, maybe some people taking early retirement, et cetera. How is the administration thinking about some of those longer term changes and addressing some of those longer term trends? Well, I think one of the biggest things that President did in the bill back better legislation that didn't go to the Senate, child care paid family leave, sick time medically, all of those issues are very important to families today. And I think a lot of companies, some of them, getting there on their own, but child care is a very complicated issue. And I think that we as a country have to think about, rethink about the way that our child care system works because it's expensive and we're having a high time retaining workers in that industry because we don't pay them enough to take care of our kids. So I think as we think about long term, that's going to be one investment on a federal level, but also on the private sector. So I think, you know, pre-pandemic, we didn't hear about the changes in companies. These companies would change the way they did office space, open areas, things like that. But I think because of the pandemic, it's made us all really think about the future and what we're doing here at the Department of Labor, we're working with companies. I don't think I have the right to tell a company how to operate that company. I'm not my role.",https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yvHvxXHIc5I,35,2022-10-10 16:25:54
2922," But I think because of the pandemic, it's made us all really think about the future. And what we're doing here at the Department of Labor, we're working with companies. I don't think I have the right to tell a company how to operate that company. That's not my role. My role is to try and assist them and help with them and share best practices where I can and what other companies are doing. Mr. Secretary, last time we spoke to you about a month ago on jobs day, we're still looking to in analyzing the quiet quitting movement. Now a month later, how big a problem is this in the country? I don't, I mean, I haven't really heard about it from companies. I know that it's being reported in the press. I've talked to a lot of companies in the country and I haven't heard about that. Certainly, that's a concern if it continues on because when people hire people, they expect them to do, you know, a day's work for a day's pay. And I think that that's something that we have to continue and encourage. But when I talk, as I've gone around the country this last month and I've done a lot of trips, no company has approached me on this quiet quitting idea. And Secretary, I want to ask you about the real strike in which you intervened last month and helped avert that strike. That was sort of an 11th hour agreement. I know it was sort of a marathon process, right, of working through it with them. What are some of the lessons learned from that? For example, would you get involved earlier in the future to sort of not have a down to the wire situation? If I'm asked to get involved earlier, I would. Certainly in the potent negotiation, I'm not involved at the table, but I certainly am talking to both sides to make sure that encouraging both sides, and they already asked often encourage them to stay at the table and get this contract done. In the real strike, you know, this was a two-year period that they weren't able to get an agreement where the president had to appoint an emergency board to come up with a P.E.B. They came up with the recommendations and we built off of that. But certainly, you know, I think when you get to that point, there's a breakdown. So I have offered to anybody, anybody who wants, if they want me to get involved, or get us involved. But I think mediation is important as well. If you have two sides that kids can't get to an agreement, my recommendation is try and bring a mediator in. It's not to be me, but bring a mediator in. It's just to keep the conversation moving forward. And Labor Secretary, just while we have you, we do know that President Biden issued a presidential proclamation pardoning federal convictions for simple marijuana possession defenses. These are people that have been barred in some cases from getting back into the workforce because of these convictions and offenses. Where will the Labor Department continue to do work at the state level, even, to ensure that there are opportunities for people to get occupations within the workforce? Yeah, we have to make sure what the president did yesterday is carried out. And too many of the people that have been pardoned by the president yesterday are people of color, and particularly the African-American community. And this has been the challenge in our country for a long time where people were convicted of a minor marijuana offense that had a record. And I commend the president for his actions yesterday and the folks that are out there were going to work with them to make sure that they can get into good employment, that this is not an impediment to their ability to get into the middle class and get a good paying job. U.S. Labor Secretary, Marty Walsh, pleasure to have you on the show. And thanks as always for taking the time. Thank you. Thank you.",https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yvHvxXHIc5I,36,2022-10-10 16:29:51
2923, you you I'm going to be on the business. I'm going to be on the business. Levi Strauss out with the beat on earnings and it's late as quarter over a stronger yours dollar weakness in Europe and ongoing supply and change just rupfions like the jeans giant to cut its outlook. With more on this we have harming Singh Levi Strauss CFO for more on this quarter harming great to get some time with you. Want to go across the pond on Europe. So some I would say some surprising results at a Levi's brand. Good morning. As the quarter progressed it did surprise us. And as you know we have a very strong brand. As you think about the quarter overall our quarter was fairly solid despite all the incremental headwinds who were up 7% in constant currency with BDPS. And the Levi's brand was just to the strongest quarter of the revenue in a decade. And so as you think about our European business you know the weather was fairly warm and the consumer there is under pressure. And so what we did as a collectively as a team is we quickly get up into action and you know looked at discretionary costs. We focus on our direct to consumer business because we have a diversified business model. The parts of the world that are really strong like Asia and Latin America and their resistors strong growth. We also had some supply chain disruptions especially in the US which impacted the business. And so as we thought about the year we said okay let's think about three things that impact the results. One is stronger dollar. The second is supply chain disruptions. And the third is you know softening consumer demand in the western part of the world. But even think of Europe brand. The parts of Europe that were fairly strong UK and Spain you know we're actually countries that grew. I think where we were so far is in Germany and France. The brand still fairly strong you know globally as well as in Europe. When you talk about softening demand harming is there a relative point that you think back to where this period is analogous to? You know I would say you know we've been as a company we've been through you know good times and tough times. And I would say as you think about softening demand you know I was not here in 0809 but you know the financial crisis at that time did have an impact as a company. You know our toughest period was during the pandemic where all our stores were shut for about 90 days and we lost a billion dollars you know just like that. But we've as a management team and I'm really proud of the management team that's been around for a while. We actually geared up into action and said okay how do we manage through the crisis but more importantly how do we emerge stronger and then in 2021 we registered our strongest financial year in a decade. So as we think about you know the next few quarters and as you know if things do tighten that's what we're going to be doing. We're going to be thinking about how do we manage through the immediate crisis which is in the near term but as a company and a brand you know we will get out of it and we'll get out of it and we'll get out of it stronger. You know some of you that I invested in June we laid out longer term targets these are what are we call not start targets we still get to and focused in delivering them over the long term.,https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yvHvxXHIc5I,37,2022-10-10 16:34:19
2924, yesterday in june we laid out long-term targets these are what are we call not start targets we're still get to and focused in delivering them over the longer term and emerging out of this as a stronger company i mean i appreciate the focus on the longer term i'm i want more shorter term question which is after the inventory bill which i believe was above 40% for the last quarter are you putting things on sale how you guys could planning to clear out that inventory yeah so the inventory bill has you know is something that we have flagged uh... you know externally as well as internally so you know it's intentional uh... in in in a way is basically comprised of three things the for the third of the of the inventory growth is driven by the fact that last year was a very low based tight inventory and the fact that inflation has uh... increase the cost of uh... inventory a third is uh... inventory uh... that is driven by the fact that we're bringing uh... you know because of the longer lead times in supply chain we bring in stuff early and we're getting ready for our e-rp installation in the in quarter two of uh... next year and a third is largely goods in transit to a third of our inventory is called so think the five or once think the five elevens and we can carry that through multiple seasons and so there's no reason to discount that uh... we don't have a lot of obsolete where we do have obsolete we are discounting that so that we can clear it uh... but overall if you think of our gross margins are gross margins and q3 were still you know for a basis points higher than twenty nineteen it did a little relative to last year but that was you know largely driven by foreign exchange a little bit more discounting we do expect the holidays season to have to be a little bit more promotional and we're going to balance growing revenue and discounting because the brands never been this strong and that's you know evidence by the fact that q3 revenues uh... for a livid with the strongest in in in uh... in a decade for quarter three when you acknowledge discounting it's hard not to think about the strongest brands right now needing to move through inventory in ploring some of the promotional elements and so when you think about the percentage of full price that selling versus the percentage of what would actually be did uh... discounted during this period of time through the holiday season even perhaps thereafter as well what does that breakdown really look like to you yeah you know uh... still a lot of what we sell is uh... on a full price basis we had uh... estimated that uh... gross margins uh... in the second half of the year uh... because we'll be selling more uh... below full price you know would be impacted about a hundred for a hundred basis points in quarter three that a little bit more about a hundred thirty hundred forty basis points we build that into a guidance in qqq four but overall we still think we'll end the year uh... at about you know four hundred basis points higher than uh... 2019 and that just evidences the strength of the brand are you are for example uh... which is the average unit retail price in quarter three we still up in the in the mid uh... to high single digit that means pricing that we have taken to offset cost is ticking uh... and our revenues were up slightly i sorry our unit growth was up slightly so overall the brands really strong doctors uh... as we have diversified also grew uh... load double digit and beyond your guys just starting which is open up first uh... store in san amonica in heli and if uh... that uh... you know does well then you know uh... we can add a lot many stores in the active way segment so overall uh... our business is fairly diversified uh... brad and uh... thinking is that we will you know uh... you know move through this uh... promotional environment by ensuring that uh... brand continues brand equity continues to build hey harmy it's a brine here again you know i'm loyal uh... leave eyes consumer uh... but i don't know i don't know if i'm buying these new baggy dad genes uh... that you're bringing to market i i don't know if you realize how how strong i work for this physique and those kinds of the show it off i'll be honest with you and you know uh... the fact is that we're a democratic brand we have something for everybody so if the baggy dad uh... you know jesus,https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yvHvxXHIc5I,38,2022-10-10 16:38:39

There is something for you, brunt and for everybody else, across all age demographics, you know, at Levi's. And that's what, you know, we are proud to ensure that every consumer gets what he or she needs. Yeah, brunt, Jesus got to rock the jorts to show off the gas. He's got to show off the leg. Oh, you know, look, I'm still the steamy skinny jeans guy. I mean, you got to show off the glutes. You put that time in. I want to show him off on a nice pair of jeans. I don't know. I don't know. There's a little out of fashion here, so we'll take this offline. We'll take this offline. Harmi, it's great to see you. It's not only jeans that you can get from Levi's. You can get more if I had to tell look. You know, I'm wearing a wonderful Levi's shirt, you know, gives a casual look. Because we continue to bleed those who are becoming more casual. And those becoming more casual brands like us that offer more of a head to toe look, you know, are the ones that will eat the judge. Yes, no matter which of the numbers of the models that you wear on the bottom, I have to say we were expecting either the leather jacket or the jean jacket, Harmi, so it's good to know you're still repping on top with the white shirt. Harmi, it's saying great for catching up with the Levi's Strauss CFL. Thanks, Julie. Thank you. And we want to continue the labor market discussion and conversation. Check on the roads ahead for the US economy. And for that, we have Gus Vosher, joining us now, PNC Financial Services Group Chief Economist. And let me just ask you your initial reaction to the report, Gus, and then anything that sticks out to you. Yeah, so this is a good report. The Fed wants to see slower job growth. I think they prefer to even see even slower job growth than this, but certainly we have seen job growth slow over the course of 2022 is the Fed has raised rates. And that should allow the labor market to cool off as we head into 2023. All right. And then we were just listening to it. And as give some of the statistics, so when you dig into the report, some of the demographic breakdowns may surprise people, maybe some reversals and trends, what did you pick out? Well, certainly we saw the labor force participation rate decline. That's bad news from the Fed's perspective. They want to see more people looking for work. Instead, we saw fewer people. And so that means a tight labor market. And so that makes it more difficult for the Fed means they may have to raise rates a bit more. On the other hand, we did see a bit softer wage growth down to, it slowed to 5% year over year, still higher than the Fed would like, but that's moving in the right direction. So what I think is where we are.",https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yvHvxXHIc5I,39,2022-10-10 16:42:58
2926," down to, it slowed to 5% year over year, still higher than the Fed would like, but that's moving in the right direction. So what I think is we are seeing a cooling off in the labor market, but it remains too hot from the Fed's perspective, and they're going to need to raise rates more to cool off some of those inflationary pressures we're seeing in the economy right now. And I've heard some economists calling this report a Goldilocks report. You look at the stock reaction definitely to the downside, but maybe that's the bad news as good news here, because the Fed doesn't want to see stock prices go up as some of the, I believe it was, Nian Kowkari said definitively over a month ago, what are we to make of this in light of the bad news as good news as bad meme, that kind of confuses people, especially some of us in the business sometimes? Yeah, so what we want is job growth that is slowing to a more sustainable pace. So, you know, even over the last three months, we've added about 370,000 jobs per month on average, the labor force just simply can't support that. So we need to see much slower job growth that's consistent with underlying growth in the population. We're not there yet, we're moving in the right direction. So, you know, obviously if we're adding a lot of jobs in the economy, that means more income, that means more consumer spending, but at the same time it's contributing to high inflation. So, what we want is okay news from the job market, not good news, but, you know, indications that job growth is slowing and that, you know, we are reaching an equilibrium where those wage pressures in the economy are lessening. And how about the other part of the Fed's mandate inflation? So we have maximum employment, stable prices, interpreted to mean 2% inflation, obviously far above that. But what are you expecting out of some of the readings? And how does that fit into the expectations? Everybody waiting with baited breath for that eventual Fed pivot? Yeah, no, we are starting to see inflation slow. I think it peaked over the summer. Obviously we've seen a big drop in energy prices, although we'll have to see what happens with the new OPEC production cuts. Wage growth is slowing, so that should help bring down inflation. It's going to be difficult. You know, we probably won't see that 2% inflation until some time in early 2024, but we are moving in the right direction. I think the Fed wants to see both a slowing in the job market and indications that inflation is moving decisively towards 2% before they stop raising rates. I don't think that'll be some time until early in 2023. So, you know, if the Fed is going to be looking at the data as they come in and we need to see that slowing in inflation and slower job growth, if the Fed is going to let up. And you mentioned the energy market before. I'm stirring it at WTI crude prices at above $91 per barrel. And it was about a week or two ago that it seemed to be about $8 fewer than that. And I'm just wondering, what do the current energy prices say to you? There are people hoping that there would be some mitigation to help out the consumers here, but we had OPEC plus step in, reduce their outlook or reduce what they say they're going to pump by 2.1 million barrels per day. They're already in deficit. What are you making of the energy market and its effect on the U.S. economy here? Yeah, so obviously the OPEC production cuts are not good news for oil prices, for inflation in the United States. That being said, a lot of OPEC members were already below their quotas. And so I don't think we're going to see is, you know, that 2.1 barrel per day cut. But I think we're going to get less help on inflation from lower energy prices. But I think the other impacts of the Fed rate hikes in terms of slowing in job growth, the slowing in demand for consumer durables, that type of thing, that will help reduce in those inflationary pressures we're seeing in the economy, even if OPEC keeps production low. Even if lots of ifs in this business here appreciate your insights on this jobs Friday.

2927," you you you say that d the semiconductor industry is one that makes us feel very profitable and productive for three years in a row and then just makes us feel awful in that fourth year and it seems like we are in that fourth year. The specific things that are causing the headwinds this year are threefold. First, there is just enormous pressure on the consumer because of all the inflationary issues because of all the turmoil in Europe because of the lockdowns in China. Secondly, we have the specter of rising rates, which is never good for valuations in high beta, high multiple sector. And then on top of it, as you mentioned, there are some additional restrictions on semiconductor companies in terms of shipping to China and look, China is the largest customer for semiconductors than it's never good to have friction between the largest designer of semis, which is the US and the largest customer. So I think where we are today, when I put it all in the context, is the semiconductor stocks have a way of smelling the turn in the economy, you know, six to nine to 12 months before it happens. So last November, when semiconductor stocks speak, there was no talk of recession. The same way there is no talk of an upturn of the next cycle today. So our assumption is that compare start to get easier for the sector next year and if that is the assumption and if that's the right assumption, we think semiconductor stocks can try and find a bottom sometime in Q4 and meanwhile, the valuations are starting to look very interesting for what's a very profitable industry. So the fact that's interesting just in terms of what you said to expert restrictions and then taking that and coupling that with your predictions, your expectations for this space going into 2023. So it sounds like you view it as a challenge here in the near term, but you don't think it's going to have a significant impact in terms of sales, is that right? Yeah, so let's talk about those restrictions. So first of all, you know, as I mentioned, friction is never good between the largest designer and the largest buyer of semiconductors. But when you take a step back, the majority of chips that are shipped to China are actually for a lot of consumer applications. Therefore, smartphones, therefore PCs, therefore a lot of low end, you know, consumer speakers and so forth, like the largest buyers of semis in China are not supercomputing or military companies. They are companies like Oppo, Vivo, Xiaomi, Lenovo, ZTE. So it's not really super computing. In fact, if I take the entire supercomputing and military end-use market for semiconductors globally, it is not more than 5 or 10% of end-of-man.",https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yvHvxXHIc5I,41,2022-10-10 16:51:14
2928," really super computing. In fact, if I take the entire super computing and military end use market for semiconductors globally, it is not more than 5 or 10 percent of end demand. And even if you assume half of it is in China, which is a very big number, it still says that there is not more than a 5 percent or so headband. Second point I would mention is that we have to be careful when we use the term restriction. So what is happening is that there is a set of rules that now forces a lot of semiconductor companies to first go and ask for approvals. So they are not actually banned outright from shipping. They have been given this extra step to go and verify that the end customer is not a military end use customer or a super computing customer that might be on an entity list. Which is why we think that yes, it's a headband and it doesn't help when the sector is already facing a lot of the macro pressures. But in terms of specifically this incremental headband, we don't think it's more than 5 to 7 percent incremental. And that too, it's only applied to very specific set of companies. In fact, I want to draw your attention to something that we saw from tourist securities. In talking about Tesla, perhaps being a dark horse when it comes to AI and perhaps arrival for Nvidia, saying that they actually see it obviously though Nvidia is the leader in this space. They see apart the Tesla to build its own business to compete with it. What's your take on perhaps the role that some of these non-traditional chip makers like a Tesla might play in this space? Sure, absolutely. Look, first, when it comes to the field of artificial intelligence, we are still in the first innings. That means if I take all the servers that were shipped in the world in the last year, less than 15 percent of them actually had an AI accelerator in them and the majority of them used an Nvidia product. And then if I couple that with the automotive industry where Tesla participates, the entire automotive industry is only 8 percent of the semiconductor market. So I think we have to keep a lot of these things in context of what the sizes of these markets are. So we really like Nvidia. And the reason is that their specific technology of AI accelerators, it's not just a chip. They're not just designing a chip. They're actually designing a complete end-to-end system and a stack of software and a stack and a big number of developers, actually and a half million developers that have been trained on using this product. So I would say the Tesla use case is a very, very specific one, maybe less than 1 percent of the entire semiconductor industry. But it is a rising tide. Many companies will participate. But we think Nvidia is on a different not-so-different planet, but I think on a different solar system when it comes to the application and the benefits of AI. The Vekarya, always great to get your perspective. A bank of America. Thanks so much for joining us today. Let's stick with the chip makers and what we're seeing play out in the semiconductor space. And micron is the latest company to take advantage of the funding from the Biden administration's $52 billion chips act announcing plans to invest up to $100 billion for",https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yvHvxXHIc5I,42,2022-10-10 16:55:47
2929," The latest company to take advantage of the funding from the Biden administration's $52 billion chips act announcing plans to invest up to $100 billion for a plant in Syracuse, New York. Joining us now is a man who helped us seal that deal. We want to welcome Syracuse, Mayor Ben Walsh to the program. Mayor Walsh, it's great to see you. Congratulations on this historic deal between the city of Syracuse and a micron year. Just talked to us just about the economic implications of this and the opportunity that this presents for your region. Transformational is probably an understatement. We have been working for a long time to prepare our community for this opportunity and this week was historic. So really, immediately, our focus shifts towards what we need to do to be prepared for this opportunity. Clearly, we have to make sure we have the workforce. We're going to see significant investments in housing, but it's very exciting for an older, northeastern industrial city like Syracuse. It is a part of a really amazing comeback story. A story, someday you'll have to write in a book how a small town or at least medium town quarter $100 billion in investment. How do you do it? Because other companies, other towns across the country are watching to see exactly how they can do it. What was the key? Well, there are so many factors that went into it. We have a great site. The site is located about 15 to 20 minutes north of the city of Syracuse owned by the Anadogga County Industrial Development Agency. They've been investing in that site for nearly 30 years now. It is about 1,400 acres now. So we had the right site. We had the support from New York State government, Governor Holt Gold made a significant investment. The CHIP SAC at the federal level was critically important. Right here in the city of Syracuse, we have been in the midst of our own Renaissance. A lot of investment downtown. The city is really coming back and as companies are trying to attract and retain talent, having a vibrant city as a critical component. I'm proud to say we have that here in Syracuse. Up to 50,000 jobs are expected to be created as a result of this. I guess how do you prepare? How do you build up the workforce in order to fill that large number of jobs? Well, it takes time. And I'm pleased to say that we're not starting right now. We've been at this for quite a while now as part of our Syracuse Surge strategy, which is our strategy for inclusive growth in the new economy. As we've identified opportunities in what we call the fourth industrial revolution, we've seen certain areas where Syracuse has a competitive advantage where we have curriculum in our schools that we're developing that can make sure that our people and our workers have the right skill sets. So we have a lot of the right programs and infrastructure in place. This opportunity is just going to require us to scale them at a rate that we've never done before. So, again, looking at scaling our workforce development programs, continuing to invest in housing, public transportation, all of the infrastructure that we need to accommodate this investment. So 9,000 of those jobs should make an average of $100,000 each that is remarkable. As remarkable as this achievement was, I'm inspired by an independent mayor winning 60% of the vote in your second term. Is this something that we can see spread across the country? What allowed you to run as an independent because the narrative in this country is that it is a dominated two-party system and you simply cannot break through? Well, I'll describe it within the context of this deal. The fact that we have an independent mayor, a Republican County executive, a Democratic governor, all working hand in hand to make this deal happen is significant. And I think does provide a model for other communities to pursue at a time when our country is very divisive. I think when people focus on what we have in common and where we can have shared prosperity and growth, you can make things happen. So I hope in that way we are a model that we are where America is going or hopefully we want to be going. And as for me, it was about developing and bringing together a broad coalition, broad diverse coalition of people that had a love for this city and that we're willing to set party politics aside for the greater good. Speaking of being a model, making things happen clearly, this is a huge win for your city. Are you in talks with other large-",https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yvHvxXHIc5I,43,2022-10-10 17:00:18
2930," politics aside for the greater good. Speaking of being a model, making things happen clearly, this is a huge win for your city. Are you in talks with other large companies? What else are you doing to attract jobs to your city of Syracuse? Well, similar to the point about our programs in place, you know, our comeback story, our Renaissance, is already underway. We have a facility on the south side of Syracuse just south of downtown, a local company, a JMA wireless, just constructed the first 5G wireless manufacturing facility in the United States. We have other investments like that taking place. Nothing to the scale of micron, and we certainly see, know that there will be significant follow-on opportunities, supply chain opportunities that come with micron. But we do hope that this also puts us on the radar of many other companies around the globe that are looking for a place where, again, you have the political alignment that allows you to do business that has the balance of a vibrant downtown, but also beautiful parks and countrysides and mountains and lakes all around us. So it's really pulling all of that together. Well, congratulations on the deal. Nice to join us, Syracuse, Mayor Ben Walls. Appreciate it, thanks. Thank you. In this episode of influencers, SEC Chair Gary Gensler. I come with a deeply markets background. I really believe in markets. I think markets are critical part of our economy but regulated markets. Events in Eastern Europe just sort of highlight once again the importance of cyber resiliency. If you're raising money from the public, and the public's anticipating some profit based on the efforts of those folks raising the money, that comes within the definitions of a security and the security's laws, and it's kind of straightforward. Hello, everyone, and welcome to influencers. I'm Andy Sirware, and welcome to our guest, Gary Gensler, Chair of the Securities and Exchange Commission. Gary Gensler was sworn into office as the 33rd Chair last April, and in a little under a year in office, he's pushed the SEC right into the middle of the conversation surrounding cryptocurrency, meme stocks, and other issues as well. Chair Gensler, thanks so much for joining us. Andy, it's so good to be with you and your viewers. Thank you. A whole lot to get to, but I want to start with the news in Ukraine, especially the reaction from the business community, the New York Stock Exchange recently moved to temporarily halt trading for Russia-based companies. Have you been monitoring that and should it be a permanent ban? So just stepping back from any one circumstance, the staff of the SEC are monitoring markets as we do through these times, throughout the whole time that I've been at the agency. It's not just about the geopolitical events in Eastern Europe, but yes, they're monitoring. We're staying close to those events. We're talking to our colleagues at the US Department of Treasurer and across the financial regulatory complex, the Federal Reserve, and other regulators, as well as globally to regulators in the banking and the securities fields across the globe. Just to stay close and monitoring events with these really unusual events out of Eastern Europe and war in Ukraine. Do you feel you have enough transparency into US corporate exposure to Russian assets and the Russian economy? Do you have worries about hidden US connections as the Russian economy may be headed for a recession or worse? Well, Andy, I'm going to stick to our remittance, the Securities and Exchange Commission, which is about overseeing yes, a hundred plus trillion dollar cap.",https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yvHvxXHIc5I,44,2022-10-10 17:04:28
2931," worse? Well, and I'm going to stick to our remittance the securities and exchange commission, which is about overseeing yes, a hundred plus trillion dollar capital markets and ensuring that they're fair and orderly, efficient and in these unusual times we're monitoring for that. But I do feel that we've had good dialogue with major market participants in the fund area, in the broker dealer area, the exchanges, the clearing houses, and at least for these handful of days so far the market functions have been operating relatively well. But what comes tomorrow, what comes in the future we're monitoring against, you know, events as they come? I understand it's not straight ahead into your remit, but obviously as you suggest yourself, there are implications potentially and potential even systemic risks to the global macro system. One last question here, Chair Gensler, about that though, are there other actions the SEC is taking or considering taking in response to what's going on in Ukraine and Russia? Again, we're staying alert and monitoring, we're staying close with the rest of the financial stability oversight council agencies and our colleagues around the globe. If you look at funds under management, the total multiples of tens of trillions of dollars of assets under management here in the US, only a very small percentage. Well, measured well below 1%, in fact only a fraction of 1% are invested in Russian securities or ADR is traded overseas and things like that. So yes, we're going to continue to monitor, especially stay alert for any cyber risks or any other market functioning risks. But I think that's what our role is and then to ensure for our three-part mission investor protection capital formation and then that in the middle, the fair orderly and efficient markets. Okay, sounds good. Let me ask you about crypto, which is part of your purview, I guess, increasingly and something you've been considering a lot lately. I know last time you were on with Yahoo Finance, the prospects for a spot Bitcoin ETF came up and you had a lot of questions about how investor protection would work there. Have your concerns been alleviated? Is approval coming, do you think? Look, we at the SEC are technology neutral, but we're anything but public policy neutral. And so this investment class, a little less than two trillion dollars of assets, valuation in crypto currencies, if you wish, or crypto tokens, Bitcoin and all the other tokens is a highly investible asset at this point in time. Many tens of millions of people around the globe have chosen to put some of their savings into this space. And so it's every bit is important to have investor protection for crypto exchanges, for the lending platforms where people are transacting, buying and selling crypto tokens, and have appropriate disclosure about the tokens themselves and protect the public from fraud and manipulation. And that's really what we're looking at. And yes, as you said, the SEC has a role to play. Other agencies do as well, but the SEC has a role to play because Congress painted with a broad brush. And if you're raising money from the public, and the public's anticipating some profit based on the efforts of those folks raising the money, that comes within the definitions of a security and the securities law.",https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yvHvxXHIc5I,45,2022-10-10 17:08:41
2932," And the public's anticipating some profit based on the efforts of those folks raising the money that comes within the definitions of a security and the securities laws and it's it's kind of straightforward. Congress saw that that was an opportunity to mislead the public to to sell to sell a shame transaction to that the public could make a decision the basic bargain the public gets to decide on their investments as long as those promoters raising money are giving full and fair disclosure. And there's basic laws about protecting against fraud in essence lies about what's going on. Right, and then sort of following up there and you also told us that you hope this this year crypto trading exchanges would come within the public policy perimeter. Yeah, look, we had just a couple of weeks ago working with one of the larger lending platforms where where a platform was taking money in. It's it's public is block by 600,000 or so. Retail accounts and institutional accounts people putting their crypto assets at risk with block five block five then saying we'll give you a return on an in an on an account. And we were trying to bring those parties in in that case that was a you know they were not following the securities laws the securities laws investment company laws and the securities act laws. So does that mean though that the exchanges will come under SEC regulation strictly speaking. Just just do a little bit of probability here i'm sort of a math guy I was when I was a kid my identical twin brother and I you know that's that's kind of who we were and everything but. These platforms often have not just dozens but hundreds or thousands of tokens on their platforms and these tokens back to the securities laws many of them without pre judging any one of them many of them may well be securities. Probabilities or that these platforms there's 10 or 15 large platforms these crypto trading platforms have 75 to 5000 tokens on probabilities or they have securities on our laws are straightforward supposed to register as an exchange where people are buying and selling those securities and yes. Many tokens many crypto tokens have been found in the past to be securities i'm not trying to prejudge any one token with probability weighted there are many of these tokens on these platforms. you you you",https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yvHvxXHIc5I,46,2022-10-10 17:12:46
2933," you you you there thank you for attending Call His Check Tower of is in exchange, it's question whether they're registered or they're operating outside of the law, and I'll leave it at that. Are you concerned, Chair Gensler, about the decrease in the number of public companies in the US? And I know there's arguments about how extreme that decrease is, and nonetheless, if you were today and there were 20 years ago. And then the fact that private companies grow into Deca Unicorns and are great investments, perhaps, but they're unavailable to ordinary investors. They're only available to the people on Sand Hill Road and how that might be exacerbating inequality in this country. So I think that we have vibrant capital markets, it's a hundred plus trillion dollar capital markets that are kind of the envy of the world, frankly. I think anyone who's honored to be in the role of the common, as you said, Andy, the 33rd Chair, and there'll be others, you know, for decades to come in this great agency. Well, central to our roles, this Chair's, past Chair's and future Chair's, is to ensure that we continue to be the envy of the world, that we have the leading capital markets. And we have a vibrant public capital markets and vibrant private markets. We are taking up a lot of projects here at the SEC about those private markets to bring greater transparency, greater efficiency. We have more efficiency and yes, competition in the middle, that's better for those private companies, whether they're small startups or the unicorns. And it's better for the investor. So we're trying to drive efficiency in the middle. We're also trying to drive for greater transparency, particularly as it relates to financial stability risk, emanating maybe out of hedge funds and the like. So we've got a lot of projects driving competition and transparency, but part of our markets is both public markets and private markets. Speaking of the envy of the world, what is the future of Chinese stocks listing in the United States? Does the SEC have a role or a position in this situation one way or the other? So we do so we're blessed in the US again with such robust and strong capital markets that between 1,500 foreign companies actually live.",https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yvHvxXHIc5I,47,2022-10-10 17:17:25
2934," So we're blessed in the US again with such robust and strong capital markets that between 1,500 foreign companies actually list their shares here in the US. It's not just China companies but a lot of Europeans Asian South American African Australian company. It just from all around the globe. But there's some basic understandings that if you want to list in the US, you need to comply with our investor protection rules. And one of the key things that came out 20 years ago. One of the key things was that if you want to be issuing and raising money in the US, that you have to be not only audited that the company has to be audited, but the auditors have to be open to inspection. Kind of simple idea, audit the auditors and Paul Sorbaine's a Maryland Senator who I had the honor to work with chairs sorbaine's past that law 20 years ago by partisan with Republicans on the hill, which Senator with Mike Oxley and with President Bush. 20 years later, 50 plus jurisdictions around the globe have allowed US entity called the public company accounting oversight board to audit the auditors, but China has not. So Congress weighed in again two years ago or year and a half ago and said, no, that's not that's not right. And they put a clock that had to happen. So where are we today. I think it's really we've had some good discussions with our counterparts from China, the public company accounting oversight board has had some good discussions, but it's really up up to the officials in China. So now the auditing firms and Beijing and Shanghai and elsewhere to be inspected and that their work papers are actually shared and not with a lot of red actions, but actually shared. And the auditors actually allowed themselves to be, you know, give interviews and testimony like 50 other countries have done right then there's a path forward otherwise Congress has spoken about 250 Chinese companies in this three year clock. And potentially as early as 2024 would be would have to suspend trading here. Another proposal on the works is specifically in response to last year's meme stock craze, I believe it would shorten the amount of time it takes to clear trades. How would last year have played out differently had that rule been in place. And events around the meme stops or as you know, the game stop led to a review by the SEC and we came up the staff came up with four areas we should take a look at. And we have in two of those areas put out proposals to we've working on some more. So one is what you talked about is the basic plumbing. Shortening how long it takes for money to move and stock to move it's called settlement period from two days to one day we've also done something around transparency around short selling and made a proposal. Last week around that as well. Shortening the settlement cycle lowers the risk in the system is the old saying goes time is money right now if you do a trade on a Monday you don't move the money or the stock until Wednesday. You shorten that to Tuesday less risk in the middle of that January the faithful January around the game stop events the broke a number of broke one line brokers and broker jobs said we can't let retail public access the market and that's that's just that access to the market is so fundamental. That part of the issue part of the issue was the settlement cycle thing but it's not the only thing and as I say we have four projects we.",https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yvHvxXHIc5I,48,2022-10-10 17:21:38
2935," that part of the issue, part of the issue was this settlement cycle thing, but it's not the only thing. And as I say we have four projects we propose to the other two looking at really the equity market structure itself and payment for order flow and the dark. And then we have the same pool of capital that are flowing without transparency. That's a major project that I'm hoping staff will make recommendations and we'll move forward. And lastly was this thing called gamification or what we've come to call digital engagement practices. The journal is reported the SEC is looking in recent sales by Tesla CEO Elon Musk and his brother Kimble whether they violated insider trading rules. I know you can't comment on a post. I'm glad you said that. I'm not sure where you're heading. I'm going somewhere. I'm going somewhere chair against her. All right. I know you can comment on possible investigation, but have you talked about the need for stronger insider trading rules generally how big an issue is this been your first year is insider trading a problem that you're focusing on. It is it is from our enforcement side or terrific enforcement efforts headed up by director of gray wall. Sanjay Wadwa the whole team just terrific team, but it's also from from the policy side we've even done something about insiders. When can corporate executives sell their shares and there was something put in place about 20 years ago, which was called a safe harbor if you might and we came on board and thought there's too many gaps in this area that the insin your management might be trading stock. And there in receipt of material non public information and we put this proposal out in I think was December or so about these so called 10 B51 plans and so both from really vigorous enforcement. Also from the policy side about insiders were taking it up in both ways and I think it's a really important part because it comes out of trust in our capital markets and and trust that there's a level playing field that when you're in the markets that that somebody doesn't have an information and banage from material non public information. you you you you",https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yvHvxXHIc5I,49,2022-10-10 17:25:42
2936, you you you you you you what are your feelings about the debate on Capitol Hill right now about lawmakers being able to trade stocks my understanding is the SEC that SEC employees have pretty tight restrictions with some stocks being off limits and trades needing to be pretty approved is that fair I mean should it be the same for everyone in all different branches of the government but I'm going to leave that as you can imagine to Congress to think through or certainly or willing and able to give them technical assistance on that the stock act that was passed about 10 years ago by Congress and set certain reporting obligations on members of Congress and also certain limitations as well we as an agency actually have a role to play in that stock act and that's that's ongoing discussions I know up on Capitol Hill and wherever they come out we stand ready to help implement our part of that if they change those laws and finally chair Gansler other recent SEC chairs including Jake Clayton and Mary Jo White came to the job for more of a legal background that you worked as a banker at Goldman once upon a time ago how has that background and the insight you garnered there changed how you approach these issues and running the commission is it any different well I'm honored to be in this job I mean that the then president elect Biden as many to it is one of the greatest honors of my life you know right up there with my three daughters I guess but my three daughters maybe higher honor and the wonderful woman I was was married to I would say this I'm the fifth chair of those 33 that is a non-murder you know from from the first chair Joe Kennedy the president Kennedy's father Arthur Levin William Donaldson some really really fantastic chairs look we all come with different backgrounds different perspectives at different experiences I'm I come with a deeply markets background I really believe in markets I think markets are a critical part of our economy but regulated markets I think that the the laws put in place in the 1930s in this eight nine decade period of the SECs that would Franklin Dylan Roosevelt laid out and and many really wonderful people at the SEC and on Capitol Hill too have augmented is we've enhanced economic growth because when you enhance trust is basic concept that if you investors get to decide but they get full and fair disclosure and we protecting them against fraud that the exchanges have to register but there's a basic rules of investor protection and this three part mission to facilitate capital formation investors in the efficient markets in the middle I think that's a really great bargain now for me I've also had the great honor to chair and I'm,https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yvHvxXHIc5I,50,2022-10-10 17:30:03
2937," efficient markets in the middle. I think that's a really great bargain. Now for me, I've also had the great honor to share another agency, so along with Mary Shapiro, Mary and I, or two people that have shared both the commodity futures trading commission and the SEC. So it's great to talk to my former chairs. There's eight, I think of eight or nine now that are still alive and I call them on a regular basis. I check in. And there's just a terrific, terrific group of commissioners, my fellow commissioners, Alison Lee, Hester Perst and Caroline Crenshaw. And we all bring a little bit different skills and perspective and we bring it together. Eric Gensler, Chair of the Securities and Exchange Commission. Thank you so much for joining us. Thank you. You've been watching influencers. I'm Andy Sirware. We'll see you next time. Welcome back to Yowl Finance on this Monday morning. I'm Brian Sasi alongside Julie Hyman and Brad Smith. Markets or mix, this trader's gear up from Porton Reads on inflation this week and the start of earning season with results out of the big banks. You've seen some mixed action across the board. The Dow slightly in the green. Now here are three things we're watching for you at this moment. On high alert for a recession, we'll talk one economic expert on the road ahead for the sputtering U.S. economy. And DC heats up. Yowl Finance contributor Kevin Sirly stops by ahead of the annual World Bank and IMF meetings later this week. And a key great recession player wins some new hardware for his trophy shelf. We'll have the details coming up shortly. Now let's get over to Yowl Finance as an S for A over the Wi-Fi Interactive. And Sasi, we are looking at a mixed picture when it comes to equities. The bottom market today is closed. But the NASDAQ is the one that is really under pressure.",https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yvHvxXHIc5I,51,2022-10-10 17:34:46
2938," We are looking at a mixed picture when it comes to equities. The bottom market today is closed, but the NASDAQ is the one that is really underperforming right now down to 6.10% of a percent. That's because technology stocks are under pressure, so you can see tech here under pressure, healthcare and consumer discretionary as well. Over on the NASDAQ 100, we are watching a little bit of flatness when it comes to Amazon, Tesla, up about 7, 10% of a percent, and Apple, down about 1%. Do you want to point out what's happening with the Chinese ADRs? Because we are seeing some of these Chinese ADRs under pressure. And this is because of some holiday-shopping data, also because of COVID cases in China. So that's putting pressure on these Chinese stocks and also putting pressure on some of the gambling stocks as well. So just looking at our gambling chart, we are seeing some of these casinos and win resorts that are under pressure as well as some of the travel stocks guys. All right, Yahoo! Finance is on the NASDAQ. Thanks for breaking that down for us. Appreciate it. And as we continue to look ahead to what's on tap this week with the Fed Minutes and CPI data, let's bring in the co-founder of the Economic Cycle Research Institute, Lakshman to Truthin to break it down. Lakshman, always a pleasure to speak with you and get some of your insights. How was T-Up this week? I mean, we've got a ton of data, of course. Last week was the big kind of employment reading across the board from private pay rolls all the way into some of the Joltz data that we had seen, even though that's lagging a little bit more. And of course, the Monthly Jobs report. What is that setup for what the Fed is also going to be tracking on pricing more broadly this week and what consumers are actually paying? Great question. And thank you for having me. Good morning. And Jobs Data, CPI data this week, Jobs Data last Friday, CPI data this week. Those are all what we would call from a cyclical kind of monitoring point of view, coincident data. And the Fed has declared for many years, it's kind of what got us into this pickle in the first place that they're going to be tracking coincident data in order to figure out what to do. And every once in a while, you'll hear that their data dependent. And that's a little bit of of a nine into that view. And so we look at the Jobs Data. It was a pretty good report on the face of it. Your year of year, Jobs Growth actually is trending down. It's about a year and a half low in the growth rate. So cyclically, we know it's direction we're going in. But the jobless rate at a half century low, three and a half percent on the face of it, that's hawkish, more hawkish Fed. It's not what they want to see at this point. They need more weakness in the labor market and they've said that in various ways. And then when you look to the CPI, coincident inflation data this week, probably too sticky, probably too hot. Our cyclical view, right, forward looking cyclical view, is that actually the peak is in, right? And a cyclical peak has already happened in inflation. We are trending down. The problem is that it's going to be very sticky. You might get some relief in the pace of goods related inflation. But the services side, where most of the spending happens, including rents, for example, very, very sticky. And as a result, I in the earlier segment, the point was made that, you know, core is going to be sticky. They're looking at core coincident inflation. So again, kind of a hawkish, you know, angle to the Fed, trying to make up for the earlier mistake of missing the inflation cycle upturn, continuing to slow the economy. So, Lakshman, you talked about where we are in the inflation cycle. What about where we are in the overall economic cycle, right? Because what we've been hearing from guests as of late is the tenor has started to shift a little bit from being pretty darn confident that it was going to be a mild recession if we get one to maybe leaning a little bit more into, well, maybe it's going to be a little bit more severe than we thought. Thanks. Excellent question. And I, this is how we edge into the realization that, yes, there's a recession. And markets are, and analysts can be kind of manic-depressive, right? So they'll be like, no, it's not happening, and all of a sudden, as it becomes more obvious that something's afoot, they can overdo it and get more extreme the other side. Our analysis is that, yes, there is going to be a recession, to be clear.",https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yvHvxXHIc5I,52,2022-10-10 17:39:22
2939," So, foot, they can overdo it and get more extreme. The other side, our analysis is that, yes, there is going to be a recession. To be clear, we will need to see job losses for there to be a recession. Also, to be clear, there have been several instances, historically, where recessions begin before job losses begin. One of the more extreme examples would be the 73, 75 recession, which was a very severe recession, which began and then jobs actually kept growing for eight months until you actually saw jobs to start negative. So, the recession itself began a little bit earlier. This is getting into the weeds about how recessions are determined. And we may be seeing some of that here because it was so hard to find the people that you needed to work, that businesses are very reluctant to let them go. Even when they're starting to see difficulty on earnings and you were saying in the earlier segment, also I was watching about how this earnings kind of recession feeling is coming in. And FedEx, for example, is just like, forget it, we can't even say anything. It's a global recession. And we don't know what's going to happen. And global recessions, to be fair, they are more severe than your kind of garden variety of recession. So, I think that's a reasonable thing to be thinking about in your scenario planning. Do you think the economy next year will start shedding jobs like you mentioned? Yes. Look, if we're right and there's a recession, and I think that we are correct here, then by definition there must be job losses. The question will be how much structurally there's a lot of issues in tightness in the labor market so that may limit it to some degree. We have seen, as I mentioned, in that inflationary kind of 70s period where the nominal numbers look pretty good, the businesses were slow to let people go. I mean, it's very, very expensive to hire someone and then let them go. You have to train them up and then you have to let them go. That's the last thing you want to do as a business manager so I understand why that is. And they're hopeful. Certainly you see all the time. There's a lot of hope in them. You use that, I was watching everything this morning. You're using the hope in more this morning. And there's a lot of this comes up in the market talk. Oh, maybe they're going to pivot. Maybe they're going to be able to sell. I don't think that's going to happen. But that kind of talk probably is keeping some of the jobs growth going too. Lachman, how does the Fed then react to all of this, right? There's the talk of pivot has faded away a little bit. Yeah. But at some point, do we see the Fed sort of quickly trying to backpedal here and fix some of the economic damage that it looks like that the policy could cause? Yeah, I mean, I think that we wrote at the beginning of the year in January, we wrote that they had a choice of two mistakes, right? Meaning that they either had to take a recession or they had to let inflation run out of control. Overleaf simplistic. And they've chosen the recession. So the intention is the pain. That is the goal. And I think Powell said as much in one of the Q&A things a week or two ago. And so will they go too far? I mean, in the sense that there'll be a recession, I think, yes. And they, I think, believe that they have the tools to counterman that at some point and ease up on the tightening. But by their own definition, they're saying that they want to see the pace of core CPI growth, depending on various measures of looking at it. Drop down. And by all the analysis and the now casting that we're hearing, this week's CPI is still going to be sticky. And we think we understand why it's probably more in the services side that it'll be sticky. But the Fed is saying if it's sticky, we're going to stay the course. And that's not what the market wants to hear. So we probably have this slower grinding. And again, you had mentioned earlier, it's tempting because prices are down to start to look for bargains, longer term bargains. But you're going to have to accept a lot of volatility, because this chapter isn't over yet. OK, so with that.",https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yvHvxXHIc5I,53,2022-10-10 17:43:40
2940," to start to look for bargains, longer term bargains, but you're going to have to accept a lot of volatility because this chapter isn't over yet. Okay, so with that in mind, and also given that you've studied previous economic cycles, we know that the markets try to price in the risk of a recession well ahead of time, but what would that bottom out period look like in relative to now, relative to the declines that we've already seen over the course of 2022, and when might we see that bottom? Hard to say magnitude wise, right? So if it's a global recession and odds are high, I think of that, it could be more severe. So the recognition of that may be mean some more downside volatility. The question of then is where else do you put your money in? It's hard to figure that out. So there's a lot of maybe this isn't the worst place even though it's going down. These bigger recessions, you could see larger retransments in equity prices than we've seen so far. So that's totally in the cards. The relationship between equities and business cycles, business cycle recessions is that they do tend to sniff out the recovery before the bottom of the recession by a few months. And I have no reason to believe this cycle wouldn't be different. Looking at other leading indicators of non equity related leading indicators, it doesn't look like the bottom is in sight yet. And so that's why we were very suspicious of the soft landing bottoming narrative that developed a few months ago. I think that the S&P was like in 3600 right around there, 3660. And it was like, that's it. We're seeing the light at the end of the tunnel. We could see across the valley. And of course, that was premature. I think we have another light down here. It sounds like that is indeed what we call a head fake. Blacksman, Atrethan, economic cycle research institute, co-founder, always good to see you. Have a good rest of the week. Nice to see you too. Thank you. All right, before we had to break, let's highlight some cautious analysis on IBM by Marcus down these Eric Woodring. Head of its October 19th earnings report, notably Woodring expects IBM to miss consensus margin estimates says Woodring. In a note, decline. We see downside two street margins and reduce our margin estimates as we expect cost pressures to persist in the 3Q. Most of those margin pressures are seen coming from IBM's consulting and infrastructure businesses. Coming up, former Fed share, Ben Bernanke is a big winner today, and we're going to be Julia's back with today's top headlines next. Thank you very much JS out of my way.",https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yvHvxXHIc5I,54,2022-10-10 17:48:34
2941," neglected Here are some of the other headlines that we are watching at this hour, at least 11 or dead and 60 injured in Ukraine this morning. After Russia launched its biggest widespread assault on the country since the start of its invasion, this comes after Vladimir Putin accused the country of attacking a critical bridge to Crimea and promised a harsh, responsive, key of where to conduct further terrorist attacks, his words on Russian territory. Ukrainian president Vladimir Zelensky says Russia wants, quote, panic and chaos, he cited attacks on the country's electrical grid and other civilian infrastructure. Former US Federal Reserve Chair Ben Bernanke and two other US economists Douglas Diamond and Philip Dibvig were recognized by the Nobel, Nobel panel at the Royal Swedish Academy of Sciences in Stockholm today. The three economists sharing the Nobel Prize for their research into the fallout from bank failures. The panel said the trio's research, quote, significantly improved the understanding of the role of banks and why avoiding bank collapses is vital. Credit Tweet shares extended their rally to a third day after Bloomberg reported that bidders are lining up for the bank's Securitized Products Unit. That's a key pillar in the downsizing of its investment banking operations. A sale of that unit could prove an additional catalyst for the bank, which recently offered to buy back up to $3 billion of its own debt. That's it. It's a busy week down in DC highlighted by the annual IMF and World Bank meetings. Yeah, we'll find it's contributor. Kevin Surley has some analysis for us on these events. Kevin, what's on your radar screen? T minus 30 days until the midterm elections. This week we're going to get two crucial debates that really could be indicative not just of what's happening in Ohio and in Georgia, but the broader country as a whole in Ohio, the late night Senate, JD Vance, the Maga Republican, challenging former Democratic Congressman Tim Ryan. Remember, he ran for president last cycle as well. This is a debate that is going to be the first of two for them leading up to the midterm elections, but let's not forget that early voting has started in multiple states. And now it is when voters are going to be paying more careful attention. And then of course down in Georgia, Rafael Warnock, the Democrat governor incumbent challenging being challenged rather by her show Walker. Now he of course has been plagued by a series of allegations that he denies a cheap among them that he advocated for his former girlfriend to have an abortion. Walker has made being anti abortion part of his platform. So this is really the first time and potentially the last time where these two politicians and the Georgia governor race will come face to face. And mind you, this comes at a time when abortion has risen to the top of the polls as to what Democrats are paying attention to. But this debate really could reverberate outside of Georgia. A lot of folks paying attention to what's going on there. Yeah, indeed. A lot of eyes on that state and the race there, Kevin. Also, we got to talk about jobs and how the recent jobs report that impacts Thursday's inflation print as well. Well, precisely, and not just what happened with the jobs report, record low unemployment rate 50 year low 3.5%. But juxtaposed with what happened with OPEC, that has many economists worried that inflation in the United States might continue to rise as consumers.",https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yvHvxXHIc5I,55,2022-10-10 17:52:17
2942," But juxtaposed with what happened with OPEC, that has many economists worried that inflation in the United States might continue to rise as consumers face more pain at the pump. But while abortion has risen to the top of issues that Democrats are paying careful attention to amongst independent voters and Republicans, it's all about the economy. And that's why the inflation report coming on Thursday, the final report ahead of the midterm elections will be so incredibly crucial and carefully watched that this is something of an economy rather that both parties that strive to seize upon. Democrats saying that there's record low unemployment, but of course Republicans looking at inflation and saying that it's a sign that we're heading even further into a recession. And then finally, you're watching the January 6th Committee and this I guess also has implications going back to the first item you're watching the midterms potentially. When can we look for the January 6th Committee's report? Nobody knows, Jules. I mean, that's what I mean, truthfully, I mean, I'll be honest, I was just talking to folks yesterday and really that's the biggest question here is, all right, now we're having another hearing. It's going to be in the afternoon. CBS News released a poll just a couple of weeks ago ahead of this hearing where they found something like 31% of folks who have been paying attention to this say that this is going to make them more likely to vote Republican 40% who are following the hearing say it's going to make them more likely to vote for Democrats. But the timing of the release of this report and the expectation here in the beltway is that this is the final hearing ahead of the midterms. That's going to be incredibly, incredibly watched if it's after the midterms, which is looking like potentially what it could be. How will that T up 2024 candidates who are looking to launch their campaigns will be watching? Kevin's really, yeah, who finances own joining us here to really discuss and break down where we're watching in the beltway and beyond. Well, Kevin, appreciate it. Anytime, thanks guys. Definitely coming up. Why are next guests says that continue to uncertainty in the UK in Europe will cause the US dollar to remain strong. We're going to discuss that next.",https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yvHvxXHIc5I,56,2022-10-10 17:56:32
2943," The strong dollar might be here to stay as war and uncertainty in Europe and the UK abroad make the USA comparatively better place to invest. This plus a spendy consumer here at home could mean inflation is set to remain higher for longer for more. Let's bring in Joseph Lewis, who is the Jeffers head of corporate hedging and FX solutions. Joe, great to have you here with us today. First and foremost, we've already heard a lot of tech companies, especially really give their insight or at least forecast into how much FX headwinds would continue to impact them. Is it going to be in par or in line with or even greater than what they anticipated? So the first things to remember about companies and how they think about foreign exchanges that it's an averaging process, right? So what you see immediately today will take some time to flow through their earnings. I think what you'll expect is that if the dollar continues to be strong, which is generally the expectation, you're going to see this show up probably Q1, Q2 next year, as the move recently has been so quick that companies haven't had the time for that to flow completely through the income statement. Look, we're telling companies that I spend most of my days doing is to give people advice around strong dollars probably here to stay. I think you summed it up correctly, which is when you think about your alternatives, the UK, Europe, Asia, the U.S. continues to make a ton of sense in terms of where people want to keep assets going forward. So Joseph, you said that your employing things are going to get worse because the dollar keeps on going up and there's a delayed effect. This is what companies do, right? They hedge currencies, whether they're going up, they're going down. This is part of their operations. As you said, you helped them do that. What is it about this current environment that is so tricky for them? Is it the speed of the move in the dollar, the persistence of it? Is there something unique about this point in time? Well, it's two parts, right? I think it's the speed. And then what you have is the persistence, right? And I think for companies, the hard part right here is companies are hedging six to 12 months out. They're managing for a year at most 18 months for the companies that are a little bit more aggressive. And so the decision to make is if I go and hedge now, go and lock in what is potentially a problem that may bounce back, right? And so the hardest part for companies right now is to really determine will this persist? And when you have this discussion back and forth about there's going to be a recession in the US which probably could mean the dollar could weaken. It's hard for companies to make decisions, right? You can take 10 economists and you've probably had two or three people on. They'll say slightly different things have slightly different forecasts. And I think that's been really challenging for my clients is sort of there is a consistency in view. And a lot of times the views have changed so rapidly, right? Six months ago the view was very different than it is today. And so, you know, it's summing up. I think it's just hard for companies to make decisions in this market when you have this much volatility. And you know, the outcome is so determined, really not by fundamentals, but really by policy. Joe, what sectors are doing a good job of hedging in this environment? Well, it's funny. I would say, you know, I wouldn't say some sectors. I think it's the size of companies that are doing better. The larger companies just have much more developed policies. They're just doing more. They've got a history of hedging. They've just been global longer. I think it's the new companies that over the last five, 10 years have seen rapid growth.",https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yvHvxXHIc5I,57,2022-10-10 18:01:05
2944," of hedging they've just been global longer. I think it's the new companies that over the last five, 10 years have seen rapid growth. That growth has been faster than their ability to put policy in place, right? So I wouldn't say it's a sector, right? I think it's, I would say companies that are seeing meteoric growth over the last 10 years are probably a little bit behind the April. The companies that have been global for 10, 20 years tend to be, tend to have policies and tend to be managing effects already. Smaller companies are also a little bit troubling, right? Because they, yeah, for them, they're still growing, right? And you kind of want to grow and then have hedges in place. So I would say, you know, companies that are big and have grown rapidly recently and smaller companies, those are the companies I probably worry the most about. And so with the size of those companies that you're really studying across and researching around, it also comes down to their employee base in all of these countries too. What role does the workforce, the employment and the wages across those different entities? What does that play as well in some of the effects considerations? Look, if you can have earnings and costs locally, that's your best outcome, right? So if I can sell my goods in a country and hire locally, that gives me costs to offset revenue. The companies that have the most issues will tend to be companies that have a lot of intellectual capital in one country and then sell goods in the other. So think about tech. Well, if all your programmers are in one country but you're selling goods globally, you don't actually have costs to offset. So companies are starting to think about that, right? How do I create natural offset? Where do I want to have my labor force, capital to offset some of my effects risk? That's the ideal situation. Most companies aren't set up that way. They tend to have what you tend to find, and you look at a tech sector, you tend to have a lot of costs in the US, for the US companies and a lot of net income overseas. And so that's always a challenge. Joe, bottom line, what do you think the magnitude of the effect of stronger dollars going to be in terms of the hit to US corporate earnings? I get the benefit, I would say, of not having to look and try to estimate that. The answer's far. That's a very hard question. Because companies man it, and when you think about the market, right? The largest companies that dominate the S&P into Dow, they have FX policies in place, right? And so I think overall, it's probably bigger than people are going to expect. And companies will come out and tell you, they'll say on a constant currency basis, we are X, but I wouldn't have an exact number, but I would say is I do probably if this persistence next year, it's probably going to be larger people expect. Good analysis here. Joseph Lewis, Jeffrey's head of corporate hedging and FX solutions. Have a good rest of the week. We'll talk to you soon. Thank you. Coming out, Netflix stands to mint money from its new ad tier servers who has some calls of the day. Coming up next week.",https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yvHvxXHIc5I,58,2022-10-10 18:05:21
2945," My Welcome back. Let's fire off a few calls on the day on this Monday morning. I'm locking in on a good note at a JP Morgan on Netflix. Another note out here explaining the potential financial windfall from an ad tear service, which Netflix is expected to launch next year. And they're correctly pointing out this. Shifted from slow to no subscriber growth in the current business to advertising and page sharing coming in 2023. You can see that in the stock price. Netflix shares of about 22% in the past three months. It's really cut fire. Overall still down 63% year-to-date. But still a lot of optimism around the financial potential of this ad service. Netflix is putting this at potential almost $3 billion by 2026 and maybe 22 million subscribers. Just in this ad service loan by 2026 next year, looking at a potential 600 million ad sales from the service. Right. A tear that they moved up in terms of the launch and saying now we're pointing out to November to actually bring the launch into market. And it's really going to be a question of when the subscribers really kind of in mass start to latch on to what that new offering could give them in terms of an experience that is lower price. Perhaps you're still going to get some ads. We know that, of course. But that's been successful for launch of even the streaming landscape years back. We think back 10 years ago, even when Hulu had some of their ad-supported tears. That's really what got some of the introductory members into these streaming services back then. And so now for Netflix, knowing that they've already really capitalized on that high end of pricing mechanisms, now it's just trying to retain and not turn as many users. And so we could see potentially some of those users downgrading the pricing at least that they're willing to pay at this point. I mean, expectations game for an X-Blic has been the roller coaster. It's been so fascinating. As you mentioned, the beginning, really people not expecting anything from the company. And now as modeling for its ad platform has leaked, we've seen the expectations really go back up again. So it's hard to see where this goes if it's really going to meet or exceed those new more sanguine estimates. Yeah, it's a big tell in that didn't exist for Netflix coming into this year. That's for sure. Yeah, they're going to have to compete as well. Disney, even looking at exploring some of their own ad-supported tears within Disney Plus, that could be a major competitor for a company that's already seen a massive subscription adoption and has quickly catapulted itself into one of the most powerful streaming services. And that's even pre a massive bundle from Disney too. Yeah. Also here, we're tracking shares of craft hines. Yeah, we're going into the kitchen and into the, well, wherever you're starting to catch up and mustard that into the pantry is perhaps after Goldman Sachs made a bullish call on the company, upgrading it to buy from neutral with a 45.",https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yvHvxXHIc5I,59,2022-10-10 18:09:53
2946," into the kitchen and into the, well, wherever you're starting to catch up and mustard's at into the pantry is perhaps after Goldman Sachs made a bullish call on the company upgrading it to buy from neutral with a $43 price target. They're saying that this is one of the consumer staples out there where higher margins profit margins. It's not fully baked in at this point. So for anybody who's looking to stock up on some catch ups or some musters perhaps graph finds is that option but there's so many other categories that that craft times has been able to really deliver for investors, especially as consumers are really monitoring where they can either buy and bulk in some cases or just get that that value that they had seen over many years and you go back to some of the household names that have the largest brand equity. We'd seen that in some of the other fashion and apparel calls out there on the street and craft times is certainly one of those right now with the largest brand equity too. Yeah we told folks. Last week when those conagren earnings numbers hit you said watch what they said on look what they said on prices they had a lot of success. Despite people becoming more mobile again pushing through price increases and that is the same theme that we are seeing in this upgrade from craft hines which is despite price increases. They're expecting all these price increases that craft took just like conagra they are likely to stick incoming quarters now that comes against a backdrop of CEO Miguel Patricio. Probably is enough credit for taking this getting this company off life support being I think he's passed his two year mark as CEO but he's out there cutting a lot of costs from this business so if you have higher prices lower costs that's a pretty good setup for profits. Yeah it seems that way investors are believing that today also. I'm taking a look at grab holdings the stock has been on the move lower down 7% right now after Barclays initiated coverage of the Asian delivery app with doubts over its long term profitability. Now it's an it's an equal weight rating here. It's a neutral waiting so it's interesting to see it taking such a hit the price target being set at $3 as you see there. And the analysis car rental costs are a substantial burden for drivers and push up fairs. The analyst does say that the company is a category leader in food delivery and ride handling in Southeast Asia with a very strong competitive position. So hence the equal weight a little bit of good little bit of bad that said grab also might be getting caught up to some extent in just the selling that we're seeing in Asian trading. But this is a company I believe it came public through us back if I'm not mistaken and the stock has not done very well since it did come public through that. Yeah you think about the ride sharing environment not just here in the US but internationally that's where grab really gets pulled into the conversation there in the markets that they operate. Where consumers right now for either the pricing that they're seeing higher or the options that are on the market in getting into micro mobility or other forms of mobility within a broader parent app if you will as uber's and lift has tried to add on some of that micro mobility element for grab it's very similar but in a market where there is much more. That's more of that micro mobility micro mobility that is actually taken advantage of by the consumers here so it's going to be how do you reach profitability while building up some of the other mobility mechanisms for consumers and knowing that you still have to make a lot of investments to retain drivers in one sense but also decrease the operating from mile costs and that's going to be a significant headwind still for all of these companies as they try to either dabble more in autonomous technology and how quickly that comes to be. And the most forward is question marks still up in the air at this point as well but for grab that is going to be something that they have to consider similarly as uber and lift do. Well I haven't bothered with this it's a $2.50 stock most people I would say watching this have never even heard a grab or taken a grab if you were that hell bent on using or investing in a ride sharing business go with uber. We just heard Brad Arickson saying uber is starting to really take market share from its largest competitor in the United States lift that might be the better way to play the space if you really want to. From one mechanism of riding and ride sharing to another one in owning a vehicle perhaps we're also watching shares of Tesla this morning after Morgan Stanley's Adam Jonas cut his price target on Tesla from $383 to $350. Warning of continued headwinds into the fourth quarter and 2023 one of the notables here the fiscal year 2023 delivery forecast cut to 1.8 million versus the 2 million previously out there saying that they believe the buy side consensus range.",https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yvHvxXHIc5I,60,2022-10-10 18:13:50
2947,". you Not a little bit of a downward push here to start the week with key earnings and inflation data on tap our next guest says investors should look to reach real estate investment trust. They haven't been immune to recent volatility, but our quote well prepared in this current environment National Association of Reeds economist John Worth joined us now John, you know I think of REITs as a group that are vulnerable when there's rising interest rate environment for a number of different reasons they tend to carry relatively high levels of debt, right? So their service and costs are higher. And they're seen as sort of because of their high dividend yields as almost a competing asset for something like treasuries as their yields are going higher. So talk us through why you think they're well positioned here. I'm absolutely happy to do it. You know, I think the view of REITs as being high leverage players is one that is a little bit out of date, frankly. What we've seen is that REIT leverage has been coming down for basically a decade. So today we've got leverage ratios near all time lows. The debt that REITs are holding is quite well termed out. They've got a weighted average term to maturity today of about seven years plus net interest expense as a share of their operating income is at all time lows. And about 85% of their debt is fixed rate. So they're really quite well positioned for a period of rising interest rates. And just as we compare them to other income generating alternatives, it's important to keep in mind that REITs provide income, but they're not fixed income. So they provide both income through their steady dividends as well as capital appreciation opportunities. And typically what we see is that in a period where you're coming out of a potential period of slow growth as we might be in about a year that we see REITs do quite well. So why would someone look at REITs versus say high growth internet at this point? Even though high growth internet is perhaps being redefined, REITs still have to compete for the same attention when investors are looking to get back into the market as they do against technology or some of the other more flashy names. Yeah, and I think it's important to think about that from a portfolio construction perspective. One of the things we see is that commercial real estate is such a fundamental piece of the overall economy. That's really critical for investors of all types. But is commercial real estate still as necessary if you have less people that are going into offices or there's more of a hybrid work approach? Is it still carrying the same weight? Absolutely. I think you really need to think about the breadth of commercial real estate. Commercial real estate, I think many investors think about it as office and retail, but it's a really much broader space. So for example, in REITs, you have data.",https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yvHvxXHIc5I,61,2022-10-10 18:20:53
2948," I think many investors think about it as office and retail, but it's a really much broader space. So, for example, in REITs, you have data centers, cell phone towers, logistics facilities. So you're getting the breadth of the economy that's housing the modern, the breadth of the real estate that's housing the modern economy. So you may feel like hybrid work is going to have people in the office less. That means you're going to have more activity through data centers, cell phone towers, logistics facilities. It reads, provide a way to grab the whole breadth of the real estate space. John, maybe I'm looking at it too simplistically here, but if we are going into recession next year, that might kick people out of their homes. Doesn't that mean some of those public storage names should do well, like they did in the Great Recession? Yeah, and I don't think public storage and the other self storage places are really going to benefit significantly from people maybe losing their homes. What we see is that that's a sector where we saw a huge bump during COVID, a huge bump in demand as people used the space they had differently. So they cleared out the guest room, they cleared out the garage and turned those into gyms and maybe school rooms in some cases. And that gave a huge bump to self storage demand. And then that that was got another dose of demand as the residential real estate market heated up as that market cools down. We may see some diminution in demand, but as whenever you have people making transitions in their lives, whether that that's moving, sending kids to school, bringing kids back into the household, what you see is that you they're using self storage as part of that. All right, you gave me a whole new reason to rewatch storage wars, national association of re-taconomists. John Worth, John, appreciate the time here today. Thanks. Coming up everyone, Black Friday deal season, it's kicking off. Wait a minute, it's October 10th, early at Target. All right, to say the least. We've got the details next. All right. All right. All right. All right. It is time for cut for time, three stories, one minute each. We start with this another controversy for you, the rapper formerly known as Kanye West.",https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yvHvxXHIc5I,62,2022-10-10 18:24:36
2949," It is time for Cut for Time, three stories, one minute each. We start with this. Another controversy for Ye, the rapper formerly known as Kanye West, faced social media restrictions over the weekend after users accused the rapper of posting anti-Semitic content leading to a block on both his Instagram and Twitter accounts. The reaction from this was interesting, that was reaction from Elon Musk and Elon of course, has been noted to say that he is going to do more post acquisition to try and let everybody back on the platform, raises a larger question of what Twitter will actually be if you still just have this cesspool of some of the harmful or derogatory statements that are coming back onto the platform from either Ye or even former President Donald Trump. Yeah, and I have a lot of questions about the companies that have just had to partner with Ye in various business ways. I mean, we saw what happened with Gap in the fallout from that. You see now Adidas is assessing its relationship with him. And I think, you know, when they're trying to tap into his creativity, his place in the zeitgeist, right? At the same time, they have to be cognizant of some of the potential disadvantages of partnering with somebody who can be very volatile. Good point. Black Friday is coming early for target shoppers. The retailer announced it's adding an additional three weeks to its Black Friday deals, extending the discount offerings of up to 50% off to seven weeks total. This is, I think, target just being target. Also, I should mention, we got some Adobe sales data out today predicting the holiday season sales rise to 1.5% and you're not great. This will be one of the most aggressive discounting seasons yet holiday seasons, according to Adobe. So there's lots of big deals out there, a lot of retailers, even target Walmart, sitting on a lot inventory. They have to move this stuff. They're going to start moving it early. I mean, if you go to that target website today, Black Friday is like plastered across the deals page. It's pretty interesting. Move over Lululemon's we made too much and here is we've got way too much over a target. And that's going to be the story for a lot of retailers over the course of this holiday season. How do they churn through inventory at a massively accelerated clip in order to get back into a decent position, come the start of 2023 as well? And for the consumer, how are they spending? Is it cash that they're willing to spend right now? Or is it, hey, let's just put it on the credit card. Let's figure that out later. It's going to be a lot better. Target gets half of my place right now. That place is just so addictive. You go in there and you just look to spend 20 bucks and you're down 150. You don't even know what you got. Tarje. Crazy. What? All right. And I don't anticipate it. It's side effect of Apple's new crash detection features come to light. The Wall Street Journal reporting several incidents of iPhone 14 users triggering 911 calls while riding roller coasters. So what's the deal here? It's that the iPhone automatically calls 911 with like an automated message. If it thinks you've gotten into a car crash, well, I guess being on a roller coaster feels like that you've gotten into a car crash. So they keep calling 911 and police keep showing up to various amusement parks around the country. Yeah. I mean, Swift responses that we're actually seeing triggered from the devices. So we know it works. It's just a question of, okay, how do you rein that in a little bit more? Because this is some of the technology that's featured not just in Apple's new iOS for their iPhones, but also within the watch itself. So if you have enough people that have those companion devices, you're going to see a lot of those errant, triggered calls to 911. Well, it says this out real time. Oh, shake it, Mike. No, I don't have an auto. I don't have a new iPhone. And no, no, I don't. But if you like fall down, I don't know how sensitive. Police are showing up to our house. Yeah. And how is the sensor different in this case versus when you're, say, running on a treadmill or doing some other activity? All good questions. All right. Coming up, Bikiko Fajita is going to speak with the latest analyst to the Airbnb, a rating this as we see stocks swamping on this Monday morning. Oh, and now really accelerated to the downside.

2950," Omega Welcome to Yahoo Finance Live. And happy Monday to all of you. It is 11 a.m. here in New York City. I'm a Kiko Fujiweta. Here's what we're watching at this hour holding pattern and inflation data and this sort of results. We're discussing fighting the Fed with all springs George Borey. Treasury Secretary Jenna L. Warren's about the economic impact from OPEC's latest production cut. Retracking to fall out as Washington Ways a response. Frank MacCurello with the American Petroleum Institute is going to be joining us this hour with his take on the oil cartels decision. And electric vehicles going solar. The CEO of German Auto Startup Sonomoto joins us later in the show to discuss his ambitions. How the car maker plans to rev up the US EV market. First though we are as always taking a look at the market action right now. 90 minutes into the trading day. We are seeing some of those losses accelerate red across the board here. But take a look at the bottom of the screen there. The NASDAQ now hitting a two year low down about 1.3%. A lot of this coming on the back of still reaction coming from the White House and the administrations very latest efforts to crack down on semi conductors or specifically crack down on Chinese ship makers. And we have seen a lot of those declines there. Take a look at that. Named video. Intel, Texas Instruments, Qualcomm, AMD, you get the picture all of them down today on the back of that extended reaction. Of course we sell the Chinese ship makers down in a big way overnight in Asia trading as well. Well there is a very busy week ahead of us for the markets. This earnings season approaches and more key economic data rolls in. And we've got our very own Yahoo finances and NAS for a to kick things off for us this hour and NAS. We're talking about earnings, economic data, certainly a lot to process in the week ahead. Yeah, that's right. A lot of data that will be watching that the markets are going to be watching. PPI that producer price index will be coming out this week. Now this is the change in price which producers receive for their services and goods.",https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yvHvxXHIc5I,64,2022-10-10 18:34:04
2951," be watching PPI that producer price index will be coming out this week. Now this is the change in price which producers receive for their services and goods. So that's expected to come in at 7.3 percent. The prior reading was 7.3. But the CPI, the consumer price index, that's the really big one on Thursday, which will be coming out. And that is expected to, on a year over year, expectation is that's 8.1 percent. The core CPI, that's excluding food and energy, that's expected to come in at 6.5 percent. Now the big thing here with this, with PPI, with CPI is that the numbers, although they may be well, for the core CPI, it's actually, that would be up from the previous one. But as far as the expectations, the numbers may not be coming down fast enough. And so if they're not coming down fast enough, then the Fed certainly has room to keep hiking. And also this week, you've got the FOMC minutes that are coming out. And that will be interesting because at Kiko, we will be able to also see if there's any discussion in those minutes about the size of the rate increases. If at any point, the Fed is considering to sort of put a little bit of a break on those rate increases. Yeah, and the income's at a time, obviously, where there's a debate about weather. In fact, the Fed needs to pause a bit because they've been moving so quickly. Is it going to be 50 basis points? Is it going to be 75 come November? And of course, the administration's watching it closely. One more FOMC meeting before the midterm. So a lot to digest there on that front. And as thanks so much for that. Well, US Treasury Secretary Jenner Yellen is warning about the impact OPEC's oil production cut will have on the global economy. Telling the financial times, the decision is in her words unhelpful and unwise. Of course, reinforcing the Biden administration's criticism over this move as questions arise on the repercussions that lie ahead. Let's bring in Frank McEarrula. He is API senior vice president of policy, economics, and regulatory affairs. Frank, it's good to talk to you today. We have heard several officials from the administration push back against OPEC's decision from last week. The White House saying it was short-sighted, saying that they will, in fact, respond moving forward, what is that decision meant for US oil producers? Sure. Thanks for having me on. Look, first off, it's a reminder, again, of how important it is to produce energy here in the United States and not have to rely on foreign countries like the OPEC plus nations for our energy. We have the capacity to continue to strengthen our energy security by tapping into the resources we have right here at home. And the more we do that, the less we're reliant and driven by decisions that are made somewhere else. And we did hear your president and CEO Mike Summers put out a statement on the back of that OPEC decision last week saying specifically, we urge the administration to adopt sound public policy that enables American energy to benefit Americans. What specifically does that sound policy look like? Sure. At API, we released a plan called the 10-22 that would open up federal lands and waters for oil and gas production. The Biden administration at the outset of their term closed new leasing for oil and gas development. So we would propose to open it up and continue to produce more here in the United States. The plan also calls for more energy infrastructure. The Biden administration canceled critical pipeline projects. We think the process for permitting of pipeline projects needs to be reformed so we can get energy from where it's produced to where it's needed. We also call on the plan to lift the barriers that are created by tariffs. We know that there is a supply chain issue currently in being able to produce more energy. And so we need to knock those barriers down. Finally, we think it's important to expedite LNG exports. The administration has made a commitment to Europe to export natural gas to provide relief from their reliance on Putin's net.",https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yvHvxXHIc5I,65,2022-10-10 18:38:00
2952," the D.I.L.N.G. exports. The administration has made a commitment to Europe to export natural gas to provide relief from their reliance on Putin's natural gas. And so we think we need a strong policy that expedites LNG exports. And how quickly would you be able to move on that, specifically on LNG? Well, we're urging Congress and the administration to act quickly on all components of this plan. I think on LNG, it's really a question of a commitment from the government to expedite applications, a commitment from Europe to build down the necessary infrastructure to take the natural gas into its countries. But there is a commitment there on both sides. And so what we need is an acceleration of that. The oil and gas industry stands ready to help. There is another, I am, a legislation that's been floating around for some time. And this is no pack, specifically stands for no oil producing and exporting cartels act. This would essentially empower the Justice Department to go after OPEC under anti-trust rules if they are seen as setting or at least trying to attempt to control the price of oil. The Biden administration, at least in their statement, seems to suggest they want to revisit that. But I know API has specifically been very opposed to this idea. Why? This policy has been opposed on both sides of the aisle and from administrations in both parties. The real way to get OPEC is to produce more energy here in the United States. And the way to do that is to lift the pause that the administration has had on leasing. Look, at this point in the Obama administration, they had issued 60 leases for oil and gas development. This point in the Biden administration, they're just at six. And so if the administration wants to get serious about energy security and energy independence, it needs to look right here at home. And it needs to provide a pathway for more energy production here in the United States. Finally, Frank, you sort of alluded to the need for more exports coming out of the US at a time when there are concerns about supply globally. You have put out a letter here saying that any kind of export ban we're talking about diesel, but also refined products would deplete inventory levels and it would put upward pressure on consumer fuel prices. Of course, the administration argument would be, we'll at a time when there was concerns about supply crunch, that supply should be left domestically. So walk me through your calculation. Why does this deplete supply in your opinion? And why would that push prices higher? Sure, it's not our opinion in July of this year, the American Council for Capital Formation studied this issue. They found that an export ban on refined product would end up cutting refinery capacity by 1.3 million barrels per day here in the United States. It would end up raising costs for fuel for consumers across the United States. It would cost jobs, about 85,000 jobs would be lost under such a policy. And finally, it would harm American GDP. And so for all of those reasons and for American energy security, the refined export product ban is a bad idea. Finally, this administration has made a commitment to our allies overseas, to other countries that we support, to Latin America, where we export an enormous amount of refined product. It's made a commitment to those allies that we're gonna continue to provide the energy that we have right here in the United States. I see no reason why the administration should turn its back on that commitment. And it would certainly, imposing such a policy would certainly not help the American consumer. And where are those conversations stand right now with the administration? I know there's been a bit of a back and forth. Oftentimes it has been reported as being a little more contentious. In terms of specifically an export ban, what's your understanding of where the administration stands? Well, we've made the case. We've laid out the data that shows that such a policy would have negative implications for the American people for the driving public. I think the administration understands that. I think they understand that these are global products that require global markets. I think they also understand that the United...",https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yvHvxXHIc5I,66,2022-10-10 18:42:21
2953," I think the administration understands that. I think they understand that these are global products that require global markets. I think they also understand that the United States has world-class leading refineries and they produce the fuels that the world needs. And so we're hopeful that the administration steps back from considerations of export ban, whether it's crude oil, refined product, or LNG. Frankly, looks toward American energy production as the solution. And we've set all along the solution to the challenges that we face, actually lie under our feet. Because of innovation and technology, we've increased production here in the United States from seven million barrels to 12 million barrels per day. We can do more, but we need the policies in place to help us achieve that. Frank MacIarola, API Senior Vice President of Policy Economics and Regulatory Affairs, I appreciate your time today. Sure, thank you. Well, time now for our trending ticker. We are seeing shares of Rivian in reverse. Getting punished after the company were called nearly all of its electric vehicles. You see that's stocked down more than 10%. The announcement affects more than 12,000 vehicles, including the Rivian R1T pickup, as well as the R1S SUV and some delivery vans that have been produced for Amazon. The carmaker says no injuries have been reported so far, but there are concerns about a fastener that wasn't tightened properly that could affect driver's ability to steer the vehicle. Rivian says the fixes will be implemented over the next 30 days. And stay tuned later in the show because we will be speaking with Sonno Motors, co-founder and CEO Lauren Hahn, live from the NASDAQ Market site, the group kicks off its nationwide solar mobility tour to debut at the Affordable Solar EV for the first time in the U.S. That is coming up a little later in just an hour.",https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yvHvxXHIc5I,67,2022-10-10 18:47:04
2954," We are on the cusp of yet another earning season and markets are turning to JP Morgan, the city, Wells Fargo and Morgan Stanley as they report during the most uncertain of economic environments for preview of what to expect. Let's bring in Yahoo finances, Alexandra Seminova. These are always, it's always a good bell leather, right? About where things are in terms of the economy, as we said, never been more uncertain. Yeah, absolutely, Akiko. Those four bangs among the six largest in the U.S. by assets are set to be the opening act of the earnings season with Goldman Sachs and Bank of America set to release results next week and some of the themes that we'll be watching closely are a slowdown in investment banking revenues, potential alias across their businesses, how demand for loans is holding up with higher interest rates, and any potential warnings about the economy that CEOs may deliver on earnings calls. And this quarter profits are expected to shrink, especially compared to a really robust 2021 for Wall Street. Profits are also likely to take a hit from higher loan loss provisions. Those are funds that aside by banks for any potential sour loans if customers don't make their payments. The six largest U.S. banks are estimated to set aside a collective $4.5 billion this quarter that's according to a financial time's report today. And this is also a turnaround from a year ago when banks actually benefited from releasing those reserves as we were recovering from the pandemic. One notable thing to note too is that banks typically benefit from higher interest rate environments. Those often give them a nice boost on their net interest income, but investment banking revenue is likely to offset that and some other things to look out for too are any comments that bank executives make. Jamie Diamond is always an interesting one on his earnings calls with his storm cloud warnings, credit suites and the broad, what that means for the broader industry, and also a bank of American Morgan Stanley are estimated to lose a combined $500 million on Elon Musk's Twitter deal. You know worth noting the bar pretty low going into earnings season, not just within banks, but overall. Thanks so much for that. I know you're going to be tracking those results really closely. Moving on here as we look ahead to there you go. There's the prompt. It looks like a wider look on market, CD Ameritrade, out with its investor movement index showing traders took a more risk off approach in September for more about what these results mean and what's driving the trends. Let's bring in Sean Cruz, TD Ameritrade, head trading strategist. Sean, these notes are always really interesting to me, a very good gauge of where the retail investor stands feels like it's pretty much tracking with the rest of the market. Things just aren't feeling very good. Yeah, I think right now we got a little bit of a head fake back in August. There was actually recovery for the first time this year. We actually had that investor movement index tick higher. And I think that quickly got wiped off the table in September. So what we did see in what clients were buying, they were certainly being a little bit more conservative and that they weren't going out there buying some of the more speculative areas of the market, some of the more speculative names that maybe aren't profitable right now or just have some very high multiples. They're not really reaching for those right now. They're going back to some of the more familiar established names out there. In some cases really looking at names with quality fundamentals, be that solid revenues, solid cash flow, healthy balance sheets, leverage was another thing that they certainly have been a little bit wary of as we're starting to see rates tick higher and higher that is going to impact some of those more highly levered companies versus the more fundamentally sound companies. So they still found some opportunities out there, but they certainly are a little bit cautious right now. And I think that makes sense. And we're going to get to some of those names we just showed on the screen there, but probably speaking, what has led to the sell-off that you have seen exiting of positions? Is it really just about the Fed? I think that really was what drove that optimism in August and that light at the end of the tunnel from the Fed, Pausian or potentially even reverse and some of those rate hikes gave it drove a lot of optimism, but like I said, that light the end of the tunnel ended up being a train coming your way instead. And that really...",https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yvHvxXHIc5I,68,2022-10-10 18:51:04
2955," or potentially even reversing some of those rate hikes gave it. Drove a lot of optimism, but like I said, that light the end of tunnel end up being a train coming your way instead. And that really drove that shift in sentiment in that not only were we getting some data that did indicate they haven't made significant progress, they are starting to have an effect, look at housing, for instance. But the Fed kept coming out. Whenever the market would give a little bit of a pop of optimism, you would almost have a Fed speaker, someone somewhere come out and say, look, we're not stopping. This is something we are committed to. I think they're coming around to that notion. And that's why we're trading down at these levels. I think the market's going to respond differently to maybe a hawkish Fed when we're trading at 3,600 on the S&P 500 versus say trading up at 4,000 or 4,200. So I do think a lot of that is now priced in. If things get significantly worse and that's why we just spoke about the bank earnings, that is going to be huge. The macro read through on what we hear from the banks, I think is really going to set the tone for the rest of earnings seasons. And I think the market is also going to change their macro outlook based on what we hear. So let's talk about some of those names that we have seen big moves in. In terms of net buyers, we're seeing a lot of the chip makers. You could argue that's part of evaluation play given just how far some of these names have pulled back, but in terms of those that are being sold. Exxon, mobile and BP, an interesting one to me because energy has been pretty strong is this sort of the expectation that we have reached the peak with some of these names and the pullback is coming? That is where we see that type of activity. I don't think anyone expects crude oil to completely fall apart anytime soon. But I do think they're looking at it from a little bit more of a valuation standpoint. And we've seen that where you get these energy companies trading towards the bottom of their range. That's where there's a lot of interest in buying. When they recover and they start hitting towards the upper end of those ranges, that's where they rotate out of those. So I think it's an interesting strategy. It's more of a short term strategy. I think we see playing out, but they use those profits when they do decide to roll out and lower exposure in those names. We actually do see them going out there and trying to find opportunity elsewhere. And I, some of the conductors last month, was that that key spot. I think we saw a lot of interest on the buy side. Certainly today, I think caught a lot of people off guard. If you look at the semiconductors that are really getting hit, it's the semiconductor companies that really have a lot of exposure to that relationship with China and just what goes on the onshore offshore aspect of their supply chains. But I think what they were looking at, if you look at the charts, AMD, NVIDIA, Intel, all those names were hitting the support levels. And when you see these support levels, these ranges, they start to approach the lower end. That's where you get a lot of buy and activity. I'm going to venture, guess we look at this again next month. We're going to see a lot of selling as they broke through some of those. I was going to say, I wonder if some of that buying holds, especially as we get these warnings about demand, especially from a lot of these big chip makers, TSMC and other one, we're expected to hear from this week.

Joining us now is Richard Clark, managing director at A.B. Bernstein. Richard, there's a number of things that you highlight here, but really the point being that this isn't just about Airbnb being able to protect its market share and the vacation rental business, you think they could really make a significant play on hotels and experiences as well. Walk me through that thesis. Yeah, I mean, I think that's absolutely right. So I think the vacation rental market is still very exciting. I think it's a big market. It's going to gain share of the overall lodging market. And Airbnb will think we'll gain share within that. But probably beyond that, even more exciting, is that ability to sell more than just vacation rental market. It doesn't market as much as other travel platforms. So it has a loyal customer following. Has a very strong brand. Do we think they can sell longer stays, hotel rooms, experiences, and they can add to its growth? The longer stays have been a real growth spot for Airbnb, something they've been highlighting especially over the course of the pandemic. The hotels specifically, where do you see them making a play when you look at how fragmented the market is right now? Yeah, so I mean, I think actually the hotel market is fragmented. The distribution market is not that fragmented. You've got booking and expedia. They're quite dominant in their respective geographies. So I think the actual hotels are looking for other distribution channels to broaden their landscape a little bit. And I think Airbnb is unique in the sense that it does try and inspire the customer. It's got this category-based search. It tries to find a way to match the customer and the product up in the way that we don't see in other companies. I think that gives it a way to make a play in hotels. So you see the platform revolving into a place where hotels can also list their openings? Well, they're already on. I mean, there are already tens of thousands of hotels listed on Airbnb, or hotels in it. They signed a deal with Sightminder. They signed a deal with OU. And that gave them somewhere around 70 to 80,000 hotels.",https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yvHvxXHIc5I,70,2022-10-10 19:00:55
2957," you you you you triple refesions And as we see how that translates in terms of volatility, we see that the VIX above 30 here, signaling that some of the signs of a possible recession, certainly not helped today by JP Morgan Chase, CEO, Jamie Diamond, warning of a likely recession in the next six to nine months. Taking a look at what we're seeing in the sector action. We're seeing travel stocks under pressure, and that's as China reimposed COVID-19 lockdown with new daily cases tripling over the week long holiday and right before a key government meeting in Beijing next week. You can see some of the ones most under pressure. There you have trip.com. That's up. That's down about almost 6% there. And same with when they're down almost 12%. Also want to take a look at what we're seeing with the broader sector action here. As we can see, some of these mega caps under pressure, but as you break it down by sector here, we're seeing that in terms of the big winners of the day that are at least pulling ahead for now, we're seeing consumer staples in the green. Those are up about half a percent. Energy though, they're down about 2%. Sure, no? Michelle, let's take a look at the tech sector. You were just mentioning some of the underperformers there, specifically what we're seeing in energy. XlK, the technology sector not too far behind on an interday basis off just around one and a half percent. You're today clearly under pressure. As we've seen selling across almost every aspect of this industry here, you're today XlK off just around 31%. The S&P tech sector lagging the broader index by the most since 2002, that is on a year-to-date basis. Take a look at some of the individual movers within the XlK why we're seeing such losses today. A lot of that has to do with the selling that we're actually seeing in the chip stocks and take a look at the screen. You're really seeing a broad base selling here in video, Qualcomm, AMD among the worst performers in this group, Intel, AMD, Nvidia, all hitting 52 week low. So the selling that we saw all started at the end of last week continuing into today. I guess you can say that the selling has been happening since the start of the year. But we got that warning from AMD last week in terms of the third quarter revenue guidance that way on the broader chip index, the new restrict.",https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yvHvxXHIc5I,71,2022-10-10 19:03:55
2958," that the selling has been since the start of the year. But we got that warning from AMD last week in terms of the third quarter revenue guidance that way on the broader chip index, the new restrictions imposed from the Biden administration in terms of exports to China. That's a headwind here for this group heading into the fourth quarter and then into 2023. So big reason why we are seeing that selling and then I also want to pull up the Philly Semiconductor Index. You look at some of the movements that we're seeing today the Philly Semiconductor Index on the last quarter of the year. So we're seeing that just around 3% year to date off more than 40% you see that drop of just around 42% the lowest level today that we've seen since November 2020 also on track for that two day drop. If we take a look at the two day chart here off just around 9% that would be the largest two day drop date that we have seen since March of 2020. Wow. Shana. Thank you. Let's get up to speed now on the situation in the past. Last week, we were launching 84 cruise missiles on Monday along with drone attacks as well. At least 11 people were killed and powered knocked out in several regions of Ukraine. Vladimir Putin says the attacks were in retaliation for that apparent Ukrainian attack on a key supply bridge over the weekend. Ukraine is not claimed credit. President Biden condemned the quote utterly brutality of Putin's illegal war and also says that the country will continue to impose costs on Russia for its aggression. Not entirely clear of course what those costs will be. Michelle. Indeed, we're certainly a lot there for markets to digest. Let's take a look at that market reaction and we turn to Liz Young. So vice head of investment strategy. Liz, obviously the markets have a lot of information to digest and they're wondering how the Fed is going to interact to these different data points and what the Fed is going to do. Investor sentiment is pretty extended on the bearish side and it seems difficult to find really a lot of positivity in that and you can look at that a couple different ways. You can look at it as there isn't much to grasp on to as far as looking forward and getting positive about a soft landing or you can say that when things get this extreme on the bearish side we're getting closer and closer to that being over. Now what we're still looking at is that the Fed is going to be a lot more than just a few years. So what you've clearly pointed out is that there are a ton of data points rolling in many of which are telling us that the economy is softening things are slowing but it still hasn't been enough to fight that big enemy which is inflation. So it keeps the Fed on this path. The jobs numbers from last week keep the Fed on this path and that's what the market is really grappling with. What do you think has been accounted for? So if you look at just the movement in what the market expects the terminal rate to be so the rate at which the Fed will stop hiking and either pause or have to eventually cut that rate has actually moved up or that expectation has moved up just even in the last week we're looking at about 4.7% terminal rate as expected by the market by March of next year. So you could assume that that's sort of what's priced in but you're still looking at the expectation of a recession still only about 50 50 and with a market that's been down at most 25% peak to trough this year it would tell me that we still have further to go on the downside to really price in a recession and that could be what we see through October as we start to get earnings information if companies start to revise down and as economic data continues to soften we could get closer and closer to that 30% 35% down which would effectively price in the recession in my opinion. Speaking of Richell mentioned off the top the prediction from Jamie Diamond 6 to 9 months before we're tip into a recession that Europe is already there and that our markets could have another 20% to follow your thoughts on the latest comments from Jamie. So look it's not necessarily new that he's said that he's worried about economic growth so it's not the first time that he's mentioned this but it's definitely possible and you know even 6 to 9 months seems a little far out to me I think that if we do see a recession or the beginning of one that it'll happen in the first half of 2023 as far as another 20% down in the market that feels like a lot to me and look where a Caulie savings of $10330 based bring on от the balls noticed",https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yvHvxXHIc5I,72,2022-10-10 19:09:09
2959," or the beginning of one that it'll happen in the first half of 2023. As far as another 20% down in the market, that feels like a lot to me and look, nobody really knows how much further it could go and where the stopping point is, but 20% more does feel like a lot to me. And if you just think about on average to price in a recession or a drawdown during a recession, you do have to get beyond 30%. And we haven't quite gotten there yet. So at this point, the market is still sort of hoping that we can avert one. I don't know that we need to go down another 20%. I feel like 3,300 on the S&P is a pretty good stopping point, if not beyond where we might stop. But again, who knows what the future holds. There's a lot of different things that could happen. And one of the things that I think investors should really be watching is credit spreads. There hasn't been a huge blowout in spreads. They've widened, but in a really orderly fashion so far, if credit spreads start to become more troublesome and get to a level where we're worried about defaults, particularly in the corporate market or in consumer lending, that's when you have to start assuming that the stock market will go down much further. So then Liz, given those factors, then, a lot of investors, especially retail investors, one ring, should I hold onto my cash, is that the safer bet versus say other opportunities? What are you seeing in terms of opportunities? Say, what's the play here? Short term versus longer term. So in the short term look, it's not a bad idea to hold onto your cash if you're nervous, but here's what I would say. We've already done a lot of work on the valuation side. So we've done a lot of re-rating in stocks. Like I said before, we've gone down at one point from peak to trough 25% in the S&P. So if things continue to fall, it's okay to start thinking about buying that incrementally on the way down. And you can look at, many people are talking about a barbell approach. I do think that that's a good approach. So on one end of the barbell, you've got safety stocks, which are pretty expensive right now, and I would keep that in mind. You can also think about putting things in there like gold. You can think about using treasuries at this level. And then on the other end of the barbell, look at some of those growthier names or some of those cyclical sectors that are probably trading at pretty attractive valuations compared to where they were a year and a half, two years ago. So thinking about just entering into those names systematically, don't spend it all at once, but systematically as we go down and always remember the market bottoms before the economy bottoms. So by the time the market is done with its down draft, the economy still has to follow. And by the time the economy bottoms, the market usually has started to recover. Well, Liz, what you're saying right now about those growthier, more cyclical names, brings me to tech and the selling that we're seeing today. Really what we've seen since the start of the year, clearly we have seen a large drop in valuations is selling that we're seeing today. They'll bring the Nasdaq to its lowest level that we've seen in more than two years. I guess what do you think it's going to take to get investors back on board or if they are picking some of those growthier names, those cyclical plays, what should more specifically should they be looking for? So one of the things that you covered earlier in the show was semiconductors. And what I would say to people about that, it's important to think about this. The way that the economy has changed and the things that the U.S. economy is now dependent on are much more technology focused. So semiconductors have really taken over as one of those cyclical indicators in the tech space. So on a day where we're having increased recession fear and we're still worried about the fed raising rates too far and putting us into a recession, it is probably not any surprise that semiconductors are under a lot of pressure because they are that cyclical indicator for tech. Now as they continue to get hurt and as we see recession fears heat up, as the market prices that in, that's when those names start to become attractive. So I would still be waiting a little bit and maybe even beyond when the S&P gets lower than 3,500 if that's the case, but that's when you start to nibble on some of those names. But you want to be choosy about it and make sure that you've diversified your portfolio still outside of tech because rates are going to stay high for quite a period of time here until inflation is under control, which means that technology, communications and even some consumer discretionary names could have a lid on their upside because of that rate hike. But you can start to enter back into what I would call the sort of cream of the crop in each of those groups. Um, right?",https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yvHvxXHIc5I,73,2022-10-10 19:13:05

Well, one of the major railroad unions has rejected the proposed deal with freight railroads renewing the possibility of a strike. About 56% of the members of the Brotherhood of Maintenance of Way Employees Division rejected the deal, which includes 24% raises and $5,000 in bonuses. The union president saying the railroaders do not feel valued. For now, the union has agreed to delay any strike until five days after Congress reconvenes in mid-November to allow time for additional negotiations. All right, we'll say with us, we're just getting started here on Yahoo Finance Life. Coming up, automakers are getting hit hard on Wall Street following a major recall from the Rivian and a pessimistic analyst take on GM and Ford will have those details. And Kanye West's Twitter account was locked after he tweeted anti-Semitic comments. It begs the question, would that be the case if Elon Musk owns Twitter? We'll ask a long time tech investor about that. And Hulu may have just gotten a little more expensive for subscribers. We'll give you those numbers. Don't go anywhere. Rivian shares a sinking today. You can see the stock off just around 7% after voluntarily, recalling more than 12,000 vehicles over concerns of a possible steering and suspension hazard. Yahoo Finance, a senior auto reporter, Prestige Vermine, is here with more on this press. Looking at the stock reaction, Wall Street obviously very concerned about this recall.

2961," What's your take on it? It's just not a good look right now when they have this critical Q4 coming up. They've got to meet these deliveries and hit that goal of 25,000 cars a year. You know, it's a simple issue. It's a tiny bolt on an arm in front of the steering knuckle. But if it fails, it's a catastrophic steering failure. Right? So they have to do this. Safety is an utmost concern. It's good they're doing this now. But it's just sort of, you know, as one analyst, it's a black eye for them. Right? As like there's credibility issues already on the table for them. And now you have this on top of their big goal in Q4. So I think it's kind of like, you know, you see the analyst, the chart. It's just a concern there right now for them to perform. It reads like a bit of an overreaction based on the fact there are no deaths, no real serious accidents, a very small incident number as well. This is a proactive company really getting ahead of it. I want to ask you about Tesla as well, some massive numbers out of China breaking a record. And the flip side, huge numbers out of China, the Giga Shanghai 83,000 vehicles, delivered to biggest month ever. This after they sort of did these upgrades that Shanghai fac of facility over the summer, they shut down for a bit and now they're really pumping out cars there. Tesla and the latest quarter said that they can produce around 750,000 vehicles per year there now. That's like, that's the biggest factory. So huge install based right now in Giga Shanghai. Now we just got to couch that. There are new lockdowns already underway in China, not where the Tesla factory is yet, but their caseload tripled after the weekend. So new lockdowns in China could eventually impact Tesla as well. Rochelle. And, Pros, stick around because I want to turn out a Ford and GM. We saw a UBS analyst Patrick Hummel downgrading both stocks, citing an expected we can demand thanks to inflationary pressures, as well as some of these supply constraints we continue to hear about. Now, Hummel predicts, quote, that it will take three to six months for the auto industry to end up in oversupply. So, Pros, what's your reaction to this? Does it seem like one step forward, two steps back for some of these auto makers right now? It's, you know, it's a little surprising even the last two and a half years we've seen the supply be the problem for the auto makers. They were able to command huge margins, extreme pricing power because of the fact they didn't have enough supply. And now we're talking about demand actually turning down and the supply becoming a problem when you have more cars than that actually needed for the market, probably by I think the analyst saying next year. So, I'm not assuming they thought that Ford was actually in a worse place in GM because of their product portfolio and stuff like supply chain. So, I'm curious what you guys think about that. Yeah, I mean, it's interesting. I just think it's just in terms of the demand destruction, projection part of it, the fact that it's falling apart and falling apart so quickly, I think that caught me a little bit off guard. Yes, we talked about the fact that the economy is weakening. People are going to be pulling back on spending, but I didn't necessarily, I guess, expected to be to that degree so quickly. So, that's something that jumped out to me. And then also just in terms of what he does like, you be saying that they favor automakers with a luxury exposure, one of them being Mercedes just given the fact that more the higher end to consumers could potentially be more resilient if we do say a large economic downturn. Yeah, I just, it is shocking the U-turn. Yeah. It was just a couple of weeks ago that Ford told us 40, 45,000 cars did not have the parts and they'd have to park them until, and now we're talking about again, oversupply in the next three to six months, it is hard to imagine as going into a world where that is a situation. Dealers across the country, as you know, pros, are wiped out. They are still empty. So dramatic turnaround like that, I can't quite imagine. But apparently they're seeing it. We've seen it only in the used car sector. Car max got hit hard at earnings. The new car segment we haven't seen, demand destruction yet. Because there hasn't been supply. But really interesting point about the luxury demand side, because we write a lot about that. How it's insatiable demand, Rolls Royce, Bentley, Mercedes, those types of names. They can't find enough buyers, I mean, they can't find enough cars for their buyers. And on the, on the flip side, Ford and GM potentially, this analyst thinks that there's a problem for them because there's, these buyers are less able to weather the storm. I like potential downturn. But I guess the measure is interesting because of coming out at a time when we're still talking about the supply chain issues that a lot of these larger automakers make. Yes. So how is that going to be corrected so quickly that then would leave to this oversupply when we haven't been able to get our, get a better grasp of this now for over two years? I really can't see this being a prompt for this back half of next year. If you really think about it, I think that's what the analyst is kind of saying. But he's kind of putting his mark on the table right now. Ford, it said Ford.",https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yvHvxXHIc5I,75,2022-10-10 19:21:43
2962," can't see this being a problem with the back half of next year if you really think about it. I think that's what the analyst is kind of saying but he's kind of putting his mark on the table right now like Ford. He said Ford we see absolute downside for Ford. That's a direct quote. I mean that's crazy. Right now they have very very strong pricing power. I don't know maybe EBS will have the last laugh on this one. It certainly looks like Wall Street is worried about the downgrade here with Ford chairs. Sink you to air. Press. Thanks so much for that. Coming up Amazon's two-day prime early access sale. Kicking off tomorrow, rivals though are ready for a fight for your dollar and are lining up with deals of their own. Stay tuned for more on that next. Retailers are starting up their holiday sales events even earlier this year. And Amazon is leading the charge with its second prime day of the year. You know the finances Ali Garfinkle joins us now with what we can expect from this sales event which starts tomorrow. So Ali what are you watching? So Rochelle there are a couple of things. The first is that this is the second prime day of the year right. This is their first time doing two prime days and that first prime day this summer Rochelle was so successful. They touted it as their greatest prime day ever point blank. So we'll see if they can replicate that magic in a really difficult economic environment where they",https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yvHvxXHIc5I,76,2022-10-10 19:25:35
2963," started it as their greatest prime day ever, point blank. So we'll see if they can replicate that magic in a really difficult economic environment where they have more competition, right? Amazon's leading the charge, but we've seen Target, Walmart, Best Buy, you name it, everyone's got a sale going on this month. So to that end, look for some really deep discounts. Amid the inflation squeeze, companies are doing whatever it takes to get you to buy something. And for Amazon, what that means is, yes, the Amazon, the viral Amazon code from a couple years ago has returned, but it also means connected devices are going to be the star. They just had their devices and services event. And if there's one thing you're going to see, is you're going to see the Echo, Ring, Fire TV. Those are all going to be deeply, deeply discounted. If there's one thing I've learned covering Amazon, Rochelle, those devices are key to their future. They see it as key to their future and they haven't been immune to this tech route. So it makes sense that they will be pushing these connected devices at one of their most important events of the year. That certainly makes sense, getting everyone deeper into the ecosystem indeed. Thank you as always, Ali Gawfinkel. Dave. Thank you, Adobe Analytics forecast online sales in November and December, Tariah is just 2.5%. That's the slowest rates since 2015. And also it compares to 8.6%. Just a year ago, where we headed, Christine Short is the VP of Research for Wall Street, Horizon, Christine, nice to see you. So I guess tomorrow is kind of like Black Friday on a Tuesday in early October. It's a little confusing. How much does this change everything these October sales in terms of traditional holiday sales? Well, we've been seeing this for a few years, right? Like the Black Friday, the holiday sales keep getting moved early and earlier. And that's because consumers are demanding it. They want to spread out their shopping over a longer period of time. It used to be a day after Thanksgiving through Cyber Mondays. You know, you've got about five days of deals. Now you've got a couple of months of deals. So I think we're responding to consumer demand. I think it's also really smart for a lot of these retailers, Ali mentioned it's not just Amazon, but it's Target, Walmart. You've got some of the department stores, Maysees, Coles, Bed Bath and Beyond. They're all doing this because what research and which surveys have shown is that consumers are getting a little more anxious about inflation. They feel okay about their job position. Unemployment is still very historically low, but as the year goes on, something consumers are looking at. So why not get your holiday shopping out of the way now? What does it mean for shopping later? I think it just spreads out a little more. You might actually have a chance to get more money out of consumers, but I think by front loading it, it's a very smart thing. And I think those that are, there's always got your late shoppers. There will still be people shopping throughout the rest of the year, but I think it's smart to start it earlier this year. Yeah, you're talking about me and Shana Smith. I'm usually December 23rd-ish. I'm still waking up in a pumpkin spice latte, which was like two months ago. Axios has a story today saying the traditional holiday shopping season is dead. Is that true? I don't know about that. Some people really like to do it just as an activity with their family to go in person the day after Thanksgiving. But yeah, it's certainly taking a big hit here, right? And like I said, this has been a trend that's been ongoing the last few years, but as far as the shopping online is still continuing to pick up in popularity, it doesn't mean people aren't gonna be spending, right? National Retail Federation with their holiday forecast and survey show that yeah, two-thirds of people are still gonna spend on gifts, on celebrations this year. They feel like they haven't been able to do as much the last couple of years because of COVID restrictions. So whether it means taking out of savings or redirecting money that would otherwise go somewhere else or even going into credit card debt, they will be spending money this holiday season now that we're kind of getting back to normal. The story of this retail year has been an inventory issue too much of it. Is that still the case? And is there anyone that got it right? Yeah, you know, we went into this saying, the bigger sophisticated retailers like your target, like your Walmart, they set up for last holiday season, we thought they were gonna get it right, they weren't new to this. Clearly they didn't, there was loads.",https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yvHvxXHIc5I,77,2022-10-10 19:30:19
2964," like your target, like your Wal-Mart, they set up for last holiday season. We thought they were gonna get it right. They weren't new to this. Clearly they didn't. There was loads of inventory on the shelves for many of those big retailers. I think we've had over a year now to get it right. So I think retailers setting into this holiday season are certainly in a better position. So that's not as much of a concern this year. And so I think that that's one thing we don't necessarily have to worry about. Costs are still very high, right? So we're talking a little about Amazon here. Despite the fact that this is probably gonna be a great prime event. The costs over the last few quarters have been eating into those revenues. So that's something we're gonna look out for as well. Is this a positive story, though? Will it be for the holiday season? This bulk and inventory should result in discount. Should be a deflationary and even a positive fed story, although not a great earning story. Yeah, like Ali said, it's anything to push the inventory and to give deep discounts. So it is a complex situation where you've got higher costs. Inflation is creating higher costs for everything, right? But the consumer really wants value right now. So you have to be offering discounts. And some of the ones that we've seen already as advertised from target from Amazon. We're talking 50 to 80% off of some of the most popular items. So they're actually willing to take a hit in some ways just to get to the consumer who really is looking for the deepest discounts possible right now. So promotions are going to be huge and pushing out some of that extra inventory. It's not a great investor story, but it is a good consumer story. I want to come full circle back to the story we started with where online sales rising just 2.5%. But the brick and mortar stories, the real fascinating one, more stores opened in 21 than closed for the first time since 1995, according to Morgan Stanley, what is the deal with brick and mortar making a comeback? You know, I think people miss that. They miss the brick and mortar. We've seen, like you said, e-commerce sales have come down since the peak of COVID where they were really at their highest. So I think you're going to see more of a blend this year, whereas the story that lasts like 10 years for holiday shopping has been that e-commerce. It's continuing to pick up. But I think again, it's more of an activity. It's something to do together with friends with family. And so people like going out there. They like looking at the items they're buying. And honestly, retailers like that too, because there's less things getting returned. And that's what we're seeing a third of things bought online and up getting returned because you really haven't had a chance to see and experience it. So if they can get you to buy and brick and mortar, retailers are going to be pretty happy about that. Reports of brick and mortar's death greatly exaggerated. Wall Street Horizon, VP of Research, Christine Short. Good to see you. Thanks. All right, coming up. It's been a roller coaster of a day for big tech. But it's been smooth sailing for Netflix.

2965," I'm women women women women women wearing a dress before the insurance school bus tracks onusal reimagining earlier. All right, it's time for triple play with three stocks that we're watching in the final 30 minutes of trading. We've got five, nine, craft and Netflix on deck. Now my pick is Cloud Software Provider 5.9 to get FIVN. You see the stock down more than 24 percent there. Now the share started falling after CEO Rowan Trollup announced his resignation. Now he'll be leaving at the end of November and in a tweet, Trollup said, quote, he'd accepted a position as CEO of Avenger Backed pre-IPO startup I remain very bullish about the opportunity at 5.9. Investors though digesting this change against the backdrop of better than expected preliminary third quarter financial results. Up chairman and former 5.9 CEO Mike Berkland is coming back to the role. That's after resigning in 2017 due to a cancer diagnosis. The stock did hit a 52 week low on this leadership change announcement. But Berkland said he's excited about the path forward. Saying, quote, we are still in the early innings of the shift to cloud driven by key trends such as digital transformation and the strategic importance of customer experience. Now most analysts do still have a buy rating on the stock. So there's still some bullishness here, but at least just for today on the leadership change, the stock under a lot of pressure. Show them. If I shall, nearly 25 percent, you mentioned hitting a 52 week low today, even though many analysts are still bullish, actually Morgan Stanley downgrading the stock today to equal weight from overweight. So they have some questions just about what the stock and what the returns are going to look like at least in the short term. It wasn't all bad news. I'm a little surprised to see the stock off as substantially as it is today, given those pre-limb numbers that you just went through, the fact that revenue actually coming in, they expect better than expected. $198 million adjusted EPS guidance to $0.38 or initial forecast was $31.33. But it looks like analysts have a lot of questions just about the new leadership at what $59 is going to look like looking out to 2023. All right, my play today is craft gaining a today after gold. And you can see it up just about 3 percent. When upgraded this stock to buy from neutral, lifted its price target to $43 to share from $37.26 percent upside from where it's currently trading. Now, Goldman, making the case that craft offers the highest free cash flow and dividend yields of their coverage within this space and that higher profit margins haven't fully been priced into this stock. Now, in a note to clients, the team wrote that the pace of share recovery is, quote, meaningfully slower than what they had initially anticipated in its market share. So well below those pre pandemic levels, year to date, date that coming has actually done relatively well when you take a look at the broader market. Your today, it's only off just around nearly 5 percent compared to the losses that we're seeing more broadly within this space and also with the broader market. So it looks like they think craft at least has an edge, a competitive edge in this space for now. Kind of a yeah, but note, right? I mean, I very rarely read an upgrade with the words relative valuation levels for staples are daunting. Now we've been richer than the onset of the last recession. Yeah, but they have that competitive advantage over their competitors. So though whether that storm, UBS upgraded them on Thursday as well. So they're not alone at Goldman. My play is Netflix shares up on a day.",https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yvHvxXHIc5I,79,2022-10-10 19:39:12
2966," They have that competitive advantage over their competitors. So though, whether that's storm, UBS upgraded them on Thursday as well. So they're not alone at Goldman. My play is Netflix shares up on a down day overall due to a no down from JP Morgan analyst Doug and Mew. He says the streaming giants upcoming and support ad supported tears, critical to re-accelerating revenue, expanding Netflix's serviceable available market and driving greater profitability. And with estimates, there will be 7.5 million ad supported subs in the U.S. and Canada. That generates 1.2 billion in 23 and 4.6 billion in additional revenue by 26, a 13% upside that JP Morgan analyst all has a neutral rating on the stock, a $240 price target. Netflix though has lost subs and back-to-back quarters for the first time ever. They'll report earnings one week from tomorrow. It shares down those 60 plus percent this year up on this news over 2%. A lot of people have a lot of high hopes for that ad supported tear. It is going to be all or nothing once that is implemented, Rochelle. No, it's very true. Netflix is really trying to reassure investors. We saw that ad age reporting the Netflix is tapping integral ad science and double verify to really help with these measurements when it comes to ads as well, trying to reassure investors because as you imagine, this is going to be real game change. After the subscriber number started to go down and all the other streamers jumped in as well, Netflix looking for this edge, looking for way to get perhaps billions in with some of these ad supported tears. So we'll have to see how it pans out and how much people are going to be willing to pay for each tear as well. A number of analysts bullish here, Elinick, Equity's, Oppenheimer, Evercore, all upgrading the stock over the last several weeks. So we'll see how it all pans out with our new ad supported tear. All right, coming up, early Facebook investor Roger McNeigh joins us to discuss Elon Musk, Twitter, the metaverse, and much more. I highly recommend the producers to seeinda. Kanye West getting suspended on social media over the weekend, both Twitter and Instagram moving to restrict his accounts following a string of anti-symmatic posts.",https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yvHvxXHIc5I,80,2022-10-10 19:43:21
2967," Kanya West getting suspended on social media over the weekend, both Twitter and Instagram moving to restrict his accounts following a string of anti-Semitic posts. Kanya was first locked out of Instagram, which prompted him to take to Twitter for the first time in two years. It's the latest test for social media companies' willingness to monitor hateful content on their sites. Joining us now for more on this we want to bring in Roger McNamy, elevation partners managing director and author of Zuck. Roger, it's great to see you again. Certainly there has been a large debate about content moderation. How social media companies should go about this. It's just from your perspective, what is this hellish in terms of where we are when it comes to policies and the handling of hate speech on these social media platforms? The context is that six years ago there was interference in the UK referendum around Brexit and then the US presidential election. Since then we've had ethnic cleansing in Myanmar. We've had extraordinary number of terrorist events. We've had the COVID pandemic and the undermining of the country's response to that. We've had the insurrection with stopped the steal. We've had extraordinary damage done to democracy, the public health, the public safety, the people's ability to make their own choices. And yet policy makers have done nothing. Absolutely nothing. And I think that the whole situation with Kanye West, with Elon Musk attempting to buy Twitter really highlights the extraordinary inaction. And frankly in my mind, really unpardonable inaction by Congress, by the President, to do something about what is clearly a threat, not just to safety in the country, but especially in national security. Twitter has a whistleblower who showed that there are people inside Twitter who are working for foreign governments. And for a platform that has as much influence on politics and democracy as Twitter has, that's extraordinarily dangerous. And so Roger, where does the conversation go in terms of accountability for those posting as well as those moderating and the pace at which they're able to monitor these things? So I'm not at all confident that we can fix this problem. There are three aspects of it. The first is the scale of the platforms. Facebook for example, where the worst offenses have taken place has literally billions of posts every day. So the notion that you're going to somehow effectively monitor that number of posts is a big stretch. The second problem is latency, the amount of time, even if you had enough moderators, even if the artificial intelligence worked, which it doesn't. But even if those things work perfectly, there's still going to be a lag. And the problem is the harm gets done in the first seconds after these harmful posts are put out. The third problem is one of incentives. And this is the one that's killing us because there is no reason from an economic perspective why these companies should look out for the safety of their users, much less protecting the country's national interest. Right now, the incentives are for them to make as much money as they can as quickly as they can and not worry about the consequences. And until that changes, I don't think there's a chance we're going to do anything good about this. There are exceptions when somebody's really, really bad. The way the Kanye West was this weekend, you will see politically it becomes impossible for these guys not to act, but the rest of the time they're going to do nothing. We'll see how long that ban lasts. Rodgers, you know California has acted when it comes to social media companies. And now section 230 at least is on the plate of the Supreme Court. How, if at all, do you think this could change the situation? You know, it's very, very hard to tell. Section 230 is incredibly important because what it does is it gives platforms the legal right to maintain the environment of their choosing. So that part of it's really, really good. Where I think things went off the rails is that the platforms chose because the economics were better to favor harmful content over good content. Basically hate speech, disinformation and conspiracy theories are extraordinarily profitable because they trigger flight or fight. So people have to pay attention. And in a business where attention is everything, that kind of content is going to rise to the surface repeatedly. So we have to change those incentives. I do not think 230 is the way to do that. I think the thing you have to do is to regulate the business market to Jasmine outside. Remember that's the big thing that a mayor who treats",https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yvHvxXHIc5I,81,2022-10-10 19:47:32
2968," eyes to the surface repeatedly. So we have to change those incentives. I do not think 230 is the way to do that. I think the thing you have to do is to regulate the business model, which is called surveillance capitalism, is this notion that you gather all the data about people and you use it to manipulate their choices and to manipulate their behavior. That must change. And we also have to have laws that require safety. The same way we require safety for transportation or healthcare or other things. We need to require safety around these platforms because the companies have to have an incentive to protect the people who use their systems. Roger from the conversations that you're having from people within the industry, from lawmakers, from what we're hearing, just from Capitol Hill. I guess how confident are you that we will actually see some change? And what does that mean then for some of the largest players in this space like meta and Twitter? I'm not at all confident. We are making progress, but it is incredibly slow in comparison to the damage that these companies are doing. And when I first started talking about this publicly in 2017, it was really obvious to me that that the issue was the culture, the business model and algorithms of platforms could undermine democracy and civil rights. I went to Congress in spring and summer of 2017 and then continued to push them to try to do something about it. More than five years have gone by. Several elections have gone by. An insurrection has gone by. A pandemic has been amplified. And yet nothing has been done. So I don't have a lot of confidence because the pressure from the public doesn't exist. And until people start saying, wait a minute, we rarely really value democracy. We really value our public health. We really value public safety. And we recognize that these companies are at danger. Nothing's going to happen. And Roger, as we saw with Twitter as they began badting people, we saw apps like Truth Social, some of these other more siloed avenues also pop up as well. What does that do to this picture when you're trying to monitor these different things but then having these different siloed platforms coming up as well? To be clear, I think that in the United States, people should be free to say the things that they feel and believe. But not all forms of speech are protected by the First Amendment. You're not allowed to yell fire in a crowded theater. You're not allowed to threaten elected officials. There are lines that people should not be allowed to cross. And the problem we have today is there is no enforcement of those lines. In fact, the lines, you know, I think everybody knows where they are. We just choose to not engage with it. And I don't know how we're going to solve that problem. I am hopeful. There is more progress today than there's been any time in the last five years. But it's so slow. And I do believe that politicians and frankly journalists and the citizens would rather not disrupt the convenience of the status quo to deal with hard problems like this. And I think it's a gigantic issue. And then there's the question Roger of what would Elon do? How will Elon Musk impact the situation you just described if and when he owns Twitter? So the exciting thing for investors is that it does appear that Elon Musk position in the Delaware Chance Record is very bad. So the odds of either a court decision or action by Musk to complete the deal are higher than they've been at any time in this process. And even if he finds a way to weasel out, it looks to me as though it's going to cost him more than just the breakup fee. So investors in Twitter are probably pretty well positioned in the short term. I can't say the same for America. I mean the problem with Twitter is they've done a horrible job for years in managing the discourse on the platform. And there's no evidence that Elon Musk has a plan to improve that. In fact, it's not clear what plan he has at all. And what has happened over the last couple of weeks is the disclosure by the court of the text conversations with prospective investors has been super embarrassing for those investors. And that creates some doubt about financing of the deal. And so I don't quite know how this is going to play out at the deal level. What I'm really worried about is that the company will go into a situation where not even investors will be able to have any influence on the outcome. And in that situation with somebody like Musk who seems to",https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yvHvxXHIc5I,82,2022-10-10 19:51:44
2969," situation where not even investors will be able to have any influence on the outcome. And in that situation with somebody like Musk, who seems to rejoice in trolling others and seems to think that trolling is like a really positive value, that for platform where all of politics, all of journalism, and all of celebrity, does its communication, that's just going to produce terrible outcomes. And certainly be tested again in the midterm elections coming up. A big thank you to Roger McNamee for joining us this afternoon. Thank you so much. Alright, coming up, online sports betting is looking less and less like a winning play in California. We'll tell you what companies like Fandall are doing about it. Next. Music Unlike what did or did not happen to Tom Brady, a showers day wishing to stop at Fred Davis Power in time by reaching largest Loan He할 on Saturday for two. But what did all the weed and weight you gave out during the weekend on the show were delivered to the sports gambling industry. The Wall Street Journal reporting draft kings and Fando hardware. To the real bloody I think this is an interesting moment here for drafting to the Fandall, right? So the journals reporting that drafting's in Fandall have pulled some ad spending in relation to Proposition 27 in California, which had to do with mobilizing or legalizing mobile sports gambling. And that really kind of comes from what we've seen from the polls though, guys. So a poll released last week from Cal Berkwee's Institute of Governmental Studies said that 53% of people planned to vote no, while only 27% planned to vote yes. That's two to one. That is not good a month out from this vote, right? And really the problem in California is there's two propositions. There's Prop 27, which draft kings, Fandall, Bed MGM are backing. And then there's Prop 26, which the tribes in California are backing for kind of brick and mortar betting. Sources have told me that's the problem, because it's hard for some in the industry to back both. You want to be able to back both in this industry. You want to be on both sides. And some of the lobbyists can't be on both sides. So how that's sort of impacting the stock here, you can see draft kings is down.",https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yvHvxXHIc5I,83,2022-10-10 19:56:45
2970," Back both. You want to be able to back both in this industry. You want to be on both sides. And some of the lobbyists can't be on both sides. So how that's sort of impacting the stock here. You can see draft kings is down over 13% today. And one other thing I want to add on that, I talked to Jen Kelly over at Oppenheimer. He said this could be long-term good for stocks like draft kings though. It will give them more time to get to profitability. A lot of these analysts see profitability in the end of Q4 next year. If you get to profitability quicker if you're drafting you have more money to spend on opening in California. Something to think about with the liquidity. That's what a lot of the bears think about here is that liquidity. It's an interesting twist there. I was going to say why if you didn't just explain that Pajashat. We also need to get to another big story in the gaming space today. When you look at the performance inside the S&P, some of the biggest decliner's today, when Las Vegas Sands moving to the downside on a rise in COVID cases in China. Talk to us just about why this is such a concern here for these companies. Yeah, if you take a look at the one-month chart of these two companies, when in Las Vegas Sands, it really tells you the story, right? We were talking two weeks ago about how it goes up because they think that there's going to be more opening in China. And then you see it goes down today because COVID cases are back. It's just kind of a lot of teetering and towering right now. And people don't really know where its headed city group cut their revenue forecast for gross gaming revenue in Macau today this morning. And I think that's part of why you're seeing those stocks down. But a lot of uncertainty when it comes to the casino stocks in China. You remember just overlay the COVID cases in China against the stock chart? Yeah, I think they tripled over the weekend. Josh, good to see you man. Thank you. Good stuff. Coming up, we're counting down to the closing bell on Wall Street. Stick with us right here on Yahoo Finance Law. All right. Just a couple of minutes away from the closing bell. Let's bring in Yahoo Finance this year. Blick read a breakdown today's market action. Hello, sir. Hello, not the best way to begin the week. But let's narrate it and has that down 1%. And let's get a two day rolling view. 10,575, 62 if it closes below that going to be the lowest since about the summer of 2020. And it looks like we're going to do that. So another negative headline about to be generated right here. Let's take a deep dive inside the market. Or it looks like we got a minute to go. We'll call this a shallow drive dive here to the spider sectors. We got staple.",https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yvHvxXHIc5I,84,2022-10-10 20:00:32
2971," and I get a headline about to be generated right here. Let's take a deep dive inside the market or it looks like we got a minute to go. We'll call this a shallow drive dive here to the spider sectors. We got staples in the lead, followed by industrials, materials and utilities. Those are the only ones in the green right now to the downside, energy taking up the rear spot here. That's down 2% followed by tech and real estate. You take a look at what the NASDAQ 100 is doing in some standouts, especially in the chips space with President Biden out cracking down on China once again and video down 3%. Software not doing much better. PayPal's down 6%. And let's get a check of the travel sector as well. Something a little bit non-correlated to tech. Here we see a mix board, but current will cruise lines down 5% win with that China exposure, down 12% Royal Caribbean, down 5% as we head into this closing dive. That wraps up today's trading action. Here to you look at all three of the major averages ending to the downside. The NASDAQ often just over 1% S&P off. 7% of a percent down off 93 points in terms of the sector action that Jared was just walking us through. Energy by far the worst performer in today's trading off just around 2%. We're also looking at losses from technology, real estate, and consumer discretionary. Let's talk about the recent market action and what we could expect going forward. For that, we want to bring in Deborah Cunningham, federated her knees, a chief investment officer of global liquidity markets. In Andrew Slimman, a Morgan Stanley investment management, senior portfolio manager. Andrew, let me start with you just in terms of the downside, I guess risk playing out in the market today. Once again, we are looking at losses. We saw a bit of optimism going back to a week ago today and what we saw in the trading action last Tuesday. How do you think things shake out from here between now and the end of the year? Well, I think near term, you have a very tough, competitive situation for equities, which is there's uncertainty about inflation. There's uncertainty about the Fed and there's uncertainty about earning. And on the meantime, you can go on by a two-year treasury at 4.3%. So it's tough for stock to really do well when assuredness of short-term yield curve looks pretty good. Later this year, if we get better inflation for it, so I think it's a better situation for equities. But I think it's tough near term that continues to weigh in the market. And there are as you mentioned some of that Fed uncertainty. To what degree is the Fed contributed to a lot of the uncertainty about really the path ahead that investors are now concerned about? Well, certainly I agree that inflation is ruling the roost from a standpoint of what the Fed's actions are. I think to some degree, they were very late in the game in the context of sticking with their thought that this was transitory until really just a year ago, the fourth quarter of 2021. So what you now have is a Fed, I think, that's continuing to play catch-up. And people look at mortgage rates and they say, oh, my goodness, they've doubled. And how are people, what is this going to do to the housing market? Or they look at short-term interest rates and say, just what we just heard, 4.3% for a very short-term government risk, yet when you look at something other than the last 10 to 12 years since the financial crisis, I mean, that was sort of more the norm from an interest rate perspective with inflation much less than it is today. So we got used to something with a low inflationary rate and to some degree, a zero premium over that low inflation rate that just is not continuing now. And we don't really see an end to it in the near term. So I think the Fed is in unison, whether it's chair Powell, whether it's the governors, whether it's the other voting members of the FOMC. They're in unison saying, this is our chief concern. And we are going to continue to battle this by increasing rates and releasing bonds off the...",https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yvHvxXHIc5I,85,2022-10-10 20:04:47
2972," our chief concern and we are going to continue to battle this by increasing rates and releasing bonds off the balance sheet. Both ways trying to quantitatively tighten as well as with monetary policy, tighten from an interest rate standpoint. I don't really see an end to that at this red hot moment. They're hoping for a good future. The first day, Andrew Hurricane Jamie Diamond out with his latest 69 months, the federal tippes in the recession. The markets have another 20% to fall. Your thoughts? Well, this has been the story all year. The economy has proven to be stronger than what people expected. The next day, the economy has been growing for a few months ago with all due respect. I think the real question is will it come to fruition if it does not. You know, stocks will recover. I can imagine that the tightening that the fed's done will continue. We'll not affect the stock market at some point. But the key point in maybe the stock market is, you know, there's so many stocks down 40, 50, 60%. That they're already reflecting a recession. I understand the S&P isn't at the cap-weighted index. That's because there's a few big stocks. They're only down 20% or last. But there are a lot of stocks that are reflective. I don't see that as tremendous downside for most stock could be for the S&P cap-weighted. Dipper, what do you think? How do you think this sets us up heading into earning season? We're starting to get a lot of the tech things over the next couple of weeks. When it comes to the surging dollar, the uncertainty when it comes to the fed. How do you see that impacting this round of earnings? We've been surprised quarter after quarter with earnings that we thought we were going to soften. We thought we were going to turn down. In fact, they have held out very large-scale earnings in the market. They're large global entities with lots of diversification that is working in their favor during this challenging time from an economic perspective. But that can only hold out for so long. Our expectations continues to be heading into the fourth quarter that we're going to see impact on earnings which ultimately then has a broader effect in the context of the earnings. So, we're going to see what the consequences of the issuers themselves. In this environment, you say we buy, fit, and sell greed. What does that mean in terms of the investment strategy right now? Well, I mean, the only consistency to my business right is the emotional element that brought the equity prices. Things swing to extreme. The first thing that I think of the first is that the first one was buying the travel leisure stock right into the mid to the pandemic when they prices, if no one was ever going to leave their house. Then energy futures went negative and boil boy now. Everyone loves energy. And then fast forward today, I think the fear is consumer sentiment is that of all time low. And those are those things that I think are going to be the most important part of the economy. But I don't think it's going to be tomorrow, but consumer sentiment is going to improve. But as I said before, a lot of consumer discretionary stock already priced in a recession. So, if in fact we do see some improvement, those stocks could have a lot of upside. I think greed, if flip-side, is going to be the top. I just think that there was more upside in other areas as that area has garnered and attracted a lot of money. So selling fear is all, I'm sorry, buying fear is all provide upside with the right time, probably more than",https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yvHvxXHIc5I,86,2022-10-10 20:09:16
2973, acted a lot of a lot of money. So selling fears all I'm sorry buying fears all provide up to with the right time for a more than trying to get involved with a group that's very crowded. In devil a big thank you to our market panel Deborah Cunningham and Adry Slimman thank you both for joining us this afternoon. All right coming up as the Biden administration is ramping up its battle with China over chips. A next guest says microchips are the new oil stay tuned to find out why.. Chips ox selling off today sending recent losses and video AMD Intel applied materials all hitting 52 week lows. Now US restrictions on China's access to chips and dire demand forecast. Ok those concerns out there that the sectors downturn may be longer and deeper than we initially thought. We want to bring Chris Miller the Fletcher School at Tufts Assistant Professor of International History and author of the chip war the fight for the world's most critical technology. Chris it's great to see you so these new curves from the Biden administration obviously adding to that bear sentiment out there on the street. I know you have been very closely tracking this global fight when it comes to chips. I guess what's your perspective of the new limitations that we got from the Biden administration? Well they are a sweeping set of restrictions on the sale of certain advanced chips to China as well as a whole set of chip making technologies that are really going to restrain China's advances in this sphere for some time to come. It will limit kind of ability for example to build out advanced data centers and deploy artificial intelligence. The risk of course that it also spurs China to invest even more in domesticating its own chip technology but for at least,https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yvHvxXHIc5I,87,2022-10-10 20:13:14
2974," centers and deploy artificial intelligence. And the risk, of course, that it also spurs China to invest even more in domesticating its own tip technology. But for at least the next couple of years, China will find it very difficult to get around these rules. They'll hurt some US shipforms with will hurt China even more. And what about just the risk of retaliation, too, right? As we have this escalating tension between the US and China? What's certainly a possibility we can't rule it out? It is worth noting, I think, that in the past when the US has rolled out comparable restrictions in terms of the transfer of tax to Chinese firms, like when the US restricted the sale of chips to Huawei in 2020, China did nothing in retaliation. So if that's any guide, China might not do much this time, of course. This is a more dramatic action than even the assault on Huawei in 2020. So it's possible China could change course. But the reality is that China still needs US chip, even though certain types of chips are no longer possible to sell the China, China spends more money importing chips than it spends importing oil. And that's been the case for the past decade. And so the Chinese realize they're in a weak position here. They've got, have acted chips made in the US or chips made in Taiwan or South Korea that are based on US technology. And unless the Commerce Department of the United States gives them approval, that all could be cut off. Well, and Chris, going off with that, the fact that China has spent more on chips than they have spent on oil. I guess just in terms of what is the potential fallout when we start to think about the economic consequences of this? Well, there are some foreign companies that will be hit US chip firms or chip makers in Taiwan, for example. But the biggest impact will be felt by China's own tech firms because for a long time, investors have been betting that Chinese firms in the AI space, for example, or in chip making will be able to continue to import technology from the US and other Western countries that they need to improve their capabilities. And now all of that is being called into question. The chip war has really escalated. And now it's not clear that China is going to have access to the most advanced data center technologies for the next couple of years and maybe the next decade. So in that sense, the US is really putting the choke on China's event, computing capabilities, and Chinese firms that had hoped to roll out artificial intelligence across their operations will face more and more limitations than that regard. Because the cost of AI will be very expensive, very power-intensive without the most advanced chips. And as of last week's action, China will be unable to access these semiconductors. It's clearly a massive headwind and challenge here for China. In terms of creating their own semiconductor industry, obviously, they like far behind when you compare it to where we are here in the US. How long do you think it will potentially take them to catch up? We're talking at least a fair number of years and potentially over a decade. They actually may never catch up, given the amount of capital investment involved, given the really specialized machine tools that today can only be bought from the US or Japan or the Netherlands. Today, China is a big player in the electronics market, but when it comes to chips, China is less than 10% of value at across the industry. And so if we're trying to domesticate all of this technology, it's really extraordinarily difficult and expensive prospects, which is why they've been very openly relying on chip-making technologies, as well as that chips from abroad for some time. This is not an industry you can just build from scratch overnight. Well, Chris, speaking of, I guess, of the expense of it, the cost of it to build out your own semiconductor industry. How does that compare to other sectors here in the US, just in terms of the cost and what it's going to take in order to potentially have an industry that's comparable to what we have here in the US? Well, the cost is really extraordinary. A new chip-making facility that's producing processor chips and memory chips can cost $20 billion, making them the most expensive factories in human history. There's really almost nothing that compares to a facility that's able to manufacture billions and billions of transistors each one smaller than a coronavirus. This is the most complicated, precise manufacturing in history, which is why the race to dominate this sector is so intense and so expensive. And we've seen earlier iterations of the chip war between different companies. That's why I called the book the chip war. And we found that only a couple of companies have been able to keep up thus far all relying on US and Japanese technology in particular.",https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yvHvxXHIc5I,88,2022-10-10 20:18:01
2975," that called the book The Chip War. And we found that only a couple of companies have been able to keep up thus far all relying on US and Japanese technology in particular. So for Canada to do this from scratch about access to foreign technology, would just be very tough. Well, this is clearly a priority here for the Biden administration recently passing the Chips Act of Move here in order to try and entice chip makers to manufacture chips here within the United States. I guess what's key in terms of making sure that this actually succeeds here in the US? I think it's pretty clear we're going to have more manufacturing of chips in the US. Thank to the incentive, $40 billion worth of incentives provided by the Chips Act. But the reality is that today, 90% of the most advanced processor chips can only be made in Taiwan. And so even despite that, we're spending more money to entice chip makers to build new facilities here, we're still going to be reliant on Taiwan to build our most advanced chips for some time to come. The Chips Act is a good idea. I think I support the legislation. But we need to be realistic about what it can accomplish. Given that one advanced facility can cost $20 billion, $40 billion only gets us so far in an industry where capital investment is just very expensive. It's a good point there. Chris Miller, great to have you author of Chip War, the fight for the world's most critical technology. Thanks so much for joining. Our convests, Kathy Wood, taking aim at the Federal Reserve at a new open letter saying the central bank has shocked not just the US, but the world and raised the risks of a deflationary bust. Alexander Semenova is here with more. Not entirely clear what prompted her to write this letter. What is she else to she saying? What does she want the Fed to do? Well, Dave, for starters, if Kathy Wood has something to say you better believe that she will find a creative way to get her messaging across, this time, she had something to say to Federal Reserve officials. So she did the most Kathy Wood things she can do and penned an open letter to the US central bank. She argued that they're making a big mistake by overhiking rates and that FOMC members are using lagging indicators to dictate their policy decisions, specifically citing employment and what she referred to as a downstream inflation and said that overhiking rates risks a deflationary bust. Now, even as key price measures like CPI and PCE continue to come in stubbornly high, she insists that declining prices in some commodities like lumber and copper actually suggest that we're heading toward deflation. She also notes that the Monthly Jobs report which again showed robust hiring last month isn't telling the full story and pointed to increasing jobless claims and job openings. Now, obviously the speculative text docs that comprise ARC and invest ETFs are taking a big hit from the Federal Reserve. So she's continuously been sending this message across, but the point here is that what she says in the letter is not that far off now from Wall Street appears to be thinking as well, which is that the Fed is overshooting now. She made a point that rising food prices are caused by the war in Ukraine and that these are factors that the Fed can't actually resolve by tightening monetary policy. Now, the interesting thing is BlackRock actually had a similar message. They also said that the Fed is trying to combat factors that are contributing to inflation, that they can't fix with raising interest rates. So when you have ARC invest and BlackRock on the same page, that's pretty significant here. Three straight 75s, safe to say we're gonna hear from her again after what looks like a fourth 75 point hike in a row, Alexander Seminova. Thank you, great stuff.

2977," when gas prices soared and hit $5 this year, consumer confidence went exactly the other way and just about the same proportion and then consumer confidence improved as gas prices declined. We are now seeing upward pressure again on gasoline prices. We were talking last week about this production cut that the OPEC plus nations announced that Saudi Arabia plus Russia and a bunch of others mostly in the Middle East. That is already putting upward pressure on gasoline prices and I think the Biden administration is going to be desperate to keep gas prices at least on an average basis below $4 by the time of the midterm elections on November 8. That release of oil from the US strategic reserve was supposed to end in October but without saying much about it, the Biden administration has now extended some amount of oil releases into November time clearly at the midterm elections and it's also possible they could release a little bit more oil just to keep gas prices down leading up to November 8. There is not a lot of Biden can do on this but that's one thing to look for as for overall inflation. We have one more report coming on that this week and we will see what that has to say about what prices are like and how the Federal Reserve is likely to respond. There was one costly fist bump with MBS in the long term. One of the inability for the Biden administration that will really forever haunt them Rick no matter what the issue is is an inability to sell anything in particular infrastructure and a lot of their accomplishments. What do you expect the final push to be from the Biden administration on their achievements? I think they are going to keep it simple Dave I think it's going to be 10 million jobs and then Biden gives a speech he gets into the fine print the fine print is yes we pass the inflation reduction act if it's called the inflation reduction act though why is an inflation lower. He's got some explaining to do on that he did pass some bills and I think voters on the margins do give him credit for getting some of those things done. You can see it if you get deep into the polling data but Americans just don't feel like things are going right and I think that when inflation is hot you know we forgot about the corrosive impact that inflation can have on consumer attitudes because we haven't had to deal with this really since the late 1970s. We're getting a reminder all over again that inflation is really ruinous it put it in a side to put in addition to reducing purchasing power and basically shrinking people's paychecks it just puts everybody in an nasty mood. So I think we have to see inflation come down to the range of 5% before voters start to feel better about it and there's no way that's going to happen by November. No way indeed thanks as always our very own Rick Newman thanks for joining us. Well after a series of legal challenges in recent weeks student borrowers are wondering when they'll be able to apply for President Biden's debt forgiveness program. White House says applications will open any day now and the Department of Education has shared some new information about eligibility. Well your finances will be joined us now with the details so Ronda what can borrowers expect now. Well this application releases like an album drop no one knows everyone's been reaching out to the Department of Education to the White House. You don't know so it's going to be one of these things we're unfortunately borrowers are going to be finding out probably via tweet like we did about loan forgiveness and even though the education department says that they've short up their website so it won't crash. I think this will be it in an edbreaker one of the things that borrowers need to understand is even though the loan application should come out any day in October it is highly recommended that if this long forgiveness package doesn't wipe out all your debt. That you try to complete the application by November why because forbearance ends December 31st and you resume payments in January so you want to apply early to allow your loan servicer enough time to recalculate your balance and give you your new monthly payment. You have until the end of 2023 to apply but the longer you wait the longer it takes to process so particularly if you have outstanding debt after loan forgiveness be sure to apply early. Now the other thing is people have had questions that 125 income.",https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yvHvxXHIc5I,91,2022-10-10 20:30:47
2978," and just be sure to apply early. Now, the other thing is people have had questions that 125 income cap is at AGI. We are hearing from sources that is based on your adjusted gross income. So that could change too, because there again, it hasn't been confirmed, sources say. So that's another thing. One thing that borrowers need to understand. It is not enough for you to simply go on the website and sign up for the subscription notification. You need to go on the studentaid.gov site, and make sure that your account information is in the system properly. Well, that's lots of great stuff. Hopefully everyone's screenshot it some of those dates there so they can keep track. Everyone, make sure you do that. And hopefully the website holds up as well. Rondelly, thanks so much. Guys. All right, a small advocacy group of the job creators and network foundation filing a new lawsuit aimed at halting President Biden's student debt program, the latest in a series of similar suits that we have seen in recent weeks. Shahoe Finance is Alexis Keenan. Drinks is now with the details on that. Hey, Alexis. Hi, Shana. To Rondis' point about doing this early pay attention, because this lawsuit and the others like it, could have some bearing on whether or not people actually get their hands on this money that they may be eligible for. So this particular case coming from job creators network, it is an advocacy group for small business, but it's got two named plaintiffs in the lawsuit. One of these plaintiffs is eligible for the, or partially eligible for the forgiveness. The other one, not eligible at all. So this is filed in the federal district court for the Northern District of Texas. And they're saying that at the heart of the case, that this executive order coming from President Biden to offer this forgiveness, that it violates the American Procedures Act. Now, that act requires notice and comment periods for certain rule makings, but whether it applies the executive orders that has perhaps not been challenged in this type of case. Now, the plaintiffs say that the forgiveness eligibility is arbitrary. They say it's unequal, that the measures adopted by the administration and where to draw those lines about AGI, adjusted gross income, and other factors that determine whether you're eligible. They say that those are just unequal and arbitrary. Also, these plaintiffs say that the universities should really be the ones that are held accountable for prices being so high and for students being in the position that they're in today. They also say that the order is really just a ploy to drum up support for November elections. But look, there is a stay that these plaintiffs are requesting. So what that means is they want this forgiveness to be put on hold while their lawsuit is pending. And that could be a problem because if a court grants that, then that would perhaps bring to a halt the government dishing out this money to the eligible recipients. So as Rhonda said, those single filers will be allowed to apply when this application comes out up to $125,000 married in head of household filers up to $250,000. Guys, certainly an important story to continue to watch right. Alexis Keenan, thanks so much. Coming up, the world mental health day, the CEO of Headspace Health, that tells us how it's trying to get people get the ball rolling when it comes to taking care of their own mental health. It joins us next......",https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yvHvxXHIc5I,92,2022-10-10 20:35:17
2979," Pike Today is World Mental Health Day, a day for raising awareness of mental health issues and giving us all an opportunity to rekindle our efforts to make mental health a priority. Headspace Health CEO, Russ Glass, with us now to talk about this. Good to see you, sir. The numbers are staggering. 20% of employees, according to Gallup, 20% are engaged at work. I don't know if this is the quiet quitting trend or not. Are employers doing enough to help with mental health? Clearly, they're not. I think that we saw a big spike during the pandemic where employers realized they had to focus on this. They didn't have a choice. But 25% of employees tell us now that the focus on it has gone down. That employers aren't as focused on it right now. And yet what we see is that the mental health pandemic is not slowing down, right? Even though maybe the actual pandemic, the COVID pandemic is slowing down. We're seeing a continued acceleration in need. And that's what World Mental Health Day is all about. It's how do we make sure people understand that this is still a critical need, that we need to be focusing on it. And our mission is how do we transform the mental health space to break down some of these barriers that people face in getting mental health care today? Because once there is this recognition about mental health, but it doesn't seem to translate perhaps into what some of these businesses could or should be doing. Or is there a discount also between people feeling comfortable enough using the resources that their companies are offering as well? Well, let's start with the facts. The World Health Organization estimates there's about a billion people that have a diagnosed mental health condition. And 60% of them are not getting care. And that's because of access issues. They can't find providers. It's because of cost issues. It's just too expensive when they do find a provider. And then there's all kinds of stigma issues. People are still not comfortable saying, hey, I have an issue that I really need help with. And so employers have to recognize that they have a huge percentage of their employees that are struggling right now. Some estimates are about 40% of employees are struggling with mental health. We have seen that 50% of employees are thinking about leaving work because of mental health issues right now. And so we know employers have to be focused on it. We are trying to raise awareness today.",https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yvHvxXHIc5I,93,2022-10-10 20:39:43
2980," thinking about leaving work because of mental health issues right now. And so we know employers have to be focused on it. We are trying to raise awareness today. We are running live meditations throughout the week. We're doing, ask me anything for our client base, our 4,000 companies around the world that are accessing our mental health care. We did a partnership with 24 hour fitness to create the environment for their, uh, members to access this. We did a partnership with Pinterest. We're really trying to create awareness so that employers realize this is something you have to invest in and it'll drive positive return on investment in addition to supporting their employees. And certainly is very critical and very important. You're given the numbers that you were just citing. Russ, when it comes to what companies are doing, things that do work, we've talked about mental health days. We know Nike had given all their employees a week off. And hopefully other companies are setting aside and needing free times. What's your advice just in terms of what companies can do throughout the year to make sure that they are staying on top of this? Great question. Few things. One is make sure that the leaders of the company are talking about it. If, if, if the leaders are willing to say, Hey, you know, I've had anxiety throughout my career. I've had to manage issues like this. It helps destigmatize it for everybody else. So that's number one, find leaders that are willing to talk about it. Two then is provide training for leadership for managers. One of the most uncomfortable things is having a conversation and saying, Hey, how are you doing and being afraid of the answer? Right? Someone says to you, Yeah, you know, I'm actually feeling pretty depressed. And you as a manager, don't know how to respond to that. That can be super uncomfortable. So what we find is managers don't, don't talk about it. So provide training. We're, we're providing leadership workshops, for example, the help companies figure out like, how do we have these conversations? And then number three, make sure employees understand what's available to them. What we find is 94% of CEOs say they're doing enough for mental health. Only 67% of employees agree. That's a huge gap. And mostly we believe it's due to communication that it launches once. They never talk about it again. And when an employee really needs it, they don't know it's available for them. So communication, constant reinforcement of these, these resources being available. Maybe I can help with stigma. I struggled daily with anxiety. I have no problem admitting that I meditate every single day. It helps to see world mental health day trending on Twitter all day, which tells you maybe the stigma is changing a little bit. Cost and access to the two other factors that you mentioned. What can be done about those? Well, we're trying to do a few things. One is we've launched a few programs today. One is our referral program where anybody with a headspace account can now refer to as many friends as they want for 30 days free. So that's launching today. We are also creating a my headspace campaign. And people can share their stories via social media. But they can talk about how they have handled their own anxiety, depression, mental health issues and what they've done to help solve it. Just help people feel like they're not alone out there. To your point, I love the fact that you're willing to talk about it. And because everybody has mental health, everybody needs to think about this. And the more that we can feel comfortable talking about it, the better. More broadly, we have to think about creating more resource for our communities, particularly those who are underserved. How do we get resources into those communities? You know, today, 50% of US counties have zero mental health providers within county lines. We just can't continue to operate this way. And that's where we're really focused. How do we drive up the amount of care that can be delivered per therapist, psychiatrists, provider that's out there? Definitely feeling those shortages. My dad is a psychiatrist, he retired and came back because there is such a need. So appreciate the work that you're doing and all our mental health providers out there. Thank you so much for us, glass. All right, well, coming up, hello, Alice is looking to help small businesses across the US grow.

We're looking to help small businesses across the US grow. We're looking to help small businesses across the US grow. We're looking to help small businesses across the US grow. We're looking to help small businesses across the US grow. We're looking to help small businesses across the US grow. We're looking to help small businesses across the US grow. There seems to be one unanimous truth about starting a small business. It is hard. We're looking to help small businesses grow by offering funding, education and opportunities to entrepreneurs. We're joining us now is Elizabeth Gore, hello Alice co-founder president along with Russell Jackson, restaurant owner and chef of reverence. Thank you both for joining me today. Elizabeth for people who are trying to get familiar with what your company does. How do you serve small businesses and how does the pandemic change that? It's great to be with you all. At hello Alice, we help ensure the financial health of any small business. We help you access credit, grants, information, technical assistance and most of all each other. You can learn from people like Chef Jackson who is with us today. We are here at hello Alice all about your financial health. Russell speaking of health, I mean six months before the COVID pandemic hit, you came out of retirement and opened your restaurant. I can't even imagine once the pandemic started to take hold what it was like to try and access capital in those very early stages. Walk us through that. Yeah, what was I thinking, right? I've been trying to say the least, I think that for myself as a 40 year professional actually coming out of your time and to do this, I'd never spent a single day, a single hour training to every day a day? Okay.",https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yvHvxXHIc5I,95,2022-10-10 20:47:46
2982," And for myself as a 40 year professional, actually coming out of your time and to do this, I'd never spent a single day as single hour training for what we've been through for the last two years. And thanks to Hello Allis, I mean first and foremost, they were the first people to step in beyond Nick, Nicholas and Talk to step up and help us. And if it wasn't for Hello Allis, I wouldn't be standing inside this building today. So I'm very fortunate and blessed that we found them and they found us, I guess. I mean, it seems like it's a very well-matched pair here. And Russell, I do want to just follow up because obviously a lot of restaurants struggling with things like labor shortages. We're seeing wages go up. People still trying to compete for staff. How's that affecting your business at the moment? Well, this restaurant was purpose built and we built it around the idea of creating the best efficiencies that we could. So we're a small, small house. Right now we currently got three full-time staff members and two part-time staff members. And we can provide a high level of Michelin level service and high-profile dining, a tasting menu program that you, you know, we can compete with the big boys and going in with that thought and having to deal with some of the ups and downs, we're plagued by it like the rest. You know, we've had difficulties with supply chain. We've had difficulties, we're having difficulties with inflation. Scalp for a great example, we're 16 to 20 dollars a pound, pre-pandemic. They're not, they at the height during the pandemic were $60 a pound wholesale for the quality that we deal with. Yeah, wow. This is an understatement. Should have seen the bill on that one. And, you know, we've worked very, very hard to manage our way through this entire process. And again, without the advice and the support of some teams like Hello Alice, I mean, we had a tremendous amount of difficulty getting into and getting our second PPP alone. And if we were waiting for them stepping in and advocating for us and giving us a path to that, we wouldn't have had that amount of money that helped us to bridge the gap to sort of the next early path as we've been going through all this. And don't, don't misunderstand pandemics not over. We're still reeling, you know, small businesses and especially small restaurants are still violently struggling to survive on a day-to-day basis. You know, you may drive by and see a place full, but I'll tell you, for every one place that you see full, there are 50 that are empty. And so, yeah, I mean, Elizabeth, I want to bring you in here because obviously there's a lot of restaurants and companies that you work with. And I know that you recently teamed up with Square to really explore some of the challenges and some of the unique opportunities that Hispanic businesses face. Talk about some of the findings from that study and what you hope to really achieve with that as you try and get more funding and more opportunities for Hispanic business owners. Well, Hello Alice, we are left, you know, on company ourselves. And so we obviously take great pride in women, people of color, US veterans who are leading our companies. And the Hispanic community has over 5 million businesses with 800 billion contributing to our economy. However, we continue to see a huge lack of equitable access to credit, business loans, and then, you know, the things that are hitting every small business owner like inflation, as Chef said, hiring issues and so on. So if you're really going to help these, I love the way Chef says, Lily Pads hopped for one capital continuum to the next. We really have to put forward more equitable access to capital. So what Square and Hello Alice found is that grants are still critically important. So government grants, philanthropic grants, and small business owners. Second is access to credit solutions like operational credit. We are big fans of secured credit as well. And then finally, cashflow is king. So how are we helping small business owners with technical assistance on the Hello Alice platform, ensuring money in and money out is a smart use of funds. But I will tell you the other thing we found in the Latinx Hispanic community.",https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yvHvxXHIc5I,96,2022-10-10 20:52:31
2983," the full assistance on the HELLOAS platform, ensuring money in and money out is a smart use of funds. But I will tell you the other thing we found in the Latinx Hispanic community is this huge sense of optimism. They're opening companies three times at the rate of their white male counterparts. It is an exciting time. There's also an increase sense of spend around software solutions. So there's, I think we are betting on the right groups when we look at women and people of color, particularly the black and Hispanic community. And also congratulations on teaming up with Mastercard and first national bank of Omaha as well. The way it comes to business credit because I know that is not easy. And we'll have to leave it there with a big thank you Elizabeth Gaw and Russell Jackson, chef. Great to have you on both of you. Thank you so much. I'm busy. Thank you. Appreciate it. For sure. All right, coming up the new battle for streaming platforms. Family friendly content. We have a closer look just ahead. All right. All right. Well, it's talk streaming now. Hulu raising subscription prices today. Yahoo. Finances. Ali canal here with the details. How much Ali? Yeah, Dave. So these price hides they were first announced back in August, but today they are hitting those subscriptions. So here's where you're looking at if you're a Hulu subscriber. Add supported will now cost $7.99 a month. That's up from the previous $6.99. Whereas the ad free version will run two bucks more 1499 versus 1299. Now that bundled plan that also includes Disney plus and ESPN plus that's safe for now, but it will see a price increase later this year. Now price X of course, they're not uncommon for these streaming platforms Netflix, Hiked prices in January, Hulu had a previous price hike around the same time last year. And with analyst hyper focused on profitability, this is one way to increase that revenue per user. However, the one issue is that these platforms always run the risks of increased churn. So that's something that we're going to be monitoring moving forward. But for now, if you're a Hulu subscriber, you're paying just a bit more today. And Ali, we know the box office saw some so, so, so sort of lukewarm results for Sony's Li容ide L<|fr|><|translate|> cozy and All Night People's Wat Stillers ignites you. Wast It Lost Love我知道 ®",https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yvHvxXHIc5I,97,2022-10-10 20:57:08
2984," the loser subscriber you're paying just a bit more today. And Ali, we know the box office saw some so, so, so, sort of lukewarm results for Sony's Liolile crocodile. So how does that add to the shaky outlook for some of these family-friendly titles that they get? Yeah, it's a much different landscape for these types of movies. Liolile saw a box office haul this weekend of 11.5 million. It had a production budget of 50 million. So not the best debut, especially as we often see attendance levels drop off as the weeks go on. And I think honestly, it's just a reflection of this post pandemic, theatrical environment. There are only going to be 14 family-friendly movies in 2022. We have two more to go before the end of the year. And that's a pretty significant dip versus 24 of those titles that we saw in 2019. And one big reason for that is that this genre is moving over to streaming. Paramount plus, Disney plus, even Netflix have heavily invested in this type of content in some cases, spending a heck of a lot of money to secure these types of films, focus, focus to on Disney plus was a big one recently. Disenchanted coming soon on Netflix. We'll have the school for good in evil out next week. And moving forward, I think it's just going to be a conscious decision on the part of studios when it comes to where these movies go. Streaming or the theater? Are you leaving money on the table going right to streaming or some of these movies better suited for the theatrical? I think that's going to be a constant question and there's going to be a lot more experimentation moving forward. It's true. Everyone's still trying to figure it out. A big thank you, Ali. Can now. Thanks so much. I mean, I know for me when it comes to some of these streaming things, especially kids movies, you figure you pay for the one subscription. You've got your treats at home.

I'm like, if I can get it at home. Yeah, I mean, it's not a question that I am going to streaming route here. I mean, I would have done this even if the pandemic didn't happen and people didn't get more used to just streaming movies in their own home. I had never really been a huge fan of going to the movies, but from a parents perspective, bringing my kids to the movies, it's going to be a huge cost-saver. How expensive is it for the movies?

2989," Given that you've seen this before, you've seen this in the past, but for crypto this time and the amount of holdings that you do have, do you plan on kind of selling any of that, liquidating any of that in order to just sure up the coffers of cash in order to make sure that your businesses can also navigate. You know, we luckily sold over a billion dollars of stuff last year at better prices and certainly don't want to get into the business of burning the furniture to run the business. And so we're going to try to manage our business towards what we think our rational revenue targets. Listen, revenue is coming down in the industry. Volumes are down. Excitement is down in this winter could last longer than people think it might be shorter. It's hard, it's hard to predict when these crypto winners, how long they go. We're a couple years from a having cycle, I do think the fed flinching creates some enthusiasm around Bitcoin as a store of value Bitcoin as a recession as an inflation hedge as a hard money when the rest of the world keeps printing money. But we're going to manage our business to what we think is a rational revenue stream for our five operating businesses is trying to try to keep the balance sheet separate. If we sort of think of the 19th period in the 1960s to 1980 for the stock market is sort of a worst case scenario for what this bear market could look like across the equities market and crypto. I was sort of curious, you know, how do you think a crypto investor should operate in this environment that period of time sort of likened as sort of excellent for stock pickers. What do you think? How are you evaluating crypto currencies? Yeah, listen, in some ways, this is the most challenging macro environment for any investor. And if you had all the foresight of the sages, you would have just been in US dollar cash all year long, right when the whole world was saying cash is trash, cash is trash was time to just go long, you know, one week T bills and wait or go short markets. We're in a mess globally, right? Japan has got a monster imbalance, intervening in their currency market while supporting an interest rate market as inflation slowly creeps higher. That is a potential real problem. You saw what happened in the UK and they're trying to get this genie back in the box. But once confidence breaks down, it's really hard to get it back. And so what the Fed is doing is trying to preserve confidence in the US system. Now what they need. And we'll see if you get it is a Congress that is willing to take some pain. And politicians are not normally coded to take pain, right? So you already see in France, hey, we're going to do a hundred billion dollar subsidy because energy prices are too high. And hence that's driving inflation. So we're going to give more money to the system, like that's counter intuitive. I understand where it comes from people are suffering. And as you use printed dollars or printed euros in this case, you know, it creates this inflation cycle. And so it's a really treacherous market, you know, could the S&P what's it 30, whatever, 3600 today, could it end the year at 3,300, 3,300, and it looks like where the chart would go. And part about these environments is they don't get there straight line, right? There is a tremendous amount of fear in the market right now. And so like on Monday, we already saw 6% rally in it got reversed. It doesn't feel to me that the stock market lowers in that we're going to have more pain before we we see clear sailing. And, you know, there is a chance that even when the Fed thinks it's finished. And if the if the federal government doesn't tighten its belt and starts feeling this populism surge, you know, the cycle picks up again. And so I would say for now until the next, you know, until further notice, at least 12 months, these are going to be really complicated markets to trade and complicated money markets to make money in. And in some ways, just preserving your wealth is a huge win right not actually having monster gates.",https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9GS0SPvxP2s,1,2022-10-11 13:55:56

Appreciate the conversation as well as Yahoo Finance's own David Hollerith. Thank you both. Thanks, guys. Coming up, everyone, Jared Blyckery of Yahoo Finance is going to break down the Lake Is Market Action as investors brace for Ernie season. That's next. Coca-Cola getting high marks from its presentation and crowd sizes at the annual National Association of Convenience Store Conference. Now that has peaked the interest of Sasi ahead of Coca-Cola's earnings release. That's going to be on October 25th. That's where we find the stake today, South. We do here. We find other secure conferences like the National Convenience Store Conference in like bringing these reports to life. So shout out to Evercore ISI analyst Robert Ottenstein, which puts together a report of what Coca-Cola did there. It looks like Robert went to the event. It was well, well traffic. Let's fire off some photos here because you're looking at the next generation of Coca-Cola on many respects. You're seeing a smart coffee machine on screen right now that is a new cost of brand that they bought a couple years ago. You're seeing them also innovate more with new cans. You're seeing now that Coke freestyle machine up to now 200 different flavor options there. And then one of my phase right here, the body armor brand which Coke bought now coming in 28 ounce bottles with 140 milligrams of caffeine. Sign me up for all that stuff. So again, I think you would see a more focused Coca-Cola right here really starting.",https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9GS0SPvxP2s,2,2022-10-11 14:00:05
2991," In 28 ounce bottles with 140 milligrams of caffeine, sign me up for all that stuff. So again, I think you're seeing a more focused cocoa color right here, really starting to bring or crank up its innovation engine into next year. Now why is all this important? Why should we care about what's happening at the National Convenient Store conference as it pertains to cocoa color? While a couple stats on the board here, Convenient Store has a count for about 10 to 14% of coax North America sales. Convenient Store has a count for about 15 to 20% of coax North America profits. A large presence there, of course. And approximately half of the US adult population shops each day at a convenience store and likely buys something from a cocoa color. And of course, it's main rival PepsiCo, which will be getting their earnings out tomorrow morning. Overall, speaking of earnings, cocoa color will report earnings in a couple weeks. I whipped up a nifty checklist here if you guys do store away as you prepare for this earnings report. The strong dollar may hammer sales and profits. Of course, cocoa is a global player and they will very much likely to be exposed, exposed to that strong dollar, just like we heard from Nike a couple weeks ago when they reported. Consolation brands, we just talked to CEO Bill Nulens. Their earnings were strong, suggest that increased mobility might have helped cocoa color as well. Our price increases sticking. We saw from Konagra when they reported earnings in McCormick last week. Food companies are pushing through price increases. And for right now, they appear to be sticking. Good thing for margins. And last but not least, any signs of inflation rolling over. I mentioned that Konagra report last week. There were signs that inflation was starting to cool down a little bit. And my take here, more focused cocoa is ultimately a good thing for investors into next year. There I am holding a full calorie cocoa. Now what you don't see here is really over the past year or so, James Quincy, the CEO of Cocoa Cola, has really streamlined that product portfolio, really got them focused on what they should be doing, which is a body armor, which is cork cocoa, which is unique cans and not selling things I believe like tab that nobody really wants. What's remarkable is that we always had been talking about for years when there was kind of a war on sugar. If you will, and some of the more sugary drinks that were falling out of the consumer, either diet or fanfare or just kind of the affinity to those high sugary drinks, Coca-Cola pivoted. Coca-Cola is one of the only companies that has the amount of cash possible to really deploy in the beverage space to either build something out in-house or go out and acquire a brand. And I think that's really been a really good competitive positioning for them. Of course, it does come with the size of Coca-Cola to make that possible. But that's a significant consideration for how they've been able to kind of steer the ship over these past few years as consumer taste trends change. Yeah, it's interesting to see that. Charter, we're just showing how Coca-Cola shares have been outperforming PepsiCo, but again, we'll hear about them tomorrow. We'll be talking to CFO Hugh Johnston in front of our programming. Very curious to see how they did in his volatile backdrop. Curious of, wow, wow, was represented at that convenient store. I'm sure they were. Yeah, guys, coming up, we're going to do a quick check of the markets coming up next. Mhm.",https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9GS0SPvxP2s,3,2022-10-11 14:05:42

Stocks are down. They are not up as traders ultimately await that CPI index read later in the week which could come in hot and perhaps put further pressure on stocks. But let's stay on the stock market here more broadly. The Dow Jones industrial average is often seen as the most commonly used metrics for stocks but the average US household and it would appear that households are taking interest in the market again as the year winds down. Google searches for Dow Jones have picked up over the last month according to the folks at Data Trek Research. My friend and former Boston Kramer tweeted a good point to me on this chart today.

2993," Live from the Greenwich economic forum, now markets are back in a bad mood ahead of Thursday's important consumer price index reading, ongoing weakness in European and Asian markets. We're also seeing that way on sentiment as well. Right now all three major indices are in the red. And here's what's on tap for this hour. These Amazon stock prime for gains, Amazon Prime Day two is in full effect today. We'll check in with one analyst to see if the spending event will boost Amazon's beat up stock price. And Wall Street out in force pre-earnings. We got the details on a bullish new call on Chipotle and a less than happy call on Zoom. And Channing at Wales, our Julie Jaime will speak with Churchill asset management founder and CEO Ken Kencel from the always high end event known as the Greenwich economic forum. But first, Brad, let's get over to you at the Yahoo Finance Interactive for a look at all things markets. Yeah, thanks so much, Todd. Well, just putting a little more context into today's decline. There you saw, at about 10 a.m. hour, we bounced off of some of the intraday session lows for the Dow Jones industrial average as of right now. We're still lower by about three tens of a percent, though. Taking a look at the Nasdaq composite, you're also seeing that lower by about one and a half percent here intraday and still in the same ballpark of some of those early session lows as we're just about 37 minutes into today's trading activity here on this Tuesday. The S&P 500, that too, down a little more than 1%. Taking a look, though, a little further into some of the travel names that we've been tracking. And there's really only one bright spot. And it's barely holding on to some of those gains that had come as a result of an update. That from American Airlines. It's holding on to gains by the hair of its chin and chin and chin right now. That compared to being up by 4% pre-market. And so now you're seeing some of that sputtering out, but continue to watch this broader travel and kind of reopening play, if you will, because even though some of the demand that the airlines have cited as being strong, even though some of that demand persists and the taking price from, and in the midst of this kind of higher demand, taking price to consumers and having consumers still accept that, even though that's locked into place, it's still a question of what the capacity will look like for them. And so that's something that American had talked about. And now you're seeing AAL dip into the red, but more broadly, continue to watch Airbnb. That's down by about 6% here on the day. Some of the other travel names that are declining, EXPE, Expedia, also move and lower by a little more than, well, nearly 4%. Shifting gears and watching shares of Amazon, though, as they kick off their second prime day event, shares are lower by about 2.5% right now. What our next guest calls bridging the gap between the back to school and the holiday shopping periods for more on prime day. We welcome in, Cowan Managing Director and Senior Analysts Covering Internet and New Media, John Blackledge, John, great to have you here. Happy prime day sequel to you, I suppose, as we kick off the holiday season sales even earlier, and it always gets earlier and earlier, and there's more names that even get looped in to this broader sales blitz, if you will. How do you expect this to pan out for Amazon, knowing that so much of the e-commerce push that they have? This is just going to be a larger break even type of push that they're looking for in order to just get rid of some of this inventory, and perhaps get some new signups on the prime front. Yeah, it kicks off the holiday season for the company. Remember last year, it was an earlier holiday season with the supply chain issues. This year, it's a little bit different, right? I mean, more macro headwinds for the consumer, so it'll be interesting to see how the consumer holds up throughout it. But you have, like you just said, that in stock levels are good. Arguably, there's a glut of inventory across the retail landscape, which could lead to kind of higher discounting than previous holiday seasons. But I think for Amazon, a couple of things. In stock levels are good, and their delivery speeds are back at three pandemic levels. That's what they told us at two-q earnings, and that should only really improve for the company. Remember, Amazon invested about $80 billion in their fulfillment and logistics infrastructure since 2020. That included quadrupling their last mile of delivery stations. So outside of this prime early access event or second prime day, we think these faster delivery speeds will drive higher conversion rates, which should go well for the company throughout the holiday season. John, some estimates out there in the street are suggesting Amazon from this day might pull in over $4 billion in sales. It might be another big day for them. Yet the stock continues to be under pressure. We're seeing it down here today. What is holding back Amazon stock at this point?",https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9GS0SPvxP2s,5,2022-10-11 14:13:52
2994," Amazon from this day might pull in over $4 billion in sales. It might be another big day for them. Yet the stock continues to be under pressure. We're seeing it down here today. What is holding back Amazon stock at this point? Yeah, I mean, I think, you know, I think broadly, internet is kind of down today at varying levels. So, but to your point, remember in July, the July prime day event we estimated they generated about 7 billion in revenue. And that was about 5 billion incremental to what they would normally do during two days in July. So we think this will be a big event for the company over the next two days. And remember the July prime day event led to the strong 3Q guidance. And for the company for this year, they didn't have a second prime event right last year. So they're going to report earnings in a couple of weeks. They're going to have this effectively the second prime day for their 4Q guide. And we're looking for about 12% e-commerce growth in 4Q. And overall revenue, when they guide to it in a couple of weeks, we're looking, we're about a percent and a half above the street. So we are looking for pretty robust growth. And remember, Amazon despite the stock price today and thus far this year, there are a couple of good things going on. You have revenue growth re-excelerating, both in 3Q and in 4Q versus flat in the first half of the year. And they are pulling out of this massive historic investment cycle, which usually builds well for the stock. So we'll have to see, I know it's a chopping market and tougher internet. But there are good things going on fundamentally at the company. We're taking a look at some of the comparisons in terms of the stock performance, Amazon versus Walmart versus Target. You could easily throw best buy into the mix too if you wanted to. There's so many brands that have tried to take advantage as tertiary players or secondary options, I should say. When we do have a massive sales blitz like this ahead of the holiday season, but are all sales or promotional cycles created equal from your perspective? Oh yeah, you know, and I can't totally speak to what the other players are doing. You usually do see other players around typically around prime days doing things. And also, Amazon does a lot of things in the lead up to prime days. Like even I think small businesses like for the July event generated about 3 billion in revenue in the three week lead up to the July prime day. So, but I think, you know, kind of as we're talking about, I think this will kind of kick off the holiday season, not only for Amazon, but for other retailers. And we will see, like I was saying earlier, if it's going to be an earlier holiday season this year and where the consumer is, you know, just giving all these macro headlines. Cal and analyst John Blacklegge always great to get some time with you. We'll talk to you soon. Thank you. Before I head to break, let's take a look at this Morgan Stanley downgrade on shares of Zoom. Analyst Meta Marshall says the team is stepping to the sidelines on Zoom as there are no near term catalyst for the stock. The online business isn't expected to stabilize until early next year. Suggesting an overhang is likely to stay over the next stock for the next six months. Marshall's price target on Zoom goes to $90 from $130. Zoom shares are down about 61% so far on the year.

Now Carvana says it has corrected most paperwork issues and will address further concerns through consultation. In terms of PayPal, they plunged further this week after a weekend policy change suggested the financial service platform would deduct $2,500 from users spreading misinformation. That led to a delete PayPal movement resulting in a wave of cancellations. PayPal has since walked back the announcement saying that it was posted in error, shares of PYPL.

Alright, gas prices are on the rise again here in the US after OPEC Plus slash its output target by 2 million barrels a day. Now President Biden is reevaluating the nation's relationship with Saudi Arabia. Y'all find it's your commas Rick Newman has the latest. Like interesting to see how this relationship has evolved and may continue to evolve. Yeah, Saudi Arabia not such an ally anymore, basically rebuffing Biden in his request to pump more oil. But when you hear that Biden is reevaluating the relationship with Saudi Arabia, it's hard to figure out what actually might change. And I don't think people should expect much to actually change at least not anytime soon, not before the midterm elections. But people are angry. I mean, just going around, I've found that I'm talking with friends and other people and they're like, what is wrong with OPEC? Why are they citing with Russia, basically, and trying to push up the price of oil, which is going to just give Russia more energy revenue to fight its war with Ukraine? I don't think that's exactly what's going on. But people are pissed off here in the United States and you're hearing some people in Congress say we got to do something about this. So not entirely clear what we can do. There are some ideas out there. My guess is not much is actually going to change. That's prices have come down, but they're still high, is that still top of mind amongst voters as we look to the midterms? Heck yeah. I mean, we figured out this year that consumer confidence-based-",https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9GS0SPvxP2s,7,2022-10-11 14:23:16
2996," I'm down, but they're still high. Is that still top of mind amongst voters as we look to them in terms? Heck yeah. I mean, we figured out this year that consumer confidence basically goes up and down based on gas prices. Nothing seems to drive consumer confidence more than gas prices just because they're so visible. So where are gas prices right now? We're looking at about 392 today. Now oil prices, which are the main component of gas prices, did go up after OPEC said they were going to cut production. Remember, that was a long term production cut. It wasn't like anything changed in today's inventories. But then oil prices came back down. They did not go quite as high as some people thought. To figure out where gas prices are going, I look at wholesale gasoline prices. Anybody can do this on Yahoo Finance. The ticker symbol is RBOB. That's wholesale gasoline. And those prices have actually come down during the last few days. So we may see 392 come down to, I don't know, 385. I think if you're in the Biden White House and you're thinking about the midterm elections, you want most people to see a price that starts with a three rather than a four. And I think Biden might get that for the next three weeks. What's that lead gas sound for? Right. Really? I think it's on the black market. I might need it this year. Yeah, I think you're the only guy you might have a car that takes it. Let's take that off, library. The trend, yeah. We're doing it. You're the man. I'll talk to you. We'll talk to you soon.

2997," Let's get back to our very own Julie Hyman who is there with a special guest, Julie. Thanks so much, Zaz. With me is Ken Kenselli's president and CEO of Churchill Asset Management, which has an enormous credit portfolio. And so can give us a good read on what is going on in companies at this time of rising interest rates. Ken, thanks for being here. Thanks for joining us. So obviously we have been hearing about a lot of gloom lately, right? Some commentary from Jamie Dime yesterday, the IMF cutting its growth forecast for the next several years. What are you hearing from your portfolio companies? And are you guys sort of getting more stringent in some of your credit standards right now? Sure, no, great question. Great to see you here. Look, I think as we go through the challenging economic dynamic that we're seeing, obviously we are being more conservative about our lending standards and companies that we look to finance and invest in. But that being said, if you look at our portfolio today, we have about 41 billion in capital and management. We have about 400, actually 450 portfolio companies all across the US, all US, mid-sized businesses. And what we're seeing frankly is that, you know, those companies by and large are actually quite healthy and growing and actually performing quite well. So, you know, I understand there's a lot of doom and gloom in the air, but the reality is that if you're financing high-quality companies and businesses and being very careful about the businesses that you finance and invest in and you apply, you know, a very high standard, there are still some very fantastic businesses to finance and invest in, particularly ones that have benefited from COVID-19, you know, either through technology or logistics. And so, that's where we focus. We tend to focus on software, business services, healthcare, distribution, logistics businesses that have generally benefited from COVID. And so, today our portfolios in quite good shape. Deal flow remains in the middle market for the better companies, quite robust. I would say for the more challenged businesses, those companies are kind of off the market, if you will right now. They're not really being, you know, transacted. But I think for the better businesses, there are still opportunities to finance and we're certainly seeing that. Well, let me ask you then on the fringes, right? Because I think back to the financial crisis and going into it, things look much the same. And I'm not saying that this is the same. What I'm asking for about is are there signs on the fringes of things at higher risk levels that we should be watching? Yes. So, I would say certainly for the companies or deals that were done at levels that now would be considered excessive or kind of beyond reasonable businesses that frankly may have yielded slightly more in return. But obviously brought with that return a lot more risk. And so, I would say that you'll start to see cracks along those lines. Businesses, for example, that have real issues passing on price increases to their customers, right? So, as cost rise, can they actually roll those expenses back to their customers, whether those are retail or commercial? But I will say that the, you know, there is certainly an expectation that 23 is going to be a more challenging time as we move through this credit cycle. I continue to believe that it will be relatively short. I think that when I compare this, for example, to the GFC and we did manage capital through the GFC, that this is not the same as the GFC and a lot of the fundamental cracks that we saw in the GFC, particularly the mortgage market and some of the issues with the banks. We're just not seeing that today. So, will we be in for a modest recession? I think that's becoming increasingly clear. We will. The Fed seems intent on doing that regardless of the consequences, which I think is trying to be prudent relative to the inflation threat. But I think at the end of the day, we're not looking at a two-year downturn. We're looking at a shorter term impact. But it will impact those businesses that were, you know, maybe looked pretty attractive at the margin a year ago. Right. You know, gee, we're getting 10% for a senior secured loan. Well, there's a reason. No, not so much. So, I think that's, you know, that's the thing to look for. Um, Radella, I spoke earlier and he talked about America being in decline. And you, when it was your turn to speak, really pushed back against that notion and we are, you are what one would call a dream.",https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9GS0SPvxP2s,9,2022-10-11 14:30:46
2998," You talked about America being in decline. And you, when it was your turn to speak, really pushed back against that notion. And you are what one would call a self-made man, right? And so why don't you think that America is in decline? Well, first of all, if you look at the reported competing dynamics, the competing cultures or competing models, I think about the American model. And I think that if you look at the challenges that we've seen over the last century, right? I think about a communist system or a socialist system. And I think I believe very strongly that the US is the place in the world that has been for centuries now where it provides economic opportunity, upward mobility. I'm a big believer in that. I'm on the board of Teach for America, Connecticut. And I think that we are still the best place to raise a family to build a business and to pursue your dream. So I'm fundamentally an optimist and I'm sticking to it. I like it. I like the optimism. Are we going to leave with our Ken Kensell of Churchill Cavill asset management? Thanks so much. Appreciate it. Thank you very much. Thanks so much, really excellent conversation there. Everyone's switching gears here. Want to get to our calls of the day here today. Our Alka Things Off NFLX. I'm looking at Netflix. JP Morgan's tape is that it's advertising. We'll bring in billions of dollars still making waves this morning. Now the bank retains a neutral rating with a $240 price target here. And there you're taking a look at shares. On the day, of course, there's a broader base sell off, especially in tech as we've been tracking. But NFLX shares down by about 5.8%. They had actually seen much of that kind of move higher be priced in, intraday yesterday. And so now it's a question of even with this kind of bullish perspective that they have, where some of the other bearish takes on the street are starting to pour in that as well. And you had actually mentioned one earlier today here. That particularly coming out and saying that Netflix shares have caught a relative bid post week, two Q resulting guidance and optimism. However, in the end, this is not rocket science. Their move to launch an ad supported alternative is this fraught with ARPU. ARPU, essentially, that average revenue per user, technological and financial product risk. That, I believe, had come out from, it was Jeff Rees earlier today. Pivotal. Pivotal. Was it? So all of that, you're starting to have a healthy bull bear dialogue on this. Yeah, it's going to be a fun earnings report from Netflix in a couple weeks, because you have all this optimism. Netflix shares up now about 15 or 16% in the three months on an ad service that doesn't even exist yet. And that's no revenue. And then, oh, yeah, you have to stay focused on what this company is going to report. And let me remind it folks, the past three quarters from Netflix have not been good. The sales have decelerated year over year for the past three quarters. Margins have been under pressure. People have become more mobile, have clicked out of Netflix, or flat out cancel it as prices have gone higher. So it's an interesting time, I think, to be involved with the Netflix story. The promise might be there, but again, near term, this is no longer the Netflix of old. It's just a matter of how many people, number one, opt into that ad tear. But then, additionally, the amount of advertising revenue that they actually realize from it going forward in the number of campaigns that make their way into Netflix versus a bundle, perhaps, that comes in the future, especially from a company in Disney that we know is also going to layer on some of their ad-supported ambitions as well here within this broader streaming landscape. All right, let's stay on tech here. I'm watching a good note, again, from Chris Daly, City Analysts, we frequently cite his work. I do at least, because I think he's really on the pulse of this really great chip slowdown of 2022. Calling out some weakness and cancellations of orders over analog devices, apparently that has been hitting their results, but now he's seeing that spread, especially in Europe, over at the likes of NXP semiconductor, and also Texas instruments. Now, Daly is just flat out calling this a downturn now hitting the analog chip space. Take this, you take weak results from AMD, you have that really disappointing quarter from Intel a couple months ago, and this could be a very, very challenging third quarter earnings season for chip players, not only because the results by themselves may not be good, but the guidance may be just absolutely brutal. Yeah, one of the only bright spots it seems at this point in time, at least for the broader chip segment is, or maybe two of them.",https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9GS0SPvxP2s,10,2022-10-11 14:35:11
2999," Cells may not be good, but the guidance may be just absolutely brutal. Yeah, one of the only bright spots it seems at this point in time, at least for the broader chip segment is, or maybe two of them, and one of them is years out from now. And that is kind of a multi-year, multi-pronged approach in the number of places that are going to bring on capacity, whether that be geographically or whether that be companies that we're talking about. And the production once that begins to ramp up. So that's a long term. What just had a ton of investment over the course of the last two years, pull forward and demand it's the data center businesses for a lot of the companies, even that we've talked about, inciting some of the own near-term headwinds that they do have. And if you see at least some churn in the number of chips that are in those data centers and needing to upgrade those on a more regular basis, that's perhaps at least a catalyst for some stability, but then it's what's the growth potential going forward from there. And that's something that investors, I believe, are pricing in and has been rattled to. A great extent at this point. Guys, coming up, investing in farmland. Yes, we're going to go to the heartlands and the farmlands. We're going to speak with the CEO of Acre Trader on the other side of this real quick. Get the overalls ready. Inside 40 A software landing for investors as market sentiment moves to real estate and even investments in farmland, acre trade wants to provide a marketplace for analysis and insight on the land itself, helping buyers maximize their purchase decisions now through an online platform. acre trade CEO, Carter Maloy, joins us now. Carter, great to have you here with us in studio. Thanks. So, walk us through the model, the platform and how quickly someone could go from evaluating the land to investing in it as well. In a matter of minutes, to the second part there, so very quickly our team is really there to help them with evaluations. So we're about 150 people in total.",https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9GS0SPvxP2s,11,2022-10-11 14:39:41
3000," To investing in it as well. In a matter of minutes, to the second part there, so very quickly, our team is really there to help them with evaluations. So we're about 150 people in total. Good portion of that is software engineers and data scientists supporting a lot of the decisioning. But ultimately, how it works is very simple. We're a platform for investors to gain access to farmland. Farmland has performed incredibly well historically. We haven't heard much about it because frankly you had to go out and plop down a million dollars and manage a farm. It's just not a thing most people could do. So that's where our platform acre trader comes in. We really help the individual come on and rather than investing in a million dollars, you can put in $10,000 in on a slice of a farm. What is that? What would that $10,000? If I had $10,000 right now, what would that get me? And how do I analyze if that's a good investment? Yes, so it can get you anywhere from an acre to only a portion of an acre depending on where you are within the US or Australia, where we primarily invest. Ultimately, the quality of that investment, each investment we put on the website has full detail describing, here's why we believe this is an interesting investment. And here are the cons to each one of those as well with everything there. What are the best farms? What should I invest? How do I identify a good farm? Most of the institutional portfolios seem to be about 60% row crops, so things like corn and soybeans, and then 40% permanent crops, things that grow in trees, almonds, fruits, etc. What if I say I want to invest in wine land or kind of the vineyard country, if you will, is that expansion into kind of new states, new countries even where there are different types of either things being grown for regular produce or other types of products? How have you managed some of the demand or where customers are asking for that? We do get a lot of customers that equate what's on their kitchen table to quality, if this makes wine it must be a good investment, and then of course when they come learn a little more about that, it's like, actually I think I want to own the boring corn, maybe this wine is not for me. Okay, Calcan Drink Wine rather. So it's more about what the stock is that you can actually get into some of the other parts of the broader operation in a farm land as well. So it returns your generated two ways for that investor. One is through the cash incomes, you're getting a revenue share alongside the farmer, who's your partner in the deal, or a cash lease. But actually more importantly is you're getting exposure to potential appreciation of that land underneath you. So whereas the coupon may be something similar to a money market today, that money market does not protect you from inflation. In fact it exposes you to inflation, whereas with farm land there's an intense correlation to inflation historically. And so you're actually having you can achieve some protection from inflation by the underlying appreciation of that land. That is interesting stuff. Well, I have to go now scrunch up maybe $10,000. So I think I'll try to make sure that you're not going to get the money. So I think that's why acre trader CEO, good to see you again. Appreciate it. Appreciate you guys. So look and talk to ultra luxury brand golden goose. They will stop by as a retailer. Years up for the crucial holiday shopping season. Don't go anywhere. So so so so",https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9GS0SPvxP2s,12,2022-10-11 14:43:28
3001," Okay The luxury brand Golden Goose is doubling down on its top supplier. Golden Goose CEO Silvio Compower joins us now alongside Yao Fines' brook, Silvio. Good to see you here. Help us understand the infatuation with your brand. What drives that? First of all, thank you so much for being here for a former small company from Venice. It's a big achievement. I was trying to explain the magic behind our special story. This is probably part of the magic. In the miracle that you were talking about people to see that magic is needed to be able to put in our product. Then the people perceive something special because for people who are always special today is not about how much or how much has been seen as a product. And speaking of that, a lot of consumers. Right now you're in LA for a Golden Goose event. You're going to have content creators there. We've seen the likes of Taylor Swift and Reese Witherspoon wear Golden Goose sneakers. How important has it been for influencers like those to wear your brand and ultimately drive to your success? It's a great question and I have a simple answer. Because magical is that we never place this product to be celebrities because Golden Goose is made in order to make everyone feel special. So the fact that every shoe is made, every shoe is unique. Is making our customer become a lover. And the fact that this celebrity has been wearing these has been just a great amplifier to a message that is simple and is not limited just for a small community. Why is it really open to a wider community? What are we seeing in the style trends right now? I mean, for Kanye West and Gap, it's been about some of the kind of more, I won't say basic or kind of dirty looks out there, but there is something that's out there to like making things look lived in already even before they sell. What is it with the trends right now that you're saying, how much do you expect to kind of be able to lean further into that and where the customer is actually continuing to take price despite, hey, looks like a shoe has a scuff on it. What's up with that? Thank you, Brian, for this question. This is technically the first time that I'm answering to this question live to someone. And it has been quite a question for a couple of years because you should remember that Golden Goose has been the first brand ever to be stressed first, Nekers. And at the beginning, people were a little bit like skeptic, oh, why do I have to spend 500 bucks for the issue? While it was part of the magic again, Golden Goose never wanted to promote the product of now. We always want to know the people to talk about our product. So there was a space of an undefined space where the people were not really getting.",https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9GS0SPvxP2s,13,2022-10-11 14:48:20
3002," So there was a space of an undefined space where the people were not really getting about that, but the reality is that simply what we try to do is to inject in life to our products to unleash the sense of uniqueness of every product we offer to our communities. And it's a little bit like you know your old device. It is always the most special because you're really taking with it your memories. So every item that keep with you and keep with it you know his memories is then more special than something just because he's more extensive you know. So there's a new notion of going from product to purpose, product to values rather than just the product. So this is what is going on right now in the industry and I think the example of Kanye is very interesting quite far from Golden Goose because Kanye is still you know quite fashion focused why Golden Goose is consumer obsessed. So this position Golden Goose in a very special angle of the industry. And speaking of just the long term goal of Golden Goose you've been in this industry since 2000 you've been through three different investment groups here, latest premier took a majority stake in Golden Goose. So I have to ask here there are also the owners of Doc Mardin's Valentino. Could we see Golden Goose go public in the near future? I mean it's part of course you know of the options and the most important to us where we may focus our two things first creating value every day to our consumers second to stay flexible because the market outside is very complicated and very complex and as again imagine you know consumers is really one of the first angles that the market and these difficulties and opportunities came with your reflected on. So it is very important in this process of education to stay flexible. Now that's extremely important to bring up especially in this conversation and especially in this timing right now given your kind of consumer base that you go after the more affluent consumer that is kind of flocking to the Golden Goose product if you will even with some of the anticipated recessionary concerns that many consumers have are you seeing that show up in any of the sales figures and any of the relationship with that consumer right now? It's a great question so as you can imagine for sure you know that almost 42 44% of our businesses are driven by America's and so you know I have a really special angle to be in the Italian brand because no really many Italian brands have the lucky that Golden Goose is and I can tell you that on the American from the American point of view we didn't see any recession last year we achieved something around 78% plus versus 2020 and this year we are in a zone of plus 40 versus next year versus last year in America and in general the company the first semester has been performing like in creative but you know like last year why? Because again we don't really look at the trend in fashion we really look in trend in consumer and there's something that is for sure the KPIs that consumers look at are not a BDA or no cash conversion is no revenues but are really like MPS customer acquisition is really the ability that the company and the brand has to retain and compensate with these communities so this is where Golden Goose is really representing an excellence and I really think that we are really representing a kind of new frontier for the consumer industry on this side. Really fascinating I've seen so many of your products on some of the high-end kind of fashion retailers and resellers out there as well and so I'm excited to see where the brand goes from here Golden Goose CEO Sylvia Kampar joining us here today thanks so much for the time as well as Yahoo finances own Brooke DiPalma who's going to stick around for us here because we've got much more as President Biden has proposed a new rule that will make it more likely for millions of gig economy workers to be classified as employees Uber and Lyft and DoorDash all trading lower on this news Yahoo finances Brooke DiPalma sticking around with us for this conversation Brooke. That's right so this new labor law will allow protection of workers basic rights make it easier for employers to properly classify their workers and also protect independence and businesses",https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9GS0SPvxP2s,14,2022-10-11 14:52:20
3003," That's right. So this new labor law will allow protection of workers basic rights, make it easier for employers to properly classify their workers, and also protect independent businesses that follow the law. Of course, that's out from the U.S. Department of Labor this morning. Companies now expected to provide certain benefits to full-time employees and not to contractors. Of course, that includes minimum wage over time, apportionals of workers, social security, taxes, and contributions to unemployment insurance. Here in a tweet from U.S. Secretary, he says that misclassification hurts workers by denying them important benefits and basic rights like them in a minimum wage over time pay. It's a problem we often see in low-wage jobs. Enforcing the rights of misclassified workers is a priority because these workers have so much stake. Of course, this comes on the heels of the Supreme Court overturning Grovy Wade in earlier this summer. And it also comes after 25 Democratic members of Congress led by Elizabeth Warren, Representative Bush, Accord Bush-Adish and Missouri, sent letters to CEO of Amazon, lived, DoorDash, and Grub. To question a policy, that was a Trump error decision. Now, of course, Wall Street reacting to this shares lower on Uber, lived at DoorDash, Dan Ives, a show favorite here calling this a clear blow to the gig economy and a near term concern for the likes of Uber, and let's you also add it. That depending upon this model, you could really overturn the likes of DoorDash, like Uber, of course, these customers or employees rather coming in doing their job here and there and then going, not right now, getting the full benefits of an employee. So lots more fallout to come from this decision. And once again, this is the second attempt of the Biden administration to overturn this. Yeah, and you see these harsh reactions, notably with Lyft there. It's now this issue that has long plagued this industry as well, but this comes at a time as these companies finally start to achieve a little bit of profits. If this changes, if this goes against them, and immediately goes them, brings them back to losing large sums of money. At a time where as well, some of the prices that they had passed on in search charges for gas as well, to consumers, where that had started to, at least on the gas price front, started to come down in terms of the release of the stock. In terms of the relation to the highest peaks that we had seen on an all time basis earlier this year. And so those surcharges finally starting to come down, but yet this could also factor into the higher elevated prices, consumers are seeing on the economy front too. So we're going to be watching this very closely. Y'all find this is on Brook to Palm, breaking this down for us. Thanks, Brook. And everyone coming up, Duncan, in some hot water over its rewards program, we've got the deep snacks.",https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9GS0SPvxP2s,15,2022-10-11 14:57:04
3004," Welcome back everyone. It's time for Cut for Time. We've got two stories today, one minute only clock for each. We start with this. Dunkin'. Dunkin' is facing some backlash about its new rewards program. My goodness, the coffee giant announced a new program for customers, axing the free birthday drink and changing their point system, causing resentment from loyal customers like Brian Sausie. I'm upset, Brad. I'm upset. So I noticed my app changed over the weekend and it's going to take me, I calculated $90. I'm going to spend $9 to get a free coffee from Dunkin'. Right now I have 345 points which gets me two espresso shots. But ultimately don't take away my birthday drink. This is a tradition that Starbucks had. Dunkin' adopted. I need my free birthday drink. It's a right-of-pass that I spend enough money at these places. I want to be rewarded. I mean, even Nike still sends me updates. Every other brand that I buy with, I'm pretty sure Chipotle, Nike, all of these companies don't give me that little update and say, hey, here's 20% off. Just because it's your birthday. And you're involved in all of these kind of reward systems so that you do get the birthday reward. $90. And coffee to get something free. It just don't seem right. All right, staying on food, Chipotle in focus after Bernstein initiated coverage with an outperform rating saying the chain's customer strategy through apps like TikTok will prove to be a positive thing for shareholders. And I was checking out this Chipotle presence on TikTok. It is pretty, pretty darn impressive. 1.3. I think almost actually two million followers on TikTok. Some of the posts are great. But again, this fits, I think, very much with the Chipotle brand, which has always been focused on driving sales and engagement via social media. Now that you've taken that DNA of this brand and brought it to TikTok. Yeah, the Guacomole attachment rate is strong with this one here today, as we're tracking shares. It's like the grill replacement, right? Well, I mean, I don't know. The grill replacement rate could be stronger if some of those grills start to crap out at Chipotle. So ultimately here, for Chipotle, what they have been able to do so well is, and yes, we're going to say it, menu innovation. Case O goes a far away when you're talking about burritos and changing out pollo assado and just having new types of meat offerings that you're able to throw onto the different bowls, the burritos, the tacos. I mean, the burrito was like 11 bucks when I was in college now. I would do whatever I want to do. 15. All right, one programming note. So our all market summit is Monday, October 17th featuring guests, including CEOs from Target, Microsoft and General Motors. Of course, we also speak to Chipotle CEO, Brian Nichol. I am very jazzed up about that one. All right, coming up in the next hour, Okiko Fujita will speak with IMF's chief economist on their latest economic report. They said this morning that the worst is yet to come. I can't wait to see that conversation with the Kiko. Don't worry.",https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9GS0SPvxP2s,16,2022-10-11 15:02:05
3005," makes your mind feel comfortable. was expansion. mouse. Welcome to Yahoo Finance live. It is 11 a.m. here in New York City. I'm a Kiko Fujita. Here's what we're watching this morning. Taking a look at where stocks are trading right now. The Dow, the only one in the green right now, up about 43 points, the SMP 500 and the Nasdaq both in the red. All of this ahead of key inflation data and earnings, the Nasdaq by the way, we saw falling deeper into the red after hitting a two year low. Moving ahead here, Stormy Waters ahead, the IMF downgrade that's growth outlook for the global economy as a fund warns of a harsh worldwide recession. Chief Economist Pierre Olivier Greenchess is going to be joining us to break down the latest report later this hour. And doubling down on climate financing, the US commits $950 million to accelerate the development of clean technology. We're going to talk to a senior specialist at the Climate Investment Fund to see how the group is planning to deploy all of that capital. As always, we are beginning with a market check. 90 minutes in to the trading day right now. As we pointed out, the Dow, the only one in the green right now and taking a look at where bond yields have been trading. We saw the 10 year start to move closer to that 4% level earlier today and now we are seeing it at 3.9, the 30 year yield at 3.9 and the 5 year at 4%. We're beginning today though with a focus on the semiconductor sector today. Here's an interesting number to point out. $240 billion wiped out from the global chip sector. Global market value, we should say since the close on Thursday and we're talking about it of course because of those expert controls the US has now put in and that really has had global implications. We are continuing to see a sell off in US chip stocks. You see in video down 2.5% Qualcomm seeing the biggest losses there down about 4.7% all this of course as investors try to calculate their exposure to the Chinese market. A lot of this spilling over from what we saw over in the Asia session particularly over in South Korea and Japan. A bit of a catch up session there because they did have the Monday holiday off but take a look at where those stocks chip makers ended up. We're talking about Reneces which is a chip maker. Semi conductor equipment maker, Tokyo Electron also down and significantly over in South Korea. We did see Samsung and SK Heinigs the biggest chip makers out there also down significantly and then worth noting what we saw over with TSMC of course the largest chip maker globally down significantly. We're talking about 7% right now. By the way the sell off was so significant what we saw there and also as so many of these countries and companies try to figure out the global implications we have.",https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9GS0SPvxP2s,17,2022-10-11 15:06:25
3006," Right now, by the way, the the sell off was so significant what we saw there and also as so many of these countries and companies try to figure out the global implications. We have seen a move in currency currencies as well. The Korean one down there about four tenths of a percent. So we're here to break it all down for you this morning with Dan Halley, our very own chip expert here at Yahoo Finance and Dan, you know, I just ran through so many different stocks we've been tracking over in Asia here in the U.S. by the way we also didn't talk about ASMR over in Europe. But what are how are you making sense of these latest expert controls that have been put in place that really came down on Friday but there's still a lot the market is still processing right now. Yeah, you know, you talk about those the companies that are overseas that had the holiday SK Heinrich Samsung TSMC. You can see them kind of just dropping off as they kind of get back into things. But then you look at the lights of, you know, let's say in video or Intel Qualcomm. They're all still being hit. You could see that came in on Monday and you know, you can look at stuff like applied materials, lamb research, KLA corp. These are all companies that also took a hit. Those companies are about the manufacturing side of things. So I think that's something that's important to look at. It's the manufacturing aspect as well as the overall technology. So applied materials, lamb research, KLA, they're talking about wafer manufacturing. Those are a problem there. And it'll be continued to be a problem because those companies are providing the capabilities to companies in China to actually build the chips that they need. Then you look at the chip companies like SNK Heinrichs, like Samsung, like TSMC that have actual factories out there in China. So they're all getting hit. And I think that you're going to continue to see this. Then obviously some American companies as well when it comes to the AI side of things. In video, I've taken a hit a while back when there was discussion of more export controls going into effect. And they said that they were working with the Biden administration to try to figure out what they can do there. But obviously we're seeing them taking some damage now as well. Yeah. And we're sort of backing up to say, well, what exactly the ruling was in case people are just sort of catching up right now. Number one, this new ruling means it would live in chip makers from semiconductors made with US technology. We're talking about the most advanced AI super computers. Also, those US citizens would not be allowed to be a part of that which is why it will be out. Which is certainly key. And then of course you wouldn't be able to use US equipment to manufacture these chips. And that's the thing that we often forget. So many of these companies, you've got global names out there. But many of them still use US equipment. If you are one of those, you would not be able to export to China. Yeah. I think that's the big thing that kind of gets lost is that the US is still the leader dominates the space when it comes to building actual chips. The companies that build chips or provide the materials to build chips. Those are largely US companies. So if you take that out of the equation, it's a huge blow to China. It's a huge blow to these companies. Obviously, the discussion here is about whether or not the technologies will be fed into the Chinese military. And that's the big catch there. It's the same thing that we've been talking about for some time when it comes technology in China. And we saw this during the Trump administration obviously seeing it during the Biden administration. But it'll continue to roll out and we just have to see how the other chip companies start to kind of process this or, you know, if they can get some exceptions. And we're noting really quickly that this isn't just about the regulation because this all comes at a time when we have seen a slowdown, whether it's demand in PCs, demanded other consumer electronics. That's another head when working against some of these chip makers, which is why we're seeing the pullback. Yeah, Gartner recently released yesterday released their latest note saying that worldwide PC shipments declined 19.5% in the third quarter. That's the worst decline in two decades worth pointing out, by the way, that it doesn't mean that the PC market is just, you know, going away. It's that we saw such explosive growth. And now it's coming back to, you know, buy a computer every year. That's crazy. I mean, unless, you know, you're like me. But, you know, this is going to be an issue, I think, for, you know, at least three years before we start to see PC sales start to pick up again. Okay. Thank you very much for the information. So, I'm just getting this nameless system that you want to simply check it out. And that's the latest creative input. Another update is the voribi folder battery. Okay. Please go to flip merciless lottery and continue to link to arrive as soon as",https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9GS0SPvxP2s,19,2022-10-11 15:13:34
3007, you know at least three years before we start to see PC sales start to pick up again. Okay just another narrative to add to the global tech space there. Thanks so much for that Dan. Let's turn out to a look at the broader markets as investors gear up for result season. We have joining us now. SEMA Shah principal asset management chief. Global strategy. SEMA's here with us in studio today. It's good to talk to you today. It feels like we're finally kind of able to pivot a little if you will. Looking at earning season with the big banks reporting later this week but what do you have your eye on in terms of what's driving the market right now. So we continue to think of course about the Federal Reserve and what's going on there increasingly we're getting a lot of questions about the dollar. How is that going to impact the rest of the world and even could that influence Fed policy going forward which I should say we think that the Fed stays very much domestically focused. With regards to earning season the thing that we have seen is this year top-line earnings growth has been incredibly strong. It has much to beat expectations time and time again but we're getting towards the end of the year when you are expecting to see economic weakness not to see pin but it probably won't start to show through until early 2023 so this could be another solid quarter. Yeah in terms of the narratives we're expecting during earnings season obviously a lot of sort of similarities in terms of threads. FX had wins a key one that we've been watching also just where the consumer demand is right now. What are your biggest concerns. Well I think the FX had one is an important one you are seeing their companies which have a lot of international exposure. So those which are exposed to Europe of course China emerging markets they're struggling because their economies are also slowing a lot quicker. Throw on top of that the strong dollar policy or sorry the strong dollar outlook and of course these companies are being additionally challenged so their margins are being compressed further and further. So that's one thing they're watching but also the consumer resilience is really interesting and I think that what we're expecting to see is unless until you see US labor market weakness really start to get going actually the consumer could stay quite resilient we know that there's a headwind coming but it's not quite here yet. We're still a few weeks out from the next FOMC meeting we had a New York Fed survey come out today pointing to inflation expectations declining in the short term but increasing in the medium and long term. We've got the CPI print coming out later this week but what is your read on where we are when it comes to inflation? We have still very very far to go you know we think we're hoping that we have seen peak inflation the energy prices is still very much a wild card we assume that they're going to keep coming down but as we've seen over the last week that's definitely not a guarantee. Now even if that peak is behind us it's not enough really because we do think that the decline from here is going to be extremely slow. We can see that core commodities core transportation those segments of inflation probably will turn deflationary but it's the stuff like shelter inflation medical services those parts which are very very sticky and once they start to get going it's very difficult to contain them unless you can create economic weakness. So from the Federal Reserve's perspective they almost have to engineer a hard landing in order to contain inflation so that means bringing rates up further keeping them high for pretty long so high for longer and only at that point can then we start to see some kind of relief on the inflation side. You said they have to engineer a hard landing some still holding out hope that it won't be quite as severe but it sounds like you think that's a necessary step to get inflation back to where the central bank needs it. Exactly I think a soft landing wouldn't be sufficient. I mean what the Fed needs to do is create labor market slack increase labor supply almost make things so difficult that households people have to return to the labor market and by doing that you reduce wage pressures but in so doing of course you make the economy economic conditions extremely challenging but this is your kind of your price reset this is your only way you're bringing down inflation has the pace of the rate high expense sufficient for you I mean there's something that would argue that it's going too quickly yes they need to hike rates to get the labor market in check but more importantly inflation as a whole in check are they moving too quickly? I would say that they start to very slowly I mean the fact that they started off with a 25 basis point hike in retrospect seems a little bit crazy but at this stage I think they do need to be move very quickly but they do of course risk the fact that you know given the lag from monetary policy to actually hitting real economy you do risk and even deeper slow down than what they necessarily need to achieve so it probably it could be slow down but of course you know when you have an inflation problem this serious it's important to get in front of it and really front load your what they're doing is quite moving forward but our will speak significantly,https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9GS0SPvxP2s,19,2022-10-11 15:15:34
3008," It's really neat to achieve. So it probably could be slowed down, but of course, when you have an inflation problem, this serious, it's important to get in front of it and really front load your rate hikes in order to make sure that the inflation problem just doesn't continue to grow. Really quickly, a lot of people looking at their portfolios right now saying, well, what do I do in this environment? In terms of how much cash you set aside, has that calculation shifted as a result of the volatility that we've seen? It's interesting actually, because one of the, I've been traveling around the years of the last week and the question we keep getting from clients is actually, when are we going to be ready to put our money to work? Right, so everyone's starting to look already to, when does the market reach its floor? And where do we go from there? So from that perspective, it's really important to have that kind of liquidity in your portfolio. So you're ready to deploy it as soon as those opportunities arise. So there is a concern about volatility. So in the run-up, it means about playing defense, going high qualities. We do like long end treasuries, even secure ties, debts, which have a better relationship within economic conditions and what you see with investment grade credit or even high yield credit. But really, the opportunity set, which is the best, is still real assets. This is a high inflation, low growth environment, real assets can continue to perform well at that point. A lot of people taking notes, right? There are similar principle asset management, chief global strategist, thanks so much for joining us today. Well, bearish outlook on matters weighing on the company's shares. Today, we have seen a pullback in that stock after Atlantic equities downgraded it from overweight to neutral.

3009," I'm in the car! Welcome back to Yahoo Finance Live. Let's check in on where the price of Bitcoin is moving right now. Stobal of that $20,000 handle down about 1% this morning. Earlier today, our team spoke with Galaxy Digital Founder CEO Mike Novigratz. He had to say this about what Fed tightening means for the crypto space. Take a listen. It's hard to predict when these crypto winners, how long they go. You know, we're a couple years from a having cycle. I do think the Fed flinching creates some enthusiasm around Bitcoin as a store of value, Bitcoin as a recession as an inflation hedge as a hard money when the rest of the world keeps printing money. Joining us to break down some of those comments. We've got our very own David, the holler David, you're part of that conversation. Interesting that he said the Fed flinching could mean that crypto would be a little more attractive because that sort of was not the correlation just a month ago when we were talking about where how far crypto had fallen. Right. At Kika. That's a great point in Novigratz is obviously all seasons crypto bull. But to his point, the correlation changes between crypto currencies and stocks has been sort of interesting for the past two weeks. Sometimes this correlation breaks down and it just comes back immediately when there's a large Fed event or CPI or something like that. Obviously, there's no Fed rate hike in October. So that might be one reason why we're seeing sort of a breakdown. But to his point, you know, analysts I've spoken with have also suggested maybe reasons for why crypto might be holding up slightly better, at least since July. The stock market has a lot to do with how much it is sold off in the previous quarter, the second quarter. So that's an explanation of that. But I mean, a great example to point to is actually Coinbase's own stock compared to the NASDAQ today. Coinbase has had some news with Google. It's partnering with Google and it's going to use Google's cloud services. And in return, Google Cloud customers can pay with cryptocurrencies. And the parallel between the NASDAQ composite, not necessarily year to date, but over the last days, sort of, you know, running in parallel to each other. So, you know, I think that there are a crypto is sort of getting a little bit without so much macro data happening, at least yet this week. It's getting a little bit of its own kind of innovation narrative, which is coming back. Yeah, a big pop for Coinbase right there on the back of that news that stock up more than 4%. David Hollereth is always thanks so much for that. Well, a setback for the Biden administration as a union representing 12,000 rail world workers voted against the possible contract agreement between freight rail companies and the 12 unions raising concerns once again of a possible nationwide strike. Yeah, who finances Danny Romero and Rick Newman. But the one with me here at the desk today, Danny, let's start with you because you have been speaking to the unions directly. What's the very latest on where these talks stand? Yeah. So I spoke with Peter Kennedy. He is the chief negotiator and strategist. And he says that the main reason why the union did not ratify this this tentative deal goes back to the lack of paid sick time. So there is a supplemental sick leave plan that is on the table. But that doesn't include, for example, if you if your child gets sick and you need to take that day off, it's it doesn't it doesn't include in that. So again, there's a discrepancy between what the union wants and needs and what the presidential emergency board had put forward.",https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9GS0SPvxP2s,21,2022-10-11 15:23:08
3010," It doesn't, it doesn't include in that. So again, there's a discrepancy between what the union wants and needs and what the presidential emergency board had put forward, recommended for this deal. So, and in that deal, sorry, excuse me, it included a 24% wage increase and also $5,000 bonus and an additional paid sick day. But from what the union has been telling me is that they're going to schedule more discussions with the railroad carriers and and waft, I mean, they'll have to wait and see, but it's seven more unions are expected to vote from now until November 20th. Rick, I'm thinking back to when the White House stepped in and it was sort of crisis averted. You get the sense, you know, are we at here we go again? I don't think so. So crisis averted until the midterm elections, politically speaking, if this gets, if this goes into has to be resolved after the midterm, just not a political crisis. Anymore. And everything Danny just said, I mean, this sounds like small potatoes, honestly, based on all the concessions they've gotten so far, they've gotten a nice pay increase, better working conditions. So this sounds bridgeable, honestly, but I guess we might, you know, in terms of the political conversation, we might hear Republicans saying, oh, President Biden failed to get this deal done. We could have higher prices because, you know, a strike would drive up the cost of everything that gets shipped by rail, which is a lot of stuff, but it's not going to happen before the midterm. So it's just really not a political story anymore. I don't think. Yeah, so much of this has framed in the context of the midterms or what, less than a month out. Danny, what's the sense right now in terms of the hard line that exists on these key sticking points, you just pointed out how long is this like the drag out now? Well, like I said, there are scheduling more discussions with the railroad carriers, but the railroad carriers actually responded when the union rejected this tentative deal. They said that they were disappointed, but this morning the union fired back and we actually have a sound bite. So just take a listen to what they had to say this morning. Frankly, we're disappointed that the railroads were not willing to engage in discussions that would have resulted in paid sick days, front members. So, you know, it's, it, the path goes both ways on this, you know. So if the parties don't come to terms, then there could be a strike, but that strike wouldn't happen until mid-Nobember, five days after Congress goes back to session. Okay. Just what the administration wants to hear, right? I predict it's going to get settled. I predict there will be no strike. Okay, well, I'll be watching Rick and Danny. Thanks so much for that. Coming up on the other side, two and a half trillion dollars in buying power, we discussed the reach of the Hispanic consumer and why addressing this key demographic should be a business priority. That's coming up next.",https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9GS0SPvxP2s,22,2022-10-11 15:27:12
3011," Dieser hena Frenzy Li-tant Laugh Nabi Chitt Chitt Die Dooms vegetables Hooray Bom�umm Pitch What is the final week of Hispanic Heritage Month? And we're taking a look today at investing in the Latinx community. The fast growing group accounts for 19 percent of all Americans, making it the nation's second largest racial group and a major opportunity for institutions. Joining us to discuss this, Joseon Fernandez, he's been recognized by Crenz, New York, as a notable leader in the Hispanic community. He's currently aerial investments head of national accounts. Joseon is good to talk to you today. You know, we've seen those numbers in terms of the demographic makeup of this community. How should we be thinking about them in terms of investing power and buying power? Yeah, thank you, Akiko. It's great to be on. One of the biggest growth engines and arguably the biggest opportunity, as you alluded to, lies in our US Latino cohort. The LDC, the Latino donors, collaborative have analyzed the impact of the Latino demographic and have found that it's responsible for $2.8 trillion in GDP. So $2.8 trillion in GDP, that's up $1 trillion and less than 10 years. So to put that into perspective for your viewers, if the US Latino cohort with its own independent country be the fifth largest economy in the world, surpassing that of the United Kingdom, surpassing that of France, surpassing that of India, Canada, Korea, the list goes on. And so the kicker here, Akiko, is that it's in our own respective borders, right? The fifth largest economy within our respective borders, it's an incredibly powerful demographic for both institutions and investors to be a part of. Yeah, with that said, it's not something that we always sort of frame the conversation around when we talk about the Latinx community. Why do you think that's the case? You know, I think ultimately organizations really need to pinpoint and say to themselves, okay, how important is diversity, right, within our respective organizations and diversity of thought, right? And can we actually, you know, invest in this particular space to grow the market, right? At the end of the day, we know very keenly at this junction that investing in diverse managers, investing in diverse perspectives is, is, is, can lead to, to outperformance, right? And there's certainly value there. And institutions certainly have a role to play here. They can invest in emerging managers, whether it be on the public side, whether it be on the private side, on the private side, you've seen venture capital firms really start to grow within the emerging manager section, as well as private equity and private credit. And so there's, there's a tremendous amount of opportunity, quite frankly, I think organizations need to really hone in and ultimately say to themselves, this is important to us. And we see the growth and we're going to invest in that growth. Yeah, in an aerial investment, how are you, you know, in your role trying to amplify some of that message? Well, you know, we, at aerial investments, we, we invest in the world that we want to see, right? Aerial investments is the first African-American owned asset management firm in the country, right? And so diversity is literally and figuratively in our DNA. We're committed to DE and I across all of our organization and we take very special care and are very purposeful in attracting diverse talent. And frankly, we don't just talk to talk, we, we certainly walk the walk. And our employees are 75% diverse when you look at leadership ranks, which tends to, to quite frankly be underrepresented a lot of organizations, we're at 67%. And most importantly, the minority ownership with...",https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9GS0SPvxP2s,23,2022-10-11 15:31:50
3012," when you look at leadership ranks, which tends to quite frankly be underrepresented a lot of organizations, we're at 67%. And most importantly, the minority ownership within organizations at 83%. So our COCEO, Melody Hobson, is a very firm proponent of what gets measured gets done. And we're immensely proud of those numbers. OK, well, continue to follow all the progress there. Aerial investments, head of national accounts, Hosanna Fernandez, good to talk to you today. Thank you. Well, coming up, the worst is yet to come. That's the dire warning from the IMF's chief economist as the fund downgrades its global growth outlook. It says inflation will peak this year, but isn't going away fast. He'll join us on the other side. Well, we will end the walk down更 soon....... Well, the IMF has downgraded its global economic growth outlook to 2.7 percent next year with growth in the U.S. scene at just 1 percent in 2023. The fund's new global outlook sees more than a third of the world economy contracting this coming year. With the European Union in China also continuing to stall. On inflation, the fund sees price rises peaking late this year but remaining at elevated levels. Joining us to discuss the report is Pierre Olivier Grinchas, the IMF's chief economist, who also got Yahoo Finance's Gen Chamburger joining in on the conversation. Pierre, it's good to talk to you today. You know, I'm thinking about these so-called stormy waters you've described in the report, whether it's the Russian invasion of Ukraine, the cost of living crisis, what's happening in China. These have all been headwinds that you've been watching throughout the year. To what extent have they accelerated in the second half of the year that leads you to this downgrade? Well, it's certainly the case that some of the risks that we had flagged in earlier projection rounds, particularly in July, but even if you go back to April.",https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9GS0SPvxP2s,24,2022-10-11 15:36:09
3013," to the Stagg Great? Well, it's certainly the case that some of the risks that we had flagged in earlier projection rounds, particularly in July, but even if you go back to April, have started to materialize. I mean, the energy crisis that results from the Russian invasion of Ukraine is perhaps the clearest one where we see this incredible toll that's taking on European economies right now. And also the fight against inflation that is proving quite challenging. The inflation keeps going up still. I mean, we're expecting that it's going to peak soon and then start going down as a result in part of actions by central banks, but it's proven both more persistent, more elevated, and also broader. It's not just energy prices that are going up. It's what we call core inflation that excludes energy and food prices. It's also pushing upwards. And so that's something that complicates the task for central banks around the world. The final factor in our forecast is, of course, to slow down in China. That is maybe there is a little bit less of a downward revision there. I mean, that's something that we saw a sharp slowdown in the second quarter of the year. And going forward, zero-covid policy is certainly leading to some localized lockdowns and confinements are affecting activity and the weakness in the property sector is also another factor. Here, Jennifer Seanberger here, it's great to see you. It seems like the global economy is really being stretched here. Perhaps on a string, you mentioned that a third of the countries will contract in growth this year or next. We've got the war in Ukraine. We've got interest rates going up globally. You mentioned the slowdown in China. We just saw the services sector contract in September for the first time in four months. So it just seems that it's not going to take much to push it over the edge. What do you see as the odds of the global economy tipping into recession next year? Well, we certainly flag a number of downside risks in our report. Some of them you mentioned, I mean, the fight against inflation could prove more difficult than we expected this point. We could have more energy-priced shocks. Markets could certainly experience a lot of stress. And associated with that in parts of the world, the strength of the dollar is an important factor. So we try to put all of this in an assessment of the risks around our baseline. And what we found out is that there is about a 25% probability that growth in 2023, global growth, could be at about 2%. And 2% is a very low number. We only had that about five times since 1970 and every time we had this, if you look, it's 1973, the oil price shock, 1981, and the fall curve disinflation, the 2008 financial crisis, all of them are sort of they are stuck in our collective memory as times of difficulties. And there's a 10 to 15% chance that actually output growth could be even lower than 1%. Now 1% is an interesting marker because this is at the level at which global output would remain stagnant per capita. And so that would be an economy that is not growing at all globally. Up here, you mentioned the strength of the dollar, a big concern, something we've been watching. I mean, what we're seeing are major economy currencies here, whether that is the yen, the euro, the sterling, see huge swings on the back of the dollar strength, but it's the EMs that get hit even harder, given the dollar's denominator, debt. How are you looking at that risk being elevated even further, given that it doesn't look like the dollar is going to pull back anytime soon? Yes, there's been a lot of strength in the dollar. Actually, what's interesting there also to point out is the strength of the dollar has been particularly important against other advanced economies. So the Japanese yen or the euro or the sterling. So more so than against many emerging market economies. In fact, even some emerging market economies, if you look at Brazil or Mexico or Peru, their currencies are appreciated against the US dollars. So it's more against advanced economies and emerging market economies. But in part, this is also because appreciation of the dollar is very painful in emerging market economies. So a number of them had already started tightening monetary policy, raising their policy rates, starting course if you want for their own economies and found themselves in the...",https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9GS0SPvxP2s,25,2022-10-11 15:40:13
3014," I'd already started tightening monetary policy, raising their policy rates, adjusting course if you want for their own economies and found themselves in a different position compared to, say, the European Central Bank or the Bank of Japan or the Bank of England. But this stress coming from the dollar are really important. They play out through multiple channels. They increase inflation in the rest of the world because a lot of goods are invoiced in dollars and they also increase financial stress because countries or corporations that have debt in dollars find that it becomes harder to service them. Now if you want to think about how countries should address that, our recommendation at this point is that these movements in the dollar are really reflecting fundamental forces that are at play, the fight against inflation, the energy crisis. And so countries should try to sort of let the exchange rate adjust and accommodate because it reflects an underlying change in the economy. Pierre, Olivia Garene-Chas, the IMF's chief economist, really appreciate your time today. And our thanks to Yahoo Finance is Jen Chamburger as well. Thank you. Now to clean energy, a stark report from the IEA last year outlined the need for a concerted effort to deliver sustainable energy to the developing world. It said annual clean energy investment in these economies needs to increase by more than 7 times if net zero by 2050 is to become a reality. One group working towards this goal is the climate investment funds. One of the world's biggest multilateral funds for climate action and developing nations last week it received a fresh $950 million loan from the U.S. Treasury joining us now for a weekly charging forward segment brought to you by BMW, is Daniel Morris, CIF, Senior Climate Change Specialist. Good to talk to you today. Let's start with that big injection. I mean, it is a loan, not necessarily a capital injection, but how do you plan to deploy that capital? Yeah, thanks, Akiko. The loan that we received from the U.S. really helps support our new Accelerating Coal Transition Program. It's a program that's been developed over the past couple of years to help some of the key emerging economies that are very reliant on coal, accelerate and move away from using that power source and toward more renewable power sources. So within the program, there are kind of four major countries that are participating India, Indonesia, South Africa and the Philippines. And this large loan will help execute projects that are under design now. Right now those countries are putting together investment plans that will lay out how they intend to deploy investments and bring co-finance years into support over the next few years. And that will be a big part of that. Daniel, we're just a few weeks out from COP27 over in Egypt. I'm thinking back to the big pledges that were made on climate financing a year ago. The argument would be that certainly a lot of these governments, as well as companies, haven't really put their backed up their actions with the pledges they've made. When you look globally where the need is right now, where do you see it? You know, when it comes to tackling a problem like climate change, there are so many needs that it's hard to isolate them. So I think you need to deploy a broad approach. You know, I work in the clean energy and clean tech sector. And we have a lot of resources that we can bear on different things, investments in different types of technologies that establish technologies like solar and wind and emerging technologies like say energy storage, immobility, green hydrogen. That needs a lot. And we're starting to see more and more of that. Of course, we need a lot more if we want to reach the goals that the international community has set out. But we also need to see a lot more investment in adaptation and resilience. A lot of countries, especially lower income countries, those that haven't really contributed much to the climate crisis of feeling the effects in really catastrophic ways. The most tangible example right now is Pakistan, where the flooding in August resulted in over 30 million being displaced. We need to build more climate resilient communities and the international finance community really needs to start to focus on those with a lot of large scale and a lot of power brought to",https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9GS0SPvxP2s,26,2022-10-11 15:44:23
3015," in the international finance community really needs to start to focus on those. With a lot of, with large scale and a lot of power brought to bear to try and protect people from what will continue to be a change in climate. Daniel, really quickly we've got the World Bank IMF meetings happening over in DC. This comes at a time when we had an op-ed coming out from former Treasury Secretary Larry Somersign that the World Bank just is not doing enough in terms of financing some of these projects. When you think about the need globally, how much of this falls on the development banks, how much of it is on government, how much of it is on the private sector? How do you look at that breakdown? Yeah, I mean, it's a great question. I think I can talk a little bit about our experience in the climate investment funds. We are a fund that uses six multilateral development banks as our implementing entities. So we work with the World Bank, we work with the International Finance Corporation, the Regional Development Banks. When you look at our overall portfolio, about a third of our co-finance in comes from the private sector, another third comes from the MDVs themselves, and then we also have national governments in their bilateral institutions. It really is all hands on deck. I think that public financing really needs to pave the way to support communities that are in danger. And, you know, kind of men and bring their power to bear. Daniel Morris, Climate Investment Fund, Senior Climate Change Specialist. Good to talk to you today. Well, coming up, getting alternative.

3016," Speakers today and of the subjects of conversation is on alternative Investments those outside sort of stocks and bonds and my next guest knows a lot about this area He's Matt Brown founder and CIO of case which is a firm that basically provides a Technology platform for many of those alternative investments. So before we dig into it Can you just tell me a little bit more about what you guys do? Absolutely, first of all, thanks for having me. It's great to be here Case as you said is a technology platform And what we do is we connect the very fragmented a universe of financial advisors across America With the leading alternative investment funds. So think private equity private credit hedge fund strategies real estate strategies And the reason that's valuable is because those two communities really didn't have access to each other Prior to a technology that allows it to be easy and simple to connect Well, and I feel like retail investors writ large didn't really have access to these kinds of investment that thinking always was You had to well you have to be an accredited investor Which you know means also among other things that you have to have a certain amount of money Do you think all of that needs to change do you think we need to have sort of radical accessibility to these kinds of investments? Well, the world is changing and there's really a moment in time now that we're seeing a lot of forces Come to play there's really four major trends that are coming together and you mentioned one of them And so we want to we just start there which is the regulatory environment on who governs who can access alternative investments I think previously as you said you know the bar was quite high The SEC's view was if you know invest in alternatives We want you to have a lot of capital just in case it doesn't work out I think where they realized over the last 10 years is that all except really done their job What they've done is be able to take advantage of unique opportunities at the public markets don't offer while protecting the downside of investors and Tribulant times like we're having now and the SEC now is kind of saying wait a second Maybe we've excluded too many people and not made it more broadly available So they're changing the modifying their stance on that which is creating a much more Inclusive investing environment and very much along the themes of democratization of access Yeah, and to your point it's not as if you're insulated from downside if you're in the equity market Well, I mean that's the you know the 60 40 portfolio. I can say it here. I think is officially over I think markets like this have really just once again demonstrated that you know You can't just have a portfolio that is only equities and fixed income The modern portfolio is really a three-dimensional portfolio It's stocks bonds and alternative investments and most people are talking that it's gonna be 50 You know 50 30 20 and 20 being of course alternative investments That said do you think that there is a risk with more people getting involved in alternative Investments I see just the opposite you know We look at the some of the greatest asset managers in the alternative space many of which are on our platform and available You know decade after decade they've delivered I would argue that you know if you're a financial advisor and you're not Allocating your clients capital in alternative investments. You're at risk of losing your business That's the impact positive impact all it's are having I mean at the same time if we are headed into a downturn during the financial crisis Certainly all it's we're not immune if anything some of them were the sources of some of the you know fractures that we saw within the system Well, I think when you look at the track record of how portfolios perform In good times and in times like we have right now with high volatility. They're added value far exceeds any kind of negative impact that one or two could have You know you look at the largest and most sophisticated investors in the world institutional investors average allocation rates to alternative investments 30 to 50% of their portfolio overall Interestingly look at that same lens on wealth management in America which controls $40 trillion less than 5% probably closer to 2 to 3% but it's rising Advisor demand is picking up asset managers see wealth as a huge market of new clients for them and new investors Regulation as we mentioned is changing and now with this technology that's going to make it all easier So all of this implies that even if we're seeing a pullback generally potentially and things like software spending That maybe you're not seeing that in your business or are you what are you?",https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9GS0SPvxP2s,28,2022-10-11 15:53:12
3017," All of this implies that even if we're seeing a pullback generally potentially and things like software spending that maybe you're not seeing that in your business or are you what are you seeing right now among your clients at a time where we're seeing that increased volatility. So it's interesting as a platform provider we're neutral. So we don't really have a dog in the fight we observe. We want to provide the service. Well you're neutral but your clients who make their money on it are not necessarily neutral. Right. So are they pulling are they even trenching? Yes. So what we're seeing is three or four really defined areas with the European uncertainty with the Ukraine situation with an energy crisis with the political environment here in the US all that rising interest rates rising inflation all that's factoring into the psyche of the advisor and the end of client. So what we are observing on our platform is where the money is going. So we're actually standing back and saying okay where are the advisors allocating so they're allocating to macro strategies right now. Edge fund strategies that are nimble and opportunistic. They're allocating to private credit and real assets. So it's quite interesting to see the ebbs and flows of capital flows into different strategies based on the current economic environment. Well we'll have to catch up with you again in a few months and see where those flows are going. Matt Brown, Fender and CEO of Case. Thank you so much. Thank you so much. Appreciate it. Keep it right here and much more Yahoo Finance coming your way next. Well a few cases from the Supreme Court that we're watching this morning the first being a possible rolling on a California law that affects animal welfare. Alexis Keenan is here to tell us more on that. Alexis. Hi, Ekiiko. Yeah, so this is a $26 billion industry, the pork industry. So the court's decision here will matter tremendously for these litigants. Now the Supreme Court is hearing oral arguments today in this case and it's brought by the National Port Producer's Council along with the American Farm Bureau Federation against the state of California, which in 2018 adopted a law that said any of the uncooked pork sold in the state must come from animals that were kept in pens that were at least 24. So that's a huge change for square feet of living space. Now that is 10 more square feet than the industry standard. So that is a huge change. The industry folks they say well that's going to drive up the cost of production and they also.",https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9GS0SPvxP2s,29,2022-10-11 15:57:12
3018," That is 10 more square feet than the industry standard. So that is a huge change. The industry folks, they say, well, that's going to drive up the cost of production. And they also say that it will drive up, therefore, the cost of the pork that is sold across the country. Now, they're challenging, making this challenge under the Commerce Clause, and it's particularly the dormant part of the Congress Clause, where Congress doesn't act. They say that that prevents state laws, which it traditionally has done, from disrupting national markets. So they're in court. They're continuing arguments right now about whether or not they will be able to block California from using this role. Really quickly. Another case that you're watching that could affect fair use? Yes. So this is the fair use doctrine that we even as news broadcasters use. It affects artists. It affects teachers. Those who take works of art and use them and change them so that they can use them either temporarily. Or in a transformative way. And this case comes after the late Andy Warhol's images were used by Condi Nast in a 2016 magazine. And there are photos that were taken by the famous photographer Lynn Goldsmith. And they were changed to make these silkscreen images that you see here. And Goldsmith says she wasn't paid for the second time these images were used. And so that has opened up this debate about whether fair use in its old traditional form will be able to exist as is. There's a challenge to the language of this transformative use. So it could really change the way that we use works of art and other images, both in news and across different industries. Okay. Two big cases. We'll continue to watch. Thanks so much for that Alexis. Finally, a developing story that we've been watching right now. Gig economy stocks under pressure coming after the Biden Labor Department released a proposal that could make it possible for gig workers to be reclassified as employees rather than contractors. And we have seen those gig economy stocks take a big hit there. You're taking a look at Uber right now down about 7% lift down more than 8% door dash down 6%. Let's do a final check of the broader markets before we let you go. We are seeing green here at the top of the board here. The S&P 500 now turning into the green here, but the NASDAQ continuing to weigh on the broader markets. Remember yesterday we saw the NASDAQ hit a two year intro day low right now trading pretty flat. That does it for me in this hour. We've got much more to come here and yak to finance life.

3019," Music a little bit of a downward push here to start the week with key earnings and inflation data on tap. Our next guest says investors should look to reach real estate investment trusts. They haven't been immune to recent volatility but are quote well prepared in this current environment. National Association of Reats economist John Worth joined us now. John, you know, I think of REITs as a group that are vulnerable when there's rising interest rate environment for a number of different reasons. They tend to carry relatively high levels of debt, right? So their service and costs are higher. And they're seen as sort of because of their high dividend yields as almost a competing asset for something like treasuries as their yields are going higher. So talk us through why you think they're well positioned here. I'm absolutely happy to do it. You know, I think the view of REITs as being high leverage players is one that is a little bit out of date, frankly. What we've seen is that REIT leverage has been coming down for basically a decade. So today we've got leverage ratios near all time lows. The debt that REITs are holding is quite well termed out. They've got a weighted average term to maturity today of about seven years plus net interest expense as a share of their operating income is at all time lows. And about 85% of their debt is fixed rate. So they're really quite well positioned for a period of rising interest rates. And just as we compare them to other income-generating alternatives, it's important to keep in mind that REITs provide income, but they're not fixed income, right? So they provide both income through their steady dividends as well as capital appreciation opportunities. And typically what we see is that in a period where you're coming out of a, where you're coming out of a potential period of slow growth as we might be in about a year that we see REITs do quite well. So why would someone look at REITs versus, say, high growth internet at this point, even though high growth internet is perhaps being redefined, REITs still have to compete for the same attention when investors are looking to get back into the market as they do against technology or some of the other more flashy names. Yeah, and I think it's important to think about that from a portfolio construction perspective. One of the things we see is that commercial real estate is such a fundamental piece of the overall economy. That's really critical for investors of all types. But is commercial real estate still as necessary if you have less people that are going into offices or there's more of a hybrid work approach? Is it still carrying the same weight? Absolutely. I think you really need to think about the breadth of commercial real estate. I think many investors think about it as office and retail, but it's a really much broader space. So for example, in REITs, you have data centers, cell phone towers, logistics facilities. So you're getting the breadth of the economy that's housing the modern, the breadth of the real estate that's housing the modern economy. So you may feel like hybrid work is going to have people in the office less. That means you're going to have more activity through data centers, cell phone towers, logistics facilities. It reads, provide a way to grab the whole breadth of the real estate space. John, maybe I'm looking at it too simplistically here, but if we are going into recession next year, that might kick people out of their homes. Doesn't that mean some of those public storage?",https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9GS0SPvxP2s,31,2022-10-11 16:05:58
3020," It reads, provide a way to grab the whole breadth of the real estate space. John, maybe I'm looking at it too simplistically here, but if we are going into recession next year, that might kick people out of their homes. Doesn't that mean some of those public storage names should do well, like they did in the Great Recession? Yeah, I don't think public storage and the other self-storage places are really going to benefit significantly from people maybe losing their homes. What we see is that that's a sector where we saw a huge bump during COVID, a huge bump in demand as people used the space they had differently. So they cleared out the guest room, they cleared out the garage and turned those into gyms and maybe schoolrooms in some cases. And that gave a huge bump to self-storage demand. And then that was got another dose of demand as the residential real estate market heated up. As that market falls down, we may see some diminution in demand. But whenever you have people making transitions in their lives, whether that's moving, sending kids to school, bringing kids back into the household, what you see is that they're using self-storage as part of that. All right, you gave me a whole new reason to rewatch storage towards National Association of Reats Economists. John Worth, John, appreciate the time here today. Thanks. A.B. Bernstein is getting bullish on Airbnb. Initiating coverage and outperform what they $143 price target, saying it's rapid and profitable growth removes a key hurdle. It's valuation. Joining us now is Richard Clark, managing director at A.B. Bernstein. Richard, there's a number of things that you highlight here. But really the point being that this isn't just about Airbnb being able to protect its market share and the vacation rental business. You think they could really make a significant play on hotels and experiences as well. Why can't we do that thesis? Yeah, I think that's absolutely right. So we think the vacation rental market is still very exciting. I think it's a big market. It's going to gain share of the overall lodging market. And Airbnb will gain share within that. But probably beyond that, even more exciting, is that ability to sell more than just vacation rental market. It doesn't market as much as other travel platforms. So it has a loyal customer following. It has a very strong brand. We think they can sell longer stays, hotel rooms, experiences, and they can add to its growth. The longer stays have been a real growth spot for Airbnb something they've been highlighting, especially over the course of the pandemic. The hotels specifically, where do you see them making a play when you look at how fragmented the market is right now? Yeah, so I mean, I think actually the hotel market is fragmented. The distribution market is not that fragmented. You've got booking and expedia. They're quite dominant in their respect to geography. So I think the actual hotels are looking for other distribution channels to broaden their landscape a little bit. And I think Airbnb is unique in the sense that it does try and inspire the customer. You know, it's got this category-based search. It tries to find a way to match the customer.",https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9GS0SPvxP2s,32,2022-10-11 16:10:09
3021," and their landscape a little bit. And I think Airbnb is unique in the sense that it does try and inspire the customer. You know, it's got this category-based search. It tries to find a way to match the customer and the product up in the way that we don't see in other companies. And I think that gives it a way to make a play in hotels. So you see the platform evolving into a place where hotels can also list their openings? Well, they're already on. I mean, there are already tens of thousands of hotels listed on Airbnb, or hotels in the night. They signed a deal with Side Minder. They signed a deal with OVO. And that gave them probably somewhere around 70 to 80,000 hotels. But that's only just scratching the surface. There's probably 10 times that many hotels in the world. And I think through COVID, they focus on the core business. And hotels is one thing that they can try and re-ignite post the other side of COVID. And yet put it alongside the vacation rentals on its platform. Richard, we've been talking so much about a lot of these companies within the sharing economy, whether that's in Uber, food delivery, Airbnb among them. They all started after the great recession. And it was sort of an earlier days used as a platform for a lot of people to make some extra cash on the side. How much of a catalyst do you think? If we are looking at a further downturn in the macro picture, I mean, could that be a potential catalyst for Airbnb to bring in more hosts and really expand the platform in a way? Yeah, I think that's right. I mean, I think first of all, there's quite a lot of dormant hosts on Airbnb, like there's a lot of listening that haven't taken a booking in the last year. And maybe that's because of COVID, nervousness around that. So maybe part of it is bringing existing hosts back onto the platform. And then, yeah, I think beyond that, there probably are other people that will need to supplement their income. They'll need to offset the fact that maybe they're paying higher mortgage costs or higher rental costs. And that may bring entirely new supply to the market. Okay, Amy Burns, see Managing Director Richard Clark, appreciate your time today. Thank you. One of the Fed's biggest critics of late is that it again, speaking on CBS yesterday. Aliens' chief economic advisor, Muhammad Al-Aryan, said he fears, quote, a very high probability of damaging a recession that was totally avoidable. He'll track higher in the aftermath of Friday's jobs, report him, it indications the Fed will need to continue its hiking round. Our next guest says a hard landing is likely. Let's get into the discussion with George O'Bouray. He's all spring, global investments, chief investments, strategies for fixed income. George, that doesn't sound promising. Hi, Kiko, thanks for having me on the show. It's a rough backdrop. It's a rough economic backdrop. And one of the challenges that the Fed faces is that at this juncture in the cycle, good news is effectively bad. And that's simply because the Fed is trying to fight inflation. We know that. They've been at it now for quite some time throughout this year. They still feel behind the curve. We're going to see the data. We're going to see a new set of inflation data on Thursday with the CPI report. Expectations are. Headline CPI should come down a little, but core inflation is likely to keep rising. And it's really.",https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9GS0SPvxP2s,33,2022-10-11 16:14:45
3022," Thursday with the CPI report, expectations are, you know, headline CPI should come down a little, but core inflation is likely to keep rising. And it's really, when you take that inflation data, plus the strong, relatively strong employment data from Friday, it would suggest that the economy in the US is still expanding and it's still chugging along at a pretty good pace. And the Fed has told us very clearly that they want to slow that down. So from other commentators from us as well, the expectation is the Fed's going to get what they want. They need to slow growth. They will slow growth. And if you look into the first half of next year, the sort of lag defect of all these rate hikes should start to bite. And so the probability of a recession, it's going up. And we think it's actually going up fairly quickly. And that's likely to really start to unfold as we get into the beginning part of next year. So how does that set things up going into the next FOMC meeting? And there's certainly a debate on this sidelines that's happening about whether, in fact, the Fed should maybe pause a bit here to really allow for those rate hikes that have already been implemented to take root. Are we getting any indications of that potential pause, especially when you say the risk of a recession is growing? Well, the Fed has kind of painted themselves into a box. They've said that they're going to respond to the data and they've sort of taken a much more of a near term approach. They need to see current data demonstrate that inflation is coming down on a sustained basis. That takes sort of multiple months. It's going to take time. It's also going to require a broadening out of the data. So the Fed doesn't have a lot of wiggle room in here from our perspective. They need to continue to tighten and tighten policy. The question is, is simply how fast? A pivot at this point, at best case scenario from a pivot standpoint, is they're able to decelerate the pace of rate hikes. Now, if Wednesday's data surprisingly comes in below expectations on both the headline and a core basis, that might provide the window of hope or open the window, if you will, for a bit of hope that a pivot of sorts might be coming. But it's still premature in our opinion. You haven't seen that sort of clear evidence to give the Fed kind of cover to really start to pivot. Now, the one thing that is not really discussed all that much is just market volatility. Volatility in the bond market is very high right now. And it's likely to stay high as long as these expectations for tighter policy continue. With high volatility, some comes sort of a lot of movement in prices by definition, but liquidity also tends to dry up. If the market kind of ceases to function, well, then the Fed will have to do something. But we're not at that point yet. The market's functioning at a slow pace, but it is still functioning. George, really quickly here, it is a holiday today, but when you look at where the 10-year yield has tracked, I mean, we're off of that level of just being under four, but we're still at 3, 8, 8, based on Friday's close. How much, where do you expect it to track, at least in any turn? Yeah, that's a good point. There's a big distinction between the front end of the curve and the longer end of the curve. We've repriced up, if you will, we're up about 25 basis points or so on the 10-year. As you mentioned, up around 3, 88, 4% is our number that we expect the 10-year to consolidate around that number. We would say plus or minus 25 basis points on each side of 4%. Is really our central case as we go into the end of the year. The front end, the Fed has also been pretty clear. They want to get the front end up to about 4.5% by year end. So a 50 basis point spread, say, between the two-year and the 10-year with the two-year above the 10-year, that would be pretty consistent with tight monetary policy, restrictive monetary policy, and that should help slow growth as we go into next year.

3024," And how quickly would you be able to move on that, specifically on LNG? Well, we're urging Congress and the Administration to act quickly on all components of this plan. I think on LNG, it's really a question of a commitment from the government to expedite applications, a commitment from Europe to build down the necessary infrastructure to take the natural gas into its countries. But there is a commitment there on both sides, and so what we need is an acceleration of that. The oil and gas industry stands ready to help. There is another, I am, a legislation that's been floating around for some time, and this is no PAC, specifically stands for no oil producing and exporting cartels act. This would essentially empower the Justice Department to go after OPEC under anti-trust rules if they are seen as setting or at least trying to attempt to control the price of oil. The Biden Administration, at least in their statements, seems to suggest they want to revisit that. But I know API has specifically been very opposed to this idea. Why? This policy has been opposed on both sides of the aisle and from administrations in both parties. The real way to get OPEC is to produce more energy here in the United States. And the way to do that is to lift the pause that the administration has had on leasing. Look, at this point in the Obama administration, they had issued 60 leases for oil and gas development. At this point in the Biden Administration, they're just at six. And so if the administration wants to get serious about energy security and energy independence, it needs to look right here at home, and it needs to provide a pathway for more energy production here in the United States. Finally, Frank, you sort of alluded to the need for more exports coming out of the US at a time when there are concerns about supply globally. You have put out a letter here saying that any kind of export ban we're talking about diesel, but also refined products would deplete inventory levels and it would put upward pressure on consumer fuel prices. Of course, the administration argument would be, we'll add a time when there was concerns about supply crunch, that supply should be left domestically. So walk me through your calculation. Why does this deplete supply in your opinion? And why would that push prices higher? Sure, it's not our opinion in July of this year, the American Council for Capital Formation studied this issue. They found that an export ban on refined product would end up cutting refinery capacity by 1.3 million barrels per day here in the United States. It would end up raising costs for fuel for consumers across the United States. It would cost jobs, about 85,000 jobs would be lost under such a policy. And finally, it would harm American GDP. And so for all of those reasons and for American energy security, the refined export product ban is a bad idea. Finally, this administration has made a commitment to our allies overseas to other countries that we support. To Latin America, where we export an enormous amount of refined product, it's made a commitment to those allies that we're going to continue to provide the energy that we have right here in the United States. I see no reason why the administration should turn its back on that commitment. And it would certainly imposing such a policy would certainly not help the American consumer. And where are those conversations stand right now with the administration? I know there's been a bit of a back and forth. Oftentimes, it has been reported as being a little more contentious. In terms of specifically an export ban, what's your understanding of where the administration stands? Well, we've made the case. We've laid out the data that shows that such a policy would have negative implications for the American people, for the driving public. I think the administration understands that. I think they understand that these are global products that require global markets. I think they also understand that the United States says world-class leading refineries, and they produce the fuels that the world needs. And so we're hopeful that the administration steps back from considerations of export ban, whether it's crude oil, refined product, or L.A.",https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9GS0SPvxP2s,36,2022-10-11 16:27:46
3025," that the world needs. And so, you know, we're hopeful that the administration steps back from considerations of export ban, whether it's crude oil, refined product, or LNG, frankly looks toward American energy production as the solution. We've set all along the solution to the challenges that we face, actually lie under our feet because of innovation and technology. We've increased production here in the United States from seven million barrels to 12 million barrels per day. We can do more, but we need the policies in place to help us achieve that. Frank McEarola, API Senior Vice President of Policy Economics and Regulatory Affairs, appreciate your time today. Sure, thank you. So, let's take a while to look on market, TD Ameritrade out with its Investor Movement Index, showing traders to go more risk off approach in September for more about what these results mean and what's driving the trends. Let's bring in Sean Cruz, TD Ameritrade Head, trading strategists. Sean, these notes are always really interesting to me, a very good gauge of where the retail investor stands feels like it's pretty much tracking with the rest of the market. Things just aren't feeling very good. Yeah, I think right now, we got a little bit of a head fake back in August. There was actually recovery. For the first time this year, we actually had that Investor Movement Index tick higher. And I think that quickly got wiped off the table in September. So, what we did see in what clients were buying, they were certainly being a little bit more conservative and that they weren't going out there buying some of the more speculative areas of the market, some of the more speculative names that maybe aren't profitable right now or just have some very high multiples. They're not really reaching for those right now. They're going back to some of the more familiar established names out there. In some cases, really looking at names with quality fundamentals, be that solid revenues, solid cash flow, healthy balance sheets, leverage was another thing that they certainly have been a little bit wary of as we're starting to see rates tick higher and higher that is going to impact some of those more highly leveraged companies versus the more fundamentally sound companies. So, they still found some opportunities out there but they certainly are a little bit cautious right now and I think that makes sense. And we're going to get to some of those names we just showed on the screen there, but probably speaking, what has led to the sell-off that you have seen exiting of positions? Is it really just about the Fed? I think that really was what drove that optimism in August and that light at the end of the tunnel from the Fed, Pausian or potentially even reverse in some of those rate hikes gave it drove a lot of optimism, but like I said, that light at the end of the tunnel ended up being a train coming your way instead. And that really drove that shift in sentiment in that not only were we getting some data that did indicate they haven't made significant progress. They are starting to have an effect, look at housing for instance, but they're the Fed kept coming out. Whenever the market would give a little bit of a pop of optimism, you would almost have a Fed speaker somewhere and somewhere come out and say, look, we're not stopping. This is something we are committed to. I think they're coming around to that notion and that's why we're trading down at the...",https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9GS0SPvxP2s,37,2022-10-11 16:31:56
3026," I'm gonna work about and say, look, we're not stopping. This is something we are committed to. I think they're coming around to that notion and that's why we're trading down at these levels. I think the market's gonna respond differently to maybe a hawkish Fed when we're trading at 3600 on the S&P 500 versus say trading up at 4,040, 200. So I do think a lot of that is now priced in if things get significantly worse and that's why we just spoke about the bank earnings. That is going to be huge. The macro read through on what we hear from the banks. I think it's really gonna set the tone for the rest of earnings seasons. And I think the market is also going to change their macro outlook based on what we hear. So let's talk about some of those names that we have seen big moves in. In terms of net buyers, we're seeing a lot of the chip makers. You could argue that's part of evaluation play given just how far some of these names have pulled back. But in terms of those that are being sold, Exxon mobile and BP, an interesting one to me because energy has been pretty strong. Is this sort of the expectation that we have reached the peak with some of these names and the pullback is coming? That is where we see that type of activity. I don't think anyone expects crude oil to completely fall apart anytime soon. But I do think they're looking at it from a little bit more of a valuation standpoint. And we've seen that where you get these energy companies trading towards the bottom of their range. That's where there's a lot of interest in buying when they recover and they start hidden towards the upper end of those ranges. That's where they rotate out of those. So I think it's an interesting strategy. It's more of a short-term strategy. I think we see playing out, but they use those profits when they do decide to roll out and lower exposure in those names. We actually do see them going out there and trying to find opportunity elsewhere. And I, semiconductors last month, was that key spot. I think we saw a lot of interest on the buy side. Certainly today I think caught a lot of people off guard. If you look at the semiconductors that are really getting hit, it's the semiconductor companies that really have a lot of exposure to that relationship with China and just what goes on the entrepreneur offshore aspect of their supply chains. But I think what they were looking at, if you look at the charts, AMD, NVIDIA, Intel, all those names were hitting the support levels. And when you see the support levels, these ranges, they start to approach the lower end. That's where you get a lot of buying activity. I'm going to venture, guess we look at this again next month. We're going to see a lot of selling as they broke through some of those. I was going to say, I wonder if some of that buying holds, especially as we get these warnings about demand, especially from a lot of these big chip makers, TSMC and other ones. We're expected to hear from this week. Sean Cruz, a TD Ameritrade, head trading strategist. Thanks so much for joining us today.",https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9GS0SPvxP2s,38,2022-10-11 16:36:34
3027," Well, German carmaker Sonomotors is on a mission to make mobility and growing megacities. More sustainable for more on that, the CEO of the EV startup, standing by with our very own pros, supermanian, live from the NASDAQ, pros. That's right, if you can hear it, the NASDAQ Sonomotors actually listed on the NASDAQ, their German company listed here. They have their Sion solar powered EV here, by the behind us. Joining me now is CEO, Lauren Hahn. So Lauren talked to us about the Sion, the here in the States. What's going on exactly? Sure, a nice to be here. This is the first solar electric vehicle being affordable. We brought it the first time to the US, first hand, first day here. Incredible car, $25,000, family, apparently affordable solar cells in the whole car body. It's re-churching itself and it's really meant to be that mass market electric vehicle. You know when I mentioned this to people before they talked to me, you've got a solar powered car, that's not totally true. You've got to look at it and plug it in to get more power. What kind of solar power, what kind of range are we going to get capture from the sun for those people? Yes. Giving you an example, beautiful day here in the US and New York. We have 12 miles per day being commuted in the city on average. This car is re-churching at 13 miles a day. It's 7th, 7th tea miles a week on average. That's amazing because that means no re-churching for most of the commuters. That's the big asset about electric vehicles, re-churching. We're in part, we're in a charging station, range anxiety, all that stuff. That's what people are worried about and this car is still solving that issue. So you know, this car has a total range of around 200 miles per charge. What you're saying is that, given how people use the car normally, you can basically capture as much solar power as you need to use the car on a regular basis, let's say you can get your car on by miles each way. So what we're saying is for most people, it makes sense for solar. Exactly. Commuters. People are using the car to get from A to B to work, right? And they're not driving like 200, 300 miles to work. No, they're driving on average 12 miles as a set. This car is re-searching itself. That's the biggest hurdle about electric vehicles and we're solving it. So where are you guys going to launch it? You're in Germany, what's the rollout to this car exactly? So the first launch is in Europe. We have 42,000 down payments and brewers in total from B to B and B to C. And we're right now, you know, bringing out the plan for the US. We have a great plan for the US. There's huge potential here. We see huge potential for suburban markets here. Family-friendly vehicles affordable $25,000. So taking kind of a step back with this car, $25,000, very affordable. You do the solar power element. Why did you guys decide that was the way to go for EVs? Not just the grid, but capturing from the solar power plants to get every day. Well, because I, you know, myself asked myself, what's a great product? And I'm living in the furt floor and don't have an own house. I don't have a own garage. And I asked myself, where do I charge? Where do I charge my electric vehicle, right? And I came always through the conclusion, it's not working. I need something more than that. And that's why we integrate it solar because we believe it's convenience. It's extending your range. It's highly affordable because you don't have to pay for high electricity bills there, right? Yeah. And is there more incentives in places like Europe for those sort of thing? Or is it sort of a cross-core? Are you guys getting any kind of incentive? Well, there are incentives for electric vehicles, I think across the world. And every own country, you get like certain incentives. There are countries starting to incentive by a solar electric vehicle. Take a Holland and Holland Derries and incentive for solar electric vehicles. So on top of the electric vehicle centers, in centers you get a solar.",https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9GS0SPvxP2s,39,2022-10-11 16:40:55
3028," Take Holland and Holland Derrius and incentive for solar electric vehicles. So on top of the electric vehicle centers, you get a solar electric vehicle center. So you see the whole industry is changing to solar electric vehicles. As we believe, the next big thing in the electromobility. So what are we talking about in terms of free orders here for the car globally? And also you got some deals in the works with car sharing, right? Yes. Yes. Right. As mentioned, 42,000 downpapers and free orders. It's 22,000 B2SBE and 20,000 B2C reservations. The B2C reservation being downpainted with amazing 2,000 euros an average. So sticky, real reservations. People putting down 2,000 euros for this car on the waiting list. Amazing. And with that, we have the full auto book already for Europe. Right now going on tour here. New York, Boston, Detroit, San Francisco, NLA. And we'll test the demand there. We already get great feedback. You also have this deal with FID, which I believe is a rental car company. Yes. How does that work? It's a subscription car company. They ordered just 12,600 cars. It's an amazing order. We have so much more potential in the B2B sector. This is the perfect car for being an Uber driver, for being delivery service, for being a subscription car model. We believe there's so much more potential out there. So real quick, we talk about this deal with FID. You guys using valnet to actually make the cars, because you have cars with a third party manufacturer. Yes. How soon are we going to see these cars in the road? Four planets to launch this car and produce this car in the second half of next year. We have a great partnership with the volumetric. There are being very experienced over 40, 50 years of building cars. They currently producing the Diameter GLC and GLA. So they know how to produce cars. And we believe we will not have production hell as you call it. Because we have outsourced the production to someone who actually knows how to produce electric vehicles. So second half of next year, potentially in Europe. And then maybe in the US we'll see the tour is happening right now across the United States. Exactly. Lauren Hunt. Thanks so much, Sonomotors. Back over to you, Kiko. I know there's a bit of a delay between us, but really quickly I'm seeing people check out the car behind you. When Lauren doesn't let you take a ride. Yeah, what are we going to get to ride in this car, Lauren? I'll soon. Oh, yeah, you can actually tomorrow. Tomorrow. So today here is a little difficult. Tomorrow we will have some test rides. So sign up on our website and you can come and grab a ride with this vehicle. All right, thanks, Kiko for putting that up for me. Oh, yeah, to see you with that. I know you've driven many of these EVs. I'm going to be curious to get your review on that. I'll probably thank so much for that. A live press from the NASDAQ Market Sightner.

3029, you The Dobie Analytics forecast online sales in November and December to rise just 2.5% percent that's the slowest rates since 2015 and also it compares to 8.6% just a year ago where we headed Christine short as the VP of research for Wall Street horizon Christine nice to see you so I guess tomorrow is kind of like Black Friday on a Tuesday in early October it's a little confusing how much does this change everything these October sales in terms of traditional holiday sales? Well we've been seen as for a few years right like the Black Friday the holiday sales keep getting moved early and earlier and that's because consumers are demanding it they want to spread out their shopping over a longer period of time it used to be a day after Thanksgiving through cyber Mondays you know you got about five days of deals now you've got a couple months of deals so I think we're responding to consumer demand I think it's also really smart for a lot of these retailers Ali mentioned it's not just Amazon but it's Target Walmart you've got some of the department stores may see these coals bed bath and beyond they're all doing this because what research and which surveys have shown is that consumers are getting a little more anxious about inflation they feel okay about their job position unemployment so very historically low but as the year goes on something consumers are looking at so why not get your holiday shopping out of the way now what does it mean for shopping later I think it just spreads out a little more you might actually have a chance to get more money out of consumers but I think by front loading it it's a very smart thing and I think those that are there's always got your late shoppers there will still be people shopping throughout the rest of the year but I think it's smart to start it earlier this year yeah you're talking about me and Sean Smith I'm usually December 23rd ish I'm still waking up to the pumpkin spice latte which was like two months ago axios as a story today saying the traditional holiday shopping season is dead is that true I don't know about that some people really like to do it just as an activity with their family to go in person the day after Thanksgiving but yeah it's certainly taking a big hit here right and like I said this has been a trend that's that's been ongoing the last few years but as far as the you know shopping online is still you know continuing to pick up from popularity doesn't mean people aren't going to be spending right a national retail federation with their holiday forecast and survey show that yeah two-thirds of people are still going to spend on gifts on celebrations this year they feel like they haven't been able to do as much last couple of years because of COVID restrictions so whether it means you know taking out of savings or redirecting money that would some otherwise go somewhere else or even going into credit card debt they will be spending money this holiday season now that we're kind of getting back to normal the story of this retail year has been an inventory issue too much of it is that still the case and is there anyone that got it right yeah you know we went into this saying you know the bigger sophisticated retailers like your target like your Walmart they they set up for last holiday season we thought they were going to get it right they weren't new to this clearly they didn't there was loads of inventory on the shelves for many of those big retailers I think we've had over a year now to get it right so I think retailers heading into this holiday season are certainly in a better position so that's not as much of a concern this year and so I think that that's one thing we don't necessarily have to worry about costs are still very high right so we're talking a little about Amazon here despite the fact that this is probably going to be a great prime event the costs over the last few quarters have been eating into those revenues so that's something we're going to look out for as well is this a positive story though will it be for the holiday season this bulk and inventory should,https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9GS0SPvxP2s,41,2022-10-11 16:49:12
3030," into those revenues, so that's something we're going to look out for as well. Is this a positive story, though? Will it be for the holiday season? This bulk and inventory should result in discount should be a deflationary and even a positive Fed story, although not a great earning story. Yeah, like Ali said, it's anything to push the inventory and to give deep discounts. So it is a complex situation where you've got higher costs and inflation is creating higher costs for everything, right? But the consumer really wants value right now. So you have to be offering discounts and some of the ones that we've seen already as advertised from target from Amazon, we're talking 50 to 80% off of some of the most popular items. So they're actually willing to take a hit in some ways just to get to the consumer who really is looking for the deepest discounts possible right now. So promotions are going to be huge and pushing out some of that extra inventory. On a great investor's story, but it is a good consumer story. Want to come full circle back to the story we started with where online sales rising just 2.5%. But the brick and mortar stories, the real fascinating one, more stores opened in 21 then close for the first time since 1995, according to Morgan Stanley, what is the deal with brick and mortar making a comeback? You know, I think people miss that. They miss the brick and mortar. We've seen, like you said, e-commerce sales have come down since the peak of COVID where they were really at their highest. So I think you're going to see more of a blend this year, whereas the story, the last like 10 years for holiday shopping has been that e-commerce it's continuing to pick up. But I think again, it's more of an activity. It's something to do together with friends with family. And so people like going out there, they like looking at the items are buying and honestly, retailers like that too, because there's less things getting returned. And that's what we're seeing a third of things bought online and up getting returned because you really haven't had a chance to see and experience it. So if they can get you to buy in brick and mortar, retailers are going to be pretty happy about that. Reports of brick and mortar's death greatly exaggerated Wall Street Horizon VP of research Christine short. Good to see you. Thanks. I'm you. Kanye West getting suspended on social media over the week and both Twitter and Instagram moving to restrict his accounts following a string of anti Semitic posts. Kanye was first locked out of Instagram which prompted him to take to Twitter for the first time in the world. But this is a very important issue for us for social media companies, willingness to monitor hateful content on their sites. Joining us now for more on this we want to bring in Roger McDonough, Elevation Partners, Managing Director and author of Zuck. Roger, it's great to see you again. Certainly there has been a large debate about content moderation, how how social media comes.",https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9GS0SPvxP2s,42,2022-10-11 16:54:51
3031," managing director and author of Zuck. Roger, it's great to see you again. Certainly there has been a large debate about content moderation. How social media companies should go about this. I guess just from your perspective, what is as hell is just in terms of where we are when it comes to policies and the handling of hate speech on these social media platforms? The context is that six years ago, there was interference in the UK referendum around Brexit and then the US presidential election. Since then, we've had ethnic cleansing in Myanmar. We've had extraordinary number of terrorist events. We've had the COVID pandemic and the undermining of the country's response to that. We've had the insurrection with stop the steal. We've had extraordinary damage done to democracy, to public health, to public safety, to people's ability to make their own choices. And yet, policymakers have done nothing, absolutely nothing. And I think that the whole situation with Kanye West, with Elon Musk attempting to buy Twitter, really highlights the extraordinary inaction. And frankly, in my mind, really unpardonable inaction by Congress, by the President, to do something about what is clearly a threat, not just to safety in the country, but especially the national security. Twitter has a whistleblower who showed that there are people inside Twitter who are working for foreign governments. And for a platform that has as much influence on politics and democracy as Twitter has, that's extraordinarily dangerous. And so Roger, where does the conversation go in terms of accountability for those posting, as well as those moderating, and the pace at which they're able to monitor these things? So I'm not at all confident that we can fix this problem. There are three aspects of it. The first is the scale of the platforms. Facebook, for example, where the worst offenses have taken place has literally billions of posts every day. So the notion that you're going to somehow effectively monitor that number of posts is a big stretch. The second problem is latency, the amount of time, even if you had enough moderators, even if the artificial intelligence worked, which it doesn't. But even if those things worked perfectly, there's still going to be a lag. And the problem is the harm gets done in the first seconds after these harmful posts are put out. The third problem is one of incentives. And this is the one that's killing us, because there is no reason from an economic perspective why these companies should look out for the safety of their users, much less protecting the country's national interest. Right now, the incentives are for them to make as much money as they can, as quickly as they can, and not worry about the consequences. And until that changes, I don't think there's a chance we're going to do anything good about this. There are exceptions. When somebody's really, really bad, the way the Kanye West was this weekend, you will see politically it becomes impossible for these guys not to act, but the rest of the time they're going to do nothing. We'll see how long that ban lasts. Rogers, you know, California has acted when it comes to social media companies. And now, Section 230, at least, is on the plate of the Supreme Court. How, if at all, do you think this could change the situation? You know, it's very, very hard to tell. Section 230 is incredibly important, because what it does is it gives platforms the legal right to maintain the environment of their choosing. So that part of it's really, really good. Where I think things went off the rails is that the platforms chose, because the economics were better, to favor harmful content over good content. Basically hate speech, disinformation, and conspiracy theories are extraordinarily profitable because they trigger flight or fight, so people have to pay attention. And in a business where attention is everything, that kind of content is gonna rise to the surface repeatedly. So we have to change those incentives. I do not think 230 is the way to do that. I think the thing you have to do is to regulate the business model, which is called surveillance capitalism, is this notion that you gather all the data about people, and you use it to manipulate their choices, and to manipulate their behavior. That must change. And we also have to have laws that require safety. The same way we require safety for transportation or healthcare or other things. We need to require safety around these platforms, because the companies have to have an incentive to protect the people who use their systems. And Roger from the conversation.",https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9GS0SPvxP2s,43,2022-10-11 16:58:25
3032," or health care or other things. We need to require safety around these platforms because the companies have to have an incentive to protect the people who use their systems. And Roger, from the conversations that you're having from people within the industries, from lawmakers, from what we're hearing, just from Capitol Hill, I guess, how confident are you that we will actually see some change? And what does that mean then for some of the largest players in this space like meta and Twitter? I'm not at all confident. We are making progress, but it is incredibly slow in comparison to the damage that these companies are doing. And when I first started talking about this publicly in 2017, it was really obvious to me that the issue was that the culture, the business model, and algorithms of platforms could undermine democracy and civil rights. I went to Congress in the spring and summer of 2017 and then continued to push them to try to do something about it. More than five years have gone by. Several elections have gone by. And insurrection has gone by. A pandemic has been amplified. And yet nothing has been done. So I don't have a lot of confidence because the pressure from the public doesn't exist. And until people start saying, wait a minute, we rarely really value democracy, we really value our public health, we really value public safety. And we recognize that these companies are at danger. Nothing's gonna happen. And Roger, as we saw with Twitter, as they began batting people, we saw apps like Truth Social, some of these other more siloed avenues also pop up as well. What does that do to this picture when you're trying to want to tell these different things, but then having these different siloed platforms coming up as well? To be clear, I think that in the United States, people should be free to say the things that they feel and believe. But not all forms of speech are protected by the First Amendment. You're not allowed to yell fire in a crowded theater. You're not allowed to threaten elected officials. There are lines that people should not be allowed to cross. And the problem we have today is there is no enforcement of those lines. In fact, the lines, I think everybody knows where they are. We just choose to not engage with it. And I don't know how we're gonna solve that problem. I am hopeful. There is more progress today than there's been any time in the last five years, but it's so slow. And I do believe that politicians and frankly, journalists and the citizens, would rather not disrupt the convenience of the status quo to deal with hard problems like this. And I think it's a gigantic issue. And then there's the question, Roger, of what would Elon do? How will Elon Musk impact the situation when you just described if and when he owns Twitter? So the exciting thing for investors is that it does appear that Elon Musk's position in the Delaware Chancellor Court is very bad. So the odds of either a court decision or action by Musk to complete the deal are higher than they've been at any time in this process. And even if he finds a way to weasel out, it looks to me as though it's gonna cost him more than just the breakup fee. So investors in Twitter are probably pretty well positioned, the short term. I can't say the same for America. I mean, the problem with Twitter is they've done a horrible job for years at managing the discourse on the platform. And there's no evidence that Elon Musk has a plan to improve that. In fact, it's not clear what plan he has at all. And what has happened over the last couple of weeks is the disclosure by the court of the text conversations with prospective investors has been super embarrassing for those investors. And that creates some doubt about financing of the deal. And so I don't quite know how this is going to play out at the deal level. What I'm really worried about is that the company will go into a situation where not even investors will be able to have any influence on the outcome. And in that situation with somebody like Musk who seems to rejoice in trolling others and seems to think the trolling is like a really positive value, that for platform where all of politics, all of journalism, and all of celebrity, does its communication, that's just going to increase terrible outcomes. And certainly be tested again in the midterm elections coming up. A big thank you to Roger McDonnelly for joining us this afternoon.

3033," That's just gonna prove terrible outcomes. And certainly be tested again in the midterm elections coming up. A big thank you to Roger McDonnelly for joining us this afternoon. Thank you so much. In this episode of Influencers, Quarkron Group founder, Barbara Quarkron. Well, I see the business as an extension of the person who runs it. Short and simple. I see it on Shark Tank. So much money invested in things that make absolutely no sense. I get so much satisfaction out of helping my businesses that I've invested in. Not because I'm making money over that helps a lot I find after a few years. But I love seeing someone with a dream and thinking I'm part of getting into that dream. Hello everyone and welcome to Influencers. I'm Andy Sirward and welcome to our guest Barbara Quarkron founder of the Quarkron Group. We're hosting a host of the podcast on usual business and shark and executive producer on ABC's Shark Tank. Barbara, welcome. Great to see you. Pleasure to be here with you. Thanks. So want to ask you a little bit about this economic environment. Conflation seems to be roaring back and I'm wondering if if people should really take this into account right now and individual or a couple who are looking to make a big purchase or should you try to time it and wait it out. You should move faster because houses are only getting more expensive. It's harder to get your hands on something that you even find acceptable to live with never mind something you've been dreaming about. Interest rates are still low although they've been creeping up and they have promised to continue to go up. And so there's nothing to be gained by waiting whatsoever. Absolutely nothing. You weren't smart enough to get into the market two years ago, a year ago, the idea right now is get into it as fast as you can if you really want to home and beyond the home front. I think it's probably the best market I have ever seen for real estate investing. I think the return on investment is phenomenal and has been in so many markets and so many cities throughout throughout the US. I don't want to see a kinko wrong, but it's probably the best market I've ever seen in my life. So I think real estate is a champion. I'm not saying that because that's my gig because I invested a lot of stuff. But I'm saying it because I've never seen it more tantalizing and with more promise. You want to pick up on that last point, which is real estate is an investment, not your home per se, but I guess you're talking about like a rental property or something like that. I think that's a property or a building with five or six units of 20 units. The numbers there, the returns people are getting are really surprising. Why is that exactly so in other words, because they're such demand and that rates are still low enough to make your cost of capital still pretty good. And so one day was a shyness in the market. People were slow to respond to investment real estate. Now everybody's jumping into it, but it kind of lag behind all of the kinds of investments. So you had a little rest period. Secondly, the rents have been going up nationally. And if you choose your properties carefully, like if you're investing, say in Orlando, rents are up almost 30% crazy. And you can make sure what that does to the bottom line. And very importantly, which we all take for granted, like our right to breathe money so cheap. And so you could leverage really high. So so I even in New York City, which has gone through a really tough period because of all the changes. Albany that make it really almost untenable to make money here as an investor. And so people have stopped buying, they've moved them money elsewhere. And there's so many opportunities to buy and get very good returns because rents keep going up. Yeah, I want to drill down some of those specific markets for wherever you mentioned Orlando is hot New York is problematic. What are some other areas that are either hot or cold or things are catching your eye? Well, I should have a chart in front of me because I keep a chart and I can't remember what order they are. But you have a Houston is a very vibrant market and rentals and prices on investment real estate is still not catching up to it from what I could see. Pittsburgh is mind boggling.",https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9GS0SPvxP2s,45,2022-10-11 17:06:55
3034," Houston is a very vibrant market in rentals and prices on investment real estate is still not catching up to it from what I could see. You see Pittsburgh is mind boggling. Pittsburgh is probably where I've really put more of my money in the last two years and anywhere else. And the reason for it is people didn't take it seriously. It's not considered a major city. But there's been so much technology that has moved in there. It's got the most educated populations. It's got a friendly government that loves development. They have no rent restrictions or in control. So it's almost like a cowboy land. You could really gallop out of the gate and make money right from the get go. And that's exactly what I'm happy. I shouldn't even say it because I don't want any competition. But now everybody is discovering it. But the minor cities pretty much with, I don't forget which city just announced ring control boy I backed out of that so fast. But most of the secondary cities are doing very very well. You almost got a dark board. Throw the dart there. Be OK. You got the Steelers to what about New York City? I mean, we're talking about, you know, an extreme luxury market. What are the dynamics going on in here in the big apple? I am telling you that super duper luxury market has totally changed, particularly over the last three months. If you're a really wealthy person, you want to make a statement and get a trophy property. You'll be competing with a bunch of other giant egos with a fatter wall at the new half, right? The super luxury market is suddenly a shortage of listings. I never thought a year ago, I would say that. But there's overbidding on new development sites. On the upper side, there's one building that's going as a starting point 20% over asked for the date open the door two months ago. Make no sense. It was over price to be with the now it's going 20% over as the developers celebrating the luxury market. I can't imagine stopping and the new developments, although I see cranes all over town, just can't keep up with the demand. That's right. The top end. That's a top end. You know, what about the middle line? Everything else. Well, the middle in New York today is get a three to five million dollar apartment in middle class, right? The middle market is a shortage of listings. If you're in a co-op, they don't sell nearly as well. So if you have a condominium, just because it's such a preference for the condo product over the co-op, particularly in the last two years, don't really why that's changed. And if you're looking for a small piet of tear for your kid that's going to NY, you forget about it. You might as well just keep them at home and lock them up. It's just to damn expensive. Real surprises of those units are going up like 20%. And if you want to rent something, I know I own a lot of rental billings in New York where I have a lot of those type of rich kids, the parents guarantee the least, which makes you feel really cozy at night. But those rents, you, I mean, it's a bidding war on every single apartment, no matter how high you price it when it comes to market. And just it Hudson Yars doing okay, that things getting filled up now. It's working on it. Don't ask me about Hudson Yars because I don't want to do the many damage, but it's not my cup of tea, so to speak. It's a big project over there. Let's just be a big project over there. Yes. Right. Exactly. And what about the future against sort of broadening out nationally, Barbara? What's in store? I mean, is it so just completely rate dependent? It's rate helped. If interest rates, I forget how much they've gone up in since December, like, what is it? Three quarters of a point to their about I think it's it's helped by rate. Okay. That she is helped by cheap rates. If a rate, if the rates go up by one point, you buy less house, you have to cut your budget down a bit while rent prices of pardon me, while house prices are skyrocketing at the same time. So it eliminates more buyers, but I'm not afraid of that. I almost hate to wish it, but it's almost like we need it. We need to comment down, cool it off. But if rates go up by 2%, well, the bottom full out of the market will houses not sell no because it's such a shortage. But does it make fewer buyers compete for those houses most definitely? And so rates rates are always in partnership with real estate. I mean, that's like the foundation of real estate. Can I borrow the money cheap? Well, it doesn't sound like you're that scared of Jay Powell, that right? No, I'm not so I'm not so scared. All right. Shifting gears a little bit. Crypto Bitcoin.",https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9GS0SPvxP2s,46,2022-10-11 17:11:43
3035," Hey, pal, that right? No, I'm not so I'm not so scared. All right, shifting gears a little bit. Crypto Bitcoin. I think you said it would be perfect for real estate transactions. Why do you think that is and you really think that could be a routine way for people to pay for real estate? You know, there's a lot of money passed under the table on high end real estate that people don't know about, you know, what you see as a sales record is sometimes not very sometimes just not really what really which really transacted and that's very clumsy to do and difficult to do. I know crypto currencies because of because of the nature of what they are people would feel comfortable. It would help high end real estate particularly. So I think I don't see why not it's efficient. People believe in it. People are trusting it and I just don't see why that wouldn't become not the norm by any means for the average person but a big piece of the real estate market. Yeah, I do. You guys seen any of that yet actually in your business. We have seen three apartments trade that I know of is this probably much one that I know we've seen three apartments trading the last two years with cryptocurrency. Well, all right, it's coming okay, and then how about even beyond that bar I'm talking about the metaverse. And real estate. you you you you you r U U U N V U U U U U U U U U U U U U U U U U U U U U U T U U T U U What do you think the likelihood that a metaverse real estate investment would pay off down the line? I think, and you know, this is all guesswork. Even people who claim they know what they do are not believe and everybody is just guessing. But if you want to want to add my guesses to the pile, I think the greatest potential in the real estate space in the metaverse certainly is retail and commercial retail because it's being halfway done already that some of these high price brands like Gucci, Lovetown are selling virtual closing as an FTs and there's a large appetite for it. They're buying.",https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9GS0SPvxP2s,47,2022-10-11 17:15:34
3036," that some of these high price brands like Gucci, Loveton are selling virtual clothing as an FTs. And there's a large appetite for it. They're buying. So of course, we need the bridge between the actual clothing that I could see with when I go to the little the little mall I could hold a person my hand, I could buy it actually ordered. That's not far away. So assuming that really happens, that marries, and I don't see why it wouldn't really, I think retail. It could be the best thing that ever, that metaverse could be the best thing that ever happened to retail. I must say so. I also think that the ability to meet with the people that work with you, or people who ability to meet with anyone in the metaverse, makes the commercial sector very juicy. I really believe that people will do more of business in the metaverse in terms of meeting up. And so that makes commercial space very valuable. I think the question has to be answered is what makes one space more valuable than the other? And why would I pay that and not that? And that's, I think that's going to all come out in the wash over the next couple of years. Certainly, I know it's a odd example, but with Snoop Dogg offering parcels right next to our house. I took that very seriously, because suddenly there was a differentiation between one lot and another that someone was willing to pay so much to be next to celebrity. Now with the celebrity, they're going to do concerts and entertainment. That's a natural for the metaverse. So you might say, well, that's not true of all real estate, but there's a proof of concept that people will bid high and pay a lot of money to be near something else. And that's what real estate is like in our universe. So I see that as filled with potential that one example. I don't put much credence in the fact that Morgan Guarantee now has what do they have the lounge thing? I just see that as extension of their chimneys, the ego there because you get to see a real live tiger when you walk through his face and then you see a great portrait of the head of the bank. Wow, I really want to buy next to that. Okay, but that's just, I think that's just stealing the headlines that good PR stunt, you know, but I do pay attention to Snoop Dogg most seriously because that is proof of concept. Any big regrets from Shark Tank investing regrets that is? Yeah, I regret the first two years I invested in Shark Tank because I was trying to figure out which businesses were good. In businesses that I had no knowledge of, I know real estate, that's it. But I was trying to figure out, ah, this is a good business. When I finally threw that away on year three, I started making the right choices by just focusing on the entrepreneur. It made it also simple. So I wasted two good years and trying to be who I wasn't, I wasted those two years feeling insecure and second guessing myself. It wasn't any fun. It's only when you're comfortable in your space and you trust in yourself, do you start to have fun? So yeah, I'd rewind and get rid of those first two years away. I was managing them. Hey, do you ever invest in the stock market and in equities and if so or maybe even not if so, what do you like? What do you not? Like what do you think about? I do not and let me tell you why I don't because I like to know what I'm doing. I love control. I invest in real estate. I could smell it. I could feel that I know what I'm doing and I make money. Now, any financial advisor that I've ever talked to said it's not wise to have all my equity in real estate, real estate of this kind and that kind. I listen and I'm sure they're right in theory, but in actuality, they're not right for me. I'm right for me. I know how to do that well and so I stick with my knitting. Let me ask you about celebrity CEOs and, well, Barbara, you might kind of be one, but I'm really talking about, well, I'm talking about you, I guess a little bit, but Elon Musk and his tweeting and Warren Buffett and Zuckerberg are celebrity CEOs good for business and what can be learned from from different models of being a high profile person like that? Depends who you're talking about and our doesn't it? Elon, you mentioned him. He doesn't want people to pay as much attention to his tweets and what's he tweeting for? Of course, he does. Okay. His personal tweets control the value of his business, his personal demeanor.",https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9GS0SPvxP2s,48,2022-10-11 17:19:58
3037," and to his tweets and what's he tweeting for? Of course he does, okay? His personal tweets control the value of his business. His personal demeanor and the way he looks and acts and says kind of a little bit of a wild man, right? People love him. People love him. If you could get your audience to love you, your stock does better. So simple as that. What a great high profile CEO does for a firm is they A, get attention, which is very important, especially when the business is young. And B, they get the right attention if it's a love affair. And people will buy with their heart and justify with their head in that order. I believe in anything. I've learned that my years in business. So people will buy into him and they'll justify that that stock is gonna be amazing. And guess what, they're right because of enough people feel that way the stock keeps rising. Take a Mark Zuckerberg by comparison, okay? Mark Zuckerberg, I always pronounce his name wrong. Mark Zuckerberg, somebody's gotta tell me how to pronounce his name. Dr. Berg. Won't give it to me again. My office says this all day long. What is it? Zuckerberg. Zuckerberg. Yeah, Zuckerberg. Can you hear that? What I just said. How did that? Okay, he's smart and people respond to him, like wow, he was young, so smart, so rich. But unfortunately, he's also sneaky and robotic. And so people don't trust him, like him. Isn't that sad? I don't know if he's trustworthy. I don't know. I don't know a thing about that piece of him. But I can tell you something. Does that work against his value for his business? Yes, it does. It really does, because it's not likeable. All right, take somebody like Jeff Bezos. You know what I thought? When I saw that he lost all that weight and must have had a great personal trainer looking buff and gotta himself a young wife. I thought to myself, good for his stock. Maybe not, but he looks like a guy who looks like a winner when I see him in the pages of the papers. You see, so I don't think you can underestimate the power that a celebrity head can bring to a firm or the damage it could do when it's a wrong messaging. But I think today it's almost essential. I don't think it's an extra. You know, there was a time when we didn't elect celebrities for the highest office in our country, but we have found recently that that's a pretty darn good calling card, you know, same with business. I think things have changed. It's all about marketing, branding, and who puts a face on a brand better than the face? Right. It's essential. I want to ask you a little bit about, well, I guess maybe inequality in our economy and whether or not the deck has stacked increasingly against a little guy in terms of people wanting to start businesses, tech is so big. Rich people are getting richer. Is it that much harder now, Barbara, for someone to start a small business? I don't believe it's harder for someone to start a small business harder to maybe to get the hands on the money, but that's always been hard. And the great majority of the small businesses started in America, don't borrow money. They, you know, they work it off, so to speak. Like I did like so many small businesses did. But is there an inequality, which is your larger question across the board? Of course there is. I've never seen a less balanced America than we're seeing right now. Does a little guy have the same shot they had 10 years ago for anything? No. I mean, do they even have the same shot versus a year ago, no, with inflation doing what it's doing? They get a 3% raise and then inflation goes up 5% so that their money buys less to feed their family. I mean, they re, the lower price the worker in America, the shorter into the stick and the shorter the stick gets. I, I re end for the wealthier people in America. Everybody, I know seems to be making money. I mean, everyone I know who owns businesses through COVID made more money. I really mean it. I have many very well healed friends and they were complaining all the way to the bank. But that's not true of the people, the moms that were staying at home, mining their kids and gave up the second income because the kids couldn't go to school. There is such a breach between the rich and the poor in America that frightens me. I think about it a lot. I should have a solution. I do not at all. But I think about it a lot.",https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9GS0SPvxP2s,49,2022-10-11 17:24:42
3038," between the rich and the poor in America, it frightens me. I think about it a lot. I should have a solution, I do not at all, but I think about it a lot. I think it's very troubling, yes. Yeah, I was gonna ask you if you had any ideas. I mean, one thing is obviously higher taxes and everyone's all up in arms about that, but it is a difficult problem to solve, right? If it wasn't, it would have been solved a while ago. Certainly people are concerned about it. I've talked about it a heck of a long time. As long as I can remember talking myself, it's a difficult problem, so yeah. Let me ask you a little bit about you, Barbara. You grew up in New Jersey. I think you were the second oldest in a family of 10 siblings, is that right? Yeah, that's right. It's a good position actually in a family. Oh, well, I'm talking about that. You talked about the competition for attention from your parents. How do you think that experience formed you? So totally for me, in my family, most of the kids are all entrepreneurs. They are entrepreneurs for one reason. My father was a working man, worked two jobs his whole life and came home and told us how much he hated his boss and quit and got fired and quit and got fired. We all grew up not consciously thinking we wanna be in charge of ourselves, but we are. That was very important. In terms of getting attention, I'm very good at marketing. That comes from being one of 10. I know I had to learn how to speak up, interrupt, and be faster on my feet than the other nine if I was to get my mother's attention because it was spread among 10 kids on my dad's attention. So when you're in a big family, you know, how to get attention, you will somehow how to compete. But the greatest thing, and I'm not stereotyping about all large families, but large families that are led by loving powerful parents. For those kids, they're the luckiest kids in the world because you know what it's like really? It's like growing up in a small...",https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9GS0SPvxP2s,50,2022-10-11 17:28:22
3039," large families that are led by loving, powerful parents, for those kids. They're the luckiest kids in the world because you know what it's like really, it's like growing up in a small town. It doesn't feel like a family. Everybody's got a role. Everybody has a gift. Everybody's demonstrating the gift. You don't get a free ride. You're not helped out, but along the way you get the confidence that you're fine and will do well in life. So we all walked out of that household 18. I mean, none of us were worried about doing well for ourselves. It was embedded in our DNA by our parents who believed we could and we were well equipped with the various traits we had developed. Being in that large family with no money needed to go around and helping out, we all had jobs. I had 22 jobs before I started my real estate business. All of us worked from the time we were 11. Plot time jobs, babysitting, you know, at the kitty pool. Whatever we could get our hands on because we contributed to the household. So we are well equipped for living in a real estate. Right. And you began the real estate career. 20s, you sold it I think for what, 66 million in 2001. Yes. What was the key to building that business, Barbara? Talent. Talent choosing the right people because you have to remember when you have any unbusiness don't wants to work for you. And you don't have the means to buy people. You have to hustle somehow to get some willing souls to come work for you. And so hiring the right people and then the second part is developing their loyalty so they love you and that's easy, easy for me. You just love them really hard and they love you back. It's automatic. That's how you build a business. I mean, that was really my great talent is the right people and knowing how to build a team for sure and getting them so that they would like jump off a cliff for me. And they would because I would have jumped off a cliff for them. And so it was a mutual love affair. That's what built the coming later years I was able to build the coming much faster because I realized I had a gift for marketing. I could make something small, look very big and get everybody to write about it. That's the bullshit factor that you learn in a large family going back to that because you have to be very entertaining to get attention. But those are really the only two gifts I had. But I was able to choose all the right people around me that had all the other many things that I needed to build a big business. And I always had the right people. And finally Barbara, I mean, today you co-host the TV show, podcast speeches, you get some endorsements, you have all manner of projects. What is it that you consider important right now in your life and then even looking ahead your legacy going forward? Well, I don't care about legacy because I'll be dead. So what do I care about? But so far as what's important, I think of pretty much what winds up being important at all of us. I just really want to make a difference. However, I do it. I feel like I make a difference talking to the individual people that call on an 888 Barbara. I think I'm really good at giving advice because I can size up the situation, the person and give them the right advice. And so I do very well with my business unusual podcast, simply because people recognize it as valuable. And I feel really, really good about it. I get so much satisfaction out of helping my businesses that I've invested in, not because I'm making money, although that helps a lot, I find after a few years. But I love seeing someone with a dream and thinking I'm part of getting them to that dream. It's like being a fairy godmother. How many people get to play that in life, right? And so that is again another form of helping someone. So anything that I feel like I helped someone, I seem to make money right away. And I seem to get a lot of love back. So I feel very fulfilled and not empty handed as I get older and older close to that great. All right. That is the one and only Barbara Corcoran. Barbara, thank you so much for your time. My pleasure. Nice hanging out with you. You've been watching Influencers. I'm Andy Sirworth. We'll see you next time. That's a significant consideration for how they've been able to kind of steer the ship over these past few years as consumer taste trends change. Yeah, it's interesting to see that.

Guys, coming up, we're going to do a quick check of the markets. Coming next. Welcome back to Yahoo Finance. Let's get a quick check of the markets here. And it's very simple analysis. Stocks are down. They are not up as traders ultimately await that CPI index read later in the week, which could come in hot and perhaps put further pressure on stocks. But let's stay on the stock market here more broadly. The Dow Jones industrial average is often seen as the most commonly used metrics for stocks, but the average US households. And it would appear that households are taking interest in the market again as the year winds down. Google searches for Dow Jones have picked up over the last month according to the folks at DataTrack Research. And my friend and former Boston Kramer tweeted a good point to me on this chart today. Maybe people are just fed up with the bear market and are looking to sell, sell, sell. Only time will in fact tell if that is correct. Coming up, Amazon Prime Day is back.

3041,"ced Welcome back to Yowl Finance. I'm Brian Sausie here with Brad Smith. We'll hear from Julie Heim and Shirley live from the Grinch economic forum. Our markets are back in a bad mood ahead of Thursday's important consumer price index reading ongoing weakness in European and Asian markets. We're also seeing that way on sentiment as well. Right now all three major indices are in the red. Here's what's on tap for this hour. These Amazon stock primes for gains. Amazon Prime Day 2 is in full effect today. We'll check in with one analyst to see if the spending event will boost Amazon's beat up stock price. And Wall Street out in force pre-earnings. We've got the details on a bullish new call on Chipotle and a less than happy call on Zoom. And chatting with Wales, our Julie Heim will speak with Churchill asset management founder and CEO Ken Kencel from the always high end event known as the Green and Green and Credit economic forum. But first, Brad, let's get over to you at the Yowl Finance Interactive for a look at all things markets. Yeah, thanks so much, Sausie. Well, just putting a little more context into today's decline. There you saw at about the 10 a.m. hour we bounced off of some of the intraday session lows for the Dow Jones industrial average as of right now, we're still lower by about 3 tens of a percent though. Taking a look at the NASDAQ composite, you're also seeing that lower by about 1.5% here intraday and still in the same ballpark of some of those early session lows as we're just about 37 minutes into today's trading activity here on this Tuesday. The S&P 500, that too, down a little more than 1%. Taking a look though, a little further into some of the travel names that we've been tracking. It's really only one bright spot and it's barely holding on to some of those gains that had come as a result of an update that from American Airlines. It's holding on to gains by the hair of its chin to chin to chin right now. That compared to being up by 4% pre-market and so now you're seeing some of that sputtering out but continue to watch this broader travel and kind of reopening play if you will because even though some of the demand that the airlines have cited as being strong, even though some of that demand persists and the taking price from and in the midst of this kind of higher demand, taking price to consumers and having consumers still accept that, even though that's locked into place, it's still a question of what the capacity will look like for them. That's something that American had talked about and now you're seeing AAL dip into the red but more broadly continue to watch Airbnb. That's down by about 6% here on the day. Some of the other travel names that are declining, EXPE, Expedia, also move lower by a little more than nearly 4%. Shifting gears and watching shares of Amazon though, as they kick off their second prime day event, shares are lower by about 2.5% right now.

3042," Their second prime day event shares are lower by about 2.5% right now. What our next guest calls bridging the gap between the back to school and the holiday shopping periods for more on prime day. We welcome in, Cowan managing director and senior analyst covering internet and new media. John Blackledge, John, great to have you here. Happy prime day sequel to you, I suppose, as we kick off the holiday season sales even earlier. And it always gets earlier and earlier and there's more names that even get looped in to this broader sales blitz, if you will. How do you expect this to pan out for Amazon knowing that so much of the e-commerce push that they have? This is just going to be a larger break even type of push that they're looking for in order to just get rid of some of this inventory and perhaps get some new signups on the prime front. Yeah, you know, it kicks out, so it kicks off the holiday season for the company. Remember last year, it was an earlier holiday season with the, with the supply chain issues. This year, it's a little bit different, right? I mean, more macro headwinds for the consumer. So it'll be interesting to see how the consumer holds up throughout it. But you have, like you just said, the in stock levels are good. Arguably, there's a glut of inventory across across the retail landscape, which could lead to kind of higher discounting than previous holiday seasons. But I think for Amazon, a couple of things in stock levels are good and their delivery speeds are back at pre-pandemic levels. That's what they told us at two queue earnings. And that should only really improve for the company. Remember, Amazon invested about $80 billion in their fulfillment and logistics infrastructure since 2020. That included quadrupling their last amount of delivery stations. So outside of this prime early access event or second prime day, we think these faster delivery speeds will drive higher conversion rates, which should go well for the company throughout the holiday season. John, some estimates out there in the street are suggesting Amazon from this day might pull in over $4 billion in sales. It might be another big day for them. Yet the stock continues to be under pressure. We're seeing it down here today. What is holding back Amazon stock at this point? Yeah, I mean, I think, you know, I think broadly, Internet is kind of down today at varying levels. But to your point, remember in July, the July prime day event, we estimated they generated about $7 billion in revenue. And that was about $5 billion incremental to what they would normally do during two days in July. So we think this will be a big event for the company over the next two days. And remember, the July prime day event led to the strong three-tube guidance. And for the company for this year, they didn't have a second prime event right last year. So they're going to report earnings in a couple of weeks. They're going to have this effectively the second prime day for their 4Q guide. And we're looking for about 12% e-commerce growth in 4Q. And overall revenue, when they guide to it in a couple of weeks, we're looking, we're about a percent and a half above the street. So we are looking for pretty robust growth. And remember, Amazon, despite the stock price today and thus far this year, there are a couple of good things going on. You have revenue growth re-excelerating, both in 3Q and in 4Q versus flat in the first half of the year. And they are pulling out of this massive historic investment cycle, which usually builds well for the stock. So we'll have to see, I know it's a shopping market and tougher internet, but there are good things going on fundamentally at the company. We're taking a look at some of the comparisons in terms of the stock performance, Amazon versus Walmart versus Target. You could easily throw Best Buy into the mix too if you wanted to. There's so many brands that have tried to take advantage as tertiary players or secondary options, I should say, when we do have a massive sales blitz like this ahead of the holiday season, but are all sales or promotional cycles created equal from your perspective? Oh, yeah. You know, and I can't totally speak to what the other players are doing. You usually do see other players around, typically around prime days doing things. And also, Amazon does a lot of things in the lead up to prime days. Like even I think small businesses like for the July event generated about 3 billion in revenue in the three week lead up to the July prime day. So, but I think, you know, kind of as we're talking about, I think this will kind of kick off the holiday season, not only for Amazon, but for other retailers. And we will see like I was saying earlier.",https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9GS0SPvxP2s,54,2022-10-11 17:46:02
3043," But I think, you know, kind of as we're talking about, I think this will kind of kick off the holiday season, not only for Amazon, but for other retailers. And we will see, like I was saying earlier, if it's going to be an earlier holiday season this year and where the consumer is, you know, just giving all these macro headlines. Count Analyst John Blackledge, always great to get some time with you. We'll talk to you soon. Thank you. Before I head to break, let's take a look at this market, Stanley Downgrade on Shares of Zoom. The analyst, Meta Marshall, says the team is stepping to the sidelines on Zoom as there are no near term catalyst for the stock. The online business isn't expected to stabilize until early next year, suggesting an overhang is likely to stay over the next stock for the next six months. Marshall's price target on Zoom goes to $90 from $130. Zoom shares are down about 61% so far on this year.

And be real, the filter free social media company gaining popularity among Gen Z. Top 53 million worldwide installs across both Google and Apple's App Store. Meanwhile, monthly active users are up over 2000 percent according to sensor tower. But only 9 percent of its active Android installs are opening the app every day, far behind Instagram and TikTok. Still, many of the apps, new installs, they're from young people in the US where Apple's iOS is the perforged platform. Sounds? Oh filters. Interesting. All right, gas prices are on the rise again here in the US. After OPEC Plus, slash its output target by 2 million barrels a day. Now President Biden is re-evaluating the nation's relationship with Saudi Arabia. You know, if I can see your comments, Rick Newman has the latest. Rick, interesting to see how this relationship has evolved and may continue to evolve. Yeah, Saudi Arabia, not such an ally anymore, basically rebuffing Biden in his request to pump more oil. But when you hear that Biden is re-evaluating the relationship with Saudi Arabia, it's hard to figure out what actually might change. And I don't think people should expect much to actually change at least not anytime soon, not before the midterm elections. But people are angry. I mean, just going around, I've found that I'm talking with friends and other people and they're like, what is wrong with OPEC? Why are they citing with Russia, basically, and trying to push up the price of oil, which is going to just give Russia more energy revenue to fight its war with Ukraine? I don't think that's exactly what's going on. But, you know, people are pissed off here in the United States and you're hearing some people in Congress say we got to do something about this. So, not entirely clear what we can do. There are some ideas out there. My guess is not much is actually going to change. Gas prices have come down, but they're still high. Is that still top of mind amongst voters as we look to them in terms? Heck yeah. I mean, we figured out this year that consumer confidence basically goes up and down based on gas prices. Nothing seems to drive consumer confidence more than gas prices just because they're so visible. So, where are gas prices right now? We're looking at about 392 today. Now, oil prices, which are the main component of gas prices, did go up after OPEC said they were going to cut production. Remember, that was a long-term production cut. It wasn't like anything changed in today's inventories. But then, oil prices came back down. They did not go quite as high as some people thought. To figure out where gas prices are going, I look at wholesale gas-linked prices. Anybody can do this on Yahoo Finance. The ticker symbol is RBOB. That's wholesale gasoline. And those prices have actually come down during the last few days. So, we may see 392 come down to, I don't know, 385. I think if you're in the Biden White House and you're thinking about the midterm elections, you want most people to see a price that starts with a three, rather than a four. And I think Biden might get that for the next three weeks. What's that lead gas on for? I think it's on the black market. Yeah, I might need it this year. Yeah, I think you're the only guy you might have a car that takes that off. Let's take that off, library. The trend, damn. You're the man. I'll talk to you. We'll talk to you soon.

3045," Welcome to Timets. I'm going to do a little bit more. I'm going to do a little bit more. I'm going to do a little bit more. I'm going to do a little bit more. I'm going to do a little bit more. A choppy economy is seeing investor attention shift to private and debt markets. Joining us from the Greenwich Economic Forum in Connecticut, let's get back to our very own Julie Heimann, who is there with the special guest, Julie. Thanks so much, with me is Ken Kenselli, president and CEO of Churchill Asset Management, which has an enormous credit portfolio. And so, can give us a good read on what is going on in companies at this time of rising interest rates. Ken, thanks for being here. Thanks for joining us. So, obviously, we have been hearing about a lot of gloom lately, right? Some commentary from Jamie Dyer yesterday, the IMF cutting its growth forecast for the next several years. What are you hearing from your portfolio companies? And are you guys sort of getting more stringent in some of your credit standards right now? Sure, no, great question. Great to see you here. Look, I think, as we go through the challenging economic dynamic that we're seeing, obviously, we are being more conservative about our lending standards and companies that we look to finance and invest in. But that being said, if you look at our portfolio today, we have about 41 billion in capital and management. We have about 400, actually 450 portfolio companies all across the US, all US, mid-sized businesses. And what we're seeing, frankly, is that those companies, by and large, are actually quite healthy and growing and actually performing quite well. So, you know, I understand there's a lot of doom and gloom in the air, but the reality is that if you're financing high-quality companies and businesses and being very careful about the businesses that you finance and invest in, and you apply, you know, a very high standard, there are still some very fantastic businesses to finance and invest in, particularly ones that have benefited from COVID-19, you know, either through technology or logistics. And so, that's where we focus. We tend to focus on software, business services, healthcare, distribution, logistics, businesses that have generally benefited from COVID. And so, today our portfolios and quite good shape. Deal flow remains in the middle market for the better companies, quite robust. I would say for the more challenged businesses, those companies are kind of off the market, if you will, right now. They're not really being, you know, transacted. But I think for the better businesses, there are still opportunities to finance and we're certainly seeing that. Well, let me ask you then on the fringes, right? Because I think back to the financial crisis and going into it, things look much the same. And I'm not saying that this is the same. What I'm asking for about is, are there signs on the fringes of things at higher risk levels that we should be watching? So, I would say certainly for the companies.",https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9GS0SPvxP2s,57,2022-10-11 17:58:54
3046," that we should be watching. Yes. So I would say certainly for the companies or deals that were done at levels that now would be considered excessive or kind of beyond reasonable businesses that frankly may have yielded slightly more in return, but obviously brought with that return a lot more risk. And so I would say that you'll start to see cracks along those lines, businesses for example that have real issues passing on price increases to their customers, right? So as cost rise, can they actually roll those expenses back to their customers, whether those are retail or commercial? But I will say that there is certainly an expectation that 23 is going to be a more challenging time as we move through this credit cycle. I continue to believe that it will be relatively short. I think that when I compare this for example to the GFC and we did manage capital through the GFC that this is not the same as the GFC and a lot of the fundamental cracks that we saw in the GFC, particularly the mortgage market and some of the issues with the banks. We're just not seeing that today. So will we be in for a modest recession? I think that's becoming increasingly clear. We will. The Fed seems intent on doing that regardless of the consequences, which I think is trying to be prudent relative to the inflation threat. But I think at the end of the day, we're not looking at a two year downturn. We're looking at a shorter term impact. But it will impact those businesses that were maybe looked pretty attractive at the margin a year ago. Right. G, we're getting 10% for a senior secured loan. Well, there's a reason. No, not so much. So I think that's the thing to look for. I'm Ray Delio spoke earlier and he talked about America being in decline. And you, when it was your turn to speak, really push back against that notion and we are, you are what one would call a self-made man, right? And so why don't you think that America is in decline? Well, first of all, if you look at the purported competing dynamics, the competing cultures are competing models, right? I think about the American model and I think that if you look at the challenges that we've seen over the last century, right? I think about a communist system or a socialist system. And I think I believe very strongly that the US is the place in the world that has been for centuries now where it provides economic opportunity, upward mobility. I'm a big believer in that. I'm on the board of Teach for America, Connecticut. And I think that we are still the best place to raise a family to build a business and to pursue your dreams. So I'm fundamentally an optimist and I'm sticking to it. I like it. I like the optimism. Are we going to leave with our Ken Kensell of Churchill Caval asset management? Thanks so much. Appreciate it. Thank you very much. Thank you very much. Thanks so much, really excellent conversation there. Everyone's switching gears here. Want to get to our calls of the day here today. Our Alka thing is off NFLX. I'm looking at Netflix. JP Morgan's tape is that it's advertising will bring in billions of dollars still making waves this morning. Now the bank retains a neutral rating with a $240 price target here. There you're taking a look at shares on the day. Of course, there's a broader base sell off, especially in tech as we've been tracking. But NFLX shares down by about 5.8%. They had actually seen much of that kind of move higher be priced in, intraday yesterday. And so now it's a question of even with this kind of bullish perspective that they have, where some of the other bearish takes on the street are starting to pour in that as well. I could actually mention one earlier today here. That particularly coming out and saying that Netflix shares have caught a relative bid post week. 2Q resulting guidance and optimism. However, in the end, this is not rocket science. They're moved to launch an ad supported alternative is this fraught with ARPU, RPU, essentially that average revenue per user, technological and financial product risk. That I believe had come out from, it was Jeffries earlier today. Pivotal. Pivotal. So, all of that, you're starting to have a healthy bull bear dialogue on this. Yeah, it's going to be a fun earnings report from Netflix in a couple weeks because you have all this optimism that Netflix shares up now about 15.",https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9GS0SPvxP2s,58,2022-10-11 18:03:20
3047," you're starting to have a healthy bull bear dialogue on this. Yeah, it's going to be a fun earnings report from Netflix in a couple weeks because you have all this optimism. The Netflix shares up now about 15 or 16% in the three months on an ad service that doesn't even exist yet and that's no revenue. And then, oh yeah, you have to stay focused on what this company is going to report. And let me remind it folks, the past three quarters from Netflix have not been good. Sales have decelerated year over year for the past three quarters. Margins have been under pressure. People have become more mobile, have clicked out of Netflix or flat out canceled as prices have gone higher. So it's an interesting time, I think, to be involved with the Netflix story. The promise might be there, but again, near term, this is no longer the Netflix of old. It's just a matter of how many people, number one, opt into that ad tear. But then, additionally, the amount of advertising revenue that they actually realize from it going forward and the number of campaigns that make their way into Netflix versus a bundle, perhaps, that comes in the future, especially from a company in Disney that we know is also going to layer on some of their ad-supported ambitions as well here within this broader streaming landscape. All right, let's stay on tech here. I'm watching a good note, again, from Chris Daly, a city analyst, we frequently cite his work. I do at least because I think he's really on the pulse of this really great chip slowdown of 2022. Calling out some weakness and cancellations of orders over analog devices, apparently that has been hitting their results, but now he's seeing that spread, especially in Europe, over at the likes of NXP, semiconductor, and also Texas instruments. Now, Daly is just flat out calling this a downturn now hitting the analog chip space. Take this, you take weak results from AMD, you have that really disappointing quarter from Intel a couple months ago, and this could be a very, very challenging third quarter earnings season for chip players, not only because the results by themselves may not be good, but the guidance may be just absolutely brutal. Yeah, one of the only bright spots it seems at this point in time, at least for the broader chip segment, is, or maybe two of them, and one of them is years out from now, and that is kind of a multi-year multi-pronged approach in the number of places that are going to bring on capacity, whether that be geographically or whether that be companies that we're talking about, and the production once that begins to ramp up. So that's a long term. Near term, what just had a ton of investment over the course of the last two years, pull forward and demand, it's the data center businesses for a lot of the companies, even that we've talked about in citing some of the own near term headwinds that they do have, and if you see at least some churn in the number of chips that are in those data centers, and needing to upgrade those on a more regular basis, that's perhaps at least a catalyst for some stability, but then it's what's the growth potential going forward from there, and that's something that investors I believe are pricing in and has been rattled to a great extent at this point. Guys, coming up, investing in farmland. Yes, we're going to go to the heartlands and the farmlands. We're going to speak with the CEO of Acre Trader on the other side of this short break. Video Raw is ready.zh",https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9GS0SPvxP2s,59,2022-10-11 18:08:15
3048,"lass A software landing for investors as market sentiment moves to real estate and even investments in farmland, acre trade wants to provide a marketplace for analysis and insight on the land itself, helping buyers maximize their purchase decisions now through an online platform. acre trade CEO Carter Maloy joins us now. Carter, great to have you here with us in studio. Thanks. So walk us through the model, the platform, and how quickly someone could go from evaluating the land to investing in it as well. In a matter of minutes, so the second part there, so very quickly our team is really there to help them with evaluations. So we're about 150 people in total. Good portion of that is software engineers and data scientists supporting a lot of the decisioning. But ultimately, how it works is very simple. We're a platform for investors to gain access to farmland. Farmland has performed incredibly well historically. We haven't heard much about it because frankly you had to go out and plop down a million dollars and manage a farm. It's just not a thing most people could do. So that's where our platform acre trader comes in. We really help the individual come on and rather than investing in a million dollars, you can put in $10,000 in on a slice of a farm. What is that? What would that $10,000? If I had $10,000 right now, what would that get me and how do I analyze if that's a good investment? Yes, so it can get you anywhere from an acre to only a portion of an acre depending on the where you are within the U.S. or Australia where we primarily invest. The quality of that investment, each investment we put on the website has full detail describing. Here's why we believe this is an interesting investment. And here are the cons to each one of those as well with everything they do. What are the best farms? What should I invest? How do I identify a good farm? Most of the institutional portfolios seem to be about 60% row crops, so things like corn and soybeans and then 40% permanent crops, things that grow in trees, almonds, fruits, etc. What if I say I want to invest in wineland or kind of the vineyard country? Is that expansion into kind of new states, new countries even where there are different types of things being grown for regular produce or other types of products? How have you managed some of the demand or where customers are asking for that? Yeah, we do get a lot of customers that equate what's on their kitchen table to quality. Sure. Oh, if this makes wine, it must be a good investment. And then of course when they come learn a little more about that, it's like, actually, I think I want to own the boring corn, maybe this wine is not for me. Right, cow's can drink corn. Or cow's can drink wine rather. So it's more about what the stock is that you can actually get into some of the other parts of the broader operation in a farmland as well. That's correct. So the investor is buying a portion of this land, both, sorry, returns are generated two ways for that investor. One is through the cash incomes you're getting a revenue share alongside the farmer who's your partner in the deal or a cash lease. But actually more importantly, you're getting exposure to potential appreciation of that land underneath you. So whereas the coupon may be something similar to a money market today, that money market does not protect you from inflation. And the fact that it exposes.",https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9GS0SPvxP2s,60,2022-10-11 18:12:03
3049," and the magic is we need to be able to put in our product what then the people perceive something special because for people it's sort of all special today it's not about how much or how much as fancy is a product. And speaking of that alert among consumers, right now you're in LA for Golden Goose event, you're gonna have content creators there. We've seen the likes of Taylor Swift and Reese Witherspoon wear Golden Goose sneakers. How important has it been for influencers like those to wear your brand and ultimately drive to your success? It's a great question and I have a simple answer. What's magical is that we never place this product to be celebrities because Golden Goose is made in order to make everyone feel special. So the fact that every shoe is made, every shoe is unique, is making our customer become a lover and the fact that this celebrity has been wearing these has been just a great amplifier to a message that is simple and is not limited just for us more community, why is it really open to a wider community? What are we seeing in the style trends right now? I mean for Kanye West and Gap, it's been about some of the kind of more, I won't say basic or kind of dirty looks out there, but there is something that's out there to like making things look lived in already even before they sell. What is it with the trends right now that you're saying how much do you expect to kind of be able to lean further into that and where the customer is actually continuing to take price despite, hey, looks like a shoe has a scuff on it. What's up with that? Thank you Brian for this question because this is technically the first time that I'm answering to this question line to someone and it has been quite a question for a couple of years because you should remember that Golden Goose has been the first brand ever to be stressed for sneakers and at the beginning people will be like skeptical why do I have to spend 500 bucks for a pair of dirty shoe? While it was part of the magic again, Golden Goose never wanted to promote the product of now. We always want to know the people to talk about our product. So there was a space of an undefined space where the people were not really getting about that, but the reality is that simply what we try to do is to inject in life to our products to unleash the sense of uniqueness of every product we offer to our communities. And it's a little bit like you know your old device. It is always the most special because you really taking with it your memories. So every item that keep with you and keep with it, you know, his memories is then more special than something just because it's more extensive. So there's a new notion of going from product to purpose, product to values rather than just a product. So this is what is going on right now in the industry. And I think the example of Kanye is very interesting. Quite far from Golden Goose because Kanye is still, you know, quite fashion focused. Why Golden Goose is consumer obsessed? So this position Golden Goose in a very special angle of the industry. And speaking of just the long term goal of Golden Goose, you've been in this industry since 2000. You've been through three different investment groups here. Latest Premier took a majority stake in Golden Goose. So I have to ask here, there are also the owners of Doc Mardin's Valentino. Could we see Golden Goose go public in the near future? I mean, it's part of course, you know, of the options. And the most important to us where we may focus are two things. First, creating value every day to our consumers. Second to stay flexible because the market outside is very complicated and very complex. And as you can imagine, you know, consumers is really one of the first angles that the market and these difficulties and opportunities came with the reflected on. So it is very important in this process of education to stay flexible. Now, that's extremely important to bring up, especially in this conversation. And especially in this timing right now, given your kind of consumer base that you go after, the more affluent consumer that is kind of flocking to the Golden Goose product, if you will, even with some of the anticipated recessionary concerns that many consumers have, are you seeing that show up in any of the sales figures and any of the relationship with that can.",https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9GS0SPvxP2s,61,2022-10-11 18:19:14
3050," anticipated recessionary concerns that many consumers have, are you seeing that show up in any of the sales figures and any of the relationship with that consumer right now? It's a great question. So as you can imagine for sure you know that almost 42, 44% of our businesses are driven by americans and so you know I'm a really special angle to be any time and brand because now we really many time and brands have the lucky that code and possess and I can tell you that on the American point of view we didn't see any recession last year we achieved something around 78% plus versus 2020 and this year we are in a zone of plus 40 versus next year versus last year in America. Any general the company the first semester has been performing like in creative but you know like last year why? Because again we don't really look at the trend in fashion we really look in trend in consumer and there's something that is for sure the KPI's that consumers look at are not a BIDA or no cash conversion is no revenues but are really like MPS customer acquisition is really the ability that the company and the brand has to retain and compensate with these communities so this is where Golden Goose is really representing an excellence and I really think that we are really representing a kind of new frontier for the consumer industry on this side. Really fascinating I've seen so many of your products on some of the high-end kind of fashion retailers and retailers out there as well and so I'm excited to see where the brand goes from here Golden Goose CEO Silvia Kampar joining us here today thanks so much for the time as well as Yahoo finances own Brooke DiPoma who's going to stick around for us here because we've got much more as President Biden has proposed a new rule that will make it more likely for millions of gig economy workers to be classified as employees Uber and Lyft and DoorDash all trading lower on this news Yahoo finances Brooke DiPoma sticking around with us for this conversation that's right so this new labor law will allow protection of workers basic rights make it easier for employers to properly classify their workers and also protect independent businesses that follow the law of course that's out from the U.S. Department of Labor this morning. Companies now expected to provide certain benefits to full-time employees and not to contractors of course that includes minimum wage over time apportion of workers social security taxes and contributions to unemployment insurance but here in a tweet from U.S. Secretary he says that misclassification hurts workers by denying them important benefits and basic rights like that minimum wage over time pay. It's a problem we often see in low-wage shops enforcing the rights of misclassified workers is a priority because these workers have so much stake of course this comes on the heels of the Supreme Court overturning Grovy Wade in earlier this summer and it also comes after 25 Democratic members of Congress led by Elizabeth Warren, Representative Bush, Accord Bush-Adish and Missouri, sent letters to CEO of Amazon lived, DoorDash and Grubb to question a policy that was a Trump error decision. Now of course Wall Street reacting to this shares lower on Uber-Lifted DoorDash, Dan Ives, a show favorite here calling this a clear blow to the gig economy and a near-term concern for the likes of Uber and Letz he also added that depending upon this model you could really overturn the likes of DoorDash, like Uber of course these customers or employees rather coming in doing their job here and there and then going not right now getting the full benefits of an employee. So lots more fallout to come from this decision and once again this is the second attempt of the Biden administration to overturn this. Yeah and you just see these harsh reactions notably with Lift there it's now this issue that is long-plague this this industry as well but this comes at a time as these companies finally start to achieve a little bit of profits if this changes if this goes against them and immediately immediately goes them brings them back to losing large sums of money. At a time where as well some of the prices that they had passed on in search charges for gas as well to consumers where that had started to at least on the gas price front started to come down in terms of the relation to the highest peaks that we had seen on an all-time basis earlier this year and so those search charges finally starting to come down but yet",https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9GS0SPvxP2s,62,2022-10-11 18:23:26
3051," come down in terms of the relation to the highest peaks that we had seen on an all-time basis earlier this year. And so those surcharges finally starting to come down, but yet this could also factor into the higher and elevated prices consumers are seeing on the economy front too. So we're going to be watching this very closely. Y'all find this is zone broke to palm breaking this down for us. Thanks, bro. And everyone coming up, Duncan, in some hot water over its rewards program, we've got this so done. Welcome back everyone. It's time for Cut to Time. We've got two stories today. One minute on the clock for each. We start with this. Dunkin. Dunkin is facing some backlash about its new rewards program. My goodness, the coffee giant announced a new program for customers acting the free birthday drink and changing their point system causing resentment from loyal customers like Brian Saussie. I'm upset, Brad. I'm upset. So I noticed my app changed over the weekend and it's going to take me I would I calculated $90. I'm spending $90 to get a free coffee from Dunkin. Right now I have 345 points which gets me two espresso shots. But ultimately don't take away my birthday drink. This is a tradition that Starbucks had Dunkin adopted. I need my free birthday drink. It's a right-of-pass. I spend enough money at these places. I want to be rewarded. I mean, even Nike still sends me updates. Every other brand that I buy with, I'm pretty sure Chipotle, Nike, like all of these companies, they'll give me that little update and say, hey, here's 20% off just because it's your birthday. And you're involved in all of these kind of reward systems so that you do get the birthday reward. $90 in coffee to get something free. It just don't seem right. All right, staying on food. Chipotle in focus after Bernstein initiated coverage with an outperform rating saying the chance customer strategy through apps like TikTok will prove to be a positive thing for shareholders. And I was checking out this Chipotle presence on TikTok. It is pretty, pretty darn impressive. 1.3. I think almost actually two million followers on TikTok. Some of the posts are great. But again, this fits, I think, very much with the Chipotle brand, which has always been focused on driving sales and engagement via social media. Now that you've taken that DNA of this brand and brought it to TikTok. Yeah, the Guacamole attachment rate is strong with this one here today as we're tracking shares. See, it's like the grill replacement, right? Well, I mean, I don't know. The grill replacement rate could be stronger if some of those grill start to crap out at Chipotle. So ultimate.",https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9GS0SPvxP2s,63,2022-10-11 18:28:20

The grill replacement rate could be stronger if some of those grills start to crap out at your pole. So ultimately here, for Chipotle, what they have been able to do so well is, and yes, we're going to say it, menu innovation. KSO goes a far away when you're talking about burritos and changing out, pollo assado, and just having new types of meat offerings that you're able to throw onto the different bowls, the burritos, the tacos. I mean, the burrito was like 11 bucks when I was in college. Now, whatever. 15 here. All right, one programming note. Don't miss out. Our All Market Summit is Monday, October 17th, featuring guests, including CEOs from Target, Microsoft, and General Motors, of course, we'll also speak to Chipotle CEO, Brian Nichol. I am very jazzed up about that one. All right, coming up in the next hour, Okiko Pajito will speak with IMF's chief economist on their latest economic report. They said this morning that the worst is yet to come. I can't wait to see that conversation. Okiko, do something. Let's see. All right. All right. All right. All right. All right. All right.

3053," Moving ahead here, Stormy Waters ahead, the IMF downgrade that's growth outlook for the global economy as a fund warned of a harsh worldwide recession. Chief Economist Pierre Olivier Greenchuss is going to be joining us to break down the latest report later this hour. And doubling down on climate financing, the U.S. commits $950 million to accelerate the development of clean technology. We're going to talk to a senior specialist at the Climate Investment Fund to see how the group is planning to deploy all of that capital. As always, we are beginning with a market check, 90 minutes in to the trading day right now. As we pointed out, the only one in the green right now, and taking a look at where bond yields have been trading, we saw the 10-year start to move closer to that 4% level earlier today, and now we are seeing it at 3.9, the 30-year yield at 3.9 and the 5-year at 4%. We're beginning today, though, with a focus on the semiconductor sector today. Here's an interesting number to point out, $240 billion wiped out from the global chip sector. Global market value, we should say, since it's closed on Thursday, and we're talking about it, of course, because of those expert controls the U.S. has now put in. And that really has had global implications. We are continuing to see a sell-off in U.S. chip stocks. You see, in video, down to 1.5% Qualcomm seeing the biggest losses there, down about 4.7%. All of this, of course, as investors try to calculate their exposure to the Chinese market. A lot of this spilling over from what we saw over in the Asia session, particularly over in South Korea and Japan. A bit of a catch-up session there because they did have the Monday holiday off. Take a look at where those stocks, chip makers, ended up. We're talking about Reneces, which is a chip maker. Semi-conductor equipment maker, Tokyo Electron, also down and significantly. Over in South Korea, we did see Samsung and SK Heinigs, the biggest chip makers out there. Also down significantly, and then worth noting what we saw over with TSMC, of course, the largest chip maker globally, down significantly. We're talking about 7% right now. By the way, the sell-off was so significant what we saw there. And also, as so many of these countries and companies try to figure out the global implications, we have seen a move in currencies as well, the Korean one, down there, about 4.10% of a percent. So we're here to break it all down for you this morning, with Dan Halley, our very own chip expert here at Yahoo Finance. Dan, I just ran through so many different stocks we've been tracking over in Asia here in the US. By the way, we also didn't talk about ASMR over in Europe. How are you making sense of these latest expert controls that have been put in place that really came down on Friday, but there's still a lot of the market is still processing right now. Yeah, you talk about those companies that are overseas that had the holiday, SK Heinigs, Samsung, TSMC. You can see them kind of just dropping off as they kind of get back into things. But then you look at the likes of, let's say in video or Intel Qualcomm, they're all still being hit. You can see that came in on Monday, and you can look at stuff like applied materials, LEM research, KLA Corp. These are all companies that also took a hit. Those companies are about the manufacturing side of things. I think that's something that's important to look at. It's the manufacturing aspect as well as the overall technology. Applied materials, LEM research, KLA. They're talking about wafer manufacturing. Those are a problem there, and it'll be continuing to be a problem because those companies are providing the capabilities to companies in China to actually build the chips that they need. Then you look at the chip companies like SNK Heinigs, like Samsung, like TSMC that have actual factories out there in China. They're all getting hit, and I think that you're going to continue to see this, then obviously some American companies as well. When it comes to the AI side of things, Nvidia had taken a hit a while back when there was discussion of more export controls going into effect. They said that they were working with the Biden administration to try to figure out what they can do there. But obviously we're seeing them taking some damage now as well. Yeah, and we're sort of backing up to say, well, what exactly the ruling was in case people are just sort of catching up right now. One of the things that you want to do really means it would live in chip makers from semiconductors made with US technology. We're talking about...",https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9GS0SPvxP2s,65,2022-10-11 18:36:40
3054," What exactly the ruling was in case people are just sort of catching up right now. Number one, this new ruling means it would live in chip makers from semiconductors made with US technology. We're talking about the most advanced AI supercomputers. Also those US citizens would not be allowed to be a part about that. Which is why, yeah. Which is certainly key. And then of course, you wouldn't be able to use US equipment to manufacture these chips. And that's the thing that we often forget, right? So many of these companies, you've got global names out there, but many of them still use US equipment. If you are one of those, you would not be able to export to China. Yeah, I think that's the big thing that kind of gets lost is that the US is still the leader dominates the space when it comes to building actual chips. The companies that build chips or provide the materials to build chips, those are largely US companies. So if you take that out of the equation, it's a huge blow to China. It's a huge blow to these companies. Obviously, the discussion here is about whether or not the technologies will be fed into the Chinese military. And that's the big catch there. It's the same thing that we've been talking about for some time when it comes to technology in China. We saw this during the Trump administration, obviously seeing it during the Biden administration. But it'll continue to roll out. We just have to see how the other chip companies start to process this or if they can get some exceptions. And we're thinking really quickly that this isn't just about the regulation because this all comes out of time when we have seen a slowdown, whether it's demand in PCs, demanded other consumer electronics. That's another headwind working again, some of these chip makers, which is why we're seeing the pullback. Yeah, Gartner recently released yesterday released their latest note saying that worldwide PC shipments declined 19.5 percent in the third quarter. That's the worst decline in two decades. It's just pointing out, by the way, that it doesn't mean that the PC market is just going away. It's that we saw such explosive growth. That's just by showing the pants out. And now it's coming back to buy a computer every year. That's crazy. I mean, unless you're like me. But this is going to be an issue, I think, for at least three years before we start to see PC sales start to pick up again. Okay, just another narrative to add to the global tech space there. Thanks so much for that, Dan. Let's turn out to a look at the broader markets as investors gear up for result season. We have joining us now, SEMA Shah, principal asset management chief. Well, we'll strategist SEMA's here with us in studio today. It's good to talk to you today. It feels like we're finally able to pivot a little, if you will, looking at earning season with the big banks reporting later this week. But what do you have your eye on in terms of what's driving the market right now? So we continue to think, of course, about the Federal Reserve and what's going on that. Interestingly, we're getting a lot of questions about the dollar. How is that going to impact the rest of the world? And even could that influence Fed policy going forward, which as we have to say, we think that the Fed stays very much domestically focused. With regards to earning season, the thing that we have seen is this year, top-line earnings growth has been incredibly strong. It has managed to beat expectations time and time again. But we're getting towards the end of the year when you are expecting to see economic weakness start to seep in. But it probably won't start to show through until early 2023. So there could be another solid quarter. Yeah, in terms of the narratives we're expecting during earnings season, obviously a lot of similarities in terms of threads. FX had wins, a key one that we've been watching. Also, just where the consumer demand is right now. What are your biggest concerns? Well, I think the FX had one is an important one. You are seeing that companies which have a lot of international exposure. So those which are exposed to Europe, of course, China, emerging markets, they're struggling because their economies are also slowing a lot quicker. Throw on top of that the strong dollar policy, sorry, the strong dollar outlook. And of course, these companies are being additionally challenged. So their margins are being compressed further and further. So that's one thing they're watching. But also the consumer resilience is really interesting. And I think that what we're expecting to see is unless, until you see US labour market weakness, really start to get going. Actually the consumer could stay quite resilient. We know that there's a headwind coming, but it's not quite here yet. We're still a few weeks out from the next FOMC meeting. We had a New York Fed survey come out today pointing to inflation expectations, declining in the short term, but increasing in the medium and long term. We've got a CPI print coming out later this week, but...",https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9GS0SPvxP2s,66,2022-10-11 18:41:03
3055," the day pointing to inflation expectations, declining in the short term but increasing in the medium and long term. We've got the CPI print coming out later this week but what is your read on where we are when it comes to inflation? We have still very, very far to go. We think we're hoping that we have seen peak inflation. The energy prices still are very much a wild card. We assume that they're going to keep coming down but as we've seen over the last week that's definitely not a guarantee. But even if that peak is behind us it's not enough really because we do think that the decline from here is going to be extremely slow. We can see that commodities, core transportation, those segments of inflation probably will turn deflationary. But as this stuff like shelter inflation, medical services, those parts which are very, very sticky and once they start to get going it's very difficult to contain them unless you can create economic weakness. So from the Federal Reserve's perspective they almost have to engineer a hard landing in order to contain inflation. So that means bringing the rates up further, keeping them high for pretty long, so higher for longer and only at that point can then we start to see some kind of relief on the inflation side. You said they have to engineer a hard landing, some still holding out hope that it won't be quite as severe but it sounds like you think that's a necessary step to get inflation back to where the central bank needs it. Exactly. I think a soft landing wouldn't be sufficient. I mean what the Fed needs to do is create labor market slack, increase labor supply, almost make things so difficult that households, people have to return to the labor market. And by doing that you reduce wage pressures but in so doing of course you make the economy, the economic conditions extremely challenging but this is your kind of price reset, this is your only way you're bringing down inflation. Has the pace of the rate high expense sufficient for you? I mean there's some that would argue that it's going too quickly. Yes, they need to hike rates to get the labor market in check but more importantly inflation as a whole in check. Are they moving too quickly? I would say they start off very slowly. I mean the fact that they started off with a 25 basis point hike in retrospect seems a little bit crazy. But at this stage I think they do need to be moved very quickly but they do of course risk the fact that given the lag from monetary policy to actually hitting real economy you do risk an even deeper slowdown than what they necessarily need to achieve. So it probably it could be slow down but of course you know when you have an inflation problem this serious it's important to get in front of it and really front load your rate hikes in order to make sure that the inflation problem just doesn't continue to grow. Really quickly a lot of people looking at their portfolios right now saying well what do I do in this environment? In terms of how much cash you set aside has that calculation shifted as a result of the volatility that we've seen? It's interesting actually because one of the I've been traveling around the US for the last week and the question we keep getting from clients is actually when are we going to be ready to put our money to work? Right so everyone is starting to look already to when does the market reach its floor and where do we go from there? So from that perspective it's really important to have that kind of liquidity in your portfolio so you're ready to deploy it as soon as those opportunities arise. So there is a concern about volatility so in the run up it means about playing defence going high qualities we do like long end treasuries even secure ties debt which has a better relationship within economic conditions and what you see with investment grade credit or even high yield credit. But really the opportunity set which is the best is still real assets. This is a high inflation low growth environment real assets can continue to perform well at that point. Okay a lot of people taking notes right there are similar to our principal asset management chief global strategist thanks so much for joining us today.

3056," Defeated in mind Defeated Welcome back to Yahoo Finance Live. Let's check in on where the price of Bitcoin is moving right now. This is a $20,000 dollar handle. Earlier today, our team spoke with Galaxy Digital Founder, CEO Mike Novogratz. He had to say this about what Fed tightening means for the crypto space. Take a listen. It's hard to predict when these crypto winners how long they go. You know, we're a couple years from a having cycle. I do think the Fed flinching creates some enthusiasm around Bitcoin as a store of value. Bitcoin as a recession, as an inflation hedge, as a hard money when the rest of the world keeps printing money. Joining us to break down some of those comments. We've got our very own David, the holler at David, you're part of that conversation. Interesting that he said the Fed flinching could mean that crypto would be a little more attractive because that sort of was not the correlation just a month ago when we were talking about how far crypto had fallen. Right. That's a great point. Novogratz is obviously all seasons crypto bull. But to his point, the correlation changes between crypto currencies and stocks has been sort of interesting for the past two weeks. Sometimes this correlation breaks down and it just comes back immediately when there's a large Fed event or CPI or something like that. And obviously there's no Fed rate hike in October so that might be one reason why we're seeing sort of a breakdown. But to his point, the analysts I've spoken with have also suggested maybe reasons for why crypto...",https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9GS0SPvxP2s,68,2022-10-11 18:50:35
3057," or of a breakdown. But to his point, the analyst I've spoken with have also suggested maybe reasons for a Y crypto might be holding up slightly better, at least since July. And the stock market has a lot to do with how much it is sold off in the previous quarter, the second quarter. So that's an explanation of that. But I mean, a great example to point to is actually coin basis own stock compared to the NASDAQ today. Coin basis has some news with Google. It's partnering with Google and it's going to use Google's cloud services. And in return, Google Cloud customers can pay with cryptocurrencies. And the parallel between the NASDAQ composite, not necessarily year-to-date, but over the last days sort of running in parallel to each other. So I think that our crypto is getting a little bit without so much macro data happening at least yet this week. It's getting a little bit of its own innovation narrative, which is coming back. Yeah, a big pop for Coinbase right there on the back of that news that stock up more than 4%. David Hollereth, as always, thanks so much for that. Well, a setback for the Biden administration as a union representing 12,000 rail world workers voted against the possible contract agreement between freight rail companies and the 12 unions raising concerns once again of a possible nationwide strike. Yahoo! Finance is Danny Romero and Rick Newman. Bubble them with me here at the desk today. Danny, let's start with you because you have been speaking to the unions directly. What's the very latest on where these talks stand? Yeah, so I spoke with Peter Kennedy. He is the chief negotiator and strategist. And he says that the main reason why the union did not ratify this tentative deal goes back to the lack of paid sick time. So there is a supplemental sick leave plan that is on the table. But that doesn't include, for example, if you're child get sick and you need to take that day off, it doesn't include in that. So again, there's a discrepancy between what the union wants and needs and what the presidential emergency board had put forward recommended for this deal. So, and in that deal, sorry, excuse me, it included a 24% wage increase and also $5,000 bonus and an additional paid sick day. But from what the union has been telling me is that they're going to schedule more discussions with the railroad carriers. And they'll have to wait and see. But it's seven more unions are expected to vote from now until November 20th. Rick, I'm thinking back to when the White House stepped in and it was sort of crisis averted. You get the sense, are we here we go again? I don't think so. So, crisis averted until the midterm elections, politically speaking, if this goes into, has to be resolved after the midterm, just not a political crisis anymore. And everything Danny just said, I mean, this sounds like small potatoes, honestly, based on all the concessions they've gotten so far, they've gotten a nice pay increase, better working conditions. So this sounds bridgeable, honestly. But I guess we might, in terms of the political conversation, we might hear Republicans saying, oh, President Biden failed to get this deal done. We could have higher prices because a strike would drive up the cost of everything that gets shipped by rail, which is a lot of stuff. But it's not going to happen before the midterm. So it's just really not a political story anymore, I don't think. Yeah, so much of this is framed in the context of the midterms were less than a month out. Danny, what's the sense right now in terms of the hard line that exists on these key sticking points, you just pointed out how long is this likely to drag out now? Well, like I said, there are scheduling more discussions with the railroad carriers. But the railroad carriers actually responded when the Union rejected this tentative deal. They said that they were disappointed. But this morning, the Union fired back and we actually have a sound bite. So just take a listen to what they had to say this morning. Frankly, we're disappointed that the railroads were not willing to engage in discussions that would have resulted in paid sick days, front members. So it's, the path goes both ways on this. So if the parties don't come to terms, then there could be a strike, but that strike wouldn't happen.",https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9GS0SPvxP2s,69,2022-10-11 18:53:55
3058," You know, it's, the path goes both ways on this, you know. So if the parties don't come to terms then there could be a strike, but that strike wouldn't happen until mid-Nobember. Five days after Congress goes back to session. Okay. Just what the administration wants to hear, right? I predict it's going to get settled. I predict there will be no strike. Okay. Well, I'll be watching. Rick and Danny, thanks so much for that. Coming up on the other side, two and a half trillion dollars in buying power. We discussed the reach of the Hispanic consumer and why addressing this key demographic should be a business priority. So it's coming up next.................... What is the final week of Hispanic Heritage Month? We're taking a look today at investing in the Latinx community. The fast growing group accounts for 19 percent of all Americans making it the nation's second largest racial group and a major opportunity for institutions. Joining us to discuss this, Joseon Fernandez, he's been recognized by Cranes, New York. As a notable leader in the Hispanic community, he's currently aerial investments head of national accounts. Joseon, it's good to talk to you today. We've seen those numbers in terms of the demographic makeup of this community. How should we be thinking about the returns of investing power and buying power? Thank you, Akiko. One of the biggest growth engines and arguably the biggest opportunity as you alluded to lies in our US Latino cohort. The US Latino demographic and have found that it's responsible for $2.8 trillion in GDP. $2.8 trillion in GDP. That's up $1 trillion and less than 10 years. We put that into perspective for your viewers.",https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9GS0SPvxP2s,70,2022-10-11 18:57:43
3059," $10 in GDP. That's up a trillion dollars and less than less than 10 years. So to put that into perspective for your viewers, if the U.S.-Latino cohort was its own independent country, be the fifth largest economy in the world, surpassing that of the United Kingdom, surpassing that of France, surpassing that of India, Canada, Korea, the list goes on. And so the kicker here, Akiko, is that it's in our own respective borders, right? The fifth largest economy within our respective borders. It's an incredibly powerful demographic for both institutions and investors to be a part of. Yeah, with that said, it's not something that we always sort of frame the conversation around when we talk about the Latinx community. Why do you think that's the case? You know, I think ultimately organizations really need to pinpoint and say to themselves, okay, how important is diversity, right, within our respective organizations and diversity of thought, right? And can we actually, you know, invest in this particular space to grow the market, right? At the end of the day, we know very keenly at this junction that investing in diverse managers, investing in diverse perspectives is is is can lead to to outperformance, right? And there's certainly value there. An institution certainly have a role to play here. They can invest in emerging managers, whether it be on the public side, whether it be on the private side, on the private side, you've seen venture capital firms. Welcome to Yahoo Finance on this Tuesday afternoon. I'm Sean Smith along with Dave Briggs and Richella Kufo. Let's get you up to speed on the market action. We're seeing a bit of a reversal here in the final couple hours of trading. To you look at the Nas at compositive now off just around 1.4% S&P back in negative territory, off just around 8 tens of up percent, Dow barely holding on to gains actually to see right now just at the flat line here. Some comments coming out in the bank of England, Governor Andrew Bailey that's spooking the markets just a little bit. Russell 2000, though at least for now holding on to gains up just around 4 tens of a percent. Take a look inside one of the major averages. Let's take a look at the Dow. The reason why we're not seeing larger losses here for the Dow right now a lot of that has to do with the gains that we're seeing from and Jen and bullish call here from Morgan Stanley pushing that stock up just around 5.5% we also have wall greens here holding on to gain here. So the gains in those two stocks the big reason why we aren't seeing broader losses in the Dow. I want to pull up the mobility sector and specifically look at what's happening in Uber, DoorDash and Ly-",https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9GS0SPvxP2s,71,2022-10-11 19:02:29
3060," green tier holding on a two game here. So the games in those two stocks, the big reason why we aren't seeing broader losses in the Dow. I want to pull up the mobility sector and specifically look at what's happening in Uber, DoorDash and Lyft. You can see Lyft off just around 12% a new proposal from the labor department. We'll make it harder for these types of companies to classify their employees as contractors. So massive implications here for their business model. We're seeing that reflected in this stock. We're actually lifting and all time low, a 12% drop today. DoorDash also hitting an all time low in Uber. You can see off just around a 10%. I also want to take a look at some of the losses that we're seeing in the banking sector. You can see red basically across the board here. JP Morgan, Goldman, UBS, a city bank of America among the biggest declineers here. City, JP Morgan and a city all hitting 52 week lows and move lower here coming ahead of earnings that kick off later this week. Michelle? All right, we're getting you up to speed on global growth. The worst is yet to come. And for many, 2023 will feel like a recession. That warning from the IMF's chief economist as the organization's latest outlook predicts global growth will slow to 2.7%. And that's lower than its July forecast. Now, excluding the peak COVID years, the IMF sees quote, the weakest growth profile since 2001. The report says the three largest economies, the US, the EU and China will continue to slow. And more than a third of the global economy will see two consecutive quarters of contraction. Now, the biggest drivers rushes on Bayesian of Ukraine, the cost of living crisis and China's economic slowdown. We already see the Bank of England intervening again with another bond market rescue effort. Some silver lining albeit in the longer term, the IMF does expect global inflation will decrease to 6.5% next year and 4.1% by 2024. Dave? All right, thank you, Michelle. Joining us now is Ann Berry, the threat needle ventures founder and nice to see you. So you've got the IMF, the Bank of England weighing in, the UK finance minister rolling out the budget three weeks early. What is coming the UK's way? You know, I think they're just going to be a tsunami of continued bad news. And really the reason I say that is because there is now such a crisis of confidence, a real sense as Europe looks at the UK, as the US looks at the UK, that the government that doesn't know what it's doing and it's not thinking through the repercussions of some of the incredibly fast blitz policy it's putting in place. So I think the UK, I think the power continues to get decimated and the guilt continues to get decimated. I think the Bank of England's got a real issue in its hands when it clean up the mess that the trust government has just imposed on it. And the headlines cross right now from Andrew Bailey saying that market volatility went beyond the bank stress test, also saying structural issue prevented targeted intervention. We're seeing the worry here reflected in the US markets. What does it mean for losses here just in terms of the downside risk? And you used to what this? All right, it looks like we just lost in here. We're going to try to reestablish that feed and we will be right back. We're going to try to reestablish that feed and we will be right back. We're going to try to reestablish that feed and we will be right back. We're going to try to reestablish that feed and we will be right back.

3061, So OK. just about 54 minutes to go until the closing bell. Look at that. You're looking at the losses accelerating here. Dow now back in negative territory was up over 300 points at the highs of the day. SMP off just around 910s of a percent Nasdaq leading the losses here up just around 1.5% we know technology and communication services have been under pressure Dave for most of the trading days and the comments coming out of Bank of England Governor Andrew Bailey here spooking the markets in the final hour. And you've got a lot of comments from the Fed all week including today that continue to sound a hawkish note. Not just sounds like we're still going to hit that 75 point hike to fourth straight but it sounds like staying tighter longer is what we continue to hear from the fed. So what's going to be the catalyst as we see markets move back up what can it be we're going to get CPI number on Thursday we're going to start seeing those bank earnings the big bank start to report on Friday you showed us earlier the big banks some of them near 52 week lows could that be a catalyst doubtful given the macro environment given all the headwinds for this economy Rochelle so it looks like we're going to trade sideways if not search for a new bottom now for days if not weeks. I mean and you're seeing with the VIX it's above 33 at the moment so clearly that that fear of recession that fear of contagion that what we're seeing with the bank of England now really having to to play catch up here with what we're seeing with the British Chancellor of the Exchequer they're quite me quieting as he's trying to manage this this fire that's going on in the UK right now so obviously concerns there it does make it more difficult for the bank of England and perhaps a lot of people looking to wonder what this means for the Fed the Fed is determined to stay the course with even with every data point that comes out but you know that that increased hawkishness as we see that global inflation isn't going away as we see these comments from the IMF warning about slower global growth really going to start to take a toll if we don't see some sort of turnaround anytime soon yeah and you can't help but wonder how long does the Fed keep the year months on because there have been a lot of global warming but they've continued to sound a hawkish note regardless of what they see happening around the globe and you asked Ann Berry about this what is the impact on our economy if in fact the UK goes into recession and some say they already are in a recession and Ann Berry just told us a tsunami of bad news is ahead it's also behind yeah exactly and I think lots of speculation whether or not inflation has peaked we certainly got some commentary out from Fed officials recently just saying that maybe we haven't seen peak inflation so and of course you have to ask what that means for the economic impact Jamie Diamond earlier this week saying that he expects the US to tip into a recession within the next six to nine months here so certainly a lot of worry out there on the street I think the question is what has been priced into the markets at this point what has not been priced into the markets and then of course what that could mean here just in terms of the moves that we could see at least over the next couple of months one stock under quite a bit of pressure today is meta the stock off and,https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9GS0SPvxP2s,73,2022-10-11 19:11:37
3062," And then of course, what that could mean here just in terms of the moves that we could see at least over the next couple of months. Well, one stock under quite a bit of pressure today is meta the stock off nearly 5% here. They did though announce new partnerships also products today at its virtual event meta connect Yahoo finances. Ali Garfinkle is here with the latest and Ali a new VR headset. One of the big headlines coming out of this event, which is very, very expensive. Yes, it is very, very expensive. Shana, but they're touting it as kind of their new highly advanced headset, right? For instance, they're saying it's going to have better comfort, better visuals, mixed reality opportunities. And there is a huge price golf. I was looking at an Oculus recently. I was considering buying it. That was for about $400. This is about $1,500. So it's a huge golf and they did announce a new partnerships. For instance, Iron Man VR is coming to meta quest 2. However, how they're imagining you using this headset maybe isn't quite what you're thinking. They see it as a key part of the future of work. The future of work that they articulated definitively involves the quest pro. Well, and Ali, we also got some news here about meta teaming up with Microsoft. A lot of this has to do with just trying to get us immersed in this virtual reality. I guess what can you tell us about this? And do you think it's going to do the trick? You know, Shana, we'll see. I was surprised certainly when Sachin Adela rolled up to meta connect. And the thing that the partnership articulated was that all of Microsoft's enterprise software, things that people use like Teams, Microsoft 365, they're all going to be available in VR now. And the quest pro is set to begin shipping October 25th, right? So there's a sense that they're hoping this will happen sooner rather than later. But it's important to remember that even with this partnership with Microsoft and other partnerships across the board, what I was hearing was that there were a lot of big statements about next year. So yes, they partnered with Microsoft. That's great. But there isn't necessarily a clear sense of when some of this stuff is going to roll out. I couldn't help Shana, but think of a time recently when I was talking to an expert about meta. And the thing he said is just because they have the name doesn't mean they have the tech. So we'll see hopefully they can roll some stuff out soon. Their stocks certainly needs the help. Ali, Dave, you're at Saturdays, though you might be in the market for one of these VR headsets. I'm curious if you spent any time in the metaverse because the article on the Wall Street Journal is pretty savage review. It's out of the employees do not really want to use it even though they are being encouraged to. They were seeing notes leak out that they're not really enjoying the experience. Do you have an Ali review? An Ali review of the metaverse, you know, I do and the thing I can tell you, Dave, is I started bumping into things a lot. I was not particularly good at being in the metaverse. So at a certain point, my review may be suboptimal. I was running into desks. I was running into my closet door. It wasn't ideal. To me, the experience clearly still needs a lot of work. But what I will say is meta's beta's whole company on it. They clearly believe. And I go back to that thing I said. They weren't necessarily clear about when some of this stuff is going to start emerging. But I am still metaverse curious, Dave. That's what I would say. Metaverse curious. Okay, not as bad as what we've heard from some out there, although not really a review. I don't think that's going to get a lot of people to try it for the first time. Ali Garfingle, thanks so much for that. We mentioned the losses that we're seeing in meta today. Part of that has to do with the downgrade that the stock out from Atlantic equities. The analysts they're lowering is rating from overweight to neutral. Also cutting is price target to 160 bucks. Well above where it is a trading today. Rochelle, lots of questions just about the metaverse Facebook's pivot here. It's total rebranding. You know, you're to date the stock sale off 62% even with the product announcements and the partnerships announcements that we just heard from Ali. Clearly Wall Street is not totally on board. I mean, and you have to wonder when you look at the price tag. Not just of what meta has now invested in trying to make this pivot to the metaverse, that we have no idea in terms of the time horizon when we'll actually see it. When you figure $1,500 for a headset on top of everything else, it's as Ali said. So creating tech for something that's not actually here, but it's not...",https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9GS0SPvxP2s,74,2022-10-11 19:15:45
3063," Verizon will actually see it when you figure $1,500 for a headset on top of everything else. It's as Ali said, you're creating tech for something that's not actually here that's not got wide, wide mainstream adoption at the moment. I do have concerns, obviously, when it comes to the timeline and what Meta is doing right now there, it's a long play. We're seeing some of these plays, things like roadblocks, other companies wanting to put a foot in the door, but certainly not investing to the extent that Facebook is. At a certain point, shareholders are going to want to see some returns on this investment. But those might not come for some analysts have told us, ten, maybe even fifteen years. It is remarkable the downfall of one of the great companies on the planet. And back to that headset real quickly, the Wall Street Journal with a review said with the short battery life and the price tag, it's out of touch with reality. And the Washington Post called it the MEP, as an MEH, MET diverse, so not great reviews for what they hoped would dispel some of the bad news, including the downgrade from Atlantic equities, which cited not just the metaverse, but the ad market out there. Is it a really bad place? And as we talked about with Brent Thill last week, he said, look, going into a recession that is the first thing people cut. And Meta is already falling behind Google and everyone is falling behind TikTok. So if we had a recession, that's the first place they're going to cut. So what do you like about Meta right now? The Metaverse doesn't look good, the ad revenue doesn't look good. I don't know what the bearish story is. Exactly. I don't think Wall Street, I don't think there is a lot to like about it. When you take a look at the performance that we've seen here today. The privacy changes. Just over 60 percent, the privacy changes, like you mentioned, they're a $1,500 VR headset. I get the concept of it trying to make it more accessible, trying to entice creators and working professionals to adopt this vision that Meta clearly has of a virtual future. I just don't know if it's going to be enough and don't think it's going to do the trick just in terms of getting people on board with the Metaverse. I think that $1,500 price target meat or price tag, maybe I'm wrong. That is just too expensive and it's a little bit too much for people to pay out when they're not even sold on the Metaverse yet, Michelle. And I thought it was interesting that if the idea is that they want people to use this in the workplace, then what did people come back to work for to then sit there with a VR headset on? It's sort of like moving in the opposite direction with where the future of work seems to be headed. I mean, and when you look at roadblocks, which is also considered a mini Metaverse play, they're stock also not doing well and we saw that they were rated underweight in new coverage of Barclays as well. They're saying that the platform, it still was a primary beneficiary of the pandemic when everyone was stuck at home, but again, once you're now out of the worst of the pandemic, where do you go from here? And I think this is something that roadblocks is just that microcosm of what some of the challenges that Meta's going to continue to have. Boy, look at that stock chart for Firmetta. Four-year low and that note, we mentioned Atlantic equity, says they're going to lose an additional 5% market share in the next two years from position that is already an ugly one for Meta. October 26th, earnings. Excited? I am excited. It's going to be an interesting one for us.

I was looking at the time stamps. We had a big sell off and I'm going to get to that in a second, but I want to show you the British pound because the timestamp match up perfectly here. Now this is inverted. Usually we see this the other way around, but this means a strengthing dollar. This is intraday and right before the bond market closes, our UTC times by the way, we had Andrew Bailey. He is the Bank of England governor. He was speaking in Washington and he was basically talking his line about how they're doubling down on this bond buying program into Friday, but he warned because they are trying to stabilize market prices in British guilds for their pension fronts. You need to get these transactions done by Friday. That is a message, message pension funds. We saw the U.S. dollar appreciate on this and I'll show you what happened in the market. It was a very steep sell off. Now percentage wise, it wasn't the biggest. You can see in the S&P 500, we're not even down 1%. But I measure something called the New York Stock Exchange advancing issues, minus declining issues. In other words, nicely ticked. That was registering minus 1,500 readings, something I haven't seen in weeks. This is a very illiquid market. Could have something to do. These headlines appeared right before the bond market closed at 3pm. That could be a factor because yesterday was closed for the bond market. Adding it all up, I would say the markets are still structurally weak. You take a look at the year to date in the S&P 500. We are knocking on the lows of the year right here. So we'll have to see what happens in the final 40 minutes minus a couple here in trading. Jared Blickery, thank you my friend. Good to see you. Rochelle. All right. Well, Yahoo, finance is Julie Hyman is live from the Greenwich Economic Forum with speakers are discussing portfolio strategies and alternative investing amid all these market headwinds. She's joined now by just capital CEO Martin Whitaker. Hey Julie. Hi Rochelle. Thank you so much. Indeed, I'm right here with Martin Whitaker. And just capital is a firm that looks into everything ESG, but sort of beyond that as well, sort of making corporate America a more just place. And there's been sort of a backlash against this sort of ESG movement, if you will. You've had some ETFs that are anti ESG. So kind of how are you thinking about that environment right now?wend introduction to the",https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9GS0SPvxP2s,76,2022-10-11 19:24:28
3065," If you will, you've had some ETFs that are anti-ESG. So kind of how are you thinking about that environment right now? Well, there is a distinction, as you said, between what just capital does and the ESG movement. I've been in that space a long time. And I think there is a lot of criticism around the ESG, the ESG investing that is valid. And ESG has sort of not really addressed a lot of issues like standardization, quality of data and meaning and things like that. What just does is we pull the public on what issues matter. We track big publicly traded corporations on how they're doing on those things. And then we bring that to market in the form of investment products, indices, data, media, content, and so on and so forth. So for us, we're really in the business of tracking what our company is actually doing. And then when you pull the public and ask them what they think about this, Americans are actually united, not divided. We see a huge amount of agreement across political lines as well, but by income, by geographic location, et cetera, on companies doing more. And the last thing I'll point out, which is really important, given where we are right now, is that it's good for business. All the just indices have outperformed their benchmarks since inception and live trading. We've got the spread between the top 10% and bottom 10% over the last, since January 2018, it's a spread of over 40%. So we think it's good for business. But do companies think it's good for business? And especially do they think it's good for business? I mean, it's easy to say something's good for business, you can do something when everything's going well, right? It's when times are getting tougher, that that's when it's a true test of a new way of looking at your corporate balance sheet, for example, and your spending, et cetera, all of that. So is that sort of holding up and do you expect it to continue to hold up if we go into a recession? I do, I'll tell you why. I think we saw during COVID, how many companies responded, during a complete shock to the system, turned out companies that were leaders on investing in their workforce, for example, were much more resilient during that period of time. We haven't seen a pullback from the companies that we work with, so we engage probably over 500, maybe 600 companies. If anything this year, we've seen an intensification of their engagement with us, working with us on the underlying issues. That's kind of interesting. So no, I think companies that believe that this is good for business, are in it for the long haul and probably see it as a way to actually more effectively manage your recession. The other thing I wanted to ask you about is, during this period of time when the workforce has been so tight, right? You have seen this surge in power of the worker. You've seen a surge in unionization. You've seen people sort of saying, I want to be hybrid and getting that as the job market starts to change and shift, and we start to see maybe layoffs pick up. Do you think they'll retain that power? Well, I think it's constantly shifting, you know, who wear that power really resides, but it doesn't take away from the fundamental issue of companies that invest in their workforce, provide great training, good benefits, you know, they have better retention, better productivity. You know, the business rationale is very strong, and company leaders, CEOs and boards that get that, believe that that's part of their competitive advantage. So I don't think you become a good employer one day, and then a bad employer the next day, depending on how the labor market's moving. I think you, Ewe, that's part of your business to CREDO, or it's not. But I guess there are more companies sort of making that part of their business CREDO by necessity over the past couple of years, right? And I just wonder, is that necessity that impetus going to be taken away a little bit? I mean, we'll find out. I think we didn't really see it during COVID, like I said, and the economic shockwave that happened after that.",https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9GS0SPvxP2s,77,2022-10-11 19:28:31
3066," I mean, we'll find out. I think we didn't really see it during COVID, like I said, and the economic shockwave that happened after that. I think companies today are beginning to see human capital as a real source of alpha. We see that in our own research. And so if you're really trying to protect from the downside, batting down the hatches, you might feel like you've got, you know, more of an ability to control wages, for example, or the amount of money you spend on benefits. But, you know, and maybe short-term, you have to pull some of those levers. But for the most part, I like to think that companies that we've seen so far are who believe that human capital is part of what makes them special, will continue with that. Here's hoping. Here's hoping. Martin, it's good to see you in person, especially. Martin Whitaker of Just Capital. Thank you. Back to you guys. All right, great stuff. I'll very own Julie Heimannet with Martin, Whitaker. Bye, well, Shares of Uber, Lyft, and DoorDash falling sharply on a new proposed rule on how gig workers should be classified. We'll have those details for you after the break. Secondly, how do you think it's your first job to territory? If you're interested in education,ία,pas, Doordash lift uber all-ticking massive hit today on a new proposal that could shake up the gig economy, the plan from the Labor Department, would make it harder for companies to classify workers as independent contractors. We want to bring in Angela Zino, CFRA Research Senior Equity Analyst. Angela, it's great to see you. Ahead of this announcement, you had a buy rating on uber, buy rating on lift. What are their implications? Do you think, if in fact, we do see this rule go into effect? Yeah, I mean, listen, I think this is, right now, just kind of a proposal that's out there. I mean, from my understanding, if this goes into effect, it essentially just reverts the standards to the Obama administration era.",https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9GS0SPvxP2s,78,2022-10-11 19:33:22
3067," From my understanding, if this goes into effect, it essentially just reverts the standards to the Obama that it demonstrates an error and doesn't fully result in a full reclassification of drivers. That being said, clearly, it would probably have some implications on the margin profile of these companies to the downside. Our view is clearly there are different factors at stake here. I'm looking at each one of these individual companies. They do have flexibility to do other things in terms of pulling levers on the pricing side of things to offset potentially higher costs out there, which you would expect to take place if this were to go into effect. That being said, I think the outlook is very mixed at this point in time. We do think we were better positioned than left as most would think if this were to go into effect. Now, who has already been under pressure down 41% year to date? What would you need to hear from the companies that would instill a bit more confidence if this proposal does in fact go through? Yeah, I mean, listen, I think first and foremost, we have to see exactly what kind of some of the details are here because at the end of the day here, when we think about how this is going to be looked at, most of these, we believe most drivers out there continue to prefer the flexibility and utilize these platforms as a secondary source of income. Even if this rule were going to affect the vast majority of these drivers would probably not be impacted in the actual cost profile would probably be that impacted. I think the bigger concern out there is, do we potentially see a full reclassification of the giga's economy over time that's clearly the bare case scenario, I think, in the broader space in general. But as far as I'm concerned here, I think what we've heard just from both Uber and Lyft today is a minor positive. We have seen Uber kind of have to navigate a change in classification out in London. And they've actually been able to kind of do it very successfully. Yeah, blog post from Lyft says no immediate or direct impact on Lyft business at this time, noting a 45 day public comment period. And this does not reclassify Lyft drivers as employees. This would be from bad to worse because Uber is already down 43%. Year to date and Lyft 74% year to date. But you said, Angelo, Uber is better positioned to survive this. If in fact it goes into place, presumably they have a lot more drivers. How are they better suited to handle a rule like this? Yeah, I mean, listen, the number of factors, first and foremost, they've already kind of inflicted a note. We think they've now got a business model that's sustainably free cash flow positive. But just the scalability of this company, where the market share they've got within their markets, and the size of this company allows them to kind of navigate higher costs better than Lyft out there. They're also more geographically diversified, right? So I'm going to impact within the US market probably wouldn't have as much of an impact for them as that for Lyft, which is almost entirely US-based. But clearly, these are both companies that have been significantly impacted here over the last 12 months from what we've seen in the broader stock market. And you definitely concerns about kind of the macro factors as well as we kind of look ahead into 2023 and what they could potentially have, how it could potentially impact the business as you kind of look at these, you know, in conjunction with these potential, you know, initiatives on the political side of things. So, Angela, you mentioned that macro economic factors at play here. This, of course, will put more pressure on the businesses, of course, potentially disrupting the free cash flow. But do you think this will then, I guess, potentially trigger more or some consolidation within this space? Well, I mean, I'd say right now we can look at the market. I mean, this is... Okay, we have a few technical difficulties there, but a big thank you to Angela Zeno for joining us this afternoon. All right, coming up, Coinbase, share the room.",https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9GS0SPvxP2s,79,2022-10-11 19:37:12
3068," OK, we have a few technical difficulties there, but a big thank you to Angelusino for joining us this afternoon. Alright, coming up, Coinbase shares are on the rise. That's after announcing a partnership with Google. Details on that deal. mid-ass down to Thanks for watching! Thanks for watching! Thanks for watching! Thanks for watching!",https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9GS0SPvxP2s,80,2022-10-11 19:41:17
3069," Some challenges here ahead of it now. It is important for now. Credit Swiss denying any improper misconduct here saying that it is cooperating with US authorities. They did put out a statement on this saying that credits was doesnt tolerate tax evasion. That's not a surprise. They also went on to say that we have implemented extensive enhancements. Ascension 2014, what you were just talking about, were shall to read out individuals who seek to conceal assets from tax authorities. You just mentioned the number of hurdles that credits was housed in front of them. We know Wall Street has had a lot of questions just about what the bank will look like 6, 9, 12 months from now. So this of course is just the latest challenge here and we are seeing that reflected in a share today with the stock once again under pressure. All right, my play today is Coinbase. A top trending ticker here on Yahoo finances comes on a new partnership with Google. Now the tech giant teaming up with Coinbase to accept crypto payments for cloud services. Customers in the Web 3 industry will get first dibs with the ability to pay a using crypto. So Google is also going to use Coinbase Prime for institutional services. This is just Coinbase's latest agreement with companies outside of their crypto space. They've got to deal with BlackRock to help manage and trade Bitcoin. They also have an agreement with Meta to support integration with Coinbase Wallets. So again, the stock popping today. Lots of questions just about crypto adoption, how mainstream it's going to be. Obviously crypto has been under tremendous amount of pressure a year to date to say the least. That reflected in Coinbase's stock sense of start of the year, but some investor excitement today. Bitcoin as well just kind of locked in Matt versus 19,000 stuck at that. And on the flip side though, and a letter to G20 finance ministers, the president of the Dutch Central Bank warned of a risk that crypto poses to investors and market confidence and suggest the potential breakup of Coinbase and other major crypto players. So not all good news clearly in the sector nor for Coinbase. Some good news though from my play, which is Walmart, always low prices. But the price of the stock is up on a note from Morgan Stanley suggesting Walmart plus could be worth $45 billion. The retail giant launched its membership program in 2020 and have been to compete with Amazon Prime. Cost is similar, $12.95 per month, that includes free shipping, delivery and savings on fuel among other benefits. Members also have access to Paramount plus streaming content, a new addition. Morgan Stanley's Simeon Gutman says, quote, we're not sure the stock is getting full credit for Walmart's progress in growing membership and for the recurring income stream it generates. Walmart does not disclose the actual numbers of members, but Gutman estimates a figure could reach 18.5 million or 14 plus percent of US households. And that represents the $45 billion figure we mentioned there. At add 17 billion to the current stock price shares up about 3% today. Down though, 8% year to date. We shall, this is a big note out on the future of Walmart plus we always talk about Amazon Prime today being their second Prime Day, which is kind of not as well received as they might have hoped. A lot of upside here for Walmart. I mean you think so clearly it's been working well for Amazon and that's the muddle to go by. Even though, obviously Walmart was the more established brand. I do think this is a very smart play from Walmart. I do have to wonder though how thin consumers can actually be stretched and will they be willing to have both their Amazon Prime accounts plus then having this with Walmart or will they perhaps pick and choose. And then when you add on bundling on top of that when it comes to them both teaming up with streaming services, it's a lot. You might have to pick sides if you just don't have the bandwidth to be able to afford both Amazon and Walmart's prices right now. Yeah, I think the bigger question also going forward is what this could potentially mean for Amazon Prime membership. We know that Amazon Prime membership has up until this point remained very sticky. If there is a competing offer out there from Walmart that continues to gain a popularity. Obviously this could be a huge challenge here for Amazon going forward. The one thing that does differentiate the two offerings here is clearly that fuel savings that Dave you mentioned there in terms of Walmart. So when we're seeing gas prices so high and now likely to creep back above $4 a gallon when we're looking at the nationwide average, I think that would be enough to entice some people to Walmart instead of what they're getting from Amazon Prime. Yeah, you put enough miles on your car.",https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9GS0SPvxP2s,81,2022-10-11 19:45:59
3070," $4 a gallon when we're looking at the nationwide average. I think that would be enough to entice some people to Walmart instead of what they're getting from Amazon Prime. Yeah, you put enough miles on your cards pretty easy to make up 13 bucks in one month. Coming up, Athlete's your brand, Viori looking to disrupt the active wear market and the West Coast brand hopes a new presence in New York City will do the trick. Startup CEO tells us what to expect next. The Atlesia Explosion continues in industry estimated to be worth more than $660 billion by 2030. Get the new player in New York City this weekend the active California lifestyle brand Viori opening its first man hatton location Friday in their CEO Joe. Joe Kudler joins us now. Joe, good to see you. What's old is new again. Explain the evolution of the brand from DTC, primarily online to now brick and mortar stores. Absolutely. When we launched the brand back in 2015, we had a vision to bring a new perspective to the marketplace. We felt like the brands that existed had, just grown a little bit tired, over-distributed at mass market retail. And we wanted to do something fresh and new for men. It was all designed around this ethos of built-to-move-in, styled for life. We wanted to build a product that would take you through a tough workout into your everyday life. And the only way that we knew how to reach consumers was through the internet. And I'm very grateful, you know, being an early adopter of digital advertising, we built a really great presence online. But like all great things online, there you reach ceilings and costs of advertising have gone up incrementally since our inception. And we've found that our ability to operate stores where we can embrace community, being-",https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9GS0SPvxP2s,82,2022-10-11 19:50:17
3071," things in costs of advertising have gone up incrementally since our inception. And we've found that our ability to operate stores where we can embrace community, be in service to the community, add value in people's lives, provide a really great experience in the physical world, has really taken kind of a front and center role in our growth strategy looking forward. So very, very excited about, you know, all of our stores in the US, but also especially this one that we've got opening this week in New York City. Joe, we talk about the explosion of a leisure. You mentioned the fact that you started as a mens brand. You now offer women's apparel as well. When you talk about the growth opportunity here, you're up against some major players within this space. What do you think is the potential market that you would be able to capture over the next five to 10 years? Like, we're very bullish about our business. You know, we believe that, you know, some of the most important apparel businesses of our time are being built today by active wear brands, performance, fabrications that don't wrinkle, they're breathable, they move with your body, they're just more comfortable. They're lessons that we learned during the pandemic when we were all living in sweatpants. Now we're taking those lessons and we're applying them to sportswear, product that you would wear to work, product that you would travel in, where to the golf course. You know, those are, those are very fast growing categories for us. And so when we look at the addressable market, we don't just look at the active wear space. We look at apparel in general, which we all know is very large. And we're excited to be bringing in offering not only for your workouts, but for every aspect of your life. Some of those competitors, Sean, I mentioned obviously, Lulu Lemon stands out. I'm sure more than if you said you don't get in a space that they already dominate, but you certainly have competed right with them. How do you differentiate yourself from say Lulu or Ron or Mac Weldon? I know this new store, which opens in a couple of days, is about 500 feet from Lulu. So it certainly matters to shoppers here in New York. Yeah, absolutely. We're right around the corner from Nike, a brand that I grew up with and you know, looked up to. But you know, when we think about what differentiates Viori, we were born on the beaches of Southern California. And for folks that have spent time there, you know that there's this effortless casual DNA that people live by in Southern California. And we wanted to bring that into active wear in a way that had really not been done before. Again, going back to build to move and style for life, it's product that you actually want to wear, not just product that's going to identify you as a person going to the gym. So we prioritize incredibly soft fabrics that over 50% of the materials we work with are custom developed by us to strike that balance between performance and comfort. We prioritize a modern athletic fit. So it just looks great on. And we strip the product down of all those unnecessary in our humble opinion design features that identify you as somebody going to compete in a sport or work out. And it makes our product extremely versatile. So our customers love our product not only for working out, but just wearing it everywhere, whether you're at home, you're out and about, you're going to the office, the already works for you across so many different aspects of your life. So we're very proud to have brought that versatility to the men's market. And now we're bringing a lot of those lessons, a lot of those fabrics that we're famous for to our women's assortment, which today is about 50% of our business, which are there certainly has been demand for your product is evident in the growth numbers that you've been posting over the last couple of years. But we are entering this economic slowdown. Inflation remains high. Consumers are beginning to pull back on some of their spending. I'm on your site right now. Jaggers, $94 hoodies, $96. Are you seeing any evidence of people either trading down or spending less just in terms of their overall purchases? I mean, there's no doubt that we are dealing with challenging times in the US and globally. There what we're seeing is a bifurcation between market leaders and brands that are truly differentiated and have a really unique value proposition and your middle of the pack kind of mass market legacy brands. You know, you're seeing, you know, some of the public companies in our space that are market leaders still growing, you know, in the 20-30% year-over-year range, whereas, you know, some of the legacy players are seeing flat or or copying down. You know, we're really fortunate to be in the space where we have a highly differentiated.",https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9GS0SPvxP2s,83,2022-10-11 19:54:38
3072," We're over year range. Whereas some of the legacy players are seeing flat or or comping down. We're really fortunate to be in a space where we have a highly differentiated position. We're speaking to a premium, it's a premium product. And we aren't seeing any changes to date between Viori and its relationship with our customers. They're still showing up. We're posting really strong growth. We're encouraged about Q4 in the holiday ahead. But we are being cautiously optimistic when we look towards next year. We're not going to try to swing for the fences. We're looking at our investments in our growth very wisely with a fine tooth comb. And we want to be intelligent as we enter this new landscape where we're not ultimately clear on what's going to happen to the United States economy. The pandemic was really good for Viori. I mean, it went from fewer than 100 employees to around 500 to expect to go to 1000. Are men and women now wearing athleisure to work? Is that post pandemic office where? Yes, in some respects, we're not seeing categories like our loungewear transition as well into the office. Still very much for your after five and weekend wear. But Viori has really made an name for itself beyond just core active in those travel commute assortments, those outdoor assortments, which for us has really rooted in outerwear. And those categories have seen an incredible growth over 2022 and we anticipate that trend to continue into 2023. And Joe, real quick, as we wrap this up, we've heard from a number of retailers over the last couple of quarters inventory levels are excessive here when we compared to what we've seen over the last year or two. What are you seeing at Viori? Absolutely. I think for a lot of our peers, you saw delays in their spring deliveries, which push product and up against fall and so we saw promotions. As we transition from spring, summer into fall, you're seeing the same thing with deliveries. As you know, the supply chain was materially broken, heading into this fall. We've been very fortunate to be very close to our supply chain and our partners. We have not been immune to these challenges. We've dealt with some delays, but materially, we're in a very good position. As the brand continues to acquire market share and grow at a very fast pace, we've been able to work through inventory challenges without getting overly promotional, which has been a goal for us since we launched our business back in 2015. Well, Joe, you got two big fans of Viori here on set. So I have a feeling we will be visiting your Soho location in the near future. Joe Kavlad, thanks so much for joining us. We wish you the best. All right, shares of Disney here under pressure off just about 2% the company announcing moments ago that is delaying a slate of upcoming films among them. Blade, Deadpool 3 and Fantastic 4. And now Blade's release is moving from September 2023 to, or excuse me, November 2023 to September 2024. Deadpool is shifting a couple of months from September to November 2024 and Fantastic 4's release now being delayed into 2025. Coming up here, we are counting down to the closing bell on Wall Street, Dow, back in positive territory. Up just 54 points. SAP and Nasdaq fell firmly in the red. The Nasdaq off 1%. We'll be right back. We'll be right back.",https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9GS0SPvxP2s,84,2022-10-11 19:58:56
3073," I'll hurry. We just less than two minutes away from the closing bell and the downhang on. We are looking at the average right now. We are seeing that the NASDAQ is the one that's underperforming down more than 1% and the S&P 500 down 710s of a percent. We've got the Dow on the flat line right now. Looking at the NASDAQ 100, we're watching Meta down 4%. We've got communication services which are really dragging on the NASDAQ 100. Meta flex down more than 6%. And then some of the consumer discretionary like Amazon down 1%, Tesla is down more than 2% and here's the sector action. Here's the closing bell for today, Tuesday, October 11th. Meta wraps up today's trading action. We are back and forth for most of the trading days and those losses accelerating here in the final 90 minutes of trading. We are looking at the S&P and NASDAQ closing in the red, the NASDAQ, the worst performer of the three major averages, off just over 1% down, leaking out gains up just 35 points in terms of the sector action that NS ended with their real estate consumer staples, leading the way technology, communication services or the ligaments. That's why we're seeing the NASDAQ 115. We'll let's take a closer look at the action we saw today. And for that we want to bring in Kevin Nicholson, Riverfront Investment Group, a global fixed income, a chief investment officer. Paul Schatz, a heritage capital president. Paul, let me start with you just in terms of the losses that we've seen play out over the last couple of weeks, losses today in the S&P and the NASDAQ. What's your big takeaway from the recent action that we've been seeing? Well, look, if you open up any newspaper, turn on even this regular network television news, you can't escape the bad news. It's literally a barrage day after day after day. So it's really weighing on and beating up investors psyche. Nonetheless, this is one, it's a midterm election year. When there's a decline in the midterm election year, you typically see a bottom in Q4, most specifically in October. Bottoms don't form with good news. Bottoms form when no one wants to own stocks. So if you look at midterm election years like 2018, it was December. And then you saw in 1998, 1990, 1994, 2002, the bear market low. This is what happens. I don't want to say the bottom is today on the point, but now the narrative is stocks can't make low until.",https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9GS0SPvxP2s,85,2022-10-11 20:03:26
3074," the bear market low. This is what happens. I don't want to say the bottom is today on the point, but now the narrative is stocks can't make a low until the Fed pivots. And I'll argue vociferously that stocks are absolutely going to make a low before the Fed pivots. There's no dot in my mind. The key is you need to see some relief with a two-year note. The two-year notes got to pull back. It's you got to get some relief from the dollar before stocks can make a durable low. Kevin, given the language out of the Fed, are we anywhere near a pivot and is cash king? No, I don't think that we're not anywhere near a pivot at this juncture. I think the Fed is going to continue to hike until they feel comfortable that they have actually stomped out inflation. The other thing too is that we're going to see the Fed, the only way that the Fed pivots is if it actually breaks something or more importantly that there is a financial crisis. I think that would be when you would see the Fed pivot if they haven't finished with stomping out inflation. Cash is a bit of a king right now. We have in our portfolios, we have an elevated amount of cash, but unlike in years past holding cash, you're actually losing some purchasing power, just given the fact that the dollar is so strong at this time. So then Paul, as we look ahead to earning season, then as we get ready to get into the thick of it, then what are the expectations there? Paul, that's for you. I lost audio from it. I'm sorry. No problem. I was asking you about your expectations for earning season. Oh, again, just like the fundamental backdrop, it's really hard to believe earning season is going to have a lot of upside surprises. But remember, to me, it's not exactly what the news is. It's how stocks react. What you want to see is you want to see stocks go up in the face of bad news. That's a clear sign. Just like we saw in March of 2009 and April 2009, stocks are washed out. It's really hard to have good expectations coming into this earning season. Clearly, we're going to hear what companies have to say, but I want to see the reactions. I want to see stocks go up in the face of bad news. I want to see companies use the dollar as an excuse and then the Fed as an excuse. And let's not forget. The last four Fed chairs have all made monumental errors that caused that, you know, as Kevin said, something to break. And we're at that point right now. I mean, they're making another monumental error. So here we are again. I think you've got to watch for that final breaking point and then volatility should begin to calm down. I think right the beginning of the end, not the end of the beginning. Coming in earning season expected to be very volatile here. We certainly have seen estimates revised to the downside, the strong dollar, the uncertainty in terms of the economic backdrop here, all challenges here for the companies that are about to report. What do you think just in terms of, I guess, your expectations for the season and the likelihood that we could see even further a downside revisions? I have very low expectations for this earning season. If we go back to June 30th and until now, we've almost seen earnings revision for 2022 come down almost $16 and into 2023, they've come down about $11. And really what it's really showing us is that most of that change and when we look at, you know, 12 months for it, it's a little over $5 that they have come down. So what we're really looking at is Q3 and Q4 that have been revised down heavily. And so unless we get some type of upside surprise here in Q3 and Q4, we're going to see pressure on equities continue. And so I really am not holding out a whole lot of hope for going into the end of the year because when you think about the equity risk premium, it has come down this year largely because treasury yields have gone up and earnings yields really haven't moved a ton.",https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9GS0SPvxP2s,86,2022-10-11 20:07:31
3075," the equity risk premium. It has come down this year, largely because treasury yields have gone up and earnings yields really haven't moved a ton, but it would argue for the fact that you would have a stable low inflation environment if, you know, the equity risk premium has come down. And that's not the environment that we have right now. Man, oh man, the bad news just piling on here. Let's see if we can find something Paul, could the catalyst be a good inflation print later this week? I mean, sure, the catalyst is going to probably come from where no one expects it. So everyone's so focused on inflation, everyone's focused on the Fed pivot. It's going to come from some roast because it always does. How many people can you drag on right now that are going to pound the bullish case other than the ones that start on January 1 and pound the bullish case? And the answer is almost none. They're very few because it's so dark. But remember, I'm not saying you should go all in and, and you'll love up your portfolio now. I think you need to be tactical or surgical or opportunistic, whatever attitude you want to use. But clearly, there are opportunities. There's always opportunity in market, especially ones that have come down so much. And look, the S&P is down roughly 25% this year. It's not like the S&P hasn't priced in at least a mod recession for Q2 and Q1 and Q2 next year. We didn't go down 25% because things are, you know, rainbows and unicorns. So I would argue, perhaps part of most of much of what's coming in Q1 and Q2 has already been priced in. We're going to see shortly how much that's reality. So tough road ahead. But as you mentioned, the opportunity is still to be had a big thank you to our market panel, Kevin Nicholson and Paul Shatz. Thank you for joining us this afternoon. All right. Well, the International Monetary Fund is sharing a gloomy global outlook for 2023 warning of slower growth and the risk of recession next year. Yeah, who finances? Jen Schonberger sat down with the funds director of monetary policy and capital markets. Jen, what did they tell you? Hey, good afternoon, Michelle. That's right. The IMF downgrading its outlook for global growth and also warning that the risks to the stability of the global financial system have, quote, materially worsened and that markets are at risk of disorderly repricing. As you mentioned, I sat down with device Adrian, the head of capital markets and monetary policy for the IMF to discuss this and whether some of the turmoil that we've seen in Britain's bond market could be a precursor for elsewhere. Take a listen. We have certainly seen market liquidity in many markets around the world. But market dysfunction, we have only seen in the UK in recent weeks. So what's happening there is that a new fiscal plan was announced and that has led to a very, very sharp rise in interest rates. And the rise in interest rates has been dysfunctional with adverse feedback loops due to financial vulnerabilities in the non-bank financial sector. So that's what triggered the bank of England to intervene in order to restore orderly market functioning. And while the rise in interest rates has co-move to some degree with other interest rates, that's something very normal. Interest rates tend to move together. We haven't seen a spill over in terms of market dysfunction. So you're not seeing any similar risks akin to what we're seeing playing out in the UK now that may be brewing in other markets around the world to be clear? Well, there's only risks that the situation could change. So what we've seen around the world in many countries is that interest rates have been increased tremendously in some countries, 3, 4, 5 percent in other countries even more than that. Most of the tightening has been done within orderly market conditions. So it has been that orderly tightening. And our baseline forecast is that this orderly tightening is going to continue.",https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9GS0SPvxP2s,87,2022-10-11 20:11:46
3076," orderly market conditions. So it has been ordered tightening. And our baseline forecast is that this orderly tightening is going to continue. Having said that, there's certainly a risk of this orderly tightening at some point. There could be dysfunction more broadly outside of the UK as well. So Warren Buffett famously has said that when the tide runs out, we find out who has been skinny dipping. So as central banks around the world have been raising rates, what sorts of vulnerabilities has that revealed? Is this perhaps the point in time where China's property market finally sees a potential for reckoning after experts have been calling for this for what 15 years now? Does the US housing market have farther to drop? What are some unforeseen vulnerabilities there that this is on masking? So there are many vulnerabilities out there and we're flagging in the global financial stability report. What kind of vulnerabilities could be acting up once negative shocks are hitting? So we see leverage, we see maturity transformation and liquidity mismatches around the world, particularly in the non-bank financial sector. And when further negative news was to occur for a variety of reasons that could indeed uncover those vulnerabilities. Switching gears slightly in the report, you note the IMF's Global Bank Stress Test shows that in a scenario with an abrupt and sharp tightening of financial conditions, that would send the global economy into recession in 2023 amid high inflation. My question is how closer we to that sort of scenario, given that financial conditions have already tightened quite a bit, would it be prudent for central banks and the Fed to perhaps hit the pause button here and take a step back, given that monetary policy operates with a lag and see how things progress before hiking further? Yeah, we are very comfortable with the humanitarian policy that is currently envisioned by the Federal Reserve and that is priced into markets. We think that this is what is needed in order to get inflation down. So to get inflation down, you need to slow economic activity to some degree. Hopefully this will be a soft landing or even if it was to be a recession, it could be a shallow recession we hope. But of course, there are downside risks around that forecast and we could see a more severe recession with a relatively high likelihood. On there you have it, the IMF appears to be on the same page as the Federal Reserve when it comes to rate hikes and fighting inflation. Of course, whether that means a soft landing or a shallow recession remain for these guys? Indeed, well thank you for that great stuff. Jen Schonberger, thanks so much for this afternoon. All right, well coming up, a new survey reveals where Gen Z is a shopping, what they're eating and which social media platforms they're using. The results and what this means for those companies and stocks next.",https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9GS0SPvxP2s,88,2022-10-11 20:15:58
3077," Music music I'm going to have to go back to the first one. We'll see you next time. Piper Sandler's teen survey out today revealing where Gen Z is spending its money. Now, ATHLEASURE is still a leader in that parallel space and Nike remaining the top brand in the category here to break down. The report is one of the authors. We have Ed Eramah. He's Piper Sandler's managing director ed. It's great to see you here. Lots of takeaways. I know you're focused on the top of the survey. So, Amazon, a top e-commerce site here. Amongst teens, we mentioned the fact that Nike is still a favorite brand in terms of wallet share, clothing reaching the highest record at the highest level that we've seen in terms of wallet share since 2012. It certainly seems like teens for the most part are spending. But what was your big takeaway? Yeah, I think that's exactly right. We are seeing very strong spending on teens. Interestingly, we have seen a little bit of deterioration from the spring survey. And I also note that we did have a question about how you feel about the economy. And the teens definitely are feeling a less positive than they did. So, it's certainly something to watch. But thus far, they continue to spend, as you pointed out, apparel hitting a record share among that upper income female, which I think speaks to this idea that they're out. They want their friends to see them. And they're really focused on how they look. And Ed, with Deschorena mentioned, their Amazon 52% of the teen surveyed had it as their favorite e-commerce site. How much of that is those sort of some of these Amazon brands versus it just being a convenient way to sort of get what they need? It's clearly a combination. I mean, the way the question is phrased is what's your favorite place to shop? And so that encompasses all things. And so I think Amazon for that teen is somewhat of a default. But we do think that they are buying both a private label Amazon product, as well as their favorite items that they're putting in that search box. So, clearly, Amazon is very dominant when it comes to a teen spend. But we're seeing interesting movement underneath. And Ed, when it comes to teen spend, I know you're very closely tracking threat up and the real, real. Now, we are seeing a bit of a deterioration here in terms of female interest, at least, in using the second-hand e-commerce platforms. Only 37% of teens, I sound from 41% a year ago. What do you think is driving that shift? Because you mentioned at the top there that teens are a little bit more, I guess, wary just about where the economy is headed from here. You know, it's a really interesting kind of under them, because actually from a social issue perspective, the environment was number one. So in a way, you would assume that second-hand, which is obviously very environmentally friendly, would be ranked very highly. But interestingly, we've seen engagement in second-hand continue to deteriorate. We postulate it has to do with the fact that she wants new fashion today, she's going out, she doesn't want stuff from before. She's maybe now one of the less focused on accessories, which is a real cornerstone of a lot of these second-hand sites. But obviously, she's looking for that fresh outfit when she sees those friends. And it's interesting, because even when you look at the breakdown for cosmetics, you see things like makeup and the",https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9GS0SPvxP2s,89,2022-10-11 20:21:32
3078," and hand sites, but obviously she's looking for that fresh outfit when she sees those friends. It's interesting, because even when you look at the breakdown for cosmetics, you see things like elf position does the number one cosmetics brand. Obviously that's more for the more budget-conscious consumer. But then you also see alter also doing well as a preferred beauty destination as well as we dig deep into those numbers. How do you see those breaking down? My colleague who covers alphas is very constructive on it. She actually upgraded it this morning. Obviously, beauty remains a priority area of spend, I think for the female, it's number three after apparel and food. And so again, part of this idea of reopening, being out, being active. Interestingly, I think with elf, though, this is a brand that's likely very well positioned for what could be a more difficult macro, very attractive price points. And so I think that's one of the reasons why we've gotten as a firm work constructive on the name. At one brand that's missing from this list is stuck out to me. It's stuck out to some of the team here is Albert's. I know you cover that stock. Why don't you think that's a team favorite? You know, that's an interesting question, right? We do think that the core, all birds' customers historically been, that older customer, older meaning 20, 30-year-old, predominantly male, you know, it just hasn't really resonated the same way we think with the team consumer. And so I think that's one of the reasons why you don't see it there. That said, the team is very focused on those core athletic brands right, Nike at the top, right, Lou Lemmon, and very important to them. But I think part of it is that, you know, Albert's kind of by design are a little bit more, you know, kind of casual, less obvious, maybe then some of these bigger brands which make a logo of big component of what they do. And I also want to look at food because your study showed that a lot of people that you surveyed are moving away from some of these plant-based meats. And we know that before the pandemic, that was all the rays that was what people were moving into. You see, McDonald's Burger King's other brands really pushing this. Why do you think it's not resonating with some of the people that you surveyed? You know, it's interesting. My colleague that covers that would just say that ultimately, you know, the team cares about taste first and foremost, as I think most people do. And certainly, you know, the taste profile that the plant-based meat companies have provided are just not, you know, not as good as the real thing. And so I think that's, I think, one of the reasons why, you know, we're seeing this uptick in terms of the consumers that the plant eat, actually less plant-based meat. Eddie Ramo, very interesting stuff here within this teen survey. Thanks so much for coming on and bringing Tom for us. We appreciate it. Thanks. All right. Some sad news to pass along.

3079," Music Welcome back. The classic brand Topway is expanding its reach. Consumers are now able to find its products at Target locations nationwide. Miguel Fernandez, Topway CEO, joins us now along with Yahoo! Finances, Brooke, DiPaba. So welcome Miguel. We know this isn't Topway's first collaboration with Target. You had one in 2002. But what's different about this time and what are you hoping to achieve for this Omni Channel approach? Okay. So, you know, happy to be here with you. And as you said, we try Target, target approach about 20 years ago. You know, obviously a lot of things have changed in the last 20 years. And the most important one is, this time around, we're going to let each channel to operate independently. When we tried to do 20 years ago was to involve ourselves force within the target stores and having help with experience by an entire target. We know that that doesn't really work with consumers because if you're walking down the aisle, what do you want is your shopping experience being like a normal shopping retail experience and not have anyone or someone coming and trying to recruit you or selling more products and so on. So this time around, we are letting the channels operate by themselves. And obviously the whole Omni Channel strategy is the strategy of the company. About a couple of years ago, we identified that the biggest hurdle that we have to grow our business as big as our brand, which is huge and it's iconic, is that the consumers don't have access to our products. So we want to be where the shoppers go and prefer to shop. In this case, in the US, we know there's a lot of consumers that shop on retail and there's some other ones that are going e-commerce and there's still some in direct selling. Now we're trying to start expanding our channels of distribution and that's the whole strategy of the company. And speaking of that direct sales consumer, of course, a 76 year old brand known for those tab wearer parties, but you noted in your LinkedIn posts, acknowledging that younger customers are less familiar with direct sales. So my question for you is, can we expect those tab wearer parties to be around for another 76 years and how do those play into your long-term growth? Yeah, absolutely. So if you think about it, in Target, we're going with only 2025 skis and we carry on every single month over 200 skis. So our direct selling channel and our tab wearer parties are going to continue to be there. So are they going to change? Are they going to bolt? I think they will. So obviously we have technology and people can actually interact and have a lot of information and sharing, even prog demonstrations through a video as we're having this interview and you don't really have to have that physical presence. Along with a price, what we're seeing in many of our developments.",https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9GS0SPvxP2s,91,2022-10-11 20:29:21
3080," information and sharing, we've improved demonstrations through a video as we're having this interview, and you don't really have to have that physical presence. Same with our parties. What we're seeing in many of our developed countries are more and more parties, what we call E-parties, which is people that host consumers and they have these communities around the screen. So a combination of both. One of the things of our companies that we want to make a top of our everyone, so if you want to be the traditional top-of-the-art parties and you want to meet your customers and organize it physically, that's going to be an option for you. If you want to go on organize a virtual party, you can do it also. And if you're a shopper, you want to do it on e-commerce, you can also do it on retail, whatever suits you. And on that note of the history of the brand, Top-of-the-art brand was originally founded in order to help families save money on food waste, following the Great Depression. Now in 2022, costly food also in focus year groceries at 13.5 percent in the month of August. Do you think that that mission to help customers save money on food waste still sticks today? Very relevant. Last month I was reading this article that stated that 10% of the meals consuming the U.S. days last year were from leftovers. So that means that consumers, every 10 times they have a meal, pretty much every three days, they're eating from the leftovers that most likely there were obviously story in a top-of-the-art container. And we know that a lot has changed in terms of how people store food, but then we also saw this, the vintage collection come out in the product placement in the hit TV show The Marvelous Mrs. Maisel. Talk about how you're reaching consumers where they are now and how you really want them to view the brand, since there are some of these cheaper options out there as well. Yeah, I mean that's a great question. Obviously, our brand has always stand for quality. And the test to that is that those products we were selling probably 45 to two years ago, obviously there's an update in the residence, but not in the design of a product. And it's still very relevant when we put it out in the market, they just flew because everyone wanted the product. But to me the most important thing about the brand is that let's face it, it was literally dated and it was dated because we were reaching just certain amount of consumers. What we're trying to do right now is to gain brand relevance and to be where the new consumers are, where the new people are, and wherever they are. And that's something that we have to be intentional about because if you think about it, it's very simple to say that now Topper was going to be selling some of the products in Target. But if you think about it, we need to bring the skills, we need to build a company within the company to make sure that we serve the targets of this world better. Meaning in supply chain systems that way we put the product, you know the labels, the boxes, the packaging, everything is different from one challenge to another one. So for us, that transformation of the brand starts with even the back office functions, which is what we've been trying to build or we've been building the last two years and to get us ready for this moment. For us, it's very, very important that we come across as that brand, that is a premium brand, but it was a brand that offered products and innovation 76 years ago and the products lasted and and and through all these generations. And the proof of that is that every single person in America has a story about a talk we're containing and how mothers and daughters are fighting over them and you know the leftovers are important, but I really want my top or container back because this is my treasure and since we knew that there were so many people fighting over those vintage collections. So you know obviously taking advantage of the of the of the Netflix show and everything that happened, we we launch it and obviously we we we saw a lot of success with those products. And I can I speak to that I don't play what it comes to getting my top away and back either, but I do want to ask you about what we're seeing. Obviously the stock has been under pressure even as you look over the last two years with the pandemic down about 70% over those two years. Where do you see the next part of Top Wars growth story coming from? Where do you hope it goes from here? So absolutely so you know obviously the stock is the reflection of a continuous performance of the company. We had us as we mentioned in our",https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9GS0SPvxP2s,92,2022-10-11 20:33:37
3081," So, absolutely. So, you know, obviously the stock is a reflection of a continuous performance of the company. We had us, as we mentioned in our early schools, we had some external headwinds mostly gone from overseas, Europe and China, different factors, mostly around COVID and China locking down and things like that. But the growth opportunity we see it pretty much everywhere, where our consumers know or brand, they love our products, they've seen our products, they really want the products, but they have no access to it. So, we are, you know, obviously we're building, again, a company within a company, but more and more you're going to see our products in more of the traditional channels. And we're going to be, again, where the consumers shop. In some parts of the world like Latin America and some parts of Asia, direct selling is a very relevant channel. And we're going to be investing 99% of our resources into making our core business, which is direct selling even better and better in those countries. In some other countries like Western Europe or the US, we understand the consumers moved or some of the consumers moved from direct selling into e-commerce or retail. And that's where we, that's where we want to be. Once we start, you know, competing like any other consumer brand in the shelves or in the screen of the major retailers, then we're going to be considered like any other CPG company. And our performance is going to be judged by our performance of the numbers. And if we are able to achieve great products with where quality that consumers love and they're willing to pay the prices that we believe are products of worth. And it's just going to be a normal company. So the did that we're seeing, I think it's part of our turn, turn around, it's temporary because we're still making a lot of changes. We're not there yet. But we're in the process. This that we're targeting is a big step for us, obviously. Indeed, looking forward to seeing it in our local targets. A big thank you to Miguel Fernandez, top-where CEO and Yahoo! Finances, Rupto Palmer. Thank you both. Thank you so much. All right. You're very welcome. All right, coming up with inflation, weighing on Americans wallets, we're seeing the consumers starting to cut back. And you report details where people are streaming their spending and where they aren't. Stay tuned. You You You You",https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9GS0SPvxP2s,93,2022-10-11 20:37:31
3082," and the summer. Consumers are making some tough decisions on spending habits during record inflation. Now a new report from the National Research Group revealing some of the most surprising choices here over 40% of consumers saying that they have cut back on restaurant dining and also groceries over the past six months, but get this that 18% there only 18% are saying where where consumers or that they are cutting back on streaming when you take a look at some of the satisfaction numbers Dave within this survey 94% saying that they are very satisfied with the money that they're spending on TV and streaming 95% saying that they're satisfied with what they're spending on Amazon Prime only 72% saying that they're satisfied with what they're spending on dating apps with those that are cutting some of their subscription services the first to go are the dating apps now that makes sense to go and get this that's not a good idea to go and get this right. So the first thing that we've had is the shock that streaming wasn't higher on this list quite frankly with times of tough the last year or two. It's been one of the first conversations we've had at home about why do we have so many streaming service when we watch so little television. I expected most Americans were starting to evaluate their streaming platforms because the prices continue to go up. You have so many options and there's not a lot of content that is really that sticky. So that was a real surprise me and reshock what else shocked me is 17.8% of household budget is spent on subscription services. Now that doesn't just mean streaming. That does mean like Amazon and Walmart plus products and services. But that is an enormous number. We are now committing to some type of subscription service. Another surprise from this study. No, I would agree. I think maybe what part of the reason why people aren't really to give those up it's it's steady. You know exactly what the price is going to be every month. Whereas as you've seen with food inflation you don't know what you're going to be doing. Whereas as you've seen with food inflation you don't know what your groceries are going to cost when you go out through a restaurant. You don't know what the prices are going to be how much you're going to have to tip. So those prices are really going up. So it's a lot harder to judge how much it's going to be every time you come out. Whereas at least with streaming you have some consistency there. You can consistently budget for that every month. I'm not giving up my groceries and eating out. But it depends on what your priorities are and live. I would gladly cut out some streaming if it came to food. But that is just me short of what would you be worst of you let's give up on this list. Real quick and just wild ed. What we're seeing on the screen was a huge surprise to me. Brands consumers most associate with subscription services in terms of media. Amazon at number two ahead of Hulu, Disney, and YouTube where conversely when they asked consumers products and services subscriptions, guess what didn't make the top five? Amazon. Really? So in the eyes of the consumers, Amazon is primarily media, not products and services which is baffling to me. That's a very surprising answer. There's an Amazon box on my doorstep just about every week. Yeah, every day. Actually, it's a very different way. I do associate with Amazon with the products. I mostly use it. I'm on there every single day. I just place two orders actually this morning rather than their prime video service. So that is an interesting twist here to this. Very surprising findings in this study. All right, moving on now. Quite quitting seems to be all the rage with the kids these days. And so it seems employers are now going quiet on the hiring process. Yeah, who finds it's contributor, Mandy Woodrow, Santos is here with What to do? Should this happen to you? Hi there, Mandy. Hey, how's it going? Good. So what is this? Is it ghosting in the hiring process? Is that what we're calling it? Listen, I mean, I think you can call it a bunch of different things. But the reality is that you have companies who are maybe not quite ready to entirely give up on hiring right now. But what they're doing is pausing. I mean, Amazon just announced last week that they're doing a huge pause across the corporation and their retail sector of new positions. And they sent that memo to the recruiting staff. So you know, 10,000 people. Those are the number of job openings. Probably just had their job process, their interview process halted. So I'm here to offer some strategies on what you can do if that ends up being you through no faults of your own. So then, Mandy, what do you do? Is it worth you keep following up? Do you try and pivot? What are the strategies that you should really take on when someone is pretty much just ghosted you as an employer? Yeah, so I run a group coaching community and I see this.",https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9GS0SPvxP2s,94,2022-10-11 20:43:08
3083," up to you trying pivot one of the strategies that you should really take on when someone is pretty much isn't just ghosted you as an employer. Yeah, so I run a group coaching community and I see this. I get DMs from my own Mandy Muddy Makers who are like, hey, I have not heard back from the recruiter. It's been weeks. What do I do? So yes, you can reach out to them, but I would say first, don't take it personally. You kind of have to keep an eye on what's happening in the economy and in the sector in which you work. And what the headwinds are and why it may be happening unless they have told you that you have done something wrong or that you're lacking some, you know, specific work requirement that's led them to pause your hiring. Then it's probably not your fault. And then secondly, the actually this was like last on my list, but I think I should have made it one of the first ones. Please don't go to social media and bash them through the recruiting process. You'd be surprised. People think it's like a restaurant where they get bad service. They want to go on the internet and talk smack about companies and their recruiting process. So this is the worst thing you can possibly do. And you see that on TikTok and you have to wonder, other people are going to see this and people aren't going to want to hire you because they'll think you're bashed them next. I do want to ask the, how do you know when to let go? When do you say, okay, look, this isn't working. I've done all I can. When does it time to throw in the towel? Well, we're just talking about dating apps and sometimes the job interview process can feel like dating and it's like, wait, am I putting in more effort than when I'm getting in return? Here's the thing. I'm more to dating. I like to keep all my options open. I don't know why I said that. I'm a married lady with like a child now. But anyway, I do think it's important for job candidates to keep your options open. I am a huge proponent of always having multiple pans on the fire when it comes to interviewing and keeping just to keep your interview skills sharp, but so that you also have other options and you're not going to be so pressed if company A, you know, starts to lose interest or they pause your hiring process because hey, you got company B and C waiting for you who are still interested in you. And if that's the case, you can also use the fact that you're interviewing elsewhere as leverage when you do reach out to company A, let's say they are your top choice and say, hey, I know you guys said you're pausing your hiring process, but I want to let you know I've got two hot offers on the table. And if you don't make a move, I'm going to have to take them. And that can be a good way for you to get some closure or conversely get them to restart or reboot the hiring process because you have the additional leverage of having multiple offers on the table. So you've got to be playing the field, OK? Play the field back to the dating apps. I like it. Mandy Woodrow, Santos with some terrific advice for us. Thanks so much. All right. The government accountability office says time is running out for the estimated nine to ten million Americans who are eligible for COVID relief payments to get them. The GAO says certain groups are experiencing more difficulties getting the payments, including those who have never filed a tax return, nor are filing for the first time. Those who do not have bank accounts or lack access to banks, mixed immigrant status families, those limited or no internet access and those experiencing homelessness. The payments are based on tax returns for those who missed the April 15 tax filing deadline. You have until October 17th of file, those who don't have to file a return, but are eligible for the payments, haven't until November 15th to file a simplified return. All right. Coming up, a top executive at Amazon, shedding light on how Amazon's Thursday night football broadcast is fairing. Good job.",https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9GS0SPvxP2s,95,2022-10-11 20:46:53
3084," 3XELP Amazon has hit the ground running with their streaming Thursday night football package on prime numbers far exceeding expectations and topping NFL network from a year ago. Today, Amazon's Vice President of Global Sports Video, Marie Donahue, spoke at the Sports Business Journal, CAA Congress of Sports Conference, and said it even exceeded their own sky-high expectations. We're thrilled. Obviously, we're really happy with the product, with the tech, everything's working. Fans are happy. We're thrilled with our audience numbers. We're at O'Pernielson. We're averaging already 11 and a quarter million. We're up 11 percent since last year. And most importantly, most tellingly to us, we're up 67 percent in the 18 to 34 demographic. That's amazing. Which is phenomenal. And no, we're having a great time. I really think we've got, you know, we really respect the fan and respect the game. So we talk a lot about innovation and we try different things and we literally started from scratch and looked at it all new. But respecting the fan, we didn't want the fans to not recognize the game or be disrupted. We wanted the fan to feel more engagement and be delighted. And I think we've struck that balance. And I think some of it is obviously our alternate feeds, what we're doing with dad and things like that. But I think it's the talent we hired. We worked really hard, Al Michaels, Kirk Herb Street who are both legends in their own right, but bring something different and special in New Chemistry. And I think the studio show we've got, I think, is magic in a bottle right now. A strong start for Amazon. I will couch some of that data appears to be a bit inflated because in terms of a pure streaming number, they are including sports bars and restaurants as well as over the air television in the home markets that are airing on Thursday night football. I've got a real challenge this week with a stinker between Washington and Chicago, no real stars, two mediocre teams. But it has been a huge hit. And I will say that number, 67% up in the demo 18 to 34. That is music to the NFL's ears and to the NBA's ears and the rumor is the report from front office sports that the NBA Amazon will be a bitter for their next media rights package expected to fetch north of 50 billion a year. Yeah, Dave, talks that they're within or in those talks when that expires in the 2024 after the 2024 2025.",https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9GS0SPvxP2s,96,2022-10-11 20:51:08
3085," Fetch North of 50 billion a year. Yeah, David talks that they're within or in those talks when that expires in the 2024 after the 2024 2025 season. It's clear that this has been a huge win for Amazon. I think the question though, at least from an analyst perspective, just what is the return on investment here? Because they're paying about a billion dollars a year for these NFL rights. When you take a look at the fact that yes, it has clearly boosted prime signups. They came out with that number after the first Thursday night football game saying that it drew a record number of prime signups for a three hour period, that three hour period though, being very key. So in terms of what that actually means here, going forward will be very important for Amazon. And also just whether or not they're able to retain those new prime subscribers at these people are just signing up on a monthly basis. So if they do, in fact, continue to use prime after the NFL season. But I wish I think from anyone's standpoint here, this was a huge, I guess. Leap here, a huge chance that the NFL took with Amazon, a huge risk that Amazon did take. And it certainly has been paying off at least up until this point. And I will say it's interesting because Amazon sometimes acts like a startup. They'll go out and try. Let me try brick and mortar stores. If it doesn't work, they pull back. And as you mentioned, depending on how things are going with Thursday night football, clearly a success so far. What's going to happen when football season ends? Are you still going to be able to retain those prime members? Will you have to then do something else, perhaps more partnerships? Definitely a step in the right direction. We'll be interested to see how Amazon plans on capitalizing this when the lights go off for sure. All right, we'll have to leave that chat there for now. But coming up, we get a first hand look at a multi million dollar Italian electric hypercar. Stay tuned. Did you guys see 7 subs, or did you see anything interesting regarding this amazing 30inho happy to tell the exact correct translation of this project? Did you see that? Inflation sure has come for car prices. The average price of a new car reaching a record of more than 45,000 bucks according to JD power. Chump change compared to what senior auto's reporter, Prasad Bermanian has forced today. Pras, what do you got? Hey man, how you doing? So I'm here in Connecticut. And if you're on a mile, you've been in Farina. This is the owner from Italy and they have a hyperc.",https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9GS0SPvxP2s,97,2022-10-11 20:55:19
3086," Hey man how you doing? So I'm here in Connecticut. I'm out of a really pinniporeta is the out of Italy and they have a hyper car EV hyper car 2 million dollar car. I mean I'll see you Paris the Vanson. Paris, tell us about this car and why are you in the United States right now. We are here to show our first production ready car. Actually it's a customer car. It's a sold car that we are now letting journalists potential customers and partners test drive. So we have been in the US now for quite some time with this car. Started in August out in Bevel Beach and then we have kind of toured around the US. We're talking about a 2 million dollar car almost 2,000 horsepower. What are US kind of consumers telling you about that? What is a vital thing about this car? I have to say we are overwhelmed with the positive response we have had. It's really fantastic. I mean the car you can as I usually say you can enjoy it with all the senses. It's beautiful to look at. It's really an experience to drive. The kind of powertrain we have can do what no other cars really can do because when you have four motors one on each wheel completely independent of each other controlled by a torque vectoring system distributing the power every millisecond recalculating the distribution. So when you when you go through the windling roads of green which where we are right now or anywhere it's a sensation. So you're working with a bunch of partners here to make this car like Reenak you're owned by Mahindra which is a huge Indian mobility and auto mode of company. How does it help you kind of make this car? It's two sort of things like parts shortages and things like that. We have been affected like everybody else. First the pandemic and the shortages of components and now the war in Ukraine doesn't help. But we have found our ways through that and yes our parent company Mahindra has supported us in finding what we what we need. So we were delayed a bit but now we are there. You know I'm excited to hear what's next for you guys. I know you guys are going after maybe the luxury premium market a little bit down below in the EV scale. So anyway thanks so much for joining us and we got to go back to the studio. All right pros thank you. Before we let you go we have a very special surprise or we wanted to wish somebody a very happy birthday. It's our very own day brings birthday. We want to say exactly what the number is. We can say I'm 46 man. 46 that's young. Doing all right. Doing thing fun to celebrate. A lot older than you two sister. Not that much older. But very very special day although you didn't bring the markets much luck today or boy it didn't bring a whole lot of luck. Our way. All right well the team here at Yahoo Finance just wanted to wish you a very very happy birthday. We hope you do something fun to celebrate either tonight. This weekend you got a little snow. All right well that doesn't have to be a big birthday today on Yahoo Finance live. Thanks so much for tuning in once again we'll be right back here again tomorrow at 3 p.m. Eastern time. Have a great night. See you guys.",https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9GS0SPvxP2s,98,2022-10-11 20:59:27

3091," of Fed pivot. To a certain extent, I think that's fair. And the reason why the pivot is so important is because there's still room for the Fed to actually be more hawkish. I know you've got the Fed that's settling a roughly 4.6% term rate next year, but I think the real question is, when is the federal funds rate going across CPI? And I think it's going to cross sometime at the middle of next year. The challenge is I think it crosses out a higher Fed funds rate, not a lower inflation rate. And so I think the Fed and we'll get mid sometime this afternoon, I think it's certainly going to continue to show that while some committee members are concerned about a slow down in the economy, there's still laser focused on trying to bring that inflation and more importantly, maintaining that in their credibility as an inflation fighting entity. And so I think you do kind of have to see that Fed pivot because markets don't like higher rates. And the Fed may actually be in a position to do a little bit more over the course of the first half of next year. Well, that looks like not so much fun for the markets. Thanks a lot, Jordan. Good to see you. Jordan Jackson, JB Morgan, asset management's global markets, strategist, appreciate your time coming up. So I was going to share his talk. Take on a meta's VR glasses. Apparently you got legs now when you're wearing them, which is a big deal or something. Great. I don't know what those shoes for the metaverse. Today I guess. Yesterday afternoon, meta and bail a pair of $1,500 AR headsets that go on sale on October 25th. Sausage is of course fired up about these things, but not because he's a good guy. The best way to get a $1,500 AR headset. So go on sale on October 25th. Sausage is of course fired up about these things, but not because he's excited about the technology, his frustration with these is where he's looking at the video.",https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2iE41vefT4k,1,2022-10-12 13:53:47
3092," Saas is of course fired up about these things, but not because he's excited about the technology, his frustration with these is where we find his take today. I don't even know what we're looking at video. I imagine a lot of other consumers won't know either because they're not buying these things. My take is this. I'll do a review in real time. I hate them. And I think it's an awful time for metadata becoming out with a $1,500 product at the same time. They're laying people off of their stock prices down 62%. But let me set this up here and look at some of the specs on this because we don't really need anything else. We can just have a look at this. Yeah, well, I'm getting there. I just want to give you a little flavor, flavor of what's coming up. So here's the specs on this. Big winner for Qualcomm, friends of Yahoo Finance are always on talking about their various chips. Big win for them. That is good. You're seeing 12 gigabytes of RAM. You're seeing a good bit of storage and a 90 Hertz refresh rate. Don't know what that is, but it all sounds good worth noting as well. Without being plugged in this device gets 60 to 90 minutes on a full charge. To me, that's not exactly great. You plug it in. Obviously the charge lasts a lot longer. But the specs on this are pretty impressive. That is winning high remarks. But here's why, you know, if you were investor in meta, you should view something like this very, very skeptically. And there I am with those goggles on essentially covering my eyes. First up, you're releasing an AR AR glasses while workers at meta are reportedly being purged. That is the only thing we have heard out of meta, arguably the past month on how they're calling their workforce, focusing more on expenses. And here you have Zuckerberg on a presentation yesterday. Just championing $1,500 AR glasses. It just seems totally disconnected on relative to what's happening inside of meta regarding even a product that is not a big sales driver for this company. Number two, how will these glasses help get your stock price up? That is to be determined. I would argue it is products like this that are so focused on a metaverse that doesn't even exist and may not exist for 10 years. That is hurting meta stock price continues to hurt that stock price because it's dumping so much money into products like this. And then lastly, who is spending $1500 on these glasses in front of a recession? This is far less $5,000 more than the top end of an iPhone. I think it's a very limited market at least right now. You can't wear these outside per se. You're not walking around your office in them per se. So it's a very limited, high end focus. Usually I would say dedicated to tech eaks. Overall, now there are some sales behind this as well. You know, I pulled up the IDC worldwide shipments of augmented reality headsets or forecasts to decline to decline 8.7 percent year over year to about 260,000 units by the end of this year. So here's a $1500 product into a potential recession in a market that is not really growing clearly. That is coming from IDC. And also as well in the first half of this year, the top five AR headset makers weren't meta. You can see Microsoft on their own. They weren't really making it. They had these glasses. This is just the latest generation. So the market is not growing. And this is a product that consumers are not necessarily out there buying. My take is on this maybe not a shocker. Come on, Mark Zuckerberg. Apple is going to crush you anyway. At some point, Apple is going to come out with actual glasses, whether they look like Google Glass, whatever they are, that is going to pummel anything that meta is possibly come up here. Maybe be able to wear these glasses out in public. They're going to look like glasses. They're going to do like big cool things and you're not even need these things. I mean, total waste of time. Total waste. I think I'm in the same boat and not being sold. However, I would argue that if you saw more corporate purchases because the starting point- I know, like what is the point? That's why. If the starting point at least says an entryway for them is not just going to the individual consumer, but going to the corporate consumer and saying, if you want more collaboration, you have to do it through the tools that you're giving your team. The reason that you saw, so many IBM think pads be able to be sold, especially in the era when so many companies were navigating over to whether it be a Lenovo or an Apple MacBook Pro for their employee base. It's because they were able to just say, all right, let's just buy these in wholesale, let's buy these in bulk and then we know we can run all of our applications on that. Now, we all know what the way of the IBM think pad went. But if there's an entry point, it could be more on the corporate side than an individual side. But what in the world is the value proposition? And I know this is something Zuckerberg said, you can have meetings in the metaverse. Sure. Why? I'm so happy you agree with me on this one. This is a thank you for the side. Why would you have meetings in the metaverse when you can have a Zoom? Different do it in real person. Different do it in person. Right. Right. It just, that proposition doesn't make any sense to me. Now to be clear, Zuckerberg has said this is a longer term bet. It's something that is not going to create value in a certain way.",https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2iE41vefT4k,2,2022-10-12 13:57:54
3093," I just, that proposition doesn't make any sense to me. Now to be clear, Zuckerberg has said this is a longer term bet. It's something that is not going to create value necessarily for the company in the short term. And while that may be true, in the meantime, it's causing issues for the company. Not just the points you were making, there is also reportedly a dissatisfaction with the strategy that the company is taking. And as we know, even with the cutbacks that we've seen in Silicon Valley, there's still a war for talent that goes on. So if you're losing people because they don't think they're on the right track, that's a problem. Simple analysis here. We had that Piper Sandler survey yesterday. And it showed that Instagram is in third place behind Snap and TikTok. How do these $1,500 glasses help get Instagram back into first place? How does it make Facebook more relevant again? Where it's number one? I don't see it. And that is a big problem. That is the biggest thing that is hanging over Metastock price right now. Two high expenses in slowing growth in Facebook and Instagram. Well, do you think all the grandparents who are on Facebook are going to buy these? No, I don't think they're going to buy one. I know. Not unless they need them. It's sort of a rhetorical question. Quick talk too. If you want to follow more of my product reviews, just go to LinkedIn. I have more. I really post them all there. Really? No. Oh. Guys, all right, we can continue talking about this. But coming up, why are next guests says the US economy is not immune to global uncertainty? We'll discuss next. Welcome back. I'm Brian Sussi here.",https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2iE41vefT4k,3,2022-10-12 14:01:57
3094," Welcome back. I'm Brian Sousie here with Julie Hyman and Brad Smith. We're seeing green on the screen today across the major indices. That's even as President Biden warned about a potential mild recession. Here's what we're watching for you at this moment. A caffeinated quarter PepsiCo's checker page is read hot on Yowl Finance this morning as the company blew a profit estimates excuse me and raised guidance PepsiCo's COFU Johnson told us moments ago demand continues to be very strong and they are pushing through more price increases. More big calls earning the season officially kicked off today with PepsiCo's results. So I'll look at a few pre earnings calls by analysts on Apple and Norwegian Cruisix. In the state of freelance workers we'll talk to the COFiver on the outlook for the gig economy as economic growth slows. Brad over to you at the Wi-Fi interact. I couldn't get out. I was at the Yowl Finance interactive was the Wi-Fi whatever it is there you are Brad. There we are. Here we are. All right. Taking a look at the dash show and industrial average right now we are holding onto some slight gains on the day by about half a percent right now for the average up by about 143 points. You've also got the Nasdaq composite tech heavy average in the green. It's up 310s per percent 31 minutes into today's trading session and the S&P 500. You're also seeing some green on the screen there. That's up a little more than 310s of a percent taking a look at as well. Some of the activity that we're seeing more broadly here let me navigate us over to some of the Nasdaq 100 names that we've been continuing to track throughout the day. It looks like broadly you've got more advances than declines here. An interesting move here that we're seeing especially in some of the retail names you've got a sharp move higher and Lou lemon on the day we've been tracking that stock throughout the week given some of the new bullish sentiment that's entered into the market talking about Lou lemon as well as the annexation to the Gen Z brand affinity with it. So we'll continue to watch Lou as we move forward throughout the rest of today's session. That's up by about 2 percent. Another big gainer here as well that we've got on the day ticker symbol MRN able dive into that one and just a little bit so stick around for that. Let's shift our broader market conversation after some data from the producer price index and with inflation showing no relief. Our next guest says that a recession may be coming for more. Let's welcome in the chief economist at EY Parthenon Greg Dacco. Greg great to have you here with us this morning. But first and foremost if we were to see that recession that perhaps many of the economists if they are right that it might be slight versus the more longer or protracted one where do you fall within that camp. Well I think we're certainly seeing the initial signs of a significant slowdown in terms of global activity. We are seeing an environment in which European growth is slowing point dramatically in which growth across emerging markets is also slowing and in which the US economy is also starting to see initial signs of a slowdown. We're not hearing from the executives we speak to desire to retrench in terms of capex in terms of hiring plans here in the US but I am increasingly concerned that the global waves of uncertainty and the financial market stress that we're seeing globally will eventually affect the US and lead us into a more profound recession. More profound recession Greg what does that look like in terms of GDP? Well we are in an environment where our baseline forecast is for a mild contraction in GDP growth next year that would come on the back of growth around 1.5% this year. So that would be a mild recession. I think that if we look at household finances and corporate finances today they are still rather healthy so that would pretend to a more mild type of recession but if the global waves of uncertainty, if the massive slowdown that we're expecting in Europe in emerging markets is exacerbating this slowdown in the US then you could be in for a global recession in which we could see a more pronounced contraction in GDP maybe on the order of 1% in the US. Greg it's hard to know what to think right now right because we are hearing a lot of prominent voices in markets and economics who are getting more pessimistic right. This mild recession was sort of the base case for a while now and now I feel like it's tilting more negative than that and that there are risks coming on the periphery that then could cause more contagion. How are you weighing all of this right now?",https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2iE41vefT4k,4,2022-10-12 14:06:12
3095," more negative than that. And that there are risks coming on the periphery that then could cause more contagion. How are you weighing all of this right now? How do you figure out how concerned to be? Well, you're certainly right to highlight that we are navigating a world of uncertainty and it's extremely difficult for business leaders to navigate this world of uncertainty where inflation remains a key constraint, where the labor market is extremely tight, where the cost of capital is surging, and where there's massive uncertainty as to the geopolitical landscape. So it's a highly uncertain macroeconomic environment where it's very important to look not just as one at one base case, but really at scenarios around that base case. And I think you're right, risks are tilted to the downside. The baseline scenario is currently a mild recession. The upside is a soft landing of the global economy and of the U.S. economy by the Fed. The downside scenario could have some severe ramifications. If you have an excessive and disorderly tightening of financial conditions, that can have knock on effects onto certain streams of the financial sector as we're seeing in the UK with pension funds. So there are a lot of unknowns out there, and I think that makes it very difficult to forecast with accuracy. So there is some discomfort in the fact that the baseline view is a recession, but we have to acknowledge the downside risks to global economic activity. Greg, at what point do you believe some of the Fed's activity will finally start to fully show up in the data and yield some of the results or at least the parameters that they're looking for in order to either pause or pivot? Well, I think they're going to be very attentive to what happens on the global financial conditions front. What was at the NAVE annual conference over the first part of this week and Vice Chair Brainer highlighted, again, this concern about what's happening globally in terms of global financial conditions in terms of overall economic activity globally. And she highlighted the fact that we are in an environment where most central banks are tightening aggressively. And the fact that each of these central banks is tightening that aggressively has a greater effect than the sum of the individual tightening processes would normally have. And that is something that the Fed is going to be paying very close attention to as we move into 2023. Because again, the Fed leading the way has implications in terms of the dollar strengthening quite rapidly, exporting inflation into emerging markets, increasing the burden of debt for a lot of these emerging markets. And that's a concerning backdrop when it comes to the global economic environment. We know the US is not immune to these global waves of uncertainty. No, it is not. Greg Daco, EY, Parthenon, Chief Economist, always good to see you. We'll talk to you soon. All right, before we had to break, we are keeping a close eye on shares of McDonald's on some negative comments from city analyst John Tower. Head of the company's October 27th earnings report, power sites foreign exchange headwinds, energy cost inflation, and weakening store traffic data as key risk to McDonald's earnings days as Tower. Investors have been anchored to the defensiveness of the US business despite these risks. And we believe peak valuation leaves a little room for shares to absorb a negative estimate of visions much less of a potential slowdown in the US business. Coming up, Amazon workers in California are looking to unionize. Julie's got the details on that. Plus, more top headlines next. Come on.",https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2iE41vefT4k,5,2022-10-12 14:10:49
3096," differences Let's get down to business now. Look at some of the other headlines that we are watching. Amazon potentially facing yet another front in ongoing unionization battles as workers at a California warehouse of petition the National Labor Relations Board to form a union. That moved the first step towards a formal vote and could see the warehouses 800 workers join the Amazon Labor Union. Petition comes as part of a wave of unionization efforts hitting companies around the nation, including Starbucks, Tripoli, Apple. They're not used to unionization moves in their workforce. This would be the first Amazon move by workers in California specifically. Canadian companies, Camaco and Brookfield Renewable partners both moving this morning after agreeing to buy Westinghouse Electric, which still services half of the world's nuclear power reactors. Now the deal will see Brookfield Business Partners sell Westinghouse to the two companies, both the buyer, Brookfield Renewable and seller Brookfield Business are part of the umbrella under Brookfield Asset Management. The deal comes as the world takes a renewed look at nuclear power following Russia's energy shut off to Europe and climate change problems grow. The smash hit at NASA, the agency reporting it has successfully altered the path of the asteroid di-morphus. After ramming its dark probe into it, scientists have confirmed di-morphus. Now orbits its parent asteroid in a tighter orbit that's now 32 minutes faster than before. The dark probe launched last year, sent back this video just two weeks ago before impact and it marks the first time humanity has ever altered the course of any celestial body. It also gives us one potential option for averting a planet ending catastrophe. Good to have that option. Indeed it is, it's time for our calls of the day guys. I'm at a shoot here with what is a, I would call it a blunt take on Apple head of their earnings on October 27th. Really interesting note by city analyst Jim Suvor, you see Apple shares up there slightly here in the early going. The headline of this report absolutely got me right up my alley. I love these, some of these crazier headlines and this one got me. He said we are not scared of Apple stock despite Halloween and investor fear. So he noted Apple stock, very Google SEO friendly nonetheless. He's listening, we're saying that iPhone demand continues to be very strong. They're selling more higher price products that is good. Sticky services sales, that is good. Also suggesting more of an Apple car push in 2025. So this is more of a longer term bullish take by Suvor at city. I think acknowledges some concerns here going into the quarter, some FX challenges, maybe slow amrdt beta three more up position.",https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2iE41vefT4k,6,2022-10-12 14:15:01
3097," more of an Apple car push in 2025. So this is more of a longer term bullish take by Suva at City. I think acknowledges some concerns here going into the quarter, some FX challenges, maybe some slow down China, but by and large, just trying to I think bring a sense of, hey, the guys, this is Apple. They're going to get past any rough patch brought on by the global economy. Yeah, I think one thing that we do have to note within this as well is that for the iPhone, the demand is typically going to always be there. It's just a matter of where they are in the cycle, especially because so many people are able to pay off their phones through another type of necessity, which is your telecommunications, which is your phone carrier. And so that is perhaps one of the constants. It's just a matter of how much people are willing to take on a larger contract or go after a more expensive phone if their telephone provider or their service provider is able to offer them a better deal. Now it's a larger question, of course, too, right now of where in the even the little luxuries we were talking about with Pepsi, where that also kind of dovetails on over into the technology landscape as well in the consumer tech front, do consumers look at some of the little luxuries and the wearables and say, hey, that's a little luxury. Or is my service a little luxury that I can maintain? And for Apple, they've been continuing to build out that services business can be potentially an $80 billion run rate business either by the end of this year or early next year. And so that's something they continue to watch going forward in the services and the wearables division for Apple. Yeah, even if it might see some rockiness in the short term from some of those production cuts that we've talked about. Absolutely. Also another call of the one that I'm tracking here, Norwegian Cruise Line, ticker symbol NCLH, it's smoother sailing for new region after an upgrade to buy at UBS. The analyst also setting a $15 price target on the stock here and particularly they are kind of adjusting all cruise line models. It's not just Norwegian, it's Royal Caribbean, Caribbean, Caribbean, anyway. One of the cruise line, that's pronounced the same way. They're adjusting it for all cruise line models for slightly higher expenses due to inflation. And essentially here, when you think about the broader cruise sector, of course, there's a lot of money that we've talked about goes out the door when it's a marketing type of expense that they have to look at just to re-engage with so many of the consumers out there or the voyage takers. But then it's also on the other side, how much they're actually being able to charge for tickets in this near-term period of time. And that's something that all of the analysts have continued to have to look through the profit margin models at and try to figure out exactly where that's actually going to be netting out for the cruise line operator. Yeah, interesting time to see this call because we see fuel prices back on the rise. You have been highlighting it too. We've been talking a lot about weak pricing, we ticket pricing, notably coming out of Cardinal Cruise Line. But look, we just talked to Norwegians CFO Mark Kempe last week and he said, man, is strong? We're charging higher prices. If you look at Q3 and our most recent guidance, we had said that our total net revenue per deems are expected to be up in the high single digits. So again, there's inflation is real. It is starting to level off. We are going to see some near-term pressure on margins, but we don't believe that this is going to be a long-term sustainable margin issue. As we look at our trends and our business over the next year to two years, we see margin improvements significantly. And we believe we can get back to the same margin levels we saw prior to the pandemic. There you go. Really, a bullish take-out by Kempe who came aboard on a new ship. So despite the economic slowdown, you still have Norwegian and of course all the cruise lines, they order these ships well in advance, but still delivering a mighty new, beautiful ship called, I think it was the Prima. Right. And I'll just add just very briefly here as well within this call. They said they see this as the most preferred name and it's due to relatively greater concentration of domestic passengers, strong pricing given its higher exposure to the luxury segment. And the luxury consumer, whether it's across retail, consumer tech, and then even within the cruise line operators right now, continually being cited as one of the points of strength. All right, let's talk coffee. Okay. Dutch Bros. Bit of a perk up. I'm watching shares of Dutch Brothers this morning. Dutch Bro, I think it's technically Dutch Bros. It's a Brook to Palmitrae right there. Dutch Bros. I think Dutch Bros. It's a Brook to Palmitrae right there. Dutch Bros. It's a Morgan Chase upgrade to the SAC to overweight with a $38 price target.

3098," Up earlier, as much as 5%, so it's actually, you know, we've seen that those gains come back a little bit, but the analyst there, JP Morgan, saying the sell-up has made it attractive, sites that change permanence over time through differentiated drinks. Some interesting stuff here. 56% of customers under 25 drink, 80% cold beverages, and 60% of sales afternoon. And that's sort of more discretionary, so maybe that's a little bit more vulnerable. Oh, I guess not. Yeah, everybody's complaining about Insomnia. Yeah, think if you're drinking a giant cold brew afternoon, it could be also you're looking at your phone for the two hours before bed. That doesn't help either. But I digress. The point is here is that the analyst at JP Morgan likes Dutch bros and says that employment and stable gas braces are key to more predictable sales here, but that the company is in decent position here, and it has the capital it needs to grow the business. I think I'm going to take off a couple days from the office. I'm just going to visit a Dutch bros. Maybe it'll be my vacation. I see all the photos posted on Instagram on Twitter. People are obsessed with Dutch bros coffee. It looks beautiful, and I think it has more caffeine in some cases depending on what you order than Starbucks. That's where I'm going vacation. I'm going to go visit a Dutch bros. Oh, wait. OK, everybody, can we clip this please? Right, and since you just promised, he is going to take out vacations. I suggest that. You can miss that. That's a promise. I suggest that. I'm going to go visit Dutch bros, and I'm going to report from outside of Dutch bros with my phone. You're not allowed to log on. It's live here. I'm not allowed to log on. You're on vacation. That's what I'm declaring here. Unilaterally. Total processing. All right, coming up, a possible shake of forgate workers. We're going to speak with the CEO of Fiverr about that, and also a new study that the company is out with next.",https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2iE41vefT4k,8,2022-10-12 14:23:59
3099," Go All On Sing With Me!! The majority of bosses won employees back in the office full time. The new survey from Fiverr found that 52% of employers want their workers back in person five days a week. But 42% workers say they would consider quitting if that were the case. Fiverr CEO, Micah Kaufman, joined us now. Fiverr by the way, a platform for freelance workers. It's good to see you. So there's obviously tension here, right? There is this ongoing tension in the market. How do you think it ends up resolving itself? Thanks for having me on the show again. We're definitely seeing a very polarized view between managers and employees. And I think that if there's something very clear is that managers want this to be 2019 again. And employees cannot move back from having the experience of the past two or three years. And wanting to have more flexibility into into the work. I think that some of that is going to be resolved. But the fact that those employees are actually going to leave. And I think in order to receive that level of flexibility a lot of them are actually going to turn into freelancing, which allows them to. Define the level of flexibility that they are looking for. Okay, so that kind of answers or begin stands are my next question at least, which is where where would they go if they if they did leave there still for a lot of the companies that are either in a hybrid or purely virtual reality. For their workplace and collaboration, there's still some of the hiring freezes that are in place. Some places looking at cutting and trimming their staff. So where would the opportunities be to still retain that virtual lifestyle, even if going to or looking for other employment opportunities. That's correct. I think that a lot of companies, those who are freezing or rethinking the way they want to employ talent. And they're really making a shift between fixed expenses and variable expenses. And when you think about variable expenses, a lot of it is being answered by free answers. So a lot of the talent that are going to continue looking for that level of flexibility are going to turn into freelancing and we're seeing. Very high levels of talent coming to us to five or in similar platforms to look for that level of flexibility. I mean, a recession would mean a just a hiring boom for freelancers. I think that at some point, yes, because again, I think that more and more companies are thinking about the shift between between fixed and variable expenses. So obviously that is going to fuel if you if you go back to the wake of the previous recession right around 2009. And we've we've saw a boom in in freelancing. We saw a boom in new business formation. And a lot of these businesses cannot actually afford full time employees. So they turn into platforms such as fiber to find this talent. Mike, at the same time, we've got now this proposal, although it's sort of vague on the part of the Biden administration to reclassify workers, which there's some thinking that it might eventually make some workers who are classified as freelance before. To come on the books full time. Any thoughts on that or the likelihood of that happening in the effect that that could have on your business. Yeah, I think that we with the fact that freelancing is becoming a huge force. In in the workplace, statistics show that by the end of this day. It by 2030. 50% of talent is going to be engaging and friend-assing in some form or the other. Policie makers are trying to figure out what to do with this huge cohort.",https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2iE41vefT4k,9,2022-10-12 14:28:17
3100," 50% of talent is going to be engaging in freelancing in some form or the other. Policy makers are trying to figure out what to do with this huge cohort. And I think that in this space we need to make a distinction between skilled and unskilled labor. So if you look at Fiverr as an example, on Fiverr, freelancers have total freedom regarding their work. What they offer, when they offer it, and from where. So that level of freedom is something that is highly sought for, but it also comes with a price. I mean, you can't lead a totally free lifestyle and then expect to be considered to be a full-time employee. In other aspect of gig economy, maybe the situation is slightly different because they have less freedom on what they offer and how much they charge for it. This has been in the making for quite a long time. And we're actually working close with policymakers to figure out how. You know, the level of how we can level the plane field for freelancers in aspects such as access to affordable medical insurance. But that said, as I said, if you want to lead the lifestyle that allows you total freedom, you can't also expect to be considered as a full-time employee when you're not. Michael, just while we have you, over the past recessions where the gig economy roles have been available, we've seen this flow into some of the roles for freelancers or even just workers who are looking to kind of take their own employment under their own control. For your business at Fiverr, given some of the investments that you've made into the business to try and unlock these larger projects, more engagement, what from the Fiverr perspective would you be kind of looking towards to really navigate a recession as well? Well, yourself as a business. Yeah. So I think that a lot of businesses we've talked about fixed versus variable expenses. I think that a lot of businesses are actually focusing on identifying their core competencies and hiring full-time around those core competencies and looking for the more peripheral areas of expertise in turning into freelancers around those those types of expertise. If your core is technology, maybe something that is not in your core is going to be marketing or design in which cases they start to think about how to integrate freelancers into their workflows. And this is why we've seen the appearance of the chief freelancer officer, which is which is a new role within companies within HR that thinks about how to integrate that level of talent into organizations. We're seeing that rising throughout the past few years and this is accelerating right now. Micah, good to see you. Thanks for being here. Micah Kaufman, who is Fiverr CEO. Appreciate it. Thank you.

3101," Please share, comment and subscribe to my channel. Thank you. share of Uber and Lyft and DoorDash are back on the rise today after getting slammed on Tuesday after the Biden administration proposed to change the classification of gig workers that could revise them from independent contractors to employees. Fox Advisors founder and CEO Stephen Fox joins us now for some analysis on this. Stephen, has this now been priced in any potential change that may come in the first half of next year? It isn't now fully priced into these stocks. You know, actually I think it's more than priced into the stocks. I think regulatory concerns have been sort of the hand-ranging event since these companies went public. And what we've seen is that the companies have been able to manage through these events and actually continue to improve their business model. So I think it's being overdone at this point. Lyft has said nothing is immediately going to change about its business model just yet. Of course, that's what the company would say. Given the fact that yeah, there's still a lot of discussion that has to take place in the near term in order to see any type of reclassification go forward. But what extent should customers at the end of the day, if this does move forward, expect their prices, their fares to also have to be adjusted? Yeah, that's a great point because all the companies obviously could still raise prices to offset any higher costs. I think it's also important to keep in mind that what happens at the federal level is independent of what happens at the state level. So companies have been in discussions with various states. I think the most encouraging thing you saw without out of the state of Washington this year, which signed into law in an independent contractor plus agreement, which basically allows for some benefits. Sort of this IC plus gives the drivers flexibility plus benefits. And the companies are working to pass those costs through the customers and also reducing other costs tied to other pieces of the business to offset. Some higher costs as well. Steven, as we potentially go into a recession, what effect will that have on the sort of driver service dynamic? In other words, could there potentially be more people who are available to be drivers? Unfortunately, if there are layoffs or just do a burn lift getaway with paying them less? Like, what are going to be all those knock on effects? Yeah, I don't think Uber and lift getaway with paying them less, especially in this political environment. And I don't think they're looking to pay them less. I think if you go back and look what the companies have done, forget about what they've said, but what they've done for their drivers specifically over the last couple of years, they've worked to make their expenses come down through various methods. They've also worked to make their time on the network much more efficient. Obviously, if they're sitting around waiting for a ride, it's not as efficient. So it's really important to step back and say, okay, in a weaker economy, how dependent it has the consumer become on these rideshare opportunities, whether to drive or also to ride, and how do the network utilization rates look? On top of that, the real on-tap market is still the enterprise. So large.",https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2iE41vefT4k,11,2022-10-12 14:36:40
3102," whether to drive or also to ride and how do the network utilization rates look. On top of that, the real on-cat market is still the enterprise. So large companies with multiple pockets of spending on transportation and food delivery. As they consolidate those things, those are real profitable opportunities for lift and uber that they can also translate into their drivers to make money. Right, a lot of focus on driver utilization to make it more incentivized in order for drivers to actually want to be on the platform and be able to take advantage of more rides. But then there's also the thought of if this goes through and that changes the classification, does that actually make it more intriguing for new drivers to sign up and increase the supply side of this broader kind of supply demand equation that ultimately has a major delta on prices here for consumers? Yeah, so one of the interesting things that I think Wall Street doesn't appreciate enough is that when you talk about these networks, the companies aren't playing checkers. It's more like three-dimensional chess. So when you look at supply versus demand, like take the UK, for instance, where uber is now providing benefits to the drivers while giving them flexibility, they're cost have gone up, but then other costs have gone down in terms of actual providing, you know, looking at driver incentives, for example, they don't have to provide as many. And so they're attracting probably more drivers now, passing on some of the cost of their customers, but competition has followed. So you're getting a little bit of that network benefit, I think. How it plays out in the US is going to be on a region by region basis. But generally speaking, I think the companies have going to manage through this and continue to march towards ebic goggles where they've been set, like at Lyft and Uber. Fox Advisors founder and CEO Steven Fox. Thanks so much for the time today, Steve. Thank you. A major head count reduction is reportedly on the horizon for Intel. Thousands of employees are expected to be laid off, according to Bloomberg. It's the chip maker looks to take cost-cutting measures.

3103," Music Welcome back everyone. A major head count reduction reported on the horizon for Intel. Thousands of employees expected to be laid off according to Bloomberg as the chipmaker looks to take cost-cutting measures. Yahoo! Finances, Dan Howley joins us now to share the details with us. Dan, what do we know so far? It looks like we're going to see potentially thousands of layoffs at Intel. The company is basically struggling with slowing demand in the PC market, not just slowing sales across the board when it comes to things like servers, just as we started to see interest rates rise. And that's impacting its bottom line. And so there could be as many as thousands of these kinds of layoffs. The company also is dealing with those kinds of repeated slowdown that we've seen in the PC market. Gartner had said that the market actually collapsed 19.5% in Q3 2022. So it really doesn't look great for Intel at this point. Other chip companies are dealing with the same issues. But Intel is at this point kind of trying to turn itself around. They said that they're going to build that huge mega complex in Ohio. It's not going to look good for employees that they're getting laid off. It does look like the departments are going to be something along the lines of marketing and sales. And the company does have more than 100,000 employees. So it's not as though it's clearing house by any stretch of the imagination, but it could be as many as 10% 20% of employees. Yeah, and obviously this is part of the moves that we've been seeing by many of the chip makers. Thanks, Dan. Appreciate it. Earlier this week, the Board of Directors officially approved XPO logistics plan separation of its freight brokerage business. The company also named a new CFO. I had the chance to speak to the company's current CEO and founder, Brad Jacobs, about the restructuring at the company. I'm here at the Greenwich Economic Forum with Brad Jacobs, the founder and CEO of XPO logistics, although not for much longer. Brad is great to see you in person. And I say not for much longer, of course, because the company is spinning off RXO, which is logistics business. You just announced what that's effective on November 1st, I believe. So talk to me about what's happening now, what the process feels like, and what investors can expect from the two companies. It's very exciting. After 10 months of working really hard with large number of people working long hours, we're this close to the spin. And we'll create two separate companies that will be an inch wide and a mile deep in what they do. And therefore, they're likely to do it much better. So we'll have a pure play less than truck load business. That'll be XPO. And we'll have a pure play non-asset truck brokerage business called RXO, which is best in class truck broker. So it's very exciting. And you're not going to be running the day-to-day business any longer. Do you have some plans yet for what the next thing, the next Brad Jacobs chapter is going to be yet? Well, I want to try to repeat what I've done before, which is to have companies that over a 10-year period or so create at least 10 times return on the initial capital. And so I'm not a private equity firm in trying to make two or three X. And that's not my game. I go for things that are 20X, 30X, the big ones. So I'm looking for that. I'm looking for the next big thing. And where any hints of what in what industry or where you think the opportunities are, especially right now, it's tricky time, right? It's the best time. Just start a business when valuations are low and it's fear out there and there's not a lot of competition because a lot of people are nervous about not being courageous because they're nervous about where the economy is going and so forth. That's when you want to get it. That's when you want to buy. When valuations are reasonable and there's not a lot of competition. But I don't know. I'm still gainfully employed at CEO for a few more weeks. Sorry to get you to, don't mean to get you to jump ahead too soon. But let's talk a little bit more about the environment. You and I were just talking.",https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2iE41vefT4k,13,2022-10-12 14:45:16
3104," I don't know. I'm still gainfully employed at CEO for a few more weeks. Sorry to get you to, don't mean to get you to jump ahead too soon. But let's talk a little bit more about the environment. You and I were just talking before now about all of the negativity that we're hearing, right? From Redalio to Jamie Dimon, the IMF cutting, it's GDP forecast. Altruid Jones and all of it. Yeah, all of it. I mean, you have a really good figure on the pulse of what's going on in the economy because of moving things around. So what do you see? So I don't always get it right. I often get it right, but not half a percent of the time. My take is we're probably, so when you see all these really great minds that will come out and universally say, oh, it's really bad coming up. That's usually historically been the final pre-capitulation phase. So everyone agrees that, oh, it's really bad. And then you have the final plunge. That's the time to buy when everybody said, oh, it's down this, it's going to keep going down more. That's the time to do it. So I'm really having my antennas up for it because I don't think I don't think this downturn, which is likely to happen, is going to last for a long time. And don't forget, there's two things. There's the economy and there's the market. Yes. And the market is usually a couple quarters ahead of the economy. Right. So we could see, so the capitulation you're talking about is the market. In the market. Yes, the economy might lag that. Yeah, economy could lag. As the trade's go up, as quantitative tightening gets tighter, you could see a significant slowing in the economy. But the world has become such a small world and so well informed and so many people understand economics now. It didn't turn the great financial crisis. I don't think it will last long. I think there'll be such pressure to, okay, now we reduced inflation. Okay, now let's get some growth going again. I don't expect a long, long downturn. I expect a short, maybe significant downturn. Now, one of the things that was a detail in the latest jobs report made me think of you. And that had to do with trucker jobs, which fell by 11,000 in the month of September. And I'm just curious what that tells us. The number of truckers hired, I should say, fell by 11,000. A metric that we watch very closely, Julie, is for every truck driver posting that we post, how many people apply for it. That's about 45% just in the last several months. So there's a lot more people coming back into the job market as the economy gets a little tougher. So there's the pendulum is swinging on that. It's don't get me wrong. It's still very tough to hire truck drivers. It's a lot less tough than it was even a few months ago. The inventory climbs that we are seeing by a lot of not just the retailers, but in other industries as well. How is that affecting your business and the loads of things that you guys are trucking around? Well, the transportation business does better. The industry is a whole when inventory is a low, not high. There's more restocking and there's more goods being moved. But what you see right now is really interesting. As a result of all the craziness of the pandemic, people got the wrong, they have a lot of inventory, but it's often the wrong inventory. They have too much of this and too little of that. So there's still a lot of activity. So goods are still flowing. Goods are still flowing, but not as much as more. Not as much. But it's an interesting dichotomy. You observe the same thing. I observe today at the Greenwich Economic Forum. It's pretty down beat. I'm sure you die. People have their warrior face design. When you talk to my echo chambers a little bit different, my echo chamber is CEOs of large companies. They're not as large companies, entrepreneurs or small businesses who need their goods move. And they're not as negative. They're not as positive as they were say a year ago. They're less positive, but they're generally growing. They're not contracting. They're just growing less. All right. I have one final fun question for you. The Tesla semi. How much is that going to change the trucking industry? It depends on the price point. So we're a partner to one of the big OEMs for their electric vehicle semis. And actually we call them semis. The semis. The CUS be semi conductor semis. The CUS be semi conductor semis. And we call them semis. Sorry. No, we're talking about that. But the semis are, they're beautiful and the truck drivers love them and they're slick and they're well designed and they accelerate fast and they're safe and they've all kinds of gizziness in them. But they're really expensive. And so the economics aren't there yet. If the economic, if the technology advanced.",https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2iE41vefT4k,14,2022-10-12 14:49:45
3105," They accelerate fast and are safe. They've all kinds of gizmos in them. But they're really expensive. And so the economics aren't there yet. Now, if the technology advances and the manufacturing processes advances such that they become cost effective, yet can be very transformative. Makes sense. All right, Brad Jacobs of XBO, thank you so much. It was great to see you in person. Really appreciate it. Pleasure to mind. Thanks. So it was fun there because Brad was sort of an antidote to a lot of the darkness. I mean, he's not saying everything is wonky-dorian, fantastic. But part of it is the force of his personality. Part of it is what he's seeing on the ground. He was a little bit of a counterbalance to some of the worst-case scenarios that we're hearing out there. You say tomato. I say tomato. Yeah, exactly. That means it's every time I say tomato. It was interesting to what he said, though, about the Tesla semi-truck. It's going to be fascinating when those trucks eventually hit the road. Because at some point, it sets a stage for driverless semi-trucks in this country. Yes, but as he said, the price has to come down. Absolutely. It's going to make sense, which makes sense. Right. Also a critical time for the business, given the spin-off that's moving forward and Drew Wilkerson is going to be the new CEO of that spin-off. And he had, even in this most recent earnings period, talked about how the company has a long track record of growing gross profit even through economic cycles. And they're confident right now. They're going to continue to do it. I, for one, can't wait to see what Brad is going to do next. The next thing he's going to tackle. It's tough to see him leave this industry. He is this industry.

Elon Musk really capitalizing on his last name with a fragrance launch via his infrastructure business, the boring company. Yes, the same company that sold the flame thrower is now bringing you burnt hair for just $100 here. Okay, so $100 new perfume from Elon Musk. I don't know if I'm a buyer on this. We've already talked about how well. I'm a big buyer. I'm all, I want to be a buyer. I want to smell like sweat, success, and money. And maybe that's in this bottle. I'm down. Sign me up for a hundred dollars. Boom, done. In. I want it. I actually do. I want to try it. I love clones. This goes back to when I was a child. This isn't joke thing. Do you think it's actually going to smell good? I think it's going to smell good. I'm bullish on it. Everything that the boring company has sold has basically been subtype of joke, whether it's short shorts or whether it's flame throwers. But it's more here. The flame thrower at least worked. I would have to imagine the smells somewhat kind of. I think it smells because it doesn't actually smell like burnt hair. I would say Tom Ford smells a little burnt. The pen is one you get and he spent like $300 on it. I mean, your figure is going to know some of the best scientists in the world.

I guess he doesn't need any more of anyone's money really. Okay. I don't know. All right, from Cologne to Food, another Julie Fave. Kalegs, Waffle, Kellogg's Waffle Maker, Ego is bringing the magic of breakfast to your home bar this winter with its Ego Dog Lodge. Kellogg, yes. And that's a publicly traded company with a ticker page on Y'all. And the money that says the Rumbass liquor is perfect for parents looking to Lego during the holidays. I love me, some Christmas and holiday season eggnog. I'm just confused why this took 20 plus years to get to the market. This is great. I love it. 40 proof. 40 proof. I mean, look, we need more. We need more toasty 40 proof eggnog out there. We're going to get ham. We're going to get ham right here. Do you know? No. No. No. No. I'm not getting any money from Kellogg. I don't need to know. I'm just pro eggnog. We already know what you make. I like it. Eggnog is good. I found you a eggnog on the market already. I'm not sure what makes this eggnog any different from the better than any other eggnog. I mean, this is like a ready to drink cocktail drink. Right. That exists. Does not exist already. Except this eggnog in eggnog. Like, it's really hard to buy a thing of eggnog and pour some rum in it. We just taste like waffle. It's already done for you. It's like what Cardi B did with the whip shots for us. Like, we already knew we were whipped cream. We already knew we liked shots. And then we had whip shots. Now we've got eggnog. I think it's a long take. What's the next one? Let's talk about something else to drink Starbucks. It's taking us for a awards program to new heights through a partnership with Delta Airlines. The coffee roaster is going to give app users 150 stars and 500 miles for linking accounts. Double stars and days flying with Delta and one mile per dollar spend. Good, more miles that you can't do anything with fabulous. Sorry. Are you expecting a tone for me to make eggnog? I'm feeling a little skeptical. I'm really thinking. I'm just going to use these for awards to get that eggo eggnog. So I'm excited about it. No, it doesn't go that way. It goes the other way. So I can't use eggnog. Am I misunderstanding this? I'm not understanding this. It's the Starbucks points towards Delta. Okay, here's the details. 150 stars, 500 miles when you link those accounts. Okay. So you get the double stars on Delta travel days. So like if you buy a Starbucks when you're flying on Delta at the airport, you get more stars. And you get one mile per one dollar spend at Starbucks. I have to add a special code and concur. Like, can I use this and concur? I feel like what I need right now is that GIF with like the guy with the calculations on the board behind him to figure out exactly how to do that. It's still better than Duncan. It's still better than what Duncan did this week. I'm still waiting to get my free coffee. I think I have 600 more points to go. It's terrible. I mean, but Starbucks has had one of the better rewards out there. And for the companies that have done more digital disruption for that customer touchpoint, I mean, Starbucks. All these companies should just copy Starbucks. Why try to reinvent any of the Starbucks? People love their rewards program. It's a huge driver of their business. Let's take a look at markets. Shall we? We have a mixed picture right now from the major averages, not much movement. It feels like this is a waiting game, both perhaps for at 4 and see minutes this afternoon.",https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2iE41vefT4k,16,2022-10-12 14:58:53
3107," Let's take a look at markets. Shall we? We have a mixed picture right now from the major averages, not much movement. It feels like this is a waiting game, both perhaps for FOMC Minutes this afternoon at 2 p.m. and also probably more importantly for the CPI report that's coming out tomorrow morning. So perhaps a bit of a waiting game that the market is playing ahead of that. Coming up, a cake of a jeet is going to speak to the CEO of SunCower on the company's latest partnership with GM also be interested to hear what the inflation reduction act. We need to hold that company. Don't want to miss that. We'll be back tomorrow. Welcome to Yahoo Finance Live. It is 11 a.m. here in New York City. I'm Akiko Fujita.

3108," Another hurdle for Amazon workers at a Southern California warehouse file a petition to form a union of vote alone Would be a landmark move in the country's largest state and Charging your home with your EV some power announces a big partnership with general voters on a new home energy system CEO Peter Ferris is gonna be joining us later this hour First though 90 minutes into the trading day We are checking in on the market action right now as you see the trade things trading pretty flat right now But the Nasdaq down about just slightly there one tenth of a percent a number of things that we've been watching this morning We pointed to ppi coming out Jumping a little stronger than expected up point 4% month on month We're also looking ahead to those f1c minutes coming out later this afternoon But of course all eyes will be on that CPI print coming down tomorrow ahead of that Let's do a quick check of where bond yields are right now We are seeing the 10 year yield still below that 4% level, but we are seeing it inching ever closer at 3 9 5 the 5 year well above that 4% level and the 30 year yield at 3.9% now all of this comes as we kick off earning season We're starting to get some of those results in with the big bang flayed it to report this Friday for more on what to expect We have here with us in studio Victoria Green G-Squirt Private wealth CIO. It's good to have you in person I absolutely I know I feel like we know each other. Yeah, yeah, yeah, first time we went Pretty fitting right we're talking about earning season the bar is pretty low going into this, but you see Set yourself up for even more disappointment. I do I really see them the market is hitting about 3432 I mean Pepsi don't surprise on the upside So if it maybe that's that's a little bit of an indicator that expectations have come low enough that that we but we have the dollar I mean the dollar was such a headwind in in Q3 and I think you've got a lot of tech companies that are gonna struggle So who's gonna do well probably the energy companies? We will probably see industrials do okay. We've seen some you know energy companies are gonna continue to print money here at $80 or $90 barrel oil So I think the sectors are gonna matter individual company performance is gonna matter and what their CEOs did But I think it's like you got to check a box on what EPS is But I think more so everybody wants to know guidance What does this look like going forward how much pressure is it gonna happen with the dollar? Who's doing job cuts? I mean it's expected intel is gonna announce job cuts to follow Microsoft follow snap You know, so we're seeing a lot of job cuts cutting in the technology sector Definitely nervous going to full earning season financials really kick it off and we'll see did they pick up net interest in Commer they having to put too many reserves not seeing any mortgages You know we've definitely seen the mortgages almost grind to a halt and then investment banking has been just difficult this year So banks may startle yeah, so the four looking statements are what we're looking for going into these results But also you know, it seems to be still a bit of a debate if you could argue that that you know Where exactly we are in terms of the macro picture you have those comments coming in from president Biden saying that he doesn't Expect a recession. Obviously he's the president. He's not gonna say things are gonna get worse But we also got those comments from Jamie Dimon, which seems to suggest there are more rough patches ahead How do you view that so I think the fact the president said the R word, you know if you're a a Fan of the the show West Wing with a bagel word, you know that nobody wants to say the R word is bagel time But the fact the president is acknowledging it might be a slight recession That has to mean they're even acknowledging the slowdown is coming the feds acknowledges the slowdown is coming They're trying to slow it down to slow down inflation. I'm with Jamie Dimon I actually think we're in a recession I know we can argue the definition of recession and that's technically never's job But if you look at the slowdown where we're going with growth What's happening with inflation? What's happening with the hawkish fed? Definitely on Jamie Dimon's that there's a little more pain coming not sure I'm full. I am out for right They came out with like hey expect another 20% down like this. There's more pain coming Everybody's gonna feel recession in 23 feel like that might be a tad draconian at this point But I do think we're still gonna see the effects remember the lag between rate hikes and when we feel in the labor market It's about 12 months So the question is you know, where do you position yourself if that slowdown is already underway You've been bullish on energy for quite some time and you know There's there's questions right now especially with the moves on that we saw from OPEC last week about Whether things are really going to start to take up and we have seen them take up a little Where are you positioned in some of those big names sure we we did actually pull a little bit back to energy",https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2iE41vefT4k,18,2022-10-12 15:06:59
3109," to speak about whether things are really going to start to take up. And we have seen them take up a little. Where are you positioned in some of those big names? Sure. We did actually pull a little bit back to energy, but we're still overweight. We were very, very overweight. We pulled that back a little bit in June, but we still like a lot of it. So we like the U.S. EMPs, right? The, to get it out of the ground in the Permian area is about $30, $40 a barrel. And you haven't seen the, the rig count really jump up. We're at 765 total rigs. We're still below pre-piannebic levels. And the U.S. has now become a net exporter of petroleum products, because we are picking up market share from what Russia is stepping back in. And there are some big sanctions coming in December from the EU, and it's going to hit the shipping and the tankers, because they're not going to insure them. And if nobody's insuring an oil cargo, which like I believe something like 95% of insurance is issued by the UK in the Euro area. So I see opportunity in U.S. energy producers. We liked our Devon, you know, Diamondback announced the acquisition today. We really like the Shaneer. It's a natural gas exporter. We think the gas story, because we feel like the story of energy security for the next decade. Yes, EVs are coming, yes, solar's coming. Have we hit peak oil demand? We'll see. But we also see also the slit that we need people buying energy from allies. You know, when we're dealing with that with Saudi Arabia right now, that is Saudi Arabia really an ally, or to sound like millennial self. Are they a friend of me? Like we're friends with them a little bit. But in reality, we're not really. And if you look at the geopolitical macro view, you have maimed your players that we may have massive political shifts in. We have Saudi Arabia. We have Iran. And we have Venezuela. And we're slightly not saying this is a grand decision and picking sides here, but we're slightly warming up to Venezuela, because we realize how to Arabia really is not working on our best interests right now. Yeah, I mean, we did hear the President comment on the yesterday suggesting that there could be more moves coming against Saudi Arabia on the back of that decision. So energy, it sounds like you're still, you pulled back a bit, but you're still positive on it in this environment. Yeah. What are some other names that you think are getting overlooked right now that offer real value? So, and my Costco, I'll talk about Costco anytime I can get it. I love my Costco. Not the stock itself. I'm talking about the company. But not even the $1.50 hotdog, but they are also picking up inventory. So this second Amazon Prime Day that we've gotten is not just because Amazon is trying to be nice to us. They're trying to dump inventory. Everybody's got inventory. Nike's got inventory. So the Costco's and the TJ Maxx of the world that are kind of the off brand. They're not beholden to any brand names. So they're picking up cheap inventory and they're moving it. They're a discount store. They're 75% in the US. The bulk of their international exposures, Canada, which is held up better. So I think they're going to have a little bit less currency effects. I like them. I like a really boring name, IBM. I think they're a great place to hide. They've got a strong dividend yield. I think as a service and a tech company goes tech spending, it's going to continue. And because of the way they're positioned, I think they're going to see a little bit more sustainability and revenues. Because that's what we're looking at right now. As we move forward and things get pressured, who's going to still make money and who's at risk of being cut? And so I think they're very well positioned. They're reasonably valued. But I think they still have a lot of growth. They've changed who they were. And people realize IBM is a very old company, but they've redeveloped themselves multiple, multiple times. They sold off Lenovo, got out of the PC business. And now they're in the hybrid cloud and AI and data consulting. And I see data and data and healthcare as a great place to be. And the last place playing defense is healthcare, like a United Health. Great name to be in right now. And again, a little bit less effect with the dollar. So some of these names that have more revenues coming from the US, I think also will hold up a little bit better. Yeah, names from three very different sectors. But diversification is what we keep hearing. Victoria Green, good to have you in studio today. Yeah, thank you so much for having me. Joining us from G-Scrider Private Wealth. Well, let's take a look at oil now as OPEC flashes its forecast for global crude demand. Yahoo Finance is Jared Blyckrey here with more on the price action. Jared, I guess in some ways, this is OPEC's wave justifying that cut that we got last week. I think so. That took the administration also, the Democrats by surprise. In fact, a lot of people surprised by that because a slash of 2.1 million barrels per day is a lot. Now, OPEC Plus has been operating under capacity. So it's really only an effective cut of about 1 million barrels per day. That is still a lot. And it has house Democrats up in arms and some of the Senate leaders as well, Dick Durbin, offering up some bills that have been offered previously in the year and these have to do.",https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2iE41vefT4k,19,2022-10-12 15:11:31
3110," Up in arms and some of the Senator, Senate leaders as well, Dick Durbin offering up some bills that have been offered previously in the year. And these have to do with the potential altering the relationship that the U.S. has with Saudi Arabia. We know the U.S. just visited. President Biden just visited Saudi Arabia. But all of this is one month ahead of the midterm. So we know how gas prices and energy prices factor into politics. So not surprised to see this, but I believe there is a resolution introduced by three Democrats that would suspend military operations and protections in Saudi Arabia and also some sales of arms. And that's a huge deal. There's $100 billion in active tickets with respect to the U.S. and defense systems out there with respect to Saudi Arabia. Now here are crude oil futures. In today, you can see just kind of sinking here after the 8 AM hour. But here's a year to date. We just climbed above 91 dollars per barrel, but still well in the lower end of this range. We just broke out. And so with energy as the leading sector here, you got to ask yourself, and I'm going to go to our sector action and put a year to date on it. With energy, the leading sector, what are the options here? Victoria Green, our previous guest, mentioning that a lot of these companies, these energy companies are minting money. And with respect to the supply situation of Saudi Arabia isn't playing ball. Guess what, Venezuela. She mentioned them too. They have some of the largest holdings of oil reserves in the entire world. And they are on this side of the world in the West. So maybe we're going to see some increase in terms of interest with respect to repairing those foreign relations. And maybe easing some of those sanctions. I believe Chevron still has a presence there. So we'll have to see what comes of this. Ex-L.E., by the way, still up 43% for the year. Okay, Jared Blickrey, thanks so much for that. Well, Pepsi, PepsiCo seeing a big boost after the food giant blew away profit estimates with Frito-Lay, North America powering PepsiCo's net revenue. Take a look at the stock there, up nearly 5%. The company also raising its forecast, now expecting its full year organic revenue to increase 12%. We've got our very own Brian Sasi here with outfit change from the last hour. I just put it up please. This is my outfit I watch on Sunday football. You know, I feel a little Pepsi Max, but I'm both in box and ice and you're good to go. Which is fitting because we're talking about snacks. Turns out snacks are pretty resilient even in the face of cost rises. Yeah, you know, I don't want to bury the lead here. Bottom line is we talk to PepsiCo, CFO, Hugh Johnson, he said, hey, yeah, we'll find it steam. We're pushing through price increases because we're still dealing with high levels of inflation. And despite those price increases, people are still out there buying lots of chips and lots of soda. Take a listen. Okay, I guess we don't have that. We don't have that, but still, Johnson came out, really I think struck a bullish tone. So in addition to that, really saying how he, they just implemented more price increases in the fourth quarter. What he did not want to do is really provide any 2023 guidance. That is typically what PepsiCo does. He did not provide that on the conference call, but ultimately said that's not where they're going to go yet too. We were just also showing pictures of Gatorade. I would expect a big push by Gatorade more into the energy drink category next year. They will launch that what they're calling their new fast Twitch product, 200 milligrams of caffeine in the early part of next year in partnership with the NFL. That should be the case. 200 milligrams of... Oh, right on my alley. I'm so psyched to get a walk out. You're going to have more than one of those, right? Oh, you better go. Oh, absolutely. When you talk about those cost increases, how much of it is it to offset? I mean, it's clearly there to offset the price increases they're seeing internally from the materials, everything that goes into making all these stacks, but at the same time, is it enough to offset what they're seeing internally? Yeah, I would say they have. Pepsi was out here this morning with, I think in earnings, be nobody on the street expected. That's why the stock is ripping higher here for Pepsi on earnings. They, that's a pretty big move. That's why it's the hottest ticker on the Yow Finance platform. This quarter's positively surprised a lot of folks on the street over the next coming days. I would not be surprised to see upgrades on Pepsi co-stock, upgrades in price targets, upgrades in earnings estimates because it's clear that they have pricing power. And I think the focus now turns onto Coca-Cola to see if they could report more of the same. First instinct is yes, you will probably see a very strong quarter from Coca-Cola. The only red flag I would call out is maybe more currency exposure for Coca-Cola than Pepsi-Cola, but still Coca-Cola is teed up for a very strong quarter now. Yeah, currency exposure, one, we're going to continue a year throughout the earnings season.",https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2iE41vefT4k,20,2022-10-12 15:15:49
3111," Flag I would call out as maybe more currency exposure for Coca-Cola and Pepsi code but still Coca-Cola is teed up for a very strong core now. Yeah, currency exposure one we're going to continue to hear throughout the earnings season. Brian Sasi, thanks so much. Thanks. Well, shares of Intel aren't focused today as the company reportedly considers major job cuts. That stock is up right now but it did hit a new 52-week low today. Bloomberg reporting the chipmaker plans to announce the reductions around its quarterly results on October 27th. News of the cuts come as the company sees declining demand for its products especially its PC processors. It's a key revenue driver for the company. Bloomberg reports the reductions could be as high as 20% of staff in some divisions. Well coming up from changing our office to watching the office meta labels the QuestPro a powerful device for productivity and announces tie-ups with Microsoft and NBC universal. Dan Halle is going to break down the announcement for us on the other side. Well meta has unveiled its new virtual reality headset with a price tag and I watering $1,500. The device isn't aimed at gamers it's being more positioned as a work use tool. Those credentials bolster by an appearance from Microsoft's very own CEO Satya Nadella at the big event. Yaku finances Dan Halle has all of the details Dan I guess you could argue the device is a little less clunkyer but let's talk about the technology and how this helps meta accelerate their vision of the metaverse. Does it though I don't know if it does this is a $1,500 headset it's really geared towards professionals you know as you said it's not really geared towards gamers although part of the conference or you know the developers conference that they were running had a huge focus on gamers and how",https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2iE41vefT4k,21,2022-10-12 15:19:42
3112," professionals, as you said, it's not really here towards gamers, although part of the conference or the developer's conference that they were running had a huge focus on gamers and how they want to bring more game developers in and talk about how they're offering more in that game developers are making billions or rather millions through the platform. So they really did put that heavy emphasis on gaming. The headset, though, as you said, seemed to be focused more on the idea of work and being able to have these kind of meetings in the metaverse where you can sit down with people from around the world and easily chat without having to do it via video conference, which I'm not sure that too many people will find that super appealing when they have to strap a headset on that is heavier than the current quest, albeit according to people who've used it a little bit better weighted and less hot. So it really was kind of a mixed bag. The technology is supposed to be better with better visuals, pedographics, improved lenses. There's the ability to see the outside world in color. You could do that sort of with the quest, too, but not really with full color at all. So yeah, it really does ring to be seen if this is actually going to start pushing the metaverse idea forward. It still seems like it's quite a ways off before it becomes something that the average consumer says, I got to go out and get this headset and then use it all the time because they've sold something like 10 million headsets or more, but how often are they being used? I think the real question, how often are people picking them up, going back daily and jumping into things like check email, talk to people, access kind of the big displays that you might get in the metaverse. When instead you could just fire a computer and do that quicker. Yeah, I mean, it is about that transition we talked about so much. It's not so seamless going from the real world to the virtual world, although I have to say, Dan, I'm just really excited that Avatar's getting lights. You can talk about that. I mean, that's a good sign, right? Technology's advancing. We talked about Satya Nadella making a surprise appearance there. What's this partnership about between meta and Microsoft? Yeah, so this is about their team's mesh software and it's really, you know, they're both going hard as far as the ability to get this kind of work into the metaverse where you can sit down and have meetings with people chat with them around a virtual conference table. You know, Microsoft already offers a team's chat where you can do video chatting with your colleagues through your laptop or your smart phone. So, you know, it just kind of feels odd that you can fire up something so easily that you can carry with you and have conversations with people. Sure, you're not around a virtual conference table. You're not able to virtually whiteboard the way you might want to, although there is a whiteboard feature for video chatting with Microsoft teams when you do use the laptop. But, you know, it does kind of point to how both companies don't want to miss the boat. It could potentially be a big piece of hardware and software down the line just like they did with the smartphone. You'll remember Facebook tried to launch a phone. Microsoft had their phone line, Windows OS, mobile OS wasn't as bad as people thought. But they also did lean into gaming. So part of Microsoft's X Cloud, their cloud gaming platform will be available on the quest. And so you see this kind of balance between or attempt to balance between gamers and people who are working. It feels as though they're trying to make a PC when the PC already exists. This one you just have to put on your head. All this of course coming is a medic kind of keeps a close watch in their rearview mirror, right? With Apple, it's expected to come out with their headset soon. Dan Halley is always thanks so much for that. We are continuing to monitor some of those layoffs coming out of Warner Brothers Discovery. This is all part of the company's drive to cut costs. It's now affecting the Warner Brothers TV studio. Yahoo! Finance is Ali Canal following that story for us. And Ali, do we have a sense of just how many job cuts are coming? Yeah, we do. Yesterday we got the announcement that the TV studio has been affected. That segment cut 26% of its head count, aka 125 positions across scripted, unscripted, and animation. And that translated to 82 staffers being laid off. And then the company opted not to fill an additional 43 vacant positions. But there's another big cut that the company made. They are shuttering their digital production arms, stage 13. And the 40 year Warner Brothers television workshop. And this is a big one because this fostered new diverse talent.",https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2iE41vefT4k,22,2022-10-12 15:24:13
3113, me they are shuttering their digital production arms stage 13 and the 40 year Warner Brothers television workshop and this is a big one because this fostered new diverse talent there was a lot of talk on Twitter why are they deciding to cut this when there was so much diversity that was coming out of that program so that is now done and obviously this comes at a pretty crucial time for the company they are trying to cut three billion dollars worth of costs over the next two years we saw back in August that they cut 14% of their HBO Max work for so this is just a continuation of those expected layoffs I think we will see more throughout the fall but if you take a look at the stock it's trading near 52 week lows down more than 50% year-to-date David Sazal has been very aggressive but I think investors are they still need a buying to his vision so I think once all this consolidation happens once we get that newly combined HBO Max discovery plus streaming program next summer the next step is going to be okay David Sazal where are you going to take this company and well investors ultimately buy into it yeah maybe investors are waiting for the shakedown to all play out the other company of course in the streaming space Netflix the big giant here reporting next week what are we expecting there what's interesting about this earnings report is for the first time in a long time I don't think subscriber numbers are going to be the be all and all if we take a look at the numbers here Netflix says it expects revenue at 7.85 billion adjusted EPS at two dollars and 22 cents a share they expect that subscriber number to come in at one million I actually think they might even be on that subscriber number due to the success of Dahmer that series has just been crushing it week after week on the Netflix top 10 list but going back to what's happening at the company right now at supported that is going to be a big driver there's been a lot of optimism on Wall Street we've seen a lot of upgrades the stock is up 18% over the past three months widely outpacing the broader market we still have a couple bears in there that say there's a lot of volatility there's a lot of competition we have Disney's at supported coming out in December people are saying that Netflix could come out with theirs November 1st to beat Disney to the punch but right now I think ultimately analysts are really hoping for some more clarity on the at supported and they're really banking on that to help Netflix improve their free cash flow and profitability so that's going to be probably the biggest question that investors want answered during the earnings call in the report you think that people be a little more cautious in this environment in terms of you know which advertisers would be willing to pay up but I guess that points to the attractiveness of the platform that at least you know the analysts see if they're upgrading it because the additional revenue source they expect to come in and that's been some of the bearer sentiment too because Netflix is charging a really high premium for too a lot of these advertisers so if they even want to be on the platform they're paying above industry standard and that could be a risk. Yeah an important point to point out there Ali Canal thanks so much for that. Well coming up the sustainability conundrum support for major governments trillions worth of assets and now a new report saying supply cannot keep up with the band but is their backlash against ESG we'll discuss next.,https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2iE41vefT4k,23,2022-10-12 15:28:26
3114," Fifth In the time now for our chart of the day and today we are focusing on the rise in ESG investing. And as an investor may come as a surprise, the sum that the field is actually known for sustainable debt, which has been increasing. So much so that in 2021, issuance exceeded 1.6 trillion, take a look at this chart here. The fastest growing themes in the ESG fixed income market were sustainability, linked bonds and loans. These transactions bring the total market to more than 4 trillion since inception. That's at least according to data out from Bloomberg. Well, we're sticking with the ESG investing theme here. A new study by PWC found that nearly 9 and 10 institutional investors believe that asset managers should be more proactive in developing new ESG products. But fewer than half of asset managers were planning to launch new ESG funds. So what's an investor to do? Joining us now is Bruce Usher, a Columbia Business School professor, an author of the new book, investing in the era of climate change and Bruce, you've been arguing that despite the economic backdrop, this is kind of the time to be investing in some of these green names. Walk me through that thesis. Absolutely. It's really about the macro trends, climate change. We know climate science. We know that after 300 years of building a global economy that's putting emissions into the atmosphere, we've got 30 years to decarbonize to avoid catastrophic climate change. So you've got consumers pushing to buy more sustainable goods. You've got employees saying they want to work for sustainable companies. You now have investors looking at those trends. Company leaders saying we need to meet those trends. You have government action, like the inflation reduction act, pouring support into this. And lastly, a physical risk of climate change manifesting themselves. More violent storm, heat waves. All these macro trends are all pushing the same direction. They're going to be with us for decades to come. How do you break that down, though, for investors who are looking at this and saying, well, OK, there's questions about yes, she funds and we'll get into that in just a bit. But in terms of the names, there's, you know, EVs, which some would argue that that's actually not a long term play in terms of impact on climate change. There are many other names that may be potentially being overlooked. Right. So when I looked at this sector 20 years ago, it's how long I've been in it. The big challenge then was there was nothing to invest in. If you look at the whole solar power market, everything globally, there's less solar than one coal plant. Last year, the investment in solar, more than 100 coal plants worth, and gaining. So the big picture here is that the opportunity to invest is now trillion-dollar sectors. We've got the EV sector. All the automakers are going EVs. The key question is why? The reason is that those products are better than the incumbent product there's other before. So you look at EVs specifically, it suggests, but that why the EV sales so good? Because consumers love them. Consumers prefer EV products that flying out the showrooms, in fact, the car makers can't keep up with them. They prefer the products, but it's still a very small portion. Right? He paid about 5%.",https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2iE41vefT4k,24,2022-10-12 15:33:17
3115," for EV products that flying out the showrooms, in fact, the car makers can't keep up with them. They prefer the products, but it's still a very small portion, right? We're talking roughly what, 5%, but now analysis has shown that around 5%, you get a tipping point in these markets. And that's what the automakers are seeing. You have to ask why are they all rushing into this market? What do they see? What they see is five years ahead. When they're planning new cars, they're looking five years in the future. That's how long it takes to roll out a new model. And what they see is an all-of-evee future, because it's a better product, consumers like it. And then we have these trends around climate change. So that's what's really pushing that. And that's what's creating investment opportunities. When consumers and businesses go in this direction, the market opens up to investors. We have seen incredible amount of inflows into ESG funds over the last few years. A bit of a reckoning, some of our you that's happening right now, not just this being politicized, but you've also got those like Deutsche Bank, some other names who are now being called out for greenwashing, the funds that the names that were included in these funds were not necessarily sort of green, so to speak. What do you think? I mean, what do you think is happening here? How does this manifest itself from an investor perspective, those who've been putting money behind these saying they were anticipating some impact coming from these funds? Well, turns out that's not actually what ESG investing is, right? That's correct. Exactly. And there's a real misunderstanding around ESG. ESG investing is really very simple. It's saying, look, when I look at potentially investing in asset, I look at financial numbers, I look at management, I look at all these things. And then also, to be a smarter investor, what else could put this investment at risk? What else could change the outcomes? Look at risks like flooding or hurricanes or wildfires. How could that affect my investment? If you wouldn't go out by a house, a second home on the coast, would you want to know if it's going to flood? Would you want to know that be a smart thing to know? That's what ESG investing is. It can make you a better business manager, it can make you a better investor. The challenge though, is it doesn't really address climate change. Just because you buy that, just because you're deciding on a walk away from that house, so I'm going to pay less for it because it's at flood risk, that doesn't reduce the risk of flooding. That's a challenge. So how do you invest from an impact standpoint? So from impact standpoint, it's much more important that you go beyond ESG investing. And there's really two strategies that I read about my book. One is what we call thematic. So pick a theme that you're excited about your comfort with. If you're really interested in renewable energy, invest in the solar or wind fund. There's plenty of those out there. That's a way to really channel money into the solution. Or if you're interested in EVs into either EV company stocks or funds, those are thematic funds. There's also now new funds coming out in green hydrogen, other leading technologies. So you can have a thematic focus, the equity debt venture capital, as you wish. Or you can have what we call impact first focus. Now this is very special in the sense that it's really only for high net worth investors. Impact first is not falling if I do share responsibility. It's saying, I really want to address climate change. I'm going to put my capital into that. I might get a return. Their return might be decades from now. But it's going to have great impact. And that's where you're really investing. And technologies aren't yet commercial. This goes well beyond say solar and EVs. This is some new technologies like direct air capture, for example. And really quickly, what about green bonds? So green bonds are issued by companies because they see these trends coming. They see these sustainability trends. Consumers want investors want it. It's again thinking about how is how is they world be carbonizing? And what does that mean for my business? The green bond makes perfect sense. But again, the green bond is not going to have tremendous impact on the environment. It's just a very sensible investment. Okay. Good to differentiate those two. Bruce Esther, Columbia Business School professor and author of the book, Investing in the era of climate change. Thanks for joining us today. Thank you. Well, coming up, talking down gold comments from Janet Yellen on the dollar and Loretta Mester on rate hike. So aren't exactly supporting the precious metal. As the safe and shine truly rubbed off, we're going to ask our next guest on the other side.",https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2iE41vefT4k,25,2022-10-12 15:37:19
3116," Next We'll do a quick check on the commodity space right now and looking specifically at oil. We are seeing both WTI crude and Brent crude to the downside. WTI down about 2, more than 2% Brent crude down about 1.9 there. For more on the commodity space, let's bring in Suki Cooper, a Stan chart executive director in precious metals, analysts. Suki, good to talk to you. You've specifically been looking at gold right now. Sort of, you know, what has traditionally been more of a safe haven play, but it sounds like you think there's more downside to come. Gold has really been caught in the headwinds of the strength of the dollar and the scope of further rate hikes. And while we think that the Fed is not done with its rate hikes, I don't think there's another 75 basis points that's likely to come in an November meeting and another further 50 basis points in December. I think these are going to present strong headwinds for the gold market, but we do think that the downside is quite well supported. We're seeing quite a good price elastic response in terms of demand from India and China. And there's still that concern around the session risk and perhaps the need for flight to safety that is buffering some of the downside for gold. But we do think that there's more downside risk to come as the year comes to an end and into 2023 with the gold price is heading further towards 1600 towards the end of next year. So 1600, we're at 1675 right now. Is 1600 the support level you're talking about? The key support that's coming up next is around 1650. This is a level that we've seen physical demand materialising. And now we're entering a period where we tend to see seasonal demand from India. Devali falls on the 24th this month. We have the wedding season as well. And we've seen in markets like China, the physical premium earlier last month's long to levels that we last saw in 2015. So that price drop that we initially saw below 1700 was greeted by quite strong physical interest in the gold market. So the next level to look at from here will be 1650 and then beyond that is 1600. If we breach those two levels, then we're really looking to the cost of production and where that provides a guideline for the gold market. And we tend to see in a long run basis and here I'm looking at around about 40 years that gold prices tend to trade a third above the average cost of production. And that guideline suggests to us around 1550 to 16.",https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2iE41vefT4k,26,2022-10-12 15:41:56
3117," I'm looking at around about 40 years, that gold prices tend to trade a third above the average cost of production. And that guideline suggests to us around 1550 to 1600 is where that floor from the production side should be sterilized. So much of the price moves as you point out, really driven by the stronger dollar and we have seen it climb up again today looking at something like the Japanese yen well above or below depending on how you look at it, those intervention levels. I mean, how much higher do you think the green bag goes as you track those metals and moving in tandem? It's really pivotal for the communist complex as a whole. The dollar strength has been a headwind for not just gold, but for silver, platinum and playdium. It's really dampened that upside risk. We think that there's likely that we may see further dollar strength and perhaps we'll see something of a stabilization coming in the first part of next year. And that's really when we might see some of that pressure on gold prices starting to ease. But if we look at the correlations for the gold markets, it's strongest consistent. Relationships since the start of this year has been with the US dollar. That correlations jump in above 60% at the moment. But last year that relationship had started to pivot towards real yields and nominal yields. That relationship still matters for gold. It's in close second. But at the moment, it's the strength of the dollar that's proven to be a key headwind. Now it's not to say that gold can't rise if we see dollar strength. If both dollar and gold are benefiting from safe Hayden demand, we can see them both rally. And in the current environment, it's the concerns around slowing demand over the longer term. But there's also concerns around higher rates that's really weighing on gold. And it's not been a critical safe Hayden demand at the moment. So bottom line, Tsukiya, you should investors be putting their money here or is there a better value in the precious metal space? If we look at the entire complex on a longer term basis, the industry bias, precious metals, fundamentals are set to tighten. If we look at markets like platinum and pladium, we think that towards the end of the year, we're going to see much tighter markets. As the auto market starts to recover, we were anticipating at the start of this year, a rebound around about 11% in global auto production. But we've scaled back our expectations closer to 7%. But into 2023, we're still expecting the double-digit rebounds in terms of global auto production. And PGMs are critical in terms of the growth that we see in the auto industry. So those are two markets where we expect more off-side risk towards the end of this year. But on a longer term horizon, perhaps silver is the metal where we might see more upside risk and given the demand from the solar energy, given the electrification of vehicles, this is strong growth that we're looking to see. But that demand is like to take two to three years to materialise. So over the longer run, silver has positive prospects. But over the next few months, we think there's more upside risk for platinum and pladium, at least in the short term. Suki Cooper, Stan Chart Executive Director and Precious Metals, analysts. Good to have you on today. Thank you. Well, coming up, reigning on the parade, some power announces a big move with GM on home energy storage, but a downgrade from BFA Ways on Chairs is the teeterie housing market its biggest risk. We're going to ask CEO Peter Ferrisy on the other side.",https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2iE41vefT4k,27,2022-10-12 15:45:52
3118," Music Well, the sun shined on solar stocks in the aftermath of President Biden's landmark inflation reduction act, as it showered the sector with billions in funding and tax incentives. Now a leading player in the residential space is making a big move. The sun power announcing a major tie up with General Motors to develop new home energy systems that's going to coincide with the retail launch of the Chevy Silverado EV in 2024. Let's bring in the CEO of Sun Power, Peter Ferrisy joining us live on this show. Today Peter gets to talk to you today. It's really a big announcement here that really combines the battery side of things, the solar side of things, EVs. Talk to me about how it's all connected to the new home energy system. Yeah, first of all, thank you for having me on, but we are just thrilled to partner with General Motors. As you mentioned, our partnership has two major components that are going to be critical for the future of EV sales and for clean energy. So number one, we're preferred partner for General Motors on electric vehicle charger installations. So for all the electric vehicles they sell going forward, we'll be their preferred partner. And many customers find that it's very, this is not a do-it-yourself job. You need someone's help. To set up your own home charging station, if you will. But secondly, once you get an electric vehicle, you quickly discover your home charging station is using a lot more energy than it used to. And so most customers want solar power very quickly afterwards. And we are the exclusive partner for General Motors on solar panels and batteries. And we're just thrilled to work together on changing the world as we go forward. So you're talking about installing the solar panels on homes that are looking to get the charging installed for their GM car. Exactly. So once you buy an electric vehicle, obviously there's so many wonderful parts about it. You don't use fossil fuel at the gas station. But if you just plug into your garage and you don't have solar power, you're just connecting to usually coal or gas or whatever fossil fuel the local utility uses. So your only is green is your charging source. And so most EV customers really want solar power quickly afterwards because their bills are much higher when they go to charge their car without solar power. And with solar power, they have this clean renewable energy source forever. Peter, you know one of the big concerns with EVs has been just how it's likely to strain the power grid. And there's an idea of bidirectional charging using your car to power up your home. Certainly one that's been picking up a lot of steam. How much of that demand that's anticipated for the power grid do you think can actually be, you know, picked up by these EVs? Well you're absolutely right. By directional chargers. Wow. This has really kind of changed the world for consumers. Who would have thought that?",https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2iE41vefT4k,28,2022-10-12 15:50:19
3119," by these EVs. Well, you're absolutely right. By directional chargers. Wow, this has really kind of changed the world for consumers. Who would have thought that in addition to backing up your home with a generator, that's the way it's been done traditionally, that you can either use a solar battery or actually use your vehicle? And what General Motors has announced is that we will be installing their by directional charger for the 2024 Silverado pickup launch. It launches at the end of 23 next year. And what's exciting is that for consumers to buy a Silverado, they'll have the option to back up their home with their vehicle battery, which will just be incredible. But you're actually right. The grid today doesn't have enough capacity for all the future EV sales that we expect. General Motors is expecting to sell more than a million electric vehicles in the next three years. If you believe the data by 2030, 30 million more electric vehicles will be out there on the road. And so for practical purposes, and obviously to combat climate change, more and more consumers are going to want solar power. And we're really excited to work with them because we're the number one rated residential solar power company in the United States. We have the highest customer service, we have the best products, and we're thrilled to work with GM to serve their customers. Yeah, it's certainly the idea of by directional charging, really picking up steam, especially in light of recent natural disasters like the hurricanes, fires with a lot of home owners saying, well, this could have helped with the power outages. Obviously, GM came out with this announcement yesterday. It's certainly big news, but your stock was down significantly because of a downgrade from Bank of America, specifically setting a decline in new home sales, affecting revenue outlook. I realize sales from homes aren't specifically the biggest revenue driver for Sun Power. But how big of a pullback do you anticipate into what extent have you already seen that? Well, we are the leader in new home solar. So I recognize the origin of the comment. But what I'll tell you is that overall demand for solar, outside of new homes has been so high this year that any change in new homes demand really hasn't been material to our business. So we have a very big backlog of new homes that exist today that are waiting for solar, that'll carry us through most of 2023. So although new home starts have slowed because of rising interest rates, I don't anticipate it's going to have a bunch of an impact on our overall business. We announced that we haven't announced our third quarter result yet, obviously, but in Q1 and Q2, we actually announced accelerating demand. And this year, just to give you some color, has just been terrific from a demand standpoint. More and more consumers want solar power, and we're so excited to work with them on it. Sun Power, CEO, Peter Ferrisy. I get to have you on air today, really appreciate the time. Thank you again. Coming up, building the momentum, the critics of Amazon's labor push, they argue progress is still since the big JFK 8 win, but events in California yesterday and upstate New York today could change that. We'll discuss. Until next time, bye. I'm going to do a little bit of the same. I'm going to do a little bit of the same. I'm going to do a little bit of the same.

Well some new momentum for Amazon's labor movement workers at a Southern California warehouse campaign in Georgia is. In Texas and Kristoff. A despite regrets Patty45? Not yet. A sharp stop to go in demand. Yet again, it highlights revenue. Amazon Labor Union's first out of state venture, and it is a big one. The Inland Empire, a local politician I've spoken to, is referred to it as warehouse central. It is deeply important for the logistics industry, and it's deeply important for Amazon. Amazon set to build its largest warehouse in the Inland Empire, and in the last 12 years has invested more than 19 billion in that area alone. So Union pushes have failed there in the past, but if the Amazon Labor Union can get this election authorized and succeed, it would be a major victory, and it would hit Amazon where it hurts the most. And Ali, we got that news yesterday in anticipation of another vote that's happening in the state of New York, Albany, a pivotal union election today. What are we expecting? So we're, you know, I've spoken to a couple experts who say, who all say the same thing, that the Amazon Labor Union does believe they could win an Albany despite their latest loss in Staten Island, and experts say that, you know, the odds are still not in their favor, but if they won, it would be a watershed event. And that, combined with the news coming out of California today and yesterday, makes means that they could really have momentum. And it's important to remember, Kiko, for workers, this is about inspiration and momentum. And for Amazon, long term time is absolutely on their side, but right now momentum certainly is not. Really quickly, Ali, have we heard from Amazon in response to the very latest out of California? Not yet, but I'll keep you abreast of what happens there. Okay, great. We'll be watching. Thanks so much for that. Ali Garfinkle joining us from our LA Bureau. Well, let's do a final check of the market action before we let you go. We're seeing green arrows now across the board. The Dow up 171 points, the S&P 500 up 15 and the Nasdaq up 50. We are, of course, looking ahead to the afternoon where we are expecting the FOMC minutes to come out. Sterling investors going to be passing that ahead of that big CPI print coming out tomorrow. All of this, of course, to look ahead to that FOMC meeting. And so you just how aggressively the Fed will continue to move in the face of high inflation. That does it for me in this hour. We've got much more to come here and yakking finance life. Let's move to the right here.",https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2iE41vefT4k,30,2022-10-12 16:00:00
3121,"something you you that gets Today are expressing negativity. We heard Jamie Dheim in yesterday expressing pessimism about where we're going. You obviously were former businessman, now Governor of Connecticut. What are you hearing from your constituents? And what are you seeing out there? Here at the Greenwich Economic Forum, I think people see some recession storm clouds on the horizon. And we're a small state. I can only control so much, but what I've got to do is make sure that a state like Connecticut is prepared. And I've done that by setting aside a $3.5 billion. So if we do get a recession, I don't have to erase taxes. I don't have to lay anybody off. I don't have to cut back on education. We're in a strong position to power through and make sure we keep our economy growing. And of course, you've gotten an influx of new tax income over the course of the pandemic, because people have been moving to Connecticut. Are those new constituents, do they have sort of different needs, different wants than the folks who were in Connecticut already? No, we had tens of thousands of young families moving to the state of Connecticut. There we go in the other direction 10 years ago. Right. I think they love great schools. They love maybe a little backyard. There's a good financial sector here here in the Granted Stanford area. I don't know if they have different needs, but I think they like the Connecticut lifestyle. And how confident are you that if there is a recession, as you just said, that you absolutely won't have to erase taxes or cut back on education or some of the things that they like about Connecticut.",https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2iE41vefT4k,31,2022-10-12 16:03:21
3122," And how confident are you that if there is a recession as you just said that you absolutely won't have to race taxes or cut back on education or some of the things that they like about Connecticut. It depends on the nature of what those storm clouds bring. But I wouldn't trade Connecticut's place with just about anybody right now. We have a very strong manufacturing sector with five and ten year agreements with the defense industry. I have a hundred thousand jobs or having a hard time filling right now. So I don't think it's going to be an unemployment recession. I think it might be a financial recession. That impacts our revenues. I'm going to make sure we're ready. When you talk about an unemployment recession, the unemployment rate in the state is 4.1%. So higher than the national average, how high are you prepared for that to go in a state like Connecticut? I've got well over a hundred thousand jobs that are unfilled right now. I'm training people for those jobs. If everybody took those jobs, I'd be out of people because there's that many jobs to be filled. That's an advanced manufacturing. That's an IT, not the mentioned nursing and teaching. So it's a great time to be a young person, I think, in America. And certainly right here in Connecticut, we're providing all the job training you need. So you come to Connecticut. We'll get you a training and we'll get you a job. Yeah, talk to me a little bit more about those training programs. What they look like. How many people are taking advantage of them, for example. So thousands have done it. We put together. Look, some people want two-year community college, some want four-year college. A lot of people want an 18-week certificate program so they can be a laser welder with a guaranteed job at electric boat when they're done. And so we're providing you those options going forward. And a lot of states will say, I'll pay you $10,000 if you move to my state. Connecticut, I'll train you. Make sure you get a good paying job. The other side of all of that is them being able to afford to live in Connecticut. I got, I mean, your state has reputation as being a fancy state. I think if I could say in sort of late person's terms, I was just reading about residents in Fairfield County fighting against affordable housing regulations that would increase affordable housing. How do you help with that on the state level? You're right. We haven't allowed much housing. And not much housing has been built in this state over the last 30 years. All of a sudden we're popular. A lot of people want to build housing. The right place to build it is in our downtown areas. We've had more housing starts in the last six months, you know, than anytime, you know, this century. But we have a long way to go. Every business I talk to, they ask me the same things. Workforce, what we're doing there. And will there be a place for people to live. Especially young people. So what are you saying on that ladder question? How do you guys help with fostering more of that construction, especially when the local communities don't necessarily want it? Some of the suburban communities have a little bit of NIMBY, but we've got more housing being built affordable housing, worker housing, single people housing in Stanford and Norwalk and New Haven than ever before. I was really impressed by a travel figure. I saw regarding your state that you guys provided that overnight road trips this summer to Connecticut were up 10.6% year after year. The number one state in the nation for overnight trips. And you guys have spent a lot on a big tourism campaign. Do you expect as things maybe retrench a little bit in the economy? You guys going to keep pushing the tourism spending to get people here. Yeah, it's a beautiful state and people like to visit your as your number show. It was sort of weird during the worst of COVID, 2021. We kept our beat to Zo. We kept our parks open. We had more visitors in the state of Connecticut during those two years and ever before in our history. And I think a lot of people fell in love with the state and state. What's your favorite place to visit in Connecticut? I'll tell you what I love. I love the fact that there's a park within about a 10 minute drive of any place in this state. So we have the best mix of indoor outdoor live workplace. Governor, thank you so much for talking with me today. Governor Ned Lamont of Connecticut. Back to you guys. Thank you. Thank you.",https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2iE41vefT4k,32,2022-10-12 16:07:52
3123," you you and A a vulnerable position currently above the $19,000 mark ahead of Thursday's inflation print as the Federal Reserve looks to continue its hawkish tightening cycle, joining us now to weigh in on the crypto spaces, Galaxy Digital Founder and CEO Mike Novogratz joined by Yowl Finance's crypto reporter David Hollerith. Mike, great to get some time with you. It's been a while here. Talk to us about prices here. How much, what would happen to Bitcoin if we did in fact get that Fed pivot? Liz, I think once the Fed pivots, you're going to see assets in general rally, right? You've had a tremendous sell-off across the board based on Chairman Powell being really hawkish in the Fed. And rightfully so, people always ask me, well, Bitcoin didn't work as an inflation hedge. And I'm like, are you guys crazy? It went from $10,000 to $70,000 when the Fed was producing inflation. Since the Fed has decided to try to smash inflation by raising rates aggressively, the most aggressive rate raising in our lifetime, Bitcoin sold off with other assets. It's actually done better than most. And I think if you finally get the pause, you'll start seeing Bitcoin pick back up, Bitcoin and all cryptocurrencies. Listen, are we going to get the pause? At one point, yes, we priced in a lot, but the inflation data is still lagging and hot. And the employment data we just got was pretty darn strong. And so, this normally works. You'll have to see the ISM or the manufacturing data plunge first, go from 50 to 48 to 40. What will follow that will be earnings, inflation and employment, which is a lagging indicator. And so, you know, the bearer case is we've got two to six months left of this pain. The bull case is, you know, the market starts breaking. We're seeing a lot of breakage, not in necessarily crypto, but in the rest of the world. And crypto is interesting in that, you know, three months ago after the big sell-off and the deleverging, most people that needed to sell sold. And so, you've seen price, price is much more muted. You know, things take off when there's a good story and they sell right back off when the story goes away. And so, a lot less activity in crypto, a lot less for sellers, but also a lot less new buyers. Mike, typically during some of the crypto winters, as we see the most innovation, especially within the underlying technology in blockchain as well. But we know that there are even more bills within Congress that have moved forward as well over the course of this year. That regulation is set to still go full steam ahead in some of the discussions. And so, with regard to that, the bill's giving validation. But does that also, to your perspective, pump the value of crypto? And are there some cryptos that are not created equal perhaps? In that sense. That's a great question. Listen, I think two things are happening.",https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2iE41vefT4k,33,2022-10-12 16:11:42
3124," pump the value of crypto, and are there some cryptos that are not created equal perhaps? In that sense. It's a great question. Listen, I think two things are happening, and you can't deny they're happening. One is institutions across the board are putting big resources into building for the next crypto spring. That's guys like Citadel in their exchange. It's people like BlackRock with Aladdin, it's hedge funds, it's Citibanks and Goldman Sachs getting ready for a tokenization revolution that's coming, I don't know, in two years and three years, four years, whenever. So there's almost a sense of inevitability that this is going to be a big industry. It's a shocking difference than last crypto winter. That said, buying the coins right now, there's just less enthusiasm until the macro changes. I do think Congress has done a good job of getting educated. I was just down in DC for three days and met with, I don't know, 14 different congressmen and senators and was pleasantly surprised at how up the speed they were. I got my fingers crossed that the Ag Bill gets put into committee and potentially voted on in a in the lame duck session. That would be a great first step in starting some crypto regulation. My fear is nothing happens until post election and then you're going to, then you're going to, you know, then we'll see what happens. Maybe that, depending on how the election goes, the cards change. We do need some regulation to get things moving. Mike, there's over 500 crypto exchanges and trading venues worldwide. I was just thinking in the context of what sounds like a prolonged bear market and then also these much larger traditional institutions coming in. What sort of your expectation for what happens to those 500 exchanges? You know, it's interesting. So some of the exchanges cost very little to run, right? These are basically code. And as you got closer to a regulated world, you look at what claim based costs and your building services and your building KYC and you know, they cost more and more. And so I think as you look at what I'll call regulated exchanges or exchanges that have some regulator, you probably see a consolidation and they probably still need to cut costs. And so, but you know, exchanges of funny word, most of these exchanges should be thought of as as broker dealers, right? QAIM base is closer to fidelity than it is to the New York stock exchange. I mean, it has a tens of millions of customers that it deals with that that uses app that keep things on its in its system, right? New York stock exchange does it. You go to and trade and you have a broker deal that you trades with it. And so calling them all exchanges as a misnomer, they have matching instances and they have exchanges, but their primary business is really that of collecting customers. And I think it's a consolidation there. Right. Turning to this from a sustainability report that Galaxy put out this morning. Sort of a benchmark for the industry in a sense of transparency. But I was just curious, in the report you revealed that 68% of the company's carbon footprint comes from its Bitcoin mining operations. And that long term, you're aiming for making the energy sources for those operations 80% coming from renewable energy. And so I was just curious, what is the timeline for where you when you when the company plans to hit that 80% mark? I think we're pretty close already. And so I would, you know, without actually talking to the mining team this morning, I don't want to give you a bad bad data point, but we're pretty close to 80% already. This is one of the unfortunate things that happened in the last two years of crypto is this narrative that Bitcoin uses too much electricity showed up. Reality, total Bitcoin mining uses.",https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2iE41vefT4k,34,2022-10-12 16:16:06
3125," that happened in the last two years of crypto is this narrative that Bitcoin uses too much electricity showed up. Reality, total Bitcoin mining uses less electricity than hair dryers or Christmas lights. You know, it's not zero. It's certainly a significant amount, but it's a fraction of global power supply. And so, you know, when you think about the fewer the master of the galaxy, you would allocate electricity to things you think are valuable. Like YouTube uses a lot more electricity than Bitcoin mining. Listen, I think YouTube is an unbelievable innovation and it deserves some electricity budget. And so, it's Bitcoin because it can exactly specify how much electricity it uses and it produces those reports on a monthly basis. You know, the community says this is what what has gone into mining. It's an easy target, but it shouldn't be a target. And so, listen, we are moving towards a greener footprint because I think all companies should. But I don't want to, in essence, condone the fact that I feel like Bitcoin is being singled out as an industry, because a few people pointed at it and said, oh, this is an easy state though. Thanks for giving me a viable reason not to put up Christmas slice this year, Mike. I definitely appreciate that. And alternative, perhaps. Also, while we have you here though, considering a lot of companies, CEOs, executives, they're implementing their recession playbooks and kind of dusting that off right now, given that you've seen this before. You've seen this in the past, but for crypto this time and the amount of holdings that you do have, do you plan on kind of selling any of that, liquidating any of that in order to just show up the coffers of cash in order to make sure that your businesses can also navigate. You know, we luckily sold over a billion dollars of stuff last year at better prices and certainly don't want to get into the business of burning the furniture to run the business. And so, we're going to try to manage our business towards what we think our rational revenue targets. Listen, revenue is coming down in the industry. Volumes are down. Excitement is down. In this winter could last longer than people think. It might be shorter. It's hard to predict when these crypto winners, how long they go. You know, we're a couple years from a having cycle. I do think the Fed flinching creates some enthusiasm around Bitcoin as a store of value Bitcoin as a recession as an inflation hedge as a hard money when the rest of the world keeps printing money. But we're going to manage our business to what we think is a rational revenue stream for our five operating businesses is trying to try to keep the balance sheet separate. And Mike, if we sort of think of the 1980 period in the 1960s to 1980 for the stock market, this sort of a worst case scenario for what this bear market could look like across the equities market and crypto. I was sort of curious, you know, how do you think a crypto investor should operate in this environment? That period of time sort of likened as sort of excellent for stock pickers. What do you think? How are you evaluating crypto currencies? Yeah, listen, in some ways, this is the most challenging macro environment for any investor. And if you had all the foresight of the sages, you would have just been in US dollar cash all year long, right? When the whole world was saying cash is trash, cash is trash, was time to just go along, you know, one week T-bills and wait, or go short markets. We're in a mess globally, right? Japan has got a monster imbalance intervening in their currency market while supporting an interest rate market as inflation slowly creeps higher. That is a potential real problem. You saw what happened in the UK and they're trying to get this genie back in the box. But once confidence breaks down, it's really hard to get it back. And so what the Fed is doing is trying to preserve confidence in the US system. Now, what they need, and we'll see if you get it, is a congress that is willing to take some pain. Politicians are not normally...ko...",https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2iE41vefT4k,35,2022-10-12 16:20:43
3126," Now, what they need, and we'll see if you get it, is a Congress that is willing to take some pain, politicians are not normally coded to take pain, right? So you already see in France, hey, we're going to do a hundred billion dollar subsidy because energy prices are too high and hence that's driving inflation. So we're going to give more money to the system. Like that's counterintuitive. I understand where it comes from, people are suffering, but as you use printed dollars or printed euros in this case, you know, it creates this inflation cycle. And so it's a really treacherous market, you know, could the S&P, what's it, 30, whatever, 3600 today, could it end the year at 3,300, 3,300, kind of looks like where the chart would go? What's hard about these environments is they don't get there a straight line, right? There is a tremendous amount of fear in the market right now. And so like on Monday, we already saw 6% rally in it got reversed. It doesn't feel to me that the stock market low is in, that we're going to have more pain before we see clear sailing. And you know, there is a chance that even when the Fed thinks it's finished, they pause at if the federal government doesn't tighten its belt and starts feeling this populism surge, you know, the cycle picks up again. And so I would say for now until the next, you know, until further notice, at least 12 months, these are going to be really complicated markets to trade and complicated markets to make money in. And in some ways, just preserving your wealth is a huge win, right? Not actually having monster gains, but not losing money could be a huge win. All right. I need to grab my parfer and Bill DeBare Teddy, you're my appreciated. Maybe I'll mark the low for you guys. Good stuff there. Alex, a digital founder, NCEO, Mike Novigratz, Mike, I have you back here sometime soon. Appreciate the conversation. As well as Yahoo Finance's own David Hollerith. Thank you both. Luxury brand Golden Goose is doubling down on control of its supply chain with the purchase of its top supplier. This as it looks to boost its $227 million in sales from the first half of the year. Golden Goose CEO Silvio Compower joins us now alongside Yahoo Finance's Brook Dupama. Silvio, good to see you here. Help us understand the, I would say infatuation with your brand. What drives that? First of all, thank you so much for being here for a former small company from Venice. He's a big achievement. He's always nice for me when I can represent all my people and trying to explain the magic behind our, I would say, special story. This is probably part of the magic.",https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2iE41vefT4k,36,2022-10-12 16:24:51
3127," the magic behind our, I would say, you know, special story. And this is probably part of the magic, not in the miracle that you were talking about. People perceive that and the magic is we need to be able to put in our product what then the people perceive as something special because for people it's sort of how special today is not about how much or how much this mancy is a product. And speaking of that allure among consumers right now you're in LA for a Golden Goose event. You're going to have contact creators there. We've seen the likes of Taylor Swift and Reese Witherspoon wear Golden Goose sneakers. How important has it been for influencers like those to wear your brand and ultimately drive to your success? It's a great question and I have a simple answer. What's magical is that we never place this product to be celebrities because Golden Goose is made it is made in order to make everyone feel special. So the fact that every shoe is made, every shoe is unique is making our customer become you know a lover and the fact that this celebrity has been wearing it has been just a great amplifier to a message that is simple and is not limited just for us more community while it's really open to a wider community. What are we seeing in the style trends right now? I mean for Kanye West and Gap it's been about some of the kind of more I won't say basic or kind of dirty looks out there but there is something that's out there to like making things look lived in already even before they sell. What is it with the trends right now that you're seeing how much do you expect to kind of be able to lean further into that and where the customer is actually continuing to take price despite hey looks like a shoe has a scuff on it. What's up with that? Thank you Brian for this question because this is technically the first time that I'm answering to this question line to someone and it has been you know quite a question for a couple of years because you should remember that Golden Goose has been the first brand ever to this dress for sneakers and at the beginning people were a little bit like skeptic go why like why do I have to spend 500 bucks you know for the early shoe while the it was part of the magic again Golden Goose never wanted to promote the product of now we always want to know the people to talk about our product so there was a space of an undefined space where the people were not really getting about that but the reality is that simply what we try to do is to inject in life to our product is to unleash the sense of uniqueness of every product we offer to our communities and it's a little bit like you know your old device it is always the most special because you really taking with it your memories no so every item that keep with you and keep with it you know his memories is then more special than something just because it's more extensive you know so there's a new notion of going from product to purpose product to values rather than just the product so this is what is going on right now in the industry and I think the example of Kanye is very interesting quite far from Golden Goose because Kanye is still you know quite fashion focused why Golden Goose is consumer obsessed so these position Golden Goose in a very special angle of being the same and speaking of just the long term goal of Golden Goose you've been in this industry since 2000 you've been through three different investment groups here latest premier took a majority stake in Golden Goose so I have to ask here there are also the owners of Doc Mardin's Valentino could we see Golden Goose go public in the near future I mean it's part of course you know of the options and the most important to us where we we may focus our two things first creating value every day to our consumers second to stay flexible because the market outside is very complicated and very complex and as you can imagine you know consumers is really one of the first angles that the market and these difficulties and opportunities came that we they reflected on so it is very important in this process of education to stay flexible now that's extremely important to bring up especially in this conversation and especially in this timing right now given your kind of consumer base that you go after the more affluent consumer that is kind of flocking to the Golden Goose product",https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2iE41vefT4k,37,2022-10-12 16:29:15
3128," especially in this timing right now, given your kind of consumer base that you go after, the more affluent consumer that is kind of flocking to the golden goose product, if you will, even with some of the anticipated recessionary concerns that many consumers have, are you seeing that show up in any of the sales figures and any of the relationship with that consumer right now? It's a great question. So as you can imagine, for sure, you know that almost 42, 44% of our businesses are driven by Americas. And so, you know, I have a really special angle to be in Italian brand because now we need many Italian brands have the lucky that Golden Gooses. And I can tell you that on the American point of view, we didn't see any recession. Last year we achieved something around 78% plus versus the 2020. And this year we are in the zone of plus 40 versus next year, versus last year in America. And in general, the company, the first semester that's been performing like in creative, but you know, like last year, why? Because again, we don't really look at the trend in fashion. We really look in trend in consumer. And there's something that is for sure. The KPIs that consumers look at are not a bidder or no cost conversion is no revenues, but are really like MPS customer acquisition is really the ability that the company and the brand has to retain and compensate with these communities. So this is where Golden Gooses really representing an excellence. And I really think that we are really representing a kind of new frontier for the consumer industry on this side. Really fascinating. I've seen so many of your products on some of the high end kind of fashion retailers and resailers out there as well. And so I'm excited to see where the brand goes from here. Golden Goose CEO, Sylvia Kamparr joining us here today. Thanks so much for the time as well as Yahoo finances on Brook to Alma. Welcome back to Yahoo Finance Live. I'm Julie Heimann live at the Greenwich Economic Forum in Greenwich, Connecticut. A big focus here of the speakers today and of the subjects of conversation is on alternative investments. Those outside sort of stocks and bonds. And my next guest knows a lot about this area. He's Matt Brown, founder and CEO of Case, which is a firm that basically provides a technology.",https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2iE41vefT4k,38,2022-10-12 16:33:35
3129," sort of stocks and bonds and my next guest knows a lot about this area. He's Matt Brown, founder and CEO of Case, which is a firm that basically provides a technology platform for many of those alternative investments. So before we dig into it, can you just tell me a little bit more about what you guys do? Absolutely. First of all, thanks for having me. It's great to be here. Case, as you said, is a technology platform and what we do is we connect the very fragmented a universe of financial advisors across America with the leading alternative investment funds. So I think private equity, private credit, hedge fund strategies, real estate strategies. And the reason that's valuable is because those two communities really didn't have access to each other prior to a technology that allows it to be easy and simple to connect. Well, and I feel like retail investors writ large didn't really have access to these kinds of investment. The thinking always was, you have to be an accredited investor, which means, among other things, that you have to have a certain amount of money. Do you think all of that needs to change? Do you think we need to have sort of radical accessibility to these kinds of investments? Well, the world is changing. And there's really a moment in time now that we're seeing a lot of forces come to play. There's really four major trends that are coming together and you mentioned one of them. So we want to start there, which is the regulatory environment on who governs who can access alternative investments. I think previously, as you said, the bar was quite high. The SEC's view was, if you invest in alternatives, we want you to have a lot of capital just in case it doesn't work out. I think where they realized over the last 10 years is that all of them have really done their job. What they've done is to be able to take advantage of unique opportunities that the public markets don't offer while protecting the downside of investors in turbulent times like we're having now. And the SEC now is kind of saying, wait a second, maybe we've excluded too many people and not made it more broadly available. So they're changing and modifying their stance on that, which is creating a much more inclusive investing environment and very much along the themes of democratization of access. Yeah, and to your point, it's not as if you're insulated from downside if you're in the equity market. Well, I mean, that's the 60, 40 portfolio I can say it here, I think is officially over. I think markets like this have really just once again demonstrated that you can't just have a portfolio that is only equities and fixed income. The modern portfolio is really a three-dimensional portfolio. It's stocks, bonds, and alternative investments. And most people are talking that it's going to be 50, 50, 30, 20, 20 being, of course, alternative investments. What said do you think that there is a risk with more people getting involved in alternative investments? I see just the opposite. We look at some of the greatest asset managers in the alternative space, many of which are on our platform and available. You know, decade after decade, they've delivered. I would argue that if you're a financial advisor and you're not allocating your clients capital in alternative investments, you're at risk of losing your business. That's the impact positive impact all it's are having. I mean, at the same time, if we are headed into a downturn during the financial crisis, certainly all of us were not immune. If anything, some of them were the sources of some of the, you know, fractures that we saw within the system. Well, I think when you look at the track record of how portfolios perform in good times, and in times like we have right now with high volatility, they're added value, far exceeds, any kind of negative impact that one or two could have. You know, you look at the largest and most sophisticated investors in the world, institutional investors, average allocation rates to alternative investments, 30 to 50 percent of their portfolio overall. Interestingly, look at that same lens on wealth management in America, which controls $40 trillion, less than 5 percent, probably closer to 2 to 3 percent, but it's rising. Advisor demand is picking up. Economic managers see wealth as a huge market of new clients for them and new investors. Regulation, as we mentioned, is changing. And now with this technology, that's going to make it all easier. So all of this implies that even if we're seeing a pullback generally, potentially in things like software spending, that maybe you're not seeing that in your business, or are you? What are you seeing right now among your clients at a time where we're seeing that increased volatility? No, it's just, superior.",https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2iE41vefT4k,39,2022-10-12 16:38:15
3130," ex-op or spending that maybe you're not seeing that in your business. Or are you? What are you seeing right now among your clients at a time where we're seeing that increased volatility? So it's interesting as a platform provider, we're neutral. So we don't really have a dog in the fight, we observe. We want to provide the service. Well, you're neutral, but your clients who make their money on it are not necessarily neutral. Right. So are they pulling, are they new trenching? Yes. So what we're seeing is three or four really defined areas. With the European uncertainty, with the Ukraine situation, with an energy crisis, with the political environment here in the US, all that rising interest rates, rising inflation, all that's factoring into the psyche of the advisor and the end client. So what we are observing on our platform is where the money's going. So we're actually standing back and saying, okay, where are the advisors allocating? So they're allocating to macro strategies right now. Edge fund strategies that are nimble and opportunistic. They're allocating to private credit and real assets. So it's quite interesting to see the ebbs and flows of capital flows into different strategies based on the current economic environment. Well, we'll have to catch up with you again in a few months and see where those flows are going. Matt Brown, Founder and CEO of Case. Thank you so much. Thank you so much. Thank you. you you I'm梅 The new global outlook continuing to stall. On inflation, the fund sees price rises peaking late this year, but remaining at elevated levels. Joining us to discuss the report is Pierre Olivier Grinchas, the IMF's chief economist. We've also got Yahoo Finance's Gen Chamburger joining in on the conversation. Pierre, it's good to talk to you today. You know, I'm thinking about these so-called stormy waters you've described in the report, whether it's the Russian invasion of Ukraine, the cost of living crisis, what's happening in China. These have all been headwinds that you've been watching throughout the year. To what extent have they accelerated in the second half of the year that leads you to this downgrade? Well, it's certainly the case that some of the risks that we had flagged in earlier projection rounds, particularly in July, but even if you go back to April, have started to materialize. I mean, the energy crisis that results from the Russian invasion of Ukraine is perhaps the clearest one where we see this incredible toll that's taking on European economies right now. And also the fight against inflation that is proving quite challenging. Inflation keeps going up still. I mean, we're expecting that it's going to peak soon and then start going down as a result in part of actions by central banks, but it's proven both more persistent, more elevated.",https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2iE41vefT4k,40,2022-10-12 16:42:08
3131," that it's going to peak soon and then start going down as a result in part of actions by central banks, but it's proven both more persistent, more elevated, and also broader. It's not just energy prices that are going up. It's what we call core inflation that excludes energy and food prices. It is also pushing upwards. And so that's something that complicates the task for central banks around the world. The final factor in our forecast is of course the slowdown in China. There is a little bit less of a downward revision there. I mean, that's something that we saw a sharp slowdown in the second quarter of the year. And going forward, zero COVID policy is certainly leading to some localized lockdowns and confinement, or affecting activity and the weakness in the property sector is also another factor. Here, Jennifer Seanberger here, it's great to see you. It seems like the global economy is really being stretched here. Perhaps on a string, you mentioned that a third of the countries will contract and grow this year or next. We've got the war in Ukraine. We've got interest rates going up globally. You mentioned the slowdown in China. We just saw the services sector contract in September for the first time in four months. So it just seems that it's not going to take much to push it over the edge. What do you see as the odds of the global economy tipping into recession next year? Well, we certainly flag a number of downside risks in our report. Some of them you mentioned, I mean, the fight against inflation could prove more difficult than we expected this point. We could have more energy-priced shocks. Markets could certainly experience a lot of stress. And associated with that in parts of the world, the strength of the dollar is an important factor. So we try to put all of this in an assessment of the risks around our baseline. And what we found out is that there is about a 25% probability that growth in 2023, global growth, could be at about 2%. And 2% is a very low number. We only had that about five times since 1970. And every time we had this, if you look, it's 1973, the oil price shocked 1981 and the fall curve disinflation, the 2008 financial crisis, all of them are sort of they are stuck in our collective memory as times of difficulties. And there's a 10 to 15% chance that actually output growth could be even lower than 1%. Now 1% is an interesting marker because this is at the level at which global output would remain stagnant per capita. And so that would be an economy that is not growing at all globally. Up here, you mentioned the strength of the dollar, a big concern, something we've been watching. I mean, what we're seeing are major economy currencies here, whether that is the yen, the euro, the sterling, see huge swings on the back of the dollar strength, but it's the EMs that get hit even harder, given the dollar's nominated debt. How are you looking at that risk being elevated even further, given that it doesn't look like the dollar is going to pull back anytime soon? Yes, there's been a lot of strength in the dollar. Actually, what's interesting there also to point out is the strength of the dollar has been particularly important against other advanced economies. So the Japanese yen or the euro or the sterling. So more so than against many emerging market economies. In fact, even some emerging market economies, if you look at Brazil or Mexico or Peru, their currencies are appreciated against the US dollars. So it's more against advanced economies and emerging market economies. But in part, this is also because appreciation of the dollar is very painful in emerging market economies. So a number of them had already started tightening monetary policy, raising their policy rates, adjusting course if you want for their own economies and found themselves in a different position compared to, say, the European Central Bank or the Bank of Japan or the Bank of England. But this stress coming from the dollar are really important. They play out through multiple channels. They increase inflation in the rest of the world because a lot of goods are invoiced in dollars. And they also increase financial stress because countries or corporations that have debt in dollars find that it becomes harder to service them. Now, if you want to think about how countries should address that, our recommendation to this point.",https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2iE41vefT4k,41,2022-10-12 16:46:48
3132," corporations that have debt in dollars find that it becomes harder to service them. Now, if you want to think about how countries should address that, our recommendation at this point is that these movements in the dollar are really reflecting fundamental forces that are at play, the fight against inflation, the energy crisis. And so countries should try to sort of let the exchange rate adjust and accommodate because it reflects the sort of underlying change in the economy. Pierre, Olivia Garene-Jas, the IMF's chief economist, really appreciate your time today. And our thanks to Yahoo Finance is Jen Chamburger as well. We have a clean energy, a stark report from the IEA last year outlined the need for concerted efforts to deliver sustainable energy to the developing world. It said annual clean energy investment in these economies needs to increase by more than 7 times if net zero by 2050 is to become a reality. One group working towards this goal is the climate investment funds. One of the world's biggest multilateral funds for climate action and developing nations last week it received a fresh $950 million loan from the U.S. Treasury joining us now for a weekly charging forward segment brought to you by BMW is Daniel Morris, CIF, senior climate change specialist. Good to talk to you today. Let's start with that big injection. It is a loan not necessarily a capital injection, but how do you plan to deploy that capital? Yeah, thanks, Akiko. The loan that we received from the U.S. really helps support our new accelerating coal transition program. It's a program that's been developed over the past couple of years to help some of the key emerging economies that are very reliant on coal accelerate and move away from using that power source and toward more renewable power sources. So within the program there are kind of four major countries that are participating, India, Indonesia, South Africa and the Philippines. And this large loan will help execute projects that are under design now. Right now those countries are putting together investment plans that will lay out how they intend to deploy investments and bring co-finance years into support over the next few years. And that will be a big part of that. Daniel, we're just a few weeks out from COP27 over in Egypt. I'm thinking back to the big pledges that were made on climate financing a year ago. The argument would be that certainly a lot of these governments as well as companies haven't really put their backs up their actions with the pledges they've made. When you look globally where the need is right now, where do you see it? You know, when it comes to tackling a problem like climate change, there are so many needs that it's hard to isolate them.",https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2iE41vefT4k,42,2022-10-12 16:50:57
3133," Yeah. You know, when it comes to tackling a problem like climate change, there are so many needs that it's hard to isolate them. So I think you need to deploy a broad approach. You know, I work in the clean energy and clean tech sector. And we have a lot of resources that we can bear on different things, you know, investments in different types of technologies. That's established technologies like solar and wind and emerging technologies like say energy storage, e-mobility, green hydrogen. That needs a lot. And we're starting to see more and more of that. Of course, we need a lot more if we want to reach the goals that the international community has set out. But we also need to see a lot more investment in adaptation and resilience. A lot of countries, especially lower income countries, those that haven't really contributed much to the climate crisis of feeling the effects in really catastrophic ways. The most tangible example right now is Pakistan, where the flooding in August resulted in over 30 million being displaced. We need to build more climate resilient communities and the international finance community really needs to start to focus on those with a lot of large scale and a lot of power brought to bear to try and protect people from what will continue to be a change in climate. Daniel, really quickly, we've got the World Bank IMF meetings happening over in DC. This comes at a time when we had an op-ed coming out from former Treasury Secretary Larry Summers saying that the World Bank just is not doing enough in terms of financing some of these projects. When you think about the need globally, how much of this falls on the development banks? How much of it is on government? How much of it is on the private sector? How do you look at that breakdown? Yeah, I mean, it's a great question. I think I can talk a little bit about our experience in the climate investment funds. We are a fund that uses six multilateral development banks as our implementing entities. So we work with the World Bank. We work with the International Finance Corporation, the Regional Development Banks. And when you look at our overall portfolio, about a third of our co-finance in comes from the private sector. Another third comes from the MDVs themselves. And then we also have national governments in their bilateral institutions. It really is all hands on deck. I think that public financing really needs to pave the way to support communities that are in danger. OK. And kind of men and bring their power to their. Daniel Morris, climate investment funds, senior climate change specialists. Good to talk to you today. Thank you.",https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2iE41vefT4k,43,2022-10-12 16:55:17
3134," All right, well, Yahoo! Finances, Julie Hyman is live from the Greenwich Economic Forum. Now qué you will, you've had some ETFs that are anti ESG. So kind of how are you thinking about that environment right now? Well, there is a distinction, as you said, between what just capital does and the ESG movement. You know, I've been in that space a long time. And I think, you know, there is a lot of criticism around the ESG, the ESG investing that is valid. You know, any ESG is sort of not really addressed. A lot of issues like standardization, you know, quality of data and meaning and things like that. What just does is we pull the public on what issues matter. We track big publicly traded corporations on how they're doing on those things. And then we bring that to market in the form of investment products, indices, data, media, content, and so on and so forth. So for us, we're really in the business of tracking what are companies actually doing? And then when you pull the public and ask them what they think about this, you know, Americans are actually united, not divided. We see a huge amount of agreement across political lines as well, but by income, by geographic location, et cetera, on companies doing more. And the last thing I'll point out, which is really important, given where we are right now, is that it's good for business. You know, all the just indices have outperformed their benchmarks since inception and live trading. We've got the spread between the top 10% and bottom 10% over the, you know, since January 2018, it's a spread of over 40%. So we think it's good for business. But do companies think it's good for business? And especially do they think it's good for business? I mean, it's easy to say something's good for business and do something when everything's going well, right? It's when times are getting tougher that that's when it's a true test of a new way of looking at your corporate balance sheet, for example, and your spending, et cetera, all of that. So is that sort of holding up and do expect to continue to hold up if we go into a recession? I do. I'll tell you why. I think we saw during COVID, how many companies responded during a complete shock to the system, turned out companies that were leaders on investing in their workforce, for example, were much more resilient during that period of time. We haven't seen a pullback from the companies that we work with. So we engage probably over 500, maybe 600 companies. If anything this year, we've seen an intensification of their engagement with us, working with us on the underlying issues. That's kind of interesting. So no, I think companies that believe that this is good for business are in it for the long haul and probably see it as a way to actually more effectively manage your recession. The other thing I wanted to ask you about is, during this period of time when the workforce has been so tight, right, you have seen this surge in power of the worker. You've seen a surge in unionization. You've seen people sort of saying, I want to be hybrid and getting that. As the job market starts to change and shift and we start to see maybe layoffs pick up, do you think they'll retain that power? Well, I think it's constantly shifting, who wear that power really resides. But it doesn't take away from the fundamental issue of companies that invest.",https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2iE41vefT4k,44,2022-10-12 16:59:48
3135," Who wear that power really resides, but it doesn't take away from the fundamental issue of companies that invest in their workforce, provide great training, good benefits, they have better retention, better productivity. The business rationale is very strong, and company leaders, CEOs and boards that get that, believe that that's part of their competitive advantage. So, I don't think you become a good employer one day, and then a bad employer the next day, depending on how the labor market's moving. I think you, that's part of your business credo, or it's not. But I guess there are more companies sort of making that part of their business credo by necessity over the past couple of years, right? And I just wonder, is that necessity that impetus going to be taken away a little bit? I mean, we'll find out. I think we didn't really see it during COVID, like I said, and the economic shockwave that happened after that. I think companies today are beginning to see human capital as a real source of alpha. We see that in our own research. And so, if you're really trying to protect from the downside, batting down the hatches, you know, you might feel like you've got, you know, more of an ability to control wages, for example, or the amount of money you spend on benefits. But, you know, and maybe short-term, you have to pull some of those levers. But for the most part, I like to think that companies that we've seen so far are who believe that human capital is part of what makes them special will continue with that. Here's hoping. Here's hoping. Martin, it's good to see you in person, especially Martin Whitaker of Just Capital. Thank you. In this episode of Influencers, Dice Founder and CEO Phil Hutchin, along with Tony Fidel, Dice Board Member, Ness Founder, and inventor of the iPod. Humans need to be around other people. I mean, it's one of the things that make us, like, human and seeing it like an amazing performer. It's one of the things that you remember for the rest of your life. There's always unintended consequences in everything, and I, you know, technology's neutral. It's what we choose to do with and how we regulate and what we socially accept. I think we got a lot of fish to fry, and we are frying ourselves. So I think we need to spend more time on fixing the climate, and we need to worry about getting into the metaverse. Hello, everyone, and welcome to Influencers. I'm Andy Surwer. And welcome to our guest Phil Hutchin, the founder and CEO of Dice. Also, Tony Fidel, a board member of Dice, Tony, as you may know, former Apple executive iPod and inventor iPhone Co-Inventer, also Ness Founder, and a principal at future shape, which is an investment and advisory firm work within engineers and scientists, developing deep, well, foundational deep technology, I should say, got all that. Okay, we want to talk about Dice and Phil. Why don't you start us off by telling us what Dice is all about and what you guys are doing. Yeah, no problem. And I see you, Andy. Well, first of all, Andy, have you ever bought a ticket? Yes, I have. And how was that? Not so good, Phil. And so I think that every time I kind of asked someone over the board of ticket, they'd never come back to me and with like this, like, oh my God, it was amazing. It was always like, I bought a ticket. I thought it was one price, and it was another price, or I couldn't buy a ticket and was thousands of dollars, or whatever it was, or you know, I'd missed it. I'd miss it out on the show, whatever it is. And so there's lots of problems around it, you know, the opaque nature of the industry. So Dice is a super simple way to find out what shows are going on. Two taps and you bought the ticket. You know, it's killed, scalping. And if you can't turn up to the show, you tap a button and you go, refund it. It's just making all these things traditionally associated with, you know, going to a live experience. They've gone on, and now it's, it's just very easy. I have a million more follow-up questions that we'll get to them. But Tony, I got to ask you, you joined the board of Dice in September. What made you a believer? And why join it?",https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2iE41vefT4k,45,2022-10-12 17:04:08
3136," Million more follow-up questions will get to them. But Tony, I got to ask you, you joined the board of Dyson September. What made you a believer? And why join at a time when the live music industry is still getting back on its feet with COVID? Very sure, Andy, as well. It's great to see you. So for me, you know, music's in my blood, you know, given my past and I'm from Detroit, right? So when I was in Detroit, exactly, you know, ticket master first came out and it was like a revolution. I could go walk down the local store and get a printed ticket. You'd have to go to the box office. And so that was an incredible innovation for me. But since that part, they haven't innovated a lot. It's still like, okay, what can we do to extract more money from the fans? Really is what it is. And it hasn't been about more convenience, about more access, making it easy. You know, you can say what you want about airline ticketing or other travel ticketing. At least you can exchange tickets, upgrade, then change the dates. I'm going to say, you don't have any of those conveniences at all in the ticketing, in the entertainment ticketing world or sports ticketing world. Well, that's what DICE is trying to solve. And because I'm such a music fanatic and have been suffering with these six for years, I met Phil and I didn't just get involved with DICE this year. I've been involved with Phil and DICE. I don't know, five, six years now. So this was like literally when they were like 10, 12, 15 people. So we've been working together with them and just been because of the experience that they really want to bring. Fans first, it's all about the fans. Even the artists, the venues, everyone understands that. More fans and especially today when bands are not making any money except for merchandise and for entertainment events. Other than that, they're not making any money on streaming. We see that unless you're the top 100 artists, they don't make any money. So where are they going to make their money? And how are they going to make sure the fan has a great experience? That's what DICE is all about. Phil, I got to ask you about the competitive set. I mean, Tony mentioned ticket master. They're still around, stub hub, event bright. What sets you guys to part from those companies? And how are you going to build your brand? Right. So I think I kind of touched on it. Like our any customers, the fans. And that was something that we established on day ones. Everything that we built is for that fine experience. When we're building things with partners, or venues, or artists, or anything else, we always ask the question, is it good for the fan? And I think that the second thing is that DICE is just software. So if you're looking at the live nation, they do huge productions, they do all these things. You're a ticket master as part of it. We're just using software to bring fans and artists closer together, like helping them decide which cities they are, and how much they should be charging. All these things to make it super efficient. And I think that the third is that we're able to scale much quicker around the globe. So maybe we started off in London, but now we're in the US, in France, Spain, Italy, and India, Australia, moving into Southeast Asia. So it's like, it's kind of there's a global network. In fact, that happens as well, because you're giving that data to artists to help them plan global strategies themselves. So it's just really, when we're talking about empowering artists, it's like helping them control the cash that they own, the cash they can pay people and do things, instead of waiting for someone to pay them. How do you mitigate against scalpers? You mentioned that. Can you drill down a little bit more there? Yeah, cool. So this is, I mean, it's like things where in hindsight, it's like so simple, but there's nothing to sell. Can you buy a ticket on DICE? There's no ticket. And so there's nothing. There's nothing to screenshot. There's nothing to pass on to somebody else or anything else. Just moments before the show, there's like an animated QR code that goes around, which is there. But it's a very elegant, simple solution, but it's a way that if you've got nothing to sell, then it's impossible for scalpers to put on any platform, because they don't have anything. And how much of the business bills rely on upon the return of live music to pre-pandemic levels? And what is your prediction about when that'll happen? So we've spent 18 months or, you know, we're going to take. And like sort of stuck in our homes, we've been in Tali Digital and...",https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2iE41vefT4k,46,2022-10-12 17:08:34
3137," So your prediction about when that'll happen? So we've spent 18 months or give a take. And like sort of stuck in our homes been entirely digital. And you're thinking about the one of the things that I didn't appreciate at the beginning of Dyson kind of really kicked in sort of just before the pandemic. Because that we saw some data on terms of loneliness for people aged between 17 and 21. And a third of them expressed that they had intense periods of loneliness, even before the pandemic. You put the pandemic on everyone kind of living digitally. The return to live since summer, it's been insane. I mean, every record has been broken at Dyson in the last five months. When we're looking at the data, still now, shows are completely packed, like the venues are packed, everything else. You're in the newspapers that people have become hesitant about stuff, and then you go to live concerts and they're absolutely full. And I think it's kind of going back into what I was talking about with learners, that humans need to be around other people. I mean, it's one of the things that make us like human and seeing like an amazing performer. And it's one of the things that you remember for the rest of your life. So you know, live experiences, I think that people are actually appreciating them even more as a result of the pandemic.",https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2iE41vefT4k,47,2022-10-12 17:13:34
3138," I feel like I've been giving Tony a brief about musical preferences. I'm going to pitch you a little bit. Like I don't know if it's a DL or Coldplay. You know, I'm doing the UK thing with you. So do you work with the artists or do you work with the venues? So in other words, here in New York City, MSG, Madison Square Garden, are you selling tickets for them or are you selling tickets for Adele? So we do for both, but the focus is largely on venues because many artists play venues. But we have an artist development team and that's part of the idea of the global network because that DICE has venues all around the world and then artists want to play those venues. And we help them kind of connect them with those venues by the agents of the book or whatever else. And then part of that is, so I've got an example. So as an artist in London, pulled by the Internet. They started off with us from the very first show, 200 people and made the deal with them like called, sell exclusively through DICE, let's kind of build up this live story. And then from that, you know, you're not allowed to spend any money on social media advertising, you've got to trust it to your audience, but get the story right. Now they can sell 50,000 tickets in London and it's kind of like taking them at each of those steps all the way through. And throughout the whole time, Bicep understood their audience, they knew what they wanted where they wanted to play, they had control over, you know, their live strategy. And this is what we're doing at scale now. Right. And so do you cover all the venues in the world or do you have to, are there some venues that are not a part of your ecosystem yet? Yeah. So we wish we had, we have all the best ones, most of the best ones. So there's some holdouts. There's other people who have the ticketing rights for those venues. But we have, there's 3,600 venues sort of around the world, which is increasing day by day. And we also work largely in major cities. So the, you know, in New York, over a million people used DICE last month. And so it's quite a big spread of venues in New York. And for that, it's the same in Paris and Barcelona, all these things, because there's lots of events happening there. So the discovery engine is really kicking off. And our thing is that if you want to see a show once a month, and let's get you to show once a week, how to reduce the friction for you to actually get there. So, you know, our competition is like people stay in the home, which and Netflix is like, well, how do we make it as easy and compelling to kind of get out and see something in books? I don't think anyone's been to a great show and said, well, not doing that again. So it's the exact opposite. Tony, while I have a year, I got to ask you a few questions about Apple and the iPhone, Silicon Valley. So you were on the cutting edge and designing the iPhone, but it's been around for a while. What do you think is kind of the next big thing in terms of consumer tech? Thoughts on the metaverse? Those are two big questions happening right now. Well, the big things on the horizon for consumer electronics, you know, we're hearing more about, you know, augmented reality of these kinds of things. We're hearing about the metaverse, you know, frankly, I think we got a lot of fish to fry, and we are frying ourselves. So I think we need to spend more time on fixing the climate than we need to worry about getting into the metaverse. So let's make sure we have an environment to live in before we find another environment that, you know, keeps us in like refrigerated chambers and, you know, so that we can breathe and eat. So that's how I feel about the metaverse, you know, but on consumer electronics, I think, you know, a lot of this stuff, people think that this is going to be the next big thing, like augmented reality. I think it will be for certain very niche verticals, but not necessarily like the consumer thing that you need because, you know, we saw this before, you got to need the technology, and then you have to understand that the consumers want it, right? And they want to live in that. It live with these things on it. And it's social acceptance. It's not just you.",https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2iE41vefT4k,48,2022-10-12 17:17:06
3139," And they want to live in that. It live with these things on it. And it's social acceptance. Not just you accepting it, but the people around you accepting it. And that I've learned all the time is the technology might be right. But it's the social timing right. Is there a social acceptance? And are you truly delivering a pain killer because there's a clear need? There's a clear pain. The iPhone solved the need, right? It was on the go internet email media, these kinds of things. We don't see the need yet for the metaverse. And then to have the metaverse wherever you go on you, we already tried that with Google Glass. I think it's going to take a little while. Yeah. And speaking of Google, you invented, helped create the iPhone, the iPod Nest, which was bought by Google. And these products are networked now in a huge way. What does your take on both the upside and the downside of this massive amount of networking that some people say leads to dystopian possibilities, but also tremendous upside? Well, look, there's always unintended consequences in everything. And I, you know, technology's neutral. It's what we choose to do with it and how we regulate and what we socially accept. So we have to do things that are promote social bonding, like what Bill's doing with dice, right? Not letting the ticket bots in there, not letting the scalpers in there, doing all the things necessary. And that's what I love what Bill and Dice is doing is they're trying to bring all the best things to connect the artists to the fans, right? And getting rid of all of those middlemen who are just stealing along the way. So that's what we want to do. And I so I love the network. It can have better shows, have the artists make more things for their fans so that the fans have a better and better experience. And maybe through that, we can create even more social movements to fix some more of these problems. But it's about bringing people together and not about a network of intermediaries stealing along the way. Or just one more way back machine question. OK. Really OK. And that's you work with Steve Jobs. Apple built a music business when you were there. What did you learn from Steve? And what do you think he'd be thinking about the world today and the technology that we're using? Well, I think for me, what it was all about in the music story and the iPod, it was always about what do the customers really want? What is going to give them that social or next to me, that emotional experience that they crave, that they want, and a rational part of that, making it simple and all those other things? And that's kind of, that's like dice. So when you see something like this, you're like, wow. I think that if Steve was here today, he would go, we need to get artists more money. I think if he looked at the streaming services out there, I know how much he loved musicians, bands, and wanted to support them. I remember way back when he was looking and buying certain media companies, that kind of stuff, because he really wanted to revolutionize that. And so as far as I'm concerned, if he woke up today and saw the streaming services the way they are today and where the artists are not getting fairly paid, he would fix that. Absolutely. I remember too many infill when he came by and demoed the iPad at timing when I worked there and he played music and he played friend of the devil. And I said, oh, the grateful dead and he goes, I love the grateful dead. You can see he really meant it, right? Yeah, oh yeah. Really passionate about that.",https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2iE41vefT4k,49,2022-10-12 17:21:30
3140," you you you you You come from a musical background and music industry background i should say but jeez What made you decide to get in a ticketing? Yeah i mean, i wasn't tech before going into the music and I've not knowing anything about the music industry so very naive but it's very lucky in the music industry were getting bigger and bigger. And actually didn't care about ticketing. Didn't understand it because you spend so much time working with the artist and making an amazing album to make an amazing artwork, looking at their life. So, and didn't think about the ticketing until the artist got bigger in North America. And that was when it suddenly was like, hang on a minute, we did a deal for 40 bucks. And now the tick at 65, where's this 25 going? It sold out and it's been sold for hundreds of thousands of dollars and all the fans are angry at the artist. Like, why is anyone fixing this? And so then I went back into sort of all world new world together and just analyzed all the ticket companies and tried them all out. Didn't want to just try and deceive. There was a solution and that was the thing well, if no one else is going to fix it, I guess that we have to do it. So I'm kind of just touching on to the last question as well. I think that's, you know, take a lot of inspiration from what Tony created. You know, really thinking about the small things, you know, the experience when someone sees it, small little animations within the app, the ticket, the imagery, you're talking about brand before like people wear dice t-shirts and have the bags and everything else like all these things, like things which we really care about, because you know, you need to make a revolution and all this stuff like pays off because eventually, because of all these things being put together, artists make more money in the right way. I didn't really ask you about the business model or your P&L, how are you doing? How's the company doing? So can you dive into that a little bit quickly? Sure, as I mentioned before, it was the, you know, we, you know, the pandemic and coming out of it was like, it was a shock. I mean, we went from no one going out to everyone going out. And, you know, from zero people in New York, like sort of going out to, you know, a million people going out.",https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2iE41vefT4k,50,2022-10-12 17:25:27
3141," went from no one going out to everyone going out. And from zero people in New York, like sort of going out to a million people going out. So we have a, you know, it's over a million in New York in the last month, a million in London, half a million Paris, like all these people sort of coming together. How we make money is that we charge the venues or the artists for using dice as their partner to sell the tickets. So it's like, we're very pro privacy. And so the, you know, again, just protecting the fans from this, but also everyone knows like how we make money, make money from selling the ticket. There's no advertising, nothing else. That's that's that's on there. And in terms of the, you know, the volume is like, it's, it's accelerating. It's turning out like every week. Right? Let me be clear. We're right. We're happily writing checks and we're backing these guys. And even in the darkest of times, we see, we see the light and we see the growth and we see the fans and they're coming back, right? It's sticky. People love it. They're telling their friends about it. We do very little advertising. I meet a ton of people go, I go, yeah, I'm in the investor in dice. It's like, oh, I'm a user. Like there's so many people. If you actually ask people in the regions where we operate, there's a lot of people using it. We just don't sit there and market it. And, you know, it's self-market because the fans love it. And so that's why we keep investing because we know this is the future and it already is here today. Word of mouth seems to be working. So are you guys venture back, build IPO in the future, perhaps? Yeah. So yeah, we venture back and and public listing in the future. Yeah. Great. And Tony, how did you guys meet? So interestingly enough, I had friends in London and they said, oh, you have to meet Phil. You guys would get along, you love music. He's doing something really cool. And Phil and I just were at a hotel, I think it was a ham yard. And we just had a drink and we just started talking. And we talked all about music. And then we started talking about books and started sharing titles and just getting into, you know, psychology of like a fan and what does it mean? And why do we love shows? And really just hit it off. And it was just there was like, okay, that's it. And Dice was tiny. It was just a vision. And so it was really about a team and a mission. And you know, and Phil as an entrepreneur and visionary. And Phil, where do you see the company five years, 10 years from now? I mean, doesn't it have to become part of one of the, well, they used to call it fangs. I guess they're mangs now. You know, part of an ecosystem. Everything's got to be part of an ecosystem. Or can it be a standalone? Do you think going to be a standalone? I think that live entertainment, you know, how people look at the, the, the, the, the market right now. I think it's, I think it's undercooked. I think that it's huge. I think that you've, you know, if you've got 90% of the population of the world liking music, maybe half the population loving music and 30% people love music so much that they pay to go see it. And that's a massive market. And I think that, you know, what we're seeing is growing this around the world. I mean, like for example, just starting off in India, that market could be as big as the US within 10 years. Right. I love the Pam thing. You know, that is a truly small set. People who hate music. I hate music. Right. I'm sorry about that. That's a pretty small group of people. Right? It's pretty cool. It was the same time for the iPod. It was the same time for the iPod. Right. Yeah, that's not right. That's about right. And final couple of last questions here. Phil, what do you think that you want to be your legacy? Wow. Absolutely. I was thinking about that one. OK. You know what? It's the idea. One of the things I love the most, yeah, is the idea that we're in Mumbai and there's a scene happening in Mumbai. And there's this new music that's happening in Mumbai. And through the connections of DICE, that artist goes straight into the US and Asia and through Europe and blows up. And we do that time, time again. That the idea of bringing culture sort of around the world, that would be awesome.",https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2iE41vefT4k,51,2022-10-12 17:30:21
3142," Europe and blows up and we do that time time again. The idea of bringing culture around the world, that would be awesome. Tony, same question over to you. You've got all of these things you've accomplished, working here with DICE and I'm sure you got some all kinds of other things percolating your brain. What do you hope to accomplish over the following years? For me, it's really about mentoring and investing my time with the entrepreneurs who are truly changing the world for the better, whether that's environmentally, socially, or for health. Those are the three big things and DICE is doing that for the social experience all around the world. It's amazing and that's what I hope. Phil is able to fulfill and bring this mission and I think he's well along the way to deliver it. Well, it'd be great to watch the company grow as we hope we emerge from COVID and live comes back and people get interested in your business. So I want to thank Phil Hutchins founder and CEO of DICE and Tony Phil Board Member there and entrepreneur and executive extraordinaire. Thank you guys very much for your time. Thank you so much, Andy. Thanks, Andy. Great to see you. You've been watching influencers. I'm Andy Sirwork. We'll see you next time. Welcome back. I'm Brian Sousie here with Julie Hyman and Brad Smith. We're seeing green on the screen today across the major indices. That's even as President Biden warned about a potential mild recession. Here's what we're watching for you at this moment. A caffeinated quarter, PepsiCo's checker page is read hot on Yow Finance this morning as the company blew away profit estimates, excuse me, and raised guidance. PepsiCo's CFL Hugh Johnson told us moments ago demand continues to be very strong and they are pushing through more price increases. More big calls. Earning the season officially ticked off today with PepsiCo's results. So, I'll have a look at a few pre-earnings calls by analysts on Apple and Norwegian cruise line. In the state of freelance workers, we'll talk to the CO5er on the outlook for the gig economy as economic growth slows. Brad, over to you at the Wi-Fi interactive. Can we get out? I was at the Yow Finance interactive. Was the Wi-Fi, whatever it is, there you are, Brad. There we are. All right. Taking a look at the dash-shones industrial average. Right now, we are holding onto some slight gains on the day by about half a percent right now for the average up by about 143 points. You've also got the NASDAQ composite tech heavy average in the green. It's up 3.10 per percent, 31 minutes into today's trading session, and the S&P 500. You're also seeing some green on the screen there. That's up a little more than 3.10 per percent. Taking a look at as well. Some of the activity that we're seeing more broadly here. Let me navigate us over to some of the NASDAQ 100 names that we've been continuing to track throughout the day. It looks like broadly you've got more advances than declines here. An interesting move here that we're seeing, especially in some of the retail names, you've got a sharp move higher in Louis Lemon on the day. We've been tracking that stock throughout the week, given some of the new bullish sentiment that's entered into the market, talking about Louis Lemon as well as the annexation to the Gen Z brand affinity with it. So we'll continue to watch Louis as we move forward throughout the rest of today's session. That's up by about 2 percent. Another big gainer here as well that we've got on the day. Ticker symbol, MRN, they will dive into that one in just a little bit. So stick around for that. Let's shift our broader market conversation after some data from the producer price index and with inflation showing. No relief. Our next guest says that a recession may be coming for more. Let's welcome in. The Chief Economist at EY Parthenon. Greg Dacco. Greg, great to have you here with us this morning. First and foremost, if we were to see that recession that perhaps many of the economists, if they are right, that it might be slight versus the more longer or protracted one, where do you fall within that camp? Well, I think we're certainly seeing the initial signs of a significant slowdown in terms of global activity. We are seeing an environment in which.",https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2iE41vefT4k,52,2022-10-12 17:34:37
3143," Well, I think we're certainly seeing the initial signs of a significant slowdown in terms of global activity. We are seeing an environment in which European growth is slowing quite dramatically, in which growth across emerging markets is also slowing, and in which the U.S. economy is also starting to see initial signs of a slowdown. We're not hearing from the executives we speak to desire to retrench in terms of capex, in terms of hiring plans here in the U.S., but I am increasingly concerned that the global waves of uncertainty and the financial market stress that we're seeing globally will eventually affect the U.S. and lead us into a more profound recession. More profound recession, Greg. What does that look like in terms of GDP? Well, we are in an environment where our baseline forecast is for a mild contraction in GDP growth next year that would come on the back of growth around 1.5% this year. So that would be a mild recession. I think that if we look at household finances and corporate finances today, they are still rather healthy, so that would pretend to a more mild type of recession. But if the global waves of uncertainty, if the massive slowdown that we're expecting in Europe in emerging markets is exacerbating this slowdown in the U.S., then you could be in for a global recession in which we could see a more pronounced contraction in GDP, maybe on the order of 1% in the U.S. Greg, it's hard to know what to think right now, right? Because we are hearing a lot of prominent voices in markets and economics who are getting more pessimistic, right? This mild recession was sort of the base case for a while now, and now I feel like it's tilting more negative than that, and that there are risks coming on the periphery that then could cause more contagion. How are you weighing all of this right now? How do you figure out how concerned to be? Well, you're certainly right to highlight that we are navigating a world of uncertainty, and it's extremely difficult for business leaders to navigate this world of uncertainty where inflation remains a key constraint where the labor market is extremely tight, where the cost of capital is surging, and where there's massive uncertainty as to the geopolitical landscape. So it's a highly uncertain macroeconomic environment where it's very important to look not just at one base case, but really at scenarios around that base case. And I think you're right, risks are tilted to the downside. The baseline scenario is currently a mild recession. The upside is a soft landing of the global economy and of the U.S. economy by the Fed. The downside scenario could have some severe ramifications. If you have an excessive and disorderly tightening of financial conditions, that can have knock-on effects on to certain streams of the financial sector as we're seeing in the UK with pension funds. So there are a lot of unknowns out there, and I think that makes it very difficult to forecast with accuracy. So there is some discomfort in the fact that the baseline view is a recession, but we have to be acknowledged. We have to acknowledge the downside risks to global economic activity. Greg, at what point do you believe some of the Fed's activity will finally start to fully show up in the data and yield some of the results or at least the parameters that they're looking for in order to either pause or pivot? Well, I think they're going to be very attentive to what happens on the global financial conditions front. What was at the Naval Annual Conference over the first part of this week and Vice Chair Brainer highlighted, again, this concern about what's happening globally in terms of global financial conditions in terms of overall economic activity globally. And she highlighted the fact that we are in an environment where most central banks are tightening aggressively. And the fact that each of these central banks is tightening that aggressively has a greater effect than the sum of the individual tightening processes would normally have. And that is something that the Fed is going to be paying very close attention to as we move into 2023 because, again, the Fed leading the way has implications in terms of the dollar strengthening quite rapidly, exporting inflation into emerging markets, increasing the burden of debt for a lot of these emerging markets. And that's a concerning backdrop when it comes to the global economic environment. We know the U.S. is not immune to these global waves of uncertainty. No, it is not. Queues, no. Fuck off.",https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2iE41vefT4k,53,2022-10-12 17:38:56
3144," and backdrop when it comes to the global economic environment. We know the U.S. is not immune to these global waves of uncertainty. No, it is not. Greg Daco, EY, Parthenon, Chief Economist, always good to see you. We'll talk to you soon. All right, before we head to break, we are keeping a close eye on shares of McDonald's on some negative comments from City Analyst John Tower. Head of the company's October 27th earnings report. Tower site's foreign exchange headwinds, energy cost inflation, weakening store traffic data as key risk to McDonald's earnings days as tower. Investors have been anchored to the defensiveness of the U.S. business to spike these risks. And we believe peak valuation means a little room for shares to absorb a negative estimate of visions much less potential slowdown in the U.S. business. Coming out Amazon workers in California looking to unionize, Julie's got the details on that. Plus, more top headlines next. Let's get down to business now. Look at some of the other headlines that we are watching. Amazon potentially facing yet another front in ongoing unionization battles as workers at a California warehouse of petition the National Labor Relations Board to form a union. That moved the first step towards a formal vote and could see the warehouses 800 workers join the Amazon Labor Union. Petition comes as part of a way of unionization efforts hitting companies around the nation, including Starbucks, Chipotle, Apple. They're not used to unionization moves in their workhorse. This would be the first Amazon move by workers in California specifically.

3145," in California specifically. Canadian companies, Camaco and Brookfield Renewable partners, both moving this morning after agreeing to buy Westinghouse Electric, which still services half of the world's nuclear power reactors. Now the deal will see Brookfield Business Partners sell Westinghouse to the two companies, both the buyer, Brookfield Renewable and seller, Brookfield Business are part of the umbrella under Brookfield Asset Management and the deal comes as the world takes a renewed look at nuclear power following Russia's energy shut off to Europe and climate change problems grow. And the smash hit at NASA, the agency reporting it has successfully altered the path of the asteroid, dimorphous. After ramming its dark probe into it, scientists have confirmed dimorphous. Now orbits its parent asteroid in a tighter orbit that's now 32 minutes faster than before. The dark probe launched last year, sent back this video just two weeks ago before impact and it marks the first time humanity has ever altered the course of any celestial body. It also gives us one potential option for averting a planet ending catastrophe. Good to have that option. Indeed it is. All right, it's time for our calls of the day guys. I'm out of the shoot here with what is a I would call a blunt take on Apple head of their earnings on October 27th. Really interesting note by city analyst Jim Suvor, you see Apple shares up there slightly here in the early going. The headline of this report absolutely got me right at my alley. I love these, some of these, these crazier headlines and this one got me. He said, we are not scared of Apple stock despite Halloween and investor fears. So you know that Apple stock very Google SEO friendly nonetheless. He's listening or he's saying that iPhone demand continues to be very strong. They're selling more higher price products. That is good. Sticky services sales. That is good. Also suggesting more of an Apple car push in 2025. So this is more of a longer term bullish take by Suvor at city. I think acknowledges some concerns here going into the quarter. Some FX challenges. Maybe some slow down China but by and large. Just trying to I think bring a sense of hey guys this is Apple. They're going to get past any rough patch brought on by the global economy. Yeah, I think one thing that we do have to note within this as well is that for the iPhone the demand is typically going to always be there. It's just a matter of where they are in the cycle. Especially because so many people are able to pay off their phones through another type of necessity which is your telecommunications which is your phone carrier. And so that is perhaps one of the constants. It's just a matter of how much people are willing to take on a larger contract or go after a more expensive phone. If their telephone provider or their service provider is able to offer them a better deal. Now it's a larger question of course to right now of where in even the little luxuries we were talking about with Pepsi. Where that also kind of dovetails on over into the technology landscape as well in the consumer tech front. Do consumers look at some of the little luxuries and the wearables and say hey that's a little luxury or is my service a little luxury that I can maintain. And for Apple they've been continuing to build out that services business can be potentially an 80 billion dollar run rate business either by the end of this year or early next year. And so that's something they continue to watch going forward in the services and the wearables division for Apple. Yeah even if it might see some rockiness in the short term from some of those production cuts that we've talked about. Absolutely. Also another call of the one that I'm tracking here. Norwegian Cruise Line ticker symbol NClH. It's smoother sailing for new region after an upgrade to buy at UBS. The analyst also setting a $15 price target on the stock here and particularly they are kind of adjusting all cruise line models. It's not just Norwegian. It's Royal Caribbean Caribbean Caribbean anyway. Carnival Cruise Line that's pronounced the same way. They're adjusting it for all cruise line models for slightly higher expenses due to inflation and essentially here when you think about the broader cruise sector of course there's a lot of money that we've talked about goes out the door when it's a marketing type of expense that they have to look at just to reengage with so many of the consumers out there or the voyage takers. But then it's also on the other side how much they're actually being able to charge for tickets in this near-term period of time. And that's something that all of the analysts have continued to have to look through the profit margin models at and try to figure out exactly where that's actually going to be netting out for the cruise line operator. Yeah interesting time to see this call because we see fuel prices back on the rise. You have been highlighting it too. We've been talking a lot about weak pricing, we ticket pricing, notably coming out of Cardinal Cruise Line. But we just talked to Norwegians.",https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2iE41vefT4k,55,2022-10-12 17:47:32
3146," Fuel prices back on the rise. You've been highlighting it too. We've been talking a lot about weak pricing, weak ticket pricing, notably coming out of Cardinal Cruise Line. But look, we just talked to Norwegians CFO Mark Kempe last week and he said, man, is strong? We're charging higher prices. If you look at Q3 and our most recent guidance, we had said that our total net revenue per diems are expected to be up in the high single digits. So again, there's inflation is real. It is starting to level off. We are going to see some near term pressure on margins. But we don't believe that this is going to be a long term sustainable margin issue. As we look at and look at our trends and our business over the next year to two years, we see margin improvement significantly. And we believe we can get back to the same margin levels we saw prior to the pandemic. There you go. Really a bullish take-off. I kind of came aboard on a new ship. So despite the economic slowdown, you still have Norwegian and of course, all the cruise lines, they order these ships well in advance, but still delivering it a mighty new beautiful ship called, I think it was the Prima. Right. And I'll just add just very briefly here, as well within this call, they said, they see this as the most preferred name and it's due to relatively greater concentration of domestic passengers, sourced strong pricing given its higher exposure to the luxury segment. And the luxury consumer, whether it's across retail, consumer tech, and then even within the cruise line operators right now, continually being cited as one of the points of strain. All right, let's talk coffee, okay? Dutch Bros, bit of a perk up. I'm watching shares of Dutch Brothers this morning. Dutch Bro, I think it's a technically Dutch Bro. I think it's a Brooklyn palm tree right there. Dutch Bros. Dutch Bro's right. It is up a little bit after JP Morgan Chase upgraded the stock to overweight with a $38 price target. What's interesting here is the stock was up earlier as much as 5%, so it's actually, we've seen that those gains come back a little bit, but the analyst there at JP Morgan saying the sell-up has made it attractive, sites that change permanence over time through differentiated drinks. Some interesting stuff here. 56% of customers under 25 drink, 80% cold beverages, and 60% of sales afternoon. And that's sort of more discretionary, so maybe that's a little bit more vulnerable. Oh, I guess not. Yeah, everybody's complaining about Insomnia. Yeah, think if you're drinking a giant cold brew afternoon, could be also, you're looking at your phone for the two hours before bed. That doesn't help either. But I digress. The point is here is that the analyst at JP Morgan likes Dutch Bros and says that employment and stable gas prices are key to more predictable sales here, but that the company is in decent position here and it has the capital it needs to grow the business. I think I'm gonna, I need to take off a couple days from the office, just visit a Dutch Bros. Maybe to be my vacation. I see all the photos posted on Instagram, on Twitter. People are obsessed with Dutch Bros coffee. It looks beautiful and I think it has more caffeine in some cases depending on what you order than Starbucks. That's where I'm going vacation. I'm gonna go visit a Dutch Bros. Oh, wait, okay, everybody, can we clip this please? Ryan, it's how you just promise, he is going to take out vacation. I suggest it. Thank you, man. That's a promise. I suggest it. I'm gonna go visit Dutch Bros and I wanna report from outside of Dutch Bros with my phone. You're not allowed to log on. It's live view. I'm not gonna do it. While you're on vacation. Fair enough, fair enough, Dutch Bros. How depressing. Unilaterally. So depressing. All right, coming up, possible shakeup for good workers. We're gonna speak with the CEO of Fiverr about that and also a new study that the company's out with next. [♪ music playing Ganze's theme, FC amplify YourruploadsHit.com——The",https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2iE41vefT4k,56,2022-10-12 17:52:16
3147," Here we go! The majority of bosses won employees back in the office full time. The new survey from Fiverr found that 52% of employers want their workers back in person five days a week. But 42% workers say they would consider quitting if that were the case. Fiverr CEO, Micah Kaufman, joined us now. Fiverr by the way, a platform for freelance workers. Micah, it's good to see you. So there's obviously tension here, right? There is this ongoing tension in the market. How do you think it ends up resolving itself? Thanks for having me on the show again. We're definitely seeing a very polarized view between managers and employees. And I think that if there's something very clear is that managers want this to be 2019 again. And employees cannot move back from having the experience of the past two or three years. And wanting to have more flexibility into the work, I think that some of that is going to be resolved, but the fact that those employees are actually going to leave. And I think in order to receive that level of flexibility, a lot of them are actually going to turn into freelancing, which allows them to define the level of flexibility that they are looking for. OK, so that kind of answers or begins to answer my next question at least, which is where would they go if they did leave? There are still for a lot of the companies that are either in a hybrid or purely virtual reality for their workplace and collaboration. There's still some of the hiring freezes that are in place. Some places looking at cutting and trimming their staff. So where would the opportunities be to still retain that virtual lifestyle, even if going to or looking for other employment opportunities? That's correct. I think that a lot of companies, those who are freezing or rethinking the way they want to employ talent, are really making a shift between fixed expenses and variable expenses. OK.",https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2iE41vefT4k,57,2022-10-12 17:56:36
3148," companies, those who are freezing or rethinking the way they want to employ talent are really making a shift between fixed expenses and variable expenses. And when you think about variable expenses, a lot of it is being answered by free answers. So a lot of the talent that are going to continue looking for that level of flexibility are going to turn into freelancing and we're seeing very high levels of talent coming to us to five or in similar platforms to look for that level flexibility. So Micah, does that mean a recession would mean just a hiring boom for freelancers? I think that at some point yes because again I think that more and more companies are thinking about the shift between fixed and variable expenses. So obviously that is going to fuel. If you go back to the wake of the previous recession right around 2009, we've saw a boom in freelancing. We saw a boom in new business formation and a lot of these businesses cannot actually afford full-time employees. So they turn into platforms such as Fiverr to find this talent. Micah, this evening we've got now this proposal, although it's sort of vague on the part of the Biden administration to reclassify workers, which there's some thinking that it might eventually make some workers who are classified as freelance before us to come on the books full-time. Any thoughts on that or the likelihood of that happening and the effect that that could have on your business? Yeah, I think that with the fact that freelancing is becoming a huge force in the workplace, statistics show that by the end of this decade by 2030, 50% of talent is going to be engaging in freelancing in some form or the other. Policy makers are trying to figure out what to do with this huge cohort. And I think that in this space we need to make a distinction between skilled and unskilled labor. So if you look at Fiverr as an example, on Fiverr, freelancers have total freedom regarding their work, what they offer when they offer it and from where. So that level of freedom is something that is highly sought for, but it also comes with a price. I mean, you can't lead a totally free lifestyle and then expect to be considered to be full-time employee. In other aspects of gig economy, maybe the situation is slightly different because they have less freedom on what they offer and how much they charge for it. This has been in the making for quite a long time and we're actually working close with policymakers to figure out how the level of how we can level the plain field for freelancers in aspects such as access to affordable medical insurance. But that's it, as I said, if you want to lead the lifestyle that allows you total freedom, you can't also expect to be considered as a full-time employee when you're not. Michael, just while we have you, over the past recessions where the gig economy roles have been available, we've seen this flow into some of the roles for freelancers or even just workers who are looking to kind of take their own employment under their own control. For your business at Fiverr, given some of the investments that you've made into the business to try and unlock these larger projects, more engagement, what from the Fiverr perspective would you be kind of looking towards to really navigate a recession as well yourself as a business? Yeah, so I think that a lot of businesses we've talked about fixed versus variable expenses, I think that a lot of businesses are actually focusing on identifying their core competencies and hiring full-time around those core competencies and looking for the more peripheral areas of expertise and turning into freelancers around those those types of expertise, not could be if your core is technology, maybe something that is nothing your core is going to be marketing or design in which cases that they start to think about how to integrate freelancers into their workflows. And this is why we've seen the appearance of the Chief Freelancer Officer, which is a new role within companies within HR that thinks about how to",https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2iE41vefT4k,58,2022-10-12 18:00:23
3149," We've seen the appearance of the Chief Freelancer Officer, which is a new role within companies, within HR, that thinks about how to integrate that level of talent into organizations. We're seeing that rising throughout the past few years, and this is accelerating right now. Micah, good to see you. Thanks for being here. Micah Kaufman, who is five or CEO, appreciate it. Thank you. Now, let's get your quick trending ticker. We're sharing some Moderna. Merc shares are watching him. That's after Moderna announced that Merc has exercised an option to jointly develop and potentially sell an mRNA-based cancer vaccine. Merc is going to pay $250 million to exercise the option. That vaccine is being tested. Data on it expected in the fourth quarter of this year. But during a share, surging 10% on that news. A new burn lift shares got hammered yesterday on a potential change to how give workers a classified. We just mentioned it. Stocks are coming back today. Should they be? We'll discuss that next. Next, I will start. The sheriff's Ouberan lift and door dash are back on the rise today after getting slammed on Tuesday. After the Biden administration proposed to change the classification of gig workers that could revise them from independent contractors to employees. Fox Advisors founder and CEO Stephen Fox joins us now for some analysis on this. Stephen, has this now been priced in any potential change that may come in the first half of next year? Is it now fully priced into these stocks? You know, actually I think it's more than priced into this stock. I think regulatory concerns have been sort of the hand-ranging events since these companies went public. And what we've seen is that the companies have been able to manage through these events and actually continue to improve their business model. So I think it's being overdone at this point. Liftus said nothing is immediately going to change about its business model. Just yeah, of course that's what the company would say. Given the fact that yeah, there's still a lot of discussion that has to take place in the near term in order to see any type of reclassification go forward. But what extent should customers at the end of the day, if this does move forward, expect their prices, their fares to also have to be adjusted? Yeah, that's a great point because all the companies obviously could still raise prices to offset any higher costs. I think it's also important to keep in mind that what happens at the federal level is independent of what.",https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2iE41vefT4k,59,2022-10-12 18:05:37
3150," All the companies obviously could still raise prices to offset any higher costs. I think it's also important to keep in mind that what happens at the federal level is independent of what happens at the state level. So companies have been in discussions with various states. I think the most encouraging thing you saw without out of the state of Washington this year, which signed into law and independent contractor plus agreement, which basically allows for some benefits. This IC plus gives the driver's flexibility plus benefits. The companies are working to pass those costs through the customers and also reducing other costs tied to other pieces of the business to offset some higher costs as well. Stephen, as we potentially go into a recession, what effect will that have on the sort of driver service dynamic? In other words, could there potentially be more people who are available to be drivers? Unfortunately, if they're a layoffs or, you know, just do a burn lift get away with paying them less? Like, how is what are going to be all those knock on effects? Yeah, I don't think Uber and Lyft get away with paying them less, especially in this political environment. And I don't think they're looking to pay them less. I think if you go back and look what the companies have done. Forget about what they've said, but what they've done for their drivers, specifically over the last couple years, they've worked to make their expenses come down through various methods. And they've also worked to make their time on the network much more efficient. Obviously, if they're sitting around waiting for a ride, it's not as efficient. So it's really important to step back and say, OK, in a, in a weaker economy, how dependent has the consumer become on these rides share opportunities, whether to drive or also to ride. And so, you know, the real market is still the enterprise. So large companies with multiple pockets of spending on transportation and food delivery as a consolidate those things. Those are real profitable opportunities for lift and Uber that they can also translate into their drivers to make money. And so, you know, a lot of focus on driver utilization to make it more incentivized in order for drivers to actually want to be on the platform and be able to take advantage of more rides. But then there's also the thought of if this goes through and that changes the classification, does that actually make it more intriguing for new drivers to sign up and increase the supply side of this broader kind of supply demand equation that ultimately has a major kind of a major delta on prices here for consumers. Yeah, so one of the interesting things that I think Wall Street doesn't appreciate enough is that when you talk about these networks, the companies aren't playing checkers. It's more like three dimensional chess. So when you look at supply versus demand, like take the UK, for instance, where Uber is now providing benefits to the drivers while giving them flexibility. They're cost of going up, but then other costs have gone down in terms of actual providing, you know, looking at driver incentives, for example, they don't have to provide as many. And so they're attracting probably more drivers now passing on some of the cost of the customers, but competition has followed. So you're getting a little bit of that network benefit, I think. How it plays out in the US is going to be on a region by region basis, but generally speaking, I think the companies have a way to manage through this and continue to march towards evict goggles where they've been set, I get lift a new bird. Fox advisors founder and CEO Stephen Fox. Thanks so much for the time today, Steve. Thank you. A major headcount reduction is reportedly on the horizon for Intel.

3151," to things like servers just as we started to see interest rates rise. And that's impacting its bottom line. And so there could be as many as thousands of these kinds of layoffs. The company also is dealing with those kinds of repeated slowdown that we've seen in the PC market. Gartner had said that the market actually collapsed 19.5% in Q3 2022. So it really doesn't look great for Intel at this point. Other chip companies are dealing with the same issues. But Intel is at this point kind of trying to turn itself around. They said that they're going to build that huge mega complex in Ohio. It's not going to look good for employees if they're getting laid off. It does look like the departments are going to be something along lines of marketing and sales. And the company does have more than 100,000 employees. So it's not as though it's clearing house by any stretch of the imagination, but it could be as many as 10% 20% of employees. Yeah, and obviously this is part of the moves that we've been seeing by many of the chip makers. Thanks, Dan. Appreciate it. Earlier this week, the Board of Directors officially approved XPO logistics plan separation of its freight brokerage business. The company also named a new CFO. I had the chance to speak to the company's current CEO and founder, Brad Jacobs, about the restructuring at the company. I'm here at the Greenwich Economic Forum with Brad Jacobs, the founder and CEO of XPO logistics, although not for much longer. Brad is great to see you in person. And I said not for much longer, of course, because the company is spinning off RXO, which is logistics business. You just announced what that's effective on November 1st, I believe. So talk to me about what's happening now, what the process feels like, and what investors can expect from the two companies. It's very exciting. After 10 months of working really hard with large number of people working long hours, we're this close to the spin. And we'll create two separate companies that will be an inch wide and a mile deep in what they do. And therefore, they'll likely do it much better. So we'll have a pure play less than truck load business. That'll be XPO. And we'll have a pure play non-asset truck brokerage business called RXO, which is best in class truck broker. It's very exciting. And you're not going to be running the day-to-day business any longer. That's correct. Do you have some plans yet for what the next thing, the next Brad Jacobs chapter is going to be yet? Well, I want to try to repeat what I've done before, which is to have companies that over a 10-year period or so create at least 10 times return on the initial capital. And so I'm not a private equity firm in trying to make two or three X, and let's not make any. I go for things that are 20X, 30X, you know, the big ones. So I'm looking for that. I'm looking for the next big thing. And where any hints of what in what industry or where you think the opportunities are, because especially right now, it's tricky time, right? It's the best time just start a business when valuations are low and there's fear out there and there's not a lot of competition because a lot of people are nervous about not being courageous because they're nervous about where the economy is going and so forth. That's when you want to get it. That's when you want to buy. When valuations are reasonable and there's not a lot of competition. But I don't know. I'm going to gainfully employed at CEO for a few more weeks. Sorry to get you to, don't mean to get you to jump ahead too soon. But let's talk a little bit more about the environment. You and I were just talking before now about all of the negativity that we're hearing, right? From Ray Dalio to Jamie Dimon, the IMF cutting, it's GDP forecast. All to the Jones and all of it. Yeah, all of it. I mean, you have a really good figure on the pulse of what's going on in the economy because of moving things around. So what are you seeing? I don't always get it right. I often get it right, but not a hundred percent of the time. My take is we're probably, so when you see all these really great minds, I'll come out and universally say, oh, it's really bad coming up. That's usually historically been the final pre-capitulation phase. So everyone agrees that, oh, it's really bad. And then you have the final plunge. That's the time to buy when everybody says, oh, it's down this. It's going to keep going down more. That's the time to do it. So I'm really having my antennas up for it because I don't think this downturn, which is likely to happen, is going to last for a long time. And there's definitely other two things. There's the economy and there's the market. And the market is usually a couple quarters ahead of the economy. Right. So we could see.",https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2iE41vefT4k,61,2022-10-12 18:17:58
3152," There's two things. There's the economy and there's the market. Yes. And the market is usually a couple quarters ahead of the economy. Right. So we could see. So the capitulation you're talking about is the market in the market. Yes, the economy might lag that. The economy could lag as the straights go up as quantitative tightening gets tighter. You could see a significant slowing in the economy. But the world has become such a small world and so well informed and so many people understand economics now. It didn't during the great financial crisis. I don't think it'll last long. I think there'll be such pressure to, okay, now we reduced inflation. Okay, now let's get some growth going again. I don't expect a long, long downturn. I expect a short, maybe significant downturn. Now, one of the things that was a detail in the latest jobs report made me think of you. And that had to do with trucker jobs, which fell by 11,000 in the month of September. And I'm just curious what that tells us. The number of truckers hired, I should say, fell by 11,000. A metric that we watch very closely, Julie, is for every truck job, truck driver posting that we post, how many people apply for it? That's about 45% just in the last several months. So there's a lot more people coming back into the job market as the economy gets a little tougher. So there's the pendulum is swinging on that. Don't get me wrong. It's still very tough to hire truck drivers. It's a lot less tough than it was even a few months ago. The inventory climbs that we are seeing, by a lot of, not just the retailers, but in other industries as well. How is that affecting your business and the loads of things that you guys are trucking around? Well, the transportation business does better. The industry is a whole, when inventory is a low, not high. There's more restocking and there's more goods being moved. But what you see right now is really interesting. As a result of all the craziness of the pandemic, people got the wrong, they have a lot of inventory, but it's often the wrong inventory. They have too much of this and too little of that. So there's still a lot of activity. So goods are still flowing. Goods are still flowing, but not as much as more. Not as much. But it's an interesting dichotomy. You observe the same thing. I observed today at the Greenwich Economic Forum. It's pretty downbeat. I'm sure you'd die here. People have their warrior face design. When you talk to my echo chamber is a little bit different. My echo chamber is CEOs of large companies, chief supply chain offices, large companies, entrepreneurs of small businesses who need their goods move. And they're not as negative. They're not as positive as they were say a year ago. They're less positive. But they're generally growing. They're not contracting. They're just growing less. All right, I have one final fun question for you. The Tesla semi. How much is that going to change the trucking industry? It depends on the price point. So we're a partner to one of the big OEMs for their electric vehicle semis. And actually, we call them semis. The semi-conductor semis. The semi-conductor semis. And we call them semis. Sorry. No, I'm being the other way around. But the semis are, they're beautiful. And the truck drivers love them. And they're slick and they're well designed. And they accelerate fast and they're safe. And they've all kinds of gizziness in them. But they're really expensive. And so the economics aren't there yet. Now, if the technology advances in the manufacturing process advances such that they become cost-effective, yeah, it can be very transformative. Makes sense. All right, Brad Jacobs of XPO, thank you so much. It was great to see you in person. Really appreciate it. Pleasure to meet you. Thanks. So it was fun there because Brad was sort of an antidote to a lot of the darkness. I mean, he's not saying everything is wonky-dory and fantastic. But part of it is the force of his personality. Part of it is what he's seeing on the ground. He was a little bit of a counterbalance to some of the worst case scenarios that we're hearing out there. You say tomato. I say tomato. Yeah, exactly. That makes sense. It was interesting to what he said, though, about the Tesla semi-truck. It's going to be fascinating when those trucks eventually hit the road because at some point, it sets the stage for driverless semi-trucks in this country. Yes. But as he said, the price has to come down. Absolutely. For it to make sense, which makes sense. Right. Also, a critical time for the business. Given the spin-off that's moving forward and Drew Wilkerson is going to be the new CEO of that spin-off. And he had even in this most recent earnings period talked about how the company has a long track record of growing gross profit even through economic cycles.",https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2iE41vefT4k,62,2022-10-12 18:22:22
3153," You see, you know, of that spin off and he had even in this most recent earnings period talked about how the company has a long track record of growing gross profit even through economic cycles and they're confident right now they're going to continue to do it. I for one can't wait to see what Brad is going to do next. The next thing he's going to tackle. It's tough to see him leave this industry. He is this industry. Yeah. All right, we're keeping our eyes as well on shares of American International Group AIG. Jeffries upgraded the stock to a buy and raised a price target to $64 from $57 on under appreciated our property and casualty insurance momentum ahead of the company's earnings report. Coming up, Muskie Sense from Elon Musk. Oh dear. No, if that would make it in. Now Welcome back everyone. It's time for Cut for Time. Three stories, one minute each. We start with this today. Elon Musk really capitalizing on his last name with a fragrance launch via his infrastructure business, the boring company. Yes, the same company that sold the flame thrower is now bringing you burnt hair for just $100 here. Okay, so $100 new perfume from Elon Musk. I don't know if I'm a buyer on this. We've already talked about how well I'm a big buyer. I'm all I want to be a I want to smell like sweat success and money and maybe that's in this bottle. I'm down. So I'm up for $100 boom done in. I want it. I actually do. I want to try it. I'm a big clone guy. I love clones. This goes back to when I was a child. But joke thing. Do you think it's actually going to smell good? I'm bullish on it. Everything that the boring company is sold has basically been subtype of joke, whether it's short shorts or whether it's flame throwers. But it's more here. The flame thrower at least.",https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2iE41vefT4k,63,2022-10-12 18:26:35
3154," Sean, everything that the boring company is sold has basically been subtype of joke, whether it's short shorts or whether it's flame throwers. So, but it's rare. The flame throw at least worked. I would have to imagine the smells somewhat kind of good. You think it smells, because it's from here. Does it actually smell like burnt hair? I would say Tom Ford smells a little burnt. The pen just wanted to get, and he spent like $300 on it. I mean, you figure he's got to know some of the best scientists in the world. So somebody's got a good chemical equation perhaps out there for the best selling you're not getting this for hobby, Julie. You're not getting this for hobby. Not getting it for hobby. Oh, right. Okay. I, yes. He doesn't need any more of anyone's money, really. Okay, I don't know. All right, from Cologne to Food, another Julie Fave. Kleg's waffle, Kellogg's waffle maker, Ego, is bringing the magic of breakfast to your home bar this winter with its Ego dog lodge. Kellogg, yes, and that's a publicly traded company with a ticker page on YahuFan and says the rum-based liquor is perfect for parents looking to Lego during the holidays. I love me, some Christmas and holiday season EgoG. I'm just confused why this took 20 plus years to get to the market. This is great. I love it. 40 proof. 40 proof. I mean, look, we need more, we need more toasty 40 proof eggnog out there. We're about to get ham. We're about to get ham. Do you say no? No, no. No, no, no. I just, is Kellogg paying us? No. Am I getting any money from Kellogg? If not, then like, I don't need to. Well, thanks. No, I'm just pro eggnog. You already know what I'm making. I like it. Eggnog is good. I've sent you a eggnog on the market already. I'm not sure what makes this eggnog any different. I'm a little bit more leaner than any other eggnog. I mean, this is like a ready to drink cocktail drink. Right. That exists. Does not exist already. Except it's eggnog in eggnog. Like, it's really hard to buy a thing of eggnog and pour some rum in it. I mean, we just taste like waffle. It's already done for you. It's like what Cardi B did with the whip shots for us. Like, we already knew we were like whipped cream. We already knew we like shots. And now we had whip shots. Now we've got, like, nug. That's a long take. What's the next one? Now, let's talk about something else to drink Starbucks. It's taking us for a warrants program to new heights. We're a partnership with Delta Airlines. The coffee restor is going to give app users 150 stars and 500 miles for linking accounts. Double stars and days flying with Delta and one mile per dollar spent. Good, more miles that you can't do anything with fabulous. Sorry. Are you expecting a tone for me to make? I think you can. I feel like a little skeptical of everything. I think we can use these rewards to get that eggo eggnog. So I'm excited about it. No, it doesn't go that way. It goes the other way. So I can't use eggnog. OK. Am I misunderstanding? I understand. Yes. Starbucks points you towards Delta. OK, here's the details. 150 stars, 500 miles when you link those accounts. OK, so you get the double stars on Delta travel days. All right. So if you buy a Starbucks when you're flying on Delta at the airport, you get more stars. And you get one mile per one dollar spent at Starbucks. I have to add a special code and concur. Like, can I use this and concur? I feel like what I need right now is that gift with the guy with the calculations on the board behind him to figure out exactly how this works. It's still better than Duncan. It's still better than what Duncan did this week. I'm still waiting to get my free coffee. I think I have 600 more points to go. It's terrible. OK. I mean, but Starbucks has had one of the better rewards that are out there. And for the companies that have done more digital disruption for that customer touchpoint, I mean, Starbucks. All these companies should just copy Starbucks. Why try to reinvent any of the Starbucks? People love their rewards program. It's a huge driver of their business. Let's take a look at markets. Shall we? We have a mixed picture right now for the major averages, not much movement. It feels like this is a waiting game, both perhaps for FOMC minutes this afternoon at 2 p.m. And also, probably more importantly, for the CPI report that's coming out tomorrow morning. So perhaps a bit of a waiting game and that the market is playing ahead of that. Coming up, the cake of a G.D. is going to speak to the CEO of SunPower on the company's latest partnership with GM also be interested to hear what the inflation reduction act would that company. Don't want to miss that. We'll be back tomorrow. Welcome to Democracy, The Starry campaign.",https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2iE41vefT4k,64,2022-10-12 18:31:56
3155," Gamers Welcome to Yahoo Finance Live. It is 11 a.m. here in New York City. I'm Akiko Fujita. Here's what I'm watching at this hour. Sticky inflation, producer prices come in stronger than expected, but stocks in a bit of a holding pattern. I had a tomorrow's key consumer reading. Another hurdle for Amazon workers at a Southern California warehouse file a petition to form a union of vote alone would be a landmark move in the country's largest state. And charging your home with your EV, some power announces a big partnership with general motors on a new home energy system CEO Peter Ferrisy is going to be joining us later this hour. First though, 90 minutes into the trading day, we are checking in on the market action right now. As you see, things trading pretty flat right now, but the NASDAQ down about just slightly there, one tenth of a percent. A number of things that we've been watching this morning, we pointed to PPI coming out, jumping a little stronger than expected, up 0.4% month on month. We're also looking ahead to those FOMC minutes coming out later this afternoon, but of course, all eyes will be on that CPI print coming down tomorrow. Ahead of that, let's do a quick check of where bond yields are right now. We are seeing the 10 year yield still below that 4% level, but we are seeing it inching ever closer at 395 the five year well above that 4% level and the 30 year yield at 3.9%. Now all of this comes as we kick off earnings season, we're starting to get some of those results in with the Big Bang Flitter to report this Friday from",https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2iE41vefT4k,65,2022-10-12 18:35:37
3156," Well, at 3.9%. Now, all of this comes as we kick off earning season. We're starting to get some of those results in with the Big Bang Slated to report this Friday. For more on what to expect, we have here with us in studio, Victoria Green, G-Squirt, Private, Wealth, CIO. It's good to have you in person. Absolutely. I know. I feel like we know each other. Yeah. One way, Matt. Yeah, your first time we met, pretty fitting, right? We're talking about earning season. The bar is pretty low going into this. But you say set yourself up for even more disappointment. I do. I really see the market is hitting about 34.32. I mean, Pepsi did surprise on the upside. So maybe that's a little bit of an indicator that expectations have come low enough. But we have the dollar. I mean, the dollar was such a headwind in Q3. And I think you've got a lot of tech companies that are going to struggle. So who's going to do well? Probably the energy companies. We will probably see industrials do OK. We've seen some energy companies are going to continue to print money here at $80 or $90 barrel oil. So I think the sectors are going to matter. Individual company performance is going to matter. And what their CEOs did. But I think it's like you've got to check a box on what EPS is. But I think more so everybody wants to know guidance. What does this look like going forward? How much pressure is it going to happen with the dollar? Who's doing job cuts? I mean, it's expected Intel is going to announce job cuts to follow Microsoft, follow Snap. So we're seeing a lot of job cuts coming in the technology sector. Definitely no risk going to full earning season. Financials really kick it off. And we'll see. Did they pick up net interest income? Or are they having to put too many reserves, not seeing any mortgages? You know, we've definitely seen the mortgages almost grind to a halt. And then investment banking has been just difficult this year. So banks make trouble. So the four looking statements are what we're looking for going into these results. But also, you know, it seems to be still a bit of a debate if you could argue that, that, you know, where exactly we are in terms of the macro picture. You have those comments coming in from President Biden saying that he doesn't expect a recession. Obviously, he's the president. He's not going to say things are going to get worse. But we also got those comments from Jamie Dimon, which seems to suggest there are more rough patches ahead. How do you view that? So I think the fact the president said the R word, you know, if you're a fan of the show West Wing with a bagel word, you know, that nobody wants to say the R word is bagel time. But the fact the president is acknowledging it might be a slight recession. And that has to mean they're even acknowledging the slowdown is coming, the Fed's acknowledged the slowdown is coming. They're trying to slow it down, the slowdown inflation. I'm with Jamie Dimon. I actually think we're in a recession. I know we can argue the definition of recession. And that's technically Nebers job. But if you look at the slowdown, where we're going with growth, what's happening with inflation? What's happening with the hawkers fed? Definitely on Jamie Dimon's that there's a little more pain coming. Not sure I'm full IMF, right? They came out with like, hey, expect another 20% down like there's more pain coming. Everybody's going to feel recession in 23. Feel like that might be a tad draconian at this point. But I do think we're still going to see the effects. Remember the lag between rate hikes. And when we feel in the labor market, it's about 12 months. So the question is, where do you position yourself if that slowdown is already underway? You've been bullish on energy for quite some time. And there's questions right now, especially with the moves that we saw from OPEC last week about whether things are really going to start to take up. And when we have seen them tick up a little, where are you positioned in some of those big names? Sure. We did actually pull a little bit back to energy, but we're still overweight. We were very, very overweight. We pulled that back a little bit in June. But we still like a lot of it. So we like the USEMPs, right? The to get it out of the ground in the Permian area is about $30, $40 a barrel. And you haven't seen the rig count really jump up. We're at 765 total rigs. We're still below pre-piontubic levels. And the US has now become a net exporter of petroleum products because we are picking up market share from what Russia is stepping back in. And there are some big sanctions coming in December from the EU. And it's going to hit the shipping and the tankers, because they're not going to insure them. And if nobody's insuring an oil cargo, which I believe something like 95% of insurance is issued by the UK in the euro area. So I see opportunity in US energy producers. We liked our Devon, Devon, Diamondback announced the acquisition today. We really like the Shaneer. It's a natural gas exporter. We think the gas story. Because we feel like the story of energy security for the next decade. Yes, EVs are coming. Yes, solar is coming. Have we hit peak oil demand? We'll see. But we also see also the slit that we need people buying energy from all of us.",https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2iE41vefT4k,66,2022-10-12 18:40:00
3157," Yes, EVs are coming, yes, solar's coming. Have we hit peak oil demand? No, we'll see. But we also see also the slit that we need people buying energy from allies. You know, when we're dealing with that with Saudi Arabia right now, that is Saudi Arabia really an ally, or to sound like millennial self. Are they a friend of me? Like we're friends with them a little bit, but in reality we're not really. And if you look at the geopolitical macro view, you have maimed your players that we may have massive political shifts in. We have Saudi Arabia. We have Iran and we have Venezuela. And we're slightly not saying this is a grand decision and picking sides here, but we're slightly warming up to Venezuela because we realize how to Arabia really is not working in our best interests right now. Yeah, I mean, we did hear the President comment on the yesterday suggesting that there could be more moves coming against Saudi Arabia on the back of that decision. So energy, it sounds like you're still, you pulled back a bit, but you're still positive on it in this environment. What are some other names that you think are getting overlooked right now that offer real value? So, and I love my Costco. I'll talk about Costco anytime I can get it. I love my Costco. Not a stock itself. I'm talking about the company. And not even the $1.50 hotdog, but they are also picking up inventory. So this second Amazon Prime Day that we've gotten is not just because Amazon is trying to be nice to us. They're trying to dump inventory. Everybody's got inventory. Nike's got inventory. So the Costco's and the TJ Maxx of the world that are kind of the off brand, they're not beholden to any brand names. So they're picking up cheap inventory and they're moving it. They're a discount store. They're 75% in the US. The bulk of their international exposures, Canada, which has held up better. So I think they're going to have a little bit less currency effects. I like them. I like a really boring name IBM. I think they're a great place to hide. They've got a strong dividend yield. I think as a service, then a tech company goes, tech spending, it's going to continue. And because of the way they're positioned, I think they're going to see a little bit more sustainability in revenues. Because that's what we're looking at right now. As we move forward and things get pressured, who's going to still make money? And who's at risk of being cut? And so I think they're very well positioned. They're reasonably valued. But I think they still have a lot of growth. They changed who they were. And people realize IBM is a very old company. But they redeveloped themselves multiple, multiple times. They sold off Lenovo, got out of the PC business, and now they're in the hybrid cloud and AI and data consulting. And I see data and data and health care as a great place to be. And the last place playing defense is health care. Like a United Health. Great name to be in right now. And again, a little bit less effect with the dollar. So some of these names that have more revenues coming from the US, I think also will hold up a little bit better. Yeah, names from three very different sectors. But diversification is what we keep hearing. Victoria Green, good to have you in studio today. Yeah, thank you so much for having me. Joining us from G-Spray Private Wealth. Well, let's take a look at oil now. As OPEX last year's its forecast for global crude demand. Yahoo, finances, Jared Blickery here. With more on the price action, Jared, I guess, in some ways. This is OPEX Wave justifying that cut that we got last week. I think so. That took the administration also, the Democrats by surprise. In fact, a lot of people surprised by that because a slash of 2.1 million barrels per day is a lot. Now, OPEX Plus has been operating under capacity. So it's really only an effective cut of about 1 million barrels per day. That is still a lot. And it has house Democrats up in arms. And some of the Senator, Senate leaders as well, Dick Durbin, offering up some bills that have been offered previously in the year, and these have to do with the potential altering the relationship that the U.S. has with Saudi Arabia. We know the U.S. just visited. President Biden just visited Saudi Arabia. But all of this is one month ahead of the midterm. So we know how that, we know how gas prices and energy prices factor into politics. So not surprising to see this. But I believe there is a resolution introduced by 3 Democrats that would suspend military operations and protections in Saudi Arabia and also some sales of arms. And that's a huge deal. There's $100 billion in active tickets with respect to the U.S. and defense systems out there with respect to Saudi Arabia. Now here are crude oil futures. In today, you can see just kind of sinking here after the 8 AM hour. But here's a year to date. We just climbed above 91 dollars per barrel, but still well in the lower end of this range. We just broke out. And so with energy as the leading sector here, you got to ask yourself, and I'm going to go to our sector action and put a year to date on it. With energy, the leading sector, what are the options here? Victoria Green, our previous guest, mentioning that a lot of these companies, these energy.",https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2iE41vefT4k,67,2022-10-12 18:44:14
3158," go to our sector action and put a year to date on it. With energy-leading sector, what are the options here? Victoria Green, our previous guest, mentioning that a lot of these companies, these energy companies, are minting money. And with respect to the supply situation of Saudi Arabia isn't playing ball. Guess what? Venice will. She mentioned them too. They have some of the largest holdings of oil reserves in the entire world. And they are on this side of the world in the West. So maybe we're going to see some increase in terms of interest with respect to repairing those foreign relations. And maybe easing some of those sanctions, I believe Chevron still has a presence there. So we'll have to see what comes of this. XLE, by the way, is still up 43% for the year. OK, Jared Blickrey, thanks so much for that. Well, Pepsi, PepsiCo seeing a big boost after the food giant blew away profit estimates with free-to-lay North America powering PepsiCo's net revenue. Take a look at the stock there, up nearly 5%. The company also raising its forecast, now expecting its full-year organic revenue to increase 12%. We've got our very own Brian Sasi here with outfit change from the last hour. I just put out a place. This is my outfit I watch on Sunday football. You know, I feel a little peppy Max, bubbles and black and ice, and you're good to go. Which is fitting because we're talking about snacks. Turns out snacks are pretty resilient even in the face of cost rises. Yeah, you know, I don't want to bury the lead here. Bottom line is we talked to PepsiCo, CFO Hugh Johnson. He said, hey, y'all, finance team, we're pushing through price increases because we're still dealing with high levels of inflation. And despite those price increases, people are still out there buying lots of chips and lots of soda. Take a listen. Okay, I guess we don't have that. We don't have that, but still, Johnson came out. Really, I think struck a bullish tone. So in addition to that, really saying how he, he just implemented more price increases in the fourth quarter. What he did not want to do is really provide any 2023 guidance. That is typically what PepsiCo does. He did not provide that on the conference call, but ultimately said that's not where they're going to go yet too. We were just also showing pictures of Gatorade. I would expect a big push by Gatorade more into the energy drink category next year. They will launch that what they're calling their new fast-twitch product, 200 milligrams of caffeine in the early part of next year in partnership with the NFL. That's basically- 200 milligrams of that. Oh, right on my alley. Oh, I'm so psyched to keep going. I can't wait. You're gonna have more than one of those, right? Oh, you better go. I mean, you know, when you talk about those cost increases, and how much of it is it to offset? I mean, it's clearly there to offset the price increases they're seeing internally from the materials, everything that goes into making all these stacks, but at the same time, is it enough to offset what they're seeing internally? Yeah, they have, I would say they have. Pepsi was out here this morning with, I think, an earnings beat. Nobody on the street expected. That's why the stock is ripping higher here for Pepsi on an earnings day. That's a pretty big move. That's why it's the hottest ticker on the Yow Finance platform. This quarter's positively surprised a lot of folks on the street over the next coming days. I would not be surprised to see upgrades on Pepsi co-stock upgrades and price targets, upgrades and earnings estimates because it's clear that they have pricing power. And I think the focus now turns onto Coca-Cola to see if they report more of the same. First instinct is yes, you will probably see a very strong quarter from Coca-Cola. The only red flag I would call out is maybe more currency exposure for Coca-Cola than Pepsi-Cola, but still Coca-Cola is teed up for a very strong quarter. Now, yeah, currency exposure one. We're going to continue to hear throughout the earnings season. Brian Sasi, thanks so much. Thanks. Well, shares of Intel aren't focused today as the company reportedly considers major job cuts. That stock is up right now, but it did hit a new 52 week low today. Bloomberg reporting the chipmaker plans to announce the reductions around its quarterly results on October 27. News of the cuts come as the company sees declining demand for its products, especially its PC processors. It's a key revenue driver for the company. Bloomberg reports the revetions could be as high as 20% of staff in some divisions. Well, coming up from changing our office to watching the office meta labels the Quest Pro, a powerful device for productivity and announces tie-ups with Microsoft and NBC Universal. Dan Halley is going to break down the announcement for us on the other side. MUSIC",https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2iE41vefT4k,68,2022-10-12 18:49:17
3159," Whats going on? Swim. Eat. Well, meta has unveiled its new virtual reality headset with a price tag and an eye-watering $1,500. The device isn't aimed at gamers, it's being more positioned as a work-use tool. Those credentials bolster by an appearance from Microsoft's very own CEO Satya Nadella at the big event. Yaku Finance's Dan Halley has all of the details. I guess you could argue the device is a little less clunky, but let's talk about the technology and how this helps meta accelerate their vision of the metaverse. Does it, though, I don't know if it does. This is a $1,500 headset. It's really geared towards professionals. As you said, it's not really geared towards gamers. Part of the developers' conference that they were running had a huge focus on gamers and how they want to bring more game developers in and talk about how they're offering more and that game developers are making billions or rather millions through the platform. They really did put that heavy emphasis on gaming. The headset, though, as you said, seemed to be focused more on the idea of work and being able to have these kind of meetings in the metaverse where you can sit down with people from around the world and easily chat without having to do it via video conference, which I'm not sure that too many people will find that super appealing when they have to strap a headset on that is heavier than the current quest, albeit according to people who have used it, a little bit better weighted and less hot. It really was kind of a mixed bag. The technology is supposed to be better with better visuals, better graphics, improved lenses, there's the ability to see the outside world in color.

3160," You could do that sort of with the quest too, but not really with full color at all. So yeah, it really does ring to be seen if this is actually going to start pushing the metaverse idea forward. It still seems like it's quite a ways off before it becomes something that, you know, the average consumer says, you know, I gotta go out and get this headset and then use it all the time because, you know, they've sold something like 10 million headsets or more, but how often are they being used as I think the real question? And how often are people picking them up, going back daily and jumping in to do things like, you know, check email, talk to people, access kind of, you know, the big displays that you might get in the metaverse when, you know, instead you could just fire it for computer and do that quicker. Yeah, I mean, it is about that transition we talked about so much. It's not so seamless going from the real world to the virtual world, although I have to say, Dan, I'm just really excited that Avatar's getting lights. You can talk about that. I mean, that's a good sign, right? Technology's advancing. We talked about Satya Nadella making a surprise appearance. There, what's this partnership about between meta and Microsoft? Yeah, so this is about their team's mesh software and it's really, you know, they're both going hard as far as the ability to get this kind of work into the metaverse where you can sit down and have meetings with people, chat with them around a virtual conference table. You know, Microsoft already offers a team's chat where you can do video chatting with your colleagues through your laptop or your smart phone. So, you know, it just kind of feels odd that you can fire up something so easily that you can carry with you and have conversations with people. Sure, you're not around a virtual conference table. You're not able to virtually whiteboard the way you might want to although there is a whiteboard feature for video chatting with Microsoft teams when you do use the laptop. But, you know, it does kind of point to how both companies don't want to miss the boat on what could potentially be a big piece of hardware and software down line just like they did with the smartphone. You remember Facebook tried to launch a phone. Microsoft had their phone line, Windows OS, mobile OS, wasn't as bad as people thought. But they also did lean into gaming. So part of Microsoft's X Cloud, their Cloud Gaming platform will be available on the quest. And so you see this kind of, you know, balance between, or attempt to balance between gamers and people who are working. It feels as though they're trying to make a PC when the PC already exists. This one you just have to put on your head. All this of course coming as a medic kind of keeps the close watch in their rear view mirror, right? With Apple, expect us to come out with our headset soon. Dan Halley is always thanks so much for that. We are continuing to monitor some of those layoffs coming out of Warner Brothers Discovery. This is all part of the company's drive to cut costs. It's now affecting the Warner Brothers TV studio. Yahoo! Finance is Ali Canal following that story for us and Ali, do we have a sense of just how many job cuts are coming? Yeah, we do. Yesterday we got the announcement that the TV studio has been affected. That segment cut 26% of its head count, AKA 125 positions across scripted, unscripted, and animation. And that translated to 82 staffers being laid off. And then the company opted not to fill an additional 43 vacant positions. But there's another big cut that the company made. They are shuttering their digital production arms, stage 13. And the 40 year Warner Brothers Television workshop. And this is a big one because this fostered new, diverse talent. There was a lot of talk on Twitter. Why are they deciding to cut this when there was so much diversity? That was coming out of that program. So that is now done. And obviously this comes at a pretty crucial time for the company. They are trying to cut $3 billion worth of costs over the next two years. We saw back in August that they cut 14% of their HBO Max work for. So this is just a continuation of those expected layoffs. I think we will see more throughout the fall. But if you take a look at the stock, it's trading near 52 week lows. Down more than 50% year to date. David Zazov has been very aggressive. But I think investors are still in a bind to his vision. So I think once all this consolidation happens, once we get that newly combined HBO Max discovery plus streaming program next summer, the next step is going to be, OK, David Zazov, where are you going to take this company and will investors ultimately buy into it? Yeah, maybe investors are waiting for this shake down to all play out. The other company, of course, in this streaming space, Netflix, the big giant here reporting next week. What are we expecting there? What's interesting?",https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2iE41vefT4k,70,2022-10-12 18:56:52
3161," This is just waiting for this shakedown to all play out. The other company, of course, in this streaming space, Netflix, the big giant here reporting next week. What are we expecting there? What's interesting about this earnings report is for the first time in a long time, I don't think subscriber numbers are going to be the B all end all. If we take a look at the numbers here, Netflix says it expects revenue at $7.85 billion adjusted EPS at $2.22 a share. They expect that subscriber number to come in at $1 million. I actually think they might even be on that subscriber number due to the success of Dahmer. That series has just been crushing it week after week on the Netflix top 10 list. But going back to what's happening at the company right now, ad supported, that is going to be a big driver. There's been a lot of optimism on Wall Street. We've seen a lot of upgrades. The stock is up 18% over the past three months, widely outpacing the broader market. We still have a couple bears in there that say there's a lot of volatility. There's a lot of competition. We have Disney's out supported coming out in December. People are saying that Netflix could come out with theirs November 1st to beat Disney to the punch. But right now, I think ultimately analysts are really hoping for some more clarity on the ad supported and they're really banking on that to help Netflix improve their free cash flow and profitability. So that's going to be probably the biggest question that investors want answered during the earnings call in the report. You think that people will be a little more cautious in this environment in terms of which advertisers would be willing to pay up, but I guess that points to the attractiveness of the platform that at least, you know, the analysts see if they're upgrading it because the additional revenue source they expect to come in. And that's been some of the bear sentiment too because Netflix is charging a really high premium to a lot of these advertisers. So if they even want to be on the platform, they're paying above industry standard and that could be a risk. Yeah, an important point to point out there. Ali Canal, thanks so much for that. Well, coming up, the sustainability conundrum. We're from major governments, Trillian's worth of assets, and now a new report saying supply cannot keep up with demand. But isn't there backlash against ESG? We'll discuss next. Thank you. Great. Thank you. You",https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2iE41vefT4k,71,2022-10-12 19:01:12
3162," you you you you Welcome to Yahoo Finance on this one day afternoon. I'm Sean Smith along with Dave Briggs and Richella Kufo. Let's get you up to speed on the market action. We are looking at gains at least when you take a look at the Dow and the S&P or a Dow and the Nasdaq excuse me the Dow up about 60 points. S&P now back in negative territory. The Nasdaq though holding onto gains barely of just five points taking a look at this intraday chart. You did see this spike shortly after 2 PM after we got the Fed minute release. So it looks like the Fed minutes weren't as hawkish as what the street had maybe been bracing themselves force. That's why we're still in the green today, although well off the highs of the day, Russell 2000 moving to the upside up just about nearly two tens of a percent taking a look at the bond yields yield pulling back a bit as investors seem to get a little bit more hawkish if we could say that the 10 year yield now at 390 the 30 year yield at 389. Take a look at the sector action today and this really gets into what exactly is going on in the markets energy. The leader here up just around 1% but consumer staples also among the outperformers here up just around 8 tens of a percent. The reason why was earnings that we got out from Pepsi earlier today and take a look at some of those beverage names. You can see Pepsi leading the way with just around a 4% jump here to the upside better than expected earnings on the top and bottom lines. They also raised their guidance competitor Coca-Cola moving to the upside today as well as some of some the bigger beer names here. Budweiser you can see up just around 2% and Moulsen Quars also moving to the upside up nearly 3%. I mentioned the minutes from the Fed meeting. That's a big driver here in this afternoon's trading. Yahoo! Finance is Jen Schomburger has the latest on that. Hey Jen. Good afternoon, Shana. Many Fed officials felt that the cost of doing too little to cool inflation versus the cost of doing to outweigh the cost of doing too much according to internal policy deliberations amongst Fed officials at their meeting 3 weeks ago. Now several participants felt the need to maintain a restrictive stance for as long as necessary with a couple stressing that historical experience showed the danger of prematurely ending periods of tight monetary policy. Now at the time, Fed officials remained thought that inflation remained unacceptably high, noting that inflation data had come in above expectations and was declining more slowly than anticipated. Several participants pointed to continued elevated rate of the increase in�",https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2iE41vefT4k,72,2022-10-12 19:04:52
3163," on above expectations and was declining more slowly than anticipated. Several participants pointed to continued elevated rates of the increase in core goods prices. That is prices excluding those volatile food and energy prices. Now, most fed officials feel that some interest rate sensitive sectors like housing and business fixed investment have started to respond to rate hikes, but that a large portion of sectors in the economy have yet to. Now, as monetary policy titans further, officials think that they can slow the pace of rate hikes at some point and assess the impact of those rate hikes that have already been implemented on inflation. Many officials felt that once the policy rate had reached as efficiently restrictive level, they would maintain that level for, quote, some time until there was, quote, compelling evidence that inflation was on force to return to that 2% objective. Now, many officials expect the economy to grow at a pace below trend this year and for the next couple of years as they expect these interest rate hikes to filter through the economy. Guys. All right, thanks for that update, Gen Sean Berger reporting there. Well, let's bring in now Amy Kong, Barrett asset management chief investment officer, and Wells Fargo economist Mike Puglesi to break some of this down. So, Amy, as you sort of pass through the comments that we heard from the third and obviously, we saw that this hawkish toe and they are waiting for this consistent sign that inflation is going down. What does this mean for markets right now? Yeah, I think the trappiness continues until the third really gives us a little bit more insight into their end goal. I don't think they know what the end goal is because they are very data dependent. So, really going into the rest of this year and into 2023, what we're really watching for is inflation trends to moderate and to some earlier comments sustained at a much lower level until we get to that point. I would definitely expect elevated market volatility. Mike, these words, the aim of mitigating the risk of significant adverse effects on the economic outlook seem to sound a bit dovish to some. It seems to me that the Fed has been remarkably consistent. What did you hear today? Yeah, I think that's right. I mean, the message I heard is the Fed knows there's still a lot of work left to be done. Inflation remains well above their target and as so long as that's the case, they're going to continue to tighten monetary policy or at least leave it in very restrictive levels. But what I think you're starting to hear is a Fed that recognizes it may not need to be as aggressive with the pace as it was when rates were back at zero, right? Back in March or May when rates were very, very low still in terms of the federal funds rate, there was a lot of ground between where they were and where they needed to go to get policy restrictive. With short-term interest rates now above 3%, and potentially headed above 4% in the very near future, I think you're starting to hear a Fed that slowly but surely is calibrating to both ends of the risk spectrum, obviously not doing enough, but also potentially with rates getting to 4 or even 5% over the next few meetings, you know, worrying about doing too much. Well, Mike, and on that note, worry about doing too much. That certainly is the sentiment of some investors out there saying that the Fed is simply going to overshoot. Is there any risk of that? And I guess to what degree is that risk? Yeah, I do. And in fact, we put a recession in our base case forecast back in June based off that exact thinking with the idea being if the Fed wants to see not just lower inflation from month or two months, but on a sustained basis. And given the extent to which inflation is at best a concurrent indicator and, you know, at worst lagging, we're probably going to see a mild downturn in the economy. Now, it doesn't mean it has to happen that way if they can catch a few lucky breaks related to supply chains and COVID and the war in Ukraine and other factors that have been, you know, very unlucky breaks on the inflation fronts. You know, that could help them achieve the much desired soft landing, but, you know, I do think there is a very real possibility that what will happen in reality is a mild recession starting next spring or summer. And Amy, as we're looking at what's happening with the strength of the dollar, how do you see that playing into the Fed's thinking going forward? Sure. You know, the strength of the US dollar may, you know, certainly cause the Fed to think about the aggressiveness that they have been taking on the markets, but I don't necessarily think that they will pivot all too much from their aggressive stance. I do agree with Mike's comments, though, in the sense that, you know, we are.",https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2iE41vefT4k,73,2022-10-12 19:09:41
3164," that they have been taking on the markets. But I don't necessarily think that they will pivot all too much from their aggressive stance. I do agree with Mike's comments though, in the sense that we are at a point where we are now back at pre-COVID levels from the standpoint of where interest rates are. So really, I think the Fed needs to really understand how that cumulative impact is on the economy. They've now raised three times at 75 basis points. I'll likely do it again in November. So you're looking at four very aggressive rate heights. What's the tone they want to set for December and into 2023? I think they're going to weigh that a lot more carefully now that we are again back at pre-COVID levels from the interest rates standpoint. And Mike, you talk about catching a lucky break. Unfortunately, the war in Ukraine is ramping up. China continues to lock down and inflation is sticking around. That being said, what's your strategy to these conditions? Cash is king? Yeah, I think that's right. I mean, in these kinds of conditions, you've seen asset prices just across the board. Be it equities, be it obviously longer term bonds, even home prices have started to roll over recently. And so you start to think about where we're getting in short-term interest rates. The Fed does in fact go 75 basis points in November, which we also think is going to be the case. You're going to be talking about a 4% return on relatively safe assets like treasuries where you don't have all that much interest rate risk, you don't have the credit risk. And so I think until we get a lot more certainty on inflation finally rolling over and the Fed at least ramping down to 50 and 25 basis point of eight tax, let alone actually outright pausing, it's going to be very difficult. And I think in that kind of environment, you do want to play cautiously. Amy, what happens to earnings in all this? Because estimates have been lowered. Yet we got Pepsi out this morning beating on both the top and bottom line raising their guidance. Do you think this is a start of a trend or is Pepsi simply most likely an outlier? It's very soon to tell Pepsi is really one of the first major companies to report. We will see from some of the banks coming in the coming days, whether or not they start to build a reserve. We started to see that with Jake Morgan and maybe other banks will follow suit. I think it's again too soon to call a trend at this point. Pepsi's earnings were certainly very good, but one note to keep in mind is that they didn't guide into 2023. So while they do think the rest of the year will pan out nicely for them, I think the key is to listen for clues in terms of what 2023 earnings will look like. Our stance is that as we get into the Q3 earnings season and into January and February, we will start to hear those numbers come down. And we do expect that 240 in terms of what's the street now thinks as the peak in our next year is likely to come south to probably in the low 200s. All right. What do you see as some of the bell whether earnings reports that you're going to be keeping an eye on? Yeah, I think the financials are a great example as well, just given that one, they're so early. And two, it provides insight into the US economy as a whole, either from, you know, you can think about it just from loan growth and what's the demand for credit right now, particularly given the sharp rise and interest rates we've seen over the past few months, or just credit conditions more broadly. What are we seeing? You know, what are banks seeing on the consumer side? What are they seeing from a credit quality standpoint? So that's certainly what'll be front and center for me over the next couple of weeks, both in terms of the timing and the information provided. Okay, Mike Poblisi and Amy Kong. Thank you both. Appreciate all that. We're just getting started here on Yahoo Finance live. Coming up as mortgage rates hit their highest levels since 2006. To find out where housing prices are dropping the fastest.

3165," now Clearly, the Fed is not beating inflation yet, but they are winning the war against an overheated housing market today. Some new numbers showing mortgage demand slowing yet again. Mortgage applications decreased 2% from the prior week that's according to the Mortgage Bankers Association. These higher rates now at 6.81% on the 30 year highest since 2006 really took a hit on demand for refiase though down 86% from the same week last year. Question now is there any good news amidst all this housing carnage? It's a glimmer some deals can be had. Realtor.com out with the 10 cities where prices are falling the fastest and topping that list. In Texas where listen to this prices are down 10% plus since June. Phoenix, Arizona just behind them at 9.9%. Palm Bay, Florida Charleston, South Carolina, Ogden, Utah, they round down to top 5. Denver, Stockton, California, Durham, North Carolina, Spokane, Washington, also in the top 10. You might think those are the 10 cities where prices grew the fastest in the pandemic. That's not necessarily the case, Jonathan, there certainly is some overlap, notably Phoenix, Austin and Denver. But most of those cities were in Florida where prices are not falling that fast because we're still flocking to the tax rate. Look at Ken Griff and Citadel, they're calling it Wall Street, South Beach. A lot of people still keeping those prices high. Yeah, there certainly is a lot of demand in Florida. We talk about this cooling housing market and it's very important to pour out even though Wall Street has been lowering their expectations. For example, Morgan Stanley saying that home prices are going to drop between now and the end of 2023 by about 7%. That puts us right back to where we were at the beginning of this year, January 2022. When prices were still very elevated historically speaking. So we are starting to see a flow down, demand is starting to fall off a bit. A lot of that has to do with the higher mortgage rates that you were just referencing. But it's important to point out, Michelle, that on a pricing basis, we are still very elevated when you compare it to what we were seeing pre-pandemic. And as Dave was mentioning there, it is a regional issue. Obviously, a lot of the places that we saw that were really thriving during the pandemic as people wanted to be warm and we also had people working from home wanted some options. It's interesting though, because different parts of Florida sort of coming back at different places and then when you also look at some of these other bank predictions, you mentioned",https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2iE41vefT4k,75,2022-10-12 19:18:22
3166," people working from home wanted some options. It's interesting though because different parts of Florida sort of coming back at different paces. And then when you also look at some of these other bank predictions, you mentioned Morgan Stanley also Goldman Sachs saying that they expect home prices to fall between 5% and 10% next year. Wells Fargo putting it at about just over 5% as well. But then when you look at Zillow, they're actually expecting prices to go up. Now, I'm sure they're hoping that's the case, given that that's the business that they're in. But the big banks are expecting some cooling in the market. And so if you're a first time home viral and you got stuck in a very expensive rental, at least perhaps some good news, but you're going to have to wait about a year for it. Yeah, people think we've got a lot further to fall. Mortgage rates will climb above 7%. We could be looking at 2020, early 21 type of home prices. So you're going to take a further hit in what you have into your house right now. The interesting part about we talked about mortgage demand dropping off 2% from the week prior. It's picking up on adjustable rate mortgages. People taking a bit of a risk on those five year fixed. After that, your subject to market rates. And that we are seeing quite a big demand. People betting on rates down the road. I think in this environment, probably worth the chance for a lot of homeowners. Yeah, and we talked about the slowdown that we're seeing in the US. Obviously, this is also true on a global scale. It was interesting. UBS was also out with a recent report highlighting what they're what they're calling the riskiest cities for real estate. So Toronto actually top that list. Frank Firth, those were the top two. Miami was the only US city in that top 10 list at number 10, which I've had a little bit interesting, right? Risky. Risky. Not buying it. Miami will stay hot. They might lose a few percentage points, but we are flocking to the no state income tax. That would be fun. Certainly is a lot of demand, at least for right now. All right, well, coming up here, the self-described anti-woke YOLL ETF making its Wall Street debut yesterday. With the rise of politically driven funds, say about the broader market, we've got that",https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2iE41vefT4k,76,2022-10-12 19:22:34
3167," Pennsylvania Ken08 John Ken08 in the South New Israel The best for the future. Consumer Staples among the leaders here in today's gains after Pepsi posted a beat on both the top and bottom lines. They're full a year forecasting. Look at some of these numbers. Organic revenue up 16% growth there. The growth was also broad based North America and also global markets each delivering that 16% growth snacks were of 20% beverages were up 12% we had the CFO Hugh Johnston on Yahoo Finance earlier today and he was basically saying that Pepsi has historically done well even into a recession so Michelle maybe that explains the strong numbers here. I think the question though for Wall Street as we do see the strong report come out of Pepsi Pepsi leading the way for this current quarter whether or not this is going to be a trend maybe earnings aren't going to be as weak as we had initially expected or rather if Pepsi will simply be an outlier here. It's interesting obviously we're still very early in the earnings season but perhaps this speaks to the consumer that they're not pulling away from brand loyalty they are sticking with some of these brands. Obviously Pepsi also owns Doritos, Gatorade and a number of other brands as well and consumers clearly still sticking with that loyalty and still willing to spend a premium for some of these brand names versus say some of these store brands we know that during as recession as inflation has peaked people have turned to some of these grocery store brands but as we're seeing consumer staples still going strong at the moment as we're looking at some of the ones on the screen at Coca-Cola Pepsi, Tyson's Campbell and Kellogg enjoying some gains today showing that people aren't pulling back at least on some of these things despite high inflation day. Yeah and Sean asked which of those things will happen I'm just going to go with yes because overall I think Pepsi is going to continue to grow snacks and beverages we'll continue to be recession proof because they've talked about raising their prices has not impacted one bit the demand in fact their CEO says our category seems to be going faster than food food is going faster than non food I don't think that's going to change in spite of all the ups and downs potentially economically around the world I don't think overall they're going to be the rule of what we see in the quarter with the exception of booze my friends till array we we really focused on the earnings in terms of being a Canadian cannabis company they saw their cannabis revenue down 9% the quarter guess what booze was up 33% the quarter cannabis down nine booze up 33% we saw that with constellation brands as well it said their recession resistant and the demand has not dropped off so again yes I guess would be my oh yeah and I also think it's interesting just a commentary that we've gone out from Wall Street so far web bush was out saying that this is a positive re through on expectations for the broader sector for the broadage that broader beverage sectors that points to what you were saying just in terms of non alcoholic and alcoholic beverage companies here and also Pepsi was raised to a strong buy at CFRA at 12% upside there after the earnings be on both the top and bottom line so the streets encouraged I hope this is a trend but we'll see we love our snacks all right environment social and governance or ESG funds seeing considerable investment in the last several years and though interest has Wayne slightly this year to spurned a counter movement into a so-called anti woke funds with holdings in fossil fuels manufacturing and the like joining us now is vetifies financial futures Dave Nadeg for this ETF report sponsored by investment go QQQ so you can invest in the anti ESG movement now right yeah absolutely we've got a couple different versions of this from funds that are sort of mechanically looking at the individual stocks that are skipped by ESG to this new fund y'all which launched today which is an actively managed fund that isn't pretending that it's trying to go anti ESG as much as anti left so it's it's really positioning itself against companies who take any political so few right well that's my first guess well they don't actually say that what they say is mostly they're going to avoid companies that speak out on social issues that's the big one we do have another ETF drill from from a strive financial which is specifically going after those fossil fuel companies with the idea of voting for the ones that are and voting the shares of those individual stocks to promote more energy drilling so I think you've got a lot of different ways to skin that cap but the ESG side of the equation is",https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2iE41vefT4k,78,2022-10-12 19:28:57
3168," for the ones that are and voting the shares of those individual stocks to promote more energy drilling. So I think you've got a lot of different ways to skin that cap, but the ESG side of the equation isn't going anywhere. There's still an enormous amount of money chasing that as well. And Dave Rochelle here, I know you obviously people have invested in things that they believe in or that they support. So that aspect of it is something that's not necessarily new, but you say this actually might trivialize some of these issues. Why is that? Well, so when we look at the broad ESG universe, this is being driven by institutions and it's not a small amount of money. There's a PWC study just came out suggesting that we're going to grow from $15 to $30 trillion in the US focused on ESG investing. So the amounts of money we're talking about in some of the reactionary products here are pretty de minimis compared to the institutional money, which is going to continue to allocate based on ESG and which frankly is being rewarded for that. I mean, ESG is outperforming in most reasonable time frames, maybe not the last three months. But if you look over the, you course it this year or the last three years or the last five years, many of these ESG funds are actually beating their benchmarks. Interesting. So Dave, it sounds like you're expecting this, this pullback that we're seeing in ESG investing to at some point bounce back. What do you think that catalyst is going to be? Well, I think we're not really going to see much of a pullback in terms of that asset flow. In terms of the sort of the narrative around this, the political environment for it, I think that this will probably die down. I think I'm absolutely for people voting with their dollars if they don't want to be with an ESG asset manager. You shouldn't be with an ESG asset manager. That's a reasonable approach to take. But the big horse here is still that institutional market. A lot of it outside the US, that's going to be invested in US companies based on ESG principles, regardless of what the US retail investor might do with ETFs. This is a bit of a U-turn, but do you think the impact of these Republican attorneys' general will have an impact on the ESG investment space? They are taking this all the way. Yeah, I'm skeptical of that. If you look at, for instance, what they did in Texas, where they were trying to sort of black ball, black rock. It made for great headlines. When you went under the hood, it was a really diminimous amount of money that was going to be pulled from black rock. And in fact, if you got under the hood, they had to do a whole carve out because black rock was running their energy fund, their private equity energy fund. So this is a big, complicated industry. It makes for a great headline to say we're firing black rock, but it doesn't actually move the needle in terms of getting more drills in the ground or really even changing the cost of capital much. Well said. Dave, what about some of the returns that we're seeing on some of these anti-woke investments and ETFs? It doesn't end up being worth it, as you said. If you do have companies like Blackwink that are already doing business with some of these companies, perhaps, but making the headlines nonetheless. Yeah. Well, so one of the great things, also frustrating things about ESG, is it's very much in the eyes of the beholder. What I think of as ESG might not be with somebody else thinks. When we think about carbon, that's an easy one to understand. Investing or not investing or anti-investing in the net zero carbon transition, that's a pretty clean way of thinking about it. When you start layering on things like social issues, governance issues, honestly, I think the numbers get much harder to tease out. The carbon impact stuff, it's pretty unequivocal that the long-term returns have been positive there. 60% of institutions report that their ESG investments are outperforming consistently their non-ESG investments. Quickly, the currency hedging we can now invest in that space, what's the move? Well, people have been avoiding this and I don't really understand why. If you look at just domestic markets like EFA versus the HEFA, the hedged version, it's being a by 10% this year, just by being currency hedged. We saw this a decade ago with Japan, DXJ, a fund that really rallied way more than Japanese market because it hedged it out. We're in a similar market, but investors don't want to be international at all. That's the problem. We've seen net outflows from international investing in ETFs. So while a hedge diversion might be a better way, they're so little appetite for international diversification, it's not picking up a bid. Well, certainly an opportunity there. Big thank you to Dave Nadeg, Vetifies Financial Futures. Thank you for joining us this afternoon. Thanks for having me. You're so welcome. You can now get more than just caffeine when you get a red eye or your red eye.

3169," So welcome on, you can now get more than just caffeine when you get a red eye or your red eye. Delta and Starbucks are teaming up and their most loyal customers can benefit most. We'll have those details next. you it's time for triple play the three stocks that we're watching in the final 30 minutes of trading. We have Camico, Moderna and Starbucks and my pick is Uranium Minor Camico. Now the ticker is CCJ. The stock off about as you can see they're down about almost 14% there and that's after announcing a deal to buy Westinghouse Electric for $7.9 billion and that's via a partnership with Brookfield Renewable Partners. Now to fund the deal, Camico is selling $650 million worth of stock, priced at $21.95 a share and is also expected to close this deal in the second half of 2023. Now Brookfield Renewable and its institutional partners will own 51% of Westinghouse with the remainder going to Camico. Now a significant deal this is as Westinghouse services, services nearly half the nuclear power generation sector and of course the timing coincides with nuclear power really in focus at the moment due to the energy crisis in Europe, also high oil and gas prices and then of course you have some CEOs including Elon Musk who have been pushing for more nuclear energy use. You have Michelle the drop that we're seeing today the largest percentage decrease that we've seen in the stock sense January of 2017. So just putting today's decline into perspective you mentioned the focus here on nuclear energy. It's very similar to what we heard when we had the uranium energy CEO on the show not too long ago. He was talking about the importance of nuclear power here given the current energy climate right now saying that one in five US homes are powered by nuclear energy. He of course is making the case that more of that should be done in our own backyard that we should be investing more. So here in the US for up you can see the demand there for nuclear power and exactly what that looks like here.",https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2iE41vefT4k,79,2022-10-12 19:35:00
3170," of that should be done in our own backyard that we should be investing more. So here in the U.S. for up, you can see the demand there for nuclear power and exactly what that looks like here, given the current energy landscape. All right, my play today is Moderna. It's a top performer in the S&P after Merck extended its partnership with the company to jointly develop and also sell a cancer vaccine to treat patients with melanoma. Now Merck will pay Moderna $250 million for the collaboration, including joint development and future commercialization. Now Wall Street's viewing this as a big one ahead of the clinical trial results that we are expecting before the end of the year. You can see the pop in the stock today. This is not the only catalyst for Moderna. The FDA also granting emergency use authorization for its Omacron booster vaccine for children as young as six years old. So two stories here, very bullish for Moderna here and we're seeing the Pusok pop mostly on the cancer news, but still, big mostly. I was about to say, I think for the most part, the upside of the Omacron or any of the COVID vaccines, it's pretty much worn off. We are pretty much over it and flip the page, but it is that younger portion where there are some people that have not had their kids vaccinated. But this key truda is key because you've heard so many questions, Moderna. What now? What have you done for me lately? You've printed money for two years. What's the next plan? And this is finally a glimpse into that. Keytruda Merck's second biggest drug, 35% of their sales in the most recent quarter. My play is a two for its Delta Airlines and Starbucks. You gotta love coffee when you're flying. What's the comment thread here, though, beyond that? The two are linking their loyalty programs in order to boost sales. Starting today, once you connect the accounts, Delta Sky Miles members can earn one mile for each dollar spent at Starbucks. Members will also earn double stars on Starbucks rewards when making purchases at participating Starbucks on days when flying Delta. I know that sounds confusing. Check your email if you're a member of either. They've already emailed you. Through the end of the year, Sky Miles members can earn 500 miles if they link accounts, earn another 150 and stars once they make a qualifying purchase. This adds to existing Delta rewards relationships already with lift, Airbnb and Instacart. Delta Stock is up. Just over, let's see, it was just over 1%. Now 27% though, your today's Starbucks is up as well, 1% and down, 25% year to date. Interesting partnership, although speaking of coffee loyalty stories, the big story this week, Rochelle has been dunking members are furious at their changes, making it harder to get a freak up a coffee, and they say they're going to Starbucks. I don't believe it. I mean, there's a pretty significant price difference between what you pay at Dunkin' in Starbucks. I don't know how long it will last, but you start looking at your wallet. Exactly. As you were mentioning, these partnerships that Delta has, we saw from Prashant Sharma Vice President of Loyalty at Delta, they've really been trying to evolve the premium experience. They say they want to really capture that, whether you're flying with them or not. So, Sili, clearly having that overlap, that Delta customers get to enjoy that premium experience, so to Starbucks consumers, I like this fusion. I think this is good. What do you think, Sean? Yeah, I don't think there's anything not to like about. I'm a little confused just in terms of how you're going to prove that you're flying on Delta. How exactly this all works? So, I think we're all going to have to check the fine print of this, but this partnership of course makes a lot of sense. And this is coming in terms of, as we approach a potential worsening economic slowdown, consumer facing brands, facing a pretty rocky couple of months, that's what we expect at least. So, a partnership like this certainly does not help. Davey listed the partners that Delta has already had locked in here so far. It makes a lot of sense. I hope a similar partnership is coming to United. I don't fly Delta that often, but I think it makes a lot of sense. And I think flyers of Delta and Starbucks drinkers are going to be very excited about this one. I'm just wondering which of the airlines is going to partner up with the streamer. It's got to happen in the next couple of years. Just going to put that out there. Coming up, Fanatics is preparing to place a massive wager on sports betting in 2023.

3172," What do we know? So they had cut their production forecast twice this year from around $20,000 to $12,000, $14,000 to now at $6,000 to $7,000 a year. They're reaffirming that $6,000, $7,000 target. They actually made around 2,300 cards last quarter, which is triple the amount they made in Q2. But that's not that much. So a lot of heads are rolling actually in management there. CEO Peter also went to the factory with their everyday to sort of like, iron out those issues so that they're finally past that with the production kind of bottlenecks. But still a long way to go. We're talking about a car that costs around $150,000. So volume is low to begin with. But they have said they want to make an $80,000 base level to lose it air. So maybe that comes soon. Also the gravity SUVs also on the horizon. So that's another probably big deal for them. Hopefully next year we'll see that. It's a nice, very affordable $80,000 version. Now you know, cars are expensive. Now they are really expensive. The wagon here is $100,000 car. And that's not an EV. Pros, good stuff. Thank you. All right, let's take a look at United. Shares up just around 1.5% the airliner announcing today that it will be adding to its transatlantic travel slate next summer. The news comes as United reports demand up 20% from 2019 during the peak portion of this summer. Joining us now for more on this in the state of the industry. We want to bring in Helene Becker, Cowan's senior research analyst. Helene is great to see you. So we had the news from United. The news yesterday was American lifting its third quarter guidance. It looks like demand is very strong amongst the airlines. What's your assessment? Yeah, thanks for having me. So a couple of things. Number one, yes, you're right, demand. Especially for international is very strong. We've seen a shift in mix in the last couple of months from domestic leisure to international and mostly international leisure. And I think that's somewhat behind the United Decision to add more leisure international destinations for next summer. We did a preview on Friday for the earnings season. And we said we thought American Delta United had the best opportunity for positive surprise because we've gone from the first, say, four months of the year when we saw international down something around 60%, 50% to 60% from 2019 levels. And now we're down closer to 15%, 1%, 5%. So you've seen that big increases as markets have opened up. People have shifted and started flying further, especially Transatlantic, not so much Trans-Pacific, but Transatlantic. And business we've gone from being down about 40% or 50% earlier in the year to being down 25% earlier in the year. So I think those two elements, and we've still seen strong domestic leisure, but instead of being up 35%, it's up closer to 10%, 15%. So you've seen that mix shift, which has huge positive implications for revenue. And I think the Delta reports tomorrow first, you just mentioned that. And I think you'll hear them talk about that for the rest of the quarter, or the rest of the current quarter. Yeah, fourth quarter. And I know, obviously, the industry is still dealing with some of these staffing shortages as well. How is this affecting some of the more profitable routes for these airlines? I'm sorry. I missed the first half. They're doing more of these what as well. As we're still seeing some issues when it comes to things like labor shortages, as we continue to see some of these kinks getting worked out, how is this affecting some of the most profitable routes? Yeah. So we're having these issues to your point, with respect to infrastructure. So it's not just labor. It's air traffic control. It's airport infrastructure. I don't know when you flew last, but I was at an airport. So it was two airports yesterday and the day before and stores are closed. They haven't reopened. They can't find people. And we're seeing a lot of that. And so that's going to inform growth for 2023 and probably 2024. And not only that, you didn't specifically ask about this, but the OEMs are behind on deliveries. So the airlines don't have the, and they don't know when they're getting the aircraft. So from an airline perspective,",https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2iE41vefT4k,82,2022-10-12 19:48:54
3173," The OEMs are behind on deliveries, so the airlines don't have the, and they don't know when they're getting the aircraft. So from an airline perspective, it's really hard for network planning to think about where they're going to grow and where these aircraft are going to go and not knowing whether you're even going to have the aircraft. United is in a really unique position because they didn't retire a lot. They don't retire any, as a matter of fact, of their wide-body aircraft during the pandemic. So they are in a really great position to be able to shift capacity around their network and grow into some of these domestic leisure markets. That's part of why we have United rated and outperform. And the others retire their aircraft and in part they were older, so it made sense to retire them, but they're having issues because the OEMs are behind on deliveries or having issues getting. They're having our aircraft to be able to grow, growing, going forward. So we think we'll probably talk a lot about that too. Yeah, Holly, you mentioned the supply chain issues, the volatile jet fuel prices, difficulty hiring and retaining employees. A lot of this focus is going to be on how exactly these airlines are going to reign in costs at this time. What do you want to hear? What do you expect to hear over the coming weeks? Yeah, so the first thing I'd love to hear from them is labor contracts. Every, the big four airlines have open pilot contracts. American has an open flight to tenant contract. I would love to hear them talk about there. They probably won't because they don't like to talk about open labor contracts on earnings calls, but I would love it if they could give us some confidence that maybe by next summer, a lot of these contracts would be negotiated and ratified. That would be great, both from an investor perspective and from an employee perspective. I think it would be nice. And if the pilots, the flight attendants knew what they were going to be earning, and I think that would be good to get that resolved. We also, as you mentioned earlier, we need to attract people to the profession. I mean, we can't just do it overnight. We need to start with young people, younger people. But yes, I'd love to hear that. I think we're going to hear a lot of discussion about their loyalty programs. The number one credit card that everybody has that Americans mostly have, anyway, is a cashback card. And then that's usually followed by a gas card. But if you live in a hub city, you probably have an airline card and your spend is probably high. And you, but it takes a while to earn, earn a free ticket or an upgrade. So the airline's like having that dollar today, because it's not going to be redeemed for months yet. And it definitely helps. But if there's the shift in mix to more leisure oriented travel from business and corporate travel, that's going to inform the way the airlines think about loyalty going forward. So I'd love to hear them talk a little bit about that. I'm demanding for the holiday season. I'm starting to hear from people that fairs are getting a little out of control. And so they're driving versus flying. I feel like everybody goes home for Christmas, but not everybody goes home for Thanksgiving. And in my investor calls lately, I've been hearing people echoing that and saying, we're driving this year for Thanksgiving or we're doing Thanksgiving at our house this year. We're not going. We have to buy four tickets, five tickets, whatever. It's just gone like really aggressive. Especially given how far fairs have come in the last say 18 months, because obviously in the worst part of the pandemic, the airlines were discounting. And in the last six or nine months, they've been raising fairs pretty aggressively in part to cover higher costs. But in part to discourage some demand. But yeah, flights are full. They're like 90 percent. Well, they're more there. They're almost always going out with very few free-seats available seats. Well, certainly airlines and flyers as well, having to be more strategic at the moment. A big thank you to Helene Becker for joining us this afternoon. Thank you. All right, well, fanatics is looking to disrupt the sports betting space and soon. These are all the company's plans.",https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2iE41vefT4k,83,2022-10-12 19:52:56
3174," Becca for joining us this afternoon. Thank you. All right, well, fanatics, there's looking to disrupt the sports betting space and soon. These are all on the company's plans next. Sports apparel retail giant fanatics is not satisfied with the $27 billion valuation. The company is betting big on the sports gambling space. They're CEO Michael Rubin saying that the sports business journal world congress of sports that fanatics will be in 15 to 20 states by the start of the 2023 NFL season. Listen. We want to have an integrated gambling experience where someone can have one, you know, kind of, you know, locked into our experience once. They have one loyalty program across all of our businesses. You buy merchandise, you're incentive to game. You gamble, you're incentive to get a collectible, you know, an integrated experience. So we will be, I'll tell you this right now, we will be in every major market other than New York by next football season, you know, 15 to 20 states. That's Rubin with executive editor of sports business journal A Madcore and look, they're not in New York for two reasons. One is they got denied the permit there, but also a 51% tax on sports gambling revenue. Can you make money in the state of New York? Not entirely clear. I can't tell if they can be successful in this field because Draft Kings and Fandool have just been dominant and they're not making money. So Michael says to anyone that says to him, Hey, it's too late to get in this game. He says, how are these companies doing from a year ago? Well, Draft Kings is down. Let's see, 72% in the last 12 months. Flutter, which owns Fandool down 30%. Pen gaming is down 60% in the last 12 months.",https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2iE41vefT4k,84,2022-10-12 19:56:59
3175," and let's see, 72% in the last 12 months. Flutter, which owns Fandall, down 30%, Penn Gaming is down 60% in the last 12 months. So yes, it is late, but in this game, it's still very early, second or third inning, and the bottom line is he's one of those leaders. Mike Rubin, it's just so damn smart, I can't bet against him. Yeah, exactly, you came bet against him. They do have an advantage when it comes to the data on their customers, that of course will give them maybe the leg up against some of those bigger competitors that you just mentioned. It's going to be very, very expensive. The customer acquisition costs a number of estimates out there, but what they're going to have to spend in order to build up this business, that is going to cost a lot. Interesting that they do want to venture into this side of the sports industry. And then of course, Rochelle, the impact that this could potentially have on some of those publicly traded companies. When we talk about draft kings performing so poorly over the past year, Fandall also having a rough time over the last 12 months, if in fact, Michael Rubin is successful with this, that will also push out some of those profitability targets that we've heard from some of these bigger companies. I mean, speaking of profitability, he also talked about licensing, because he was saying, you know, perhaps people think licensing is an issue when it comes to expanding, but he was saying that prices are actually 30% to 40% cheaper than a year ago. So he was saying that his patients actually paid off. A lot of people who didn't have, who had the money to spend overpaid, and now he's like, well, we're in a good position. So clearly being strategic about this. So perhaps that could be where the profits of Bentley's going to come from, perhaps the profit that will end up making from all the licensing. Goes back to what Dave said. It's questionable, I think, but you don't want to get bet against Rubin. Take Michael's name out of it, I'd say no chance. Yeah. But I'm saying there's a chance. All right, well, we've got to take a break here. Coming up on the other side, we're counting down to the closing bill on Wall Street. You're still looking at mixed picture, S&P in the red, off just about 2% to the percent. We'll be right back. All right. All right. Yeah. Just about 90 seconds here until the closing bell. Gender Blueprint joining us in studio with a closer look if some of these movers, hey, Jared? Hey there. So, not a lot of big movement in the major indices. We didn't get any fireworks from the Fed minutes, from the prior meeting, and then we're expected. However, we are looking toward tomorrow's CPI report. We are expecting a moderation in the headline number, but an increase in the core number. And I think that's why we're seeing some muted action here. Do you have a new trajectories?",https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2iE41vefT4k,85,2022-10-12 20:03:09
3176," We are looking toward tomorrow's CPI report. We are expecting a moderation in the headline number, but an increase in the core number. And I think that's why we're seeing some muted action here. There's not in utilities and the other interest rates sector of real estate. We're going to get to the bond market in a second, but just want to note, energy staples and discretionary, those are in the green. And let's take a look at some charts now with about a minute, less than a minute to go. This is a 13 week T bill yield. This is very short duration. This tracks what the Fed is thinking, or what is anticipated to be done. It is up 19 basis points. A huge move today. So a relentless increase in the expect exosfire works tomorrow morning. Before we go here, I think we have time for one more heat map. And we do have that in terms of the travel section. Check out this. Royal City enough 11% today. He's a closing bell on Balsby. There is your closing bell on this huff day stocks ending the day on a downward note. Not a whole lot of action as you can see. The doubt down to 28 points. The S&P doubt about 12 in the NASDAQ barely slipping to the downside. Nine points. Not a whole lot of reaction to the Fed minutes. We're close to looking for broader markets. Let's bring in Eric Friedman, U.S. Bank asset management CIO and Hugh Roberts, quant insight head of analytics. Good to see you both. Eric, let's start with you. Any takeaway from the Fed minutes? Are you expect tighter, longer? Nothing's really changed in the dynamics here. I think it's a story that we've heard from the Fed most specifically post Jackson Hall, which is rates higher and higher for longer. I think that was really the key message coming out of this set of minutes. I think the key thing for us as we think about the really the talent of this year is not so much what happens next meeting. But what does it look like for the Fed in the first quarter of next year? By that point, we expect to have a little bit of guidance from companies, which should be a little more sobered and perhaps a bit more tepid than what we may hear right now. So our viewpoint is the bar is pretty high for the Fed to come off. It's correct rate path for this year. But if we get into the first quarter of next year with some downbeat company guidance, the Fed may start to waver at least a little bit. And Hugh, as you look at the Fed minutes, and also some of these data points that you know that the Fed is watching and really looking for this sustained inflation to start going down. What is your outlook? Yeah, I would largely echo Eric's comment first up. I think this year and the immediate next couple of meetings are pretty much locked in really 2023 and the outlook there is more important. I guess if we're trying to look a wee bit further ahead, I think the comments from Deputy Chair Brainard have been probably the most interesting because the messaging has been consistent. It's been about taking financial conditions. That's been true all year and as Eric said, it went up a gear after Jackson Hole. Brainard appears to be the one who is just flagging the fact that overseas market is seeing stress. We've seen obviously intervention in Dolly-N. We're all aware that Shenanigans going on here in the UK after the many budget a few weeks back. I know the whole kind of move fast and break things. I think in the States you're used to looking at things like inverted yield curves or credit spreads or things that might domestically be the things that break. But actually it's looking like it's international stuff that's breaking first and Brainard seems to be flagging that up a little bit. So very early days yet, it's not obvious she's got a consensus at all but she's the one potential outlier as things currently stand. Eric, what do you think this measure is in terms of the pricing activity that we're going to see between now and year end? Are we going to remain volatile or is more of that risk to the downside do you think from these levels? We think probably a little more risk to the downside. I would just tip my cap to Q and they're firm. They do great work on this topic specifically but just in terms of our read on things. We say really a couple things at work. Number one is that we think we're largely in sync with the feds most recent thoughts regarding the forward state of the curve. In other words, the market is really in tune with what the fed is thinking with respect to interest rate hikes. That's really the first repricing that we've had. You cover this as a team very well in the last.",https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2iE41vefT4k,86,2022-10-12 20:06:23
3177," In other words, the market is really in tune with what the Fed is thinking with respect to interest rate hikes. That's really the first repricing that we've had. You cover this as a team very well in the last segment. And we think what's next is the slowdown, almost the lagged impact of higher rates still elevated fuel costs, still elevated shelter costs. We think that's going to start to really weigh in on margins. And so we do think there's probably a little more downside. We wouldn't be abandoning ships, if you will, right now. But we do think that in terms of risk to the equity market, we'd still be leading a bit more defensive. As you pointed out, utilities and infrastructure, those have been areas that we've actually been, been really constructive on. They've been, we think on, on duly hits in recent days, those are getting more attractive. We stick around in energy as well. Those would be our top ideas right now. Here, you say the latest down move has not been a function of macro fundamentals. What are you seeing? Well, it's more of the fact that we're being uber tactical here to be fair. So, you know, the primary trend throughout 2022 has been at macro conditions for us equity markets have got worse. And that's largely a function of what we talked about just now, i.e. tighter financial conditions. And in particular, they're moving real yields and the move and credit spreads. What's interesting from a very short term perspective is that this latest down trade, and I'm talking in the last week now, our model value was actually flatlined. So that this very latest down move has been less justified by macro fundamentals than from much of the bear market price action of the last nine, 10 months. So if you are in a kind of repeat of the summer potential for a bear market squeeze, looking at positioning, looking at beaten up sentiment, I saw an interesting tweet today about inside of buying picking up tends to get people interested when, you know, CEOs are buying their own stocks. If you're thinking there's scope for a bit of a tactical squeeze within the context of the primary bear market, then what we're seeing at the moment actually is that S&P is around 6% cheap to our model value because macro conditions have kind of stabilized up at the lows. And this latest selloff has gone a little bit further. So still agree with the primary bearish dynamic that there's been a spouse, but there may be some hope for a little bit of a bear market squeeze. And Eric, there's some of the clients that you speak to. What lens are you suggesting that they really view this period through? Yeah, it's a great question. I think that, you know, for those that have capital that they need in the what's called the next three to six months, we think that like a great place to be is in very short duration of income. Well, for a long time, we just haven't been paid or shell to be involved in whatsoever in that part of the curve. Not to say that there isn't some potential price risk, but just as you hit on the earlier segment, if you're looking at corporate bonds and are spitting out 5, 5, 5, 6% yields, not a bad spot to be in very, very short maturities. I do think that for those clients that have the ability to kind of piece into stuff, we would not be aggressively involved in technology, we're just going to scratch right now. We do think that the supply, demand and balance is still skewed the wrong way for technology in the media term. But again, we do think that there's likely to be some rationalization towards the middle to the second half of next year for again, for longer term investors. So our viewpoint has been, look, take what you're given and this market, don't trade the market that you want to trade the market that you have. And so grabbing some yield up front makes sense. We do think that there's a time to again reconcile the second half of next year. We're just not there quite yet. And you, one of the challenges in this market now is a strong dollar. That of course is being felt on a global scale. We did get the earnings out from Pepsi this morning that were actually better than expected. And so we're wondering whether or not I guess how big of a threat that strong dollar would be to a name like Pepsi. What do you think today's results really tell us just about what we couldn't expect this earnings season? Well, from a macro perspective, I think the Pepsi earnings were bad news from the Fed's policymaking perspective, because it basically showed that they have pricing power and they're going to increase margins. And that's not good for the Fed who want to see demand slow down, obviously. More broadly, I agree totally that the strength of the dollar is going to be a key key issue for this.",https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2iE41vefT4k,87,2022-10-12 20:10:40
3178," on a Z demand slowdown, obviously. More broadly, I agree totally that the strength of the dollar is going to be a key key issue for this particular earnings season. On our analysis, we have the ability to break down patterns between, say, sectors and the strength of the dollar. And it's the independent pattern where we can out but we're able to strip out the isolated impact of the dollar on different assets. And what stands out on our analysis at the moment is that if you look at the likes of energy by the XLE, OIH, XOP, they're all comparatively indifferent to the dollar. It's not really a big driver of price action in the energy ETS at the moment. But it's technology that is most vulnerable. And that's true for XLK. It is true for something like consumer discretionary, where, of course, Amazon and Tesla are, I think, nearly 50% of that sector. And it's especially true for something like Sox, the semi-conduct, that ETF. So I think that's probably where, on our analysis, that's where potentially the most pain is going to be felt. Lots of great insights. They would do appreciate you both joining us, Eric Friedman and Hugh Roberts with your market insights. While investors watching tomorrow's inflation data closely and the data will have a big impact on millions of social security recipients, inflation from the third quarter is used to determine the cost of living adjustment or cola. Now, the adjustment for 2023 is likely to be 8.7% according to estimates from the senior citizens league. Now, that means the average monthly social security check would rise by $145. And that is the biggest jump since 1981. All right, well, coming up, the Amazon Labor Union faces its next test in upstate New York. We'll give you the latest when we come back.

3179," Apple is reportedly withholding its latest employee perks from a unionized store in Maryland. Apple, according to Bloomberg, has told retail and corporate employees that going to increase education and in some states' health benefits. However, employees at the one unionized Apple store in a Baltimore suburb will have to negotiate for those benefits via their collective bargaining arrangement. Now the news comes as employees at an Oklahoma City store are said to vote this week on joining a union. Apple shares closing down about half a percent in today's trade. Sure, no? Well, Apple rival Amazon, also dealing with unionization efforts starting today, workers at a warehouse near Albany, New York can vote in a pivotal union election. Yahoo, finance, senior tech reporter, Ali Garfinkle, joins us now with more. Hey, Ali. Hi, Shana, great to be here. So it's important to remember here this vote is pivotal. A victory for the Amazon labor union could be watershed. It could prove that they can really generate some momentum in more than one warehouse. And nurses are telling me that the ALU actually thinks they have a pretty decent shot here. The organizing has been organic and it's actually a relatively small number for the ALU. About 400 workers they're trying to organize, which is to be fair still a lot by NLRB standards. I'm looking for the Albany vote count to start on October 18th. Ali, big picture here. We hear a lot about the unionization effort across the country, but where are we overall? Overall Dave, I was talking to San Francisco State professor John Logan about this recently. And what he said is that in part this is actually a byproduct of the pandemic. You include down to the fact a lot of these unions were seeing, including the Amazon labor union, Trader Joe's union, that they're unconventional unions. The discontent that was kind of fermented by the pandemic has really facilitated and really helped unions gain momentum that they haven't necessarily had in decades. In the case of Amazon, we did see a petition for a vote in the inland empire near Los Angeles recently. And it's important to say though, nothing is all said and done. The odds are usually still in the employer's favor. And in the case of this vote that's coming in California potentially, the NLRB has not yet authorized that election. However, it's important to state that location here is important, particularly in the inland empire. I've talked to experts who've called it logistics central. So a vote there would really matter not only for warehouses, but for Amazon in particular. The company has actually invested more than 19 billion in the inland empire since about 2010. So, the messaging I'm getting out of Amazon as of today so far is that they are skeptical that that vote will come to fruition, but the either way, I'm looking for them to continue to fight. And overall, yeah, they have a lot of momentum, but would it be stopped cold in its tracks if we enter a recessionary environment? That. We shall wait and see. Ali Garfinkle, thanks so much. Appreciate that. Coming up, a Bank of America survey reveals significant differences between how millennials and older generations are investing. We'll break it down next. All right.",https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2iE41vefT4k,89,2022-10-12 20:19:15
3180," son The Well-being millennials are losing faith in the stock market as a way to build wealth. A recent Bank of America survey found that many are turning to alternative investments to find those returns. Here with more on that is Jeff Busconi, Bank of America Head of Private Bank Services. Jeff, welcome back to the show. So talk about the divergence in what we're seeing between some younger investors and older millennials. Sure, and thank you thanks for having me. It's great to be here with you again. Yes, so we did find in our survey some generational differences emerging. And in particular 75% of younger investors who were part of our survey indicated that they don't believe a traditional portfolio of stocks and bonds will generate above average returns over time and into the future. So that was really one of the major findings. We also found that younger investors were more inclined to have sustainable investment products in their portfolios and also wanting to have an impact through philanthropy with their wealth. Jeff, you mentioned the fact that this group of individuals is favoring alternative investment or really finding a reason to invest there. I guess what do you think is driving that lack of confidence when it comes to stocks and bonds? I think I would point to a couple of factors. First, you have to remember where we're coming from from a market standpoint. We've come through a fairly prolonged period of strong performance at the equity and bond markets. And of course, this year we've had considerably more volatility. So that may be causing some investors to think about investments outside of traditional investments. I also think the alternative investment universe continues to evolve. There's more and more access to alternative investments through platforms like ours here at Bank of America. And as access grows, interest may also be increasing. Remember this was historically the domain of institutions and endowments. The last thing I would point to is remember that this generation has really come of age during a period of extreme innovation. And so there may be a greater willingness here in this generation to embrace newer asset classes and different products. They're also coming of age at a time where crypto and NFTs have absolutely crashed in particular NFTs. Has that shied them forced in the shy away from some of those digital assets? You know, what we see around digital and this was picked up in the survey as well, there's a lot of innovation and development happening in that space. One will tell how it all plays out. If in our client base, our conversations are focused mostly on education.",https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2iE41vefT4k,90,2022-10-12 20:23:50
3181," in that space. Time will tell how it all plays out. Within our client base, our conversations are focused mostly on education. People want to learn more about the ecosystem. They want to understand what it is, how it works. And Jeff, I thought it was interesting as we had that crypto question in this study, looking at the discrepancy between those who thought they understood crypto well and whether they thought it would actually pay off as a longer term investment, break down some of that for us. Sure, again, I think what you're starting to see in the survey again is generational differences among investors. And as I just said, you know, the younger investors, college, 20 to 40, they've come of age in a period of just extreme innovation. So they may be willing to embrace newer asset classes, non-conventional forms of investment to a degree that maybe we haven't seen in prior generations. Again, I think time will tell when it comes to crypto. And certainly the current market environment is playing into the mindset here around crypto. Jeff, one thing that did stick out to me in this survey was that only half of wealthy parents considered their children well prepared to inherit their fortunes. The conversations that you've had with clients just the feeling out there, why do you think that is? Look, so I think you put your finger on one of the critical insights from the survey. We're all aware of the 84 trillion in wealth that's set to transfer here over the next two decades. And yet half just half of parents feel that their children are well prepared to inherit that wealth. For us, I think that speaks to a need, a continued need around a state planning, wealth in a state planning. Our advisors, our client teams need to really be having comprehensive holistic dialogues with families around a state planning. And it's not just the documents, the legal documents, its conversations around family dynamics, purpose, impact, all of the factors that go into having a really well thought out a state plan. And finally, we talk a lot about ESG investing in this space and it's been a hot topic across the country politically as well. Statistically, what is the survey showing about the drop-off between younger people and those over 43? So what the survey showed is about a quarter of all respondents have ESG and their portfolios. That 25% or so is driven heavily by this younger cohort of investors. Upwards of 70% of the younger investors have ESG and their portfolios. So there again, you see a divergence between the older generation of investors and the younger generation of investors. I think it's important to point out that there was a quarter of respondents had exposure and that's double the level that it was just four years ago in 2018. So this is an area that's growing rapidly and that's an area of focus particularly for younger investors who feel that this is just a smart way to invest. It's not a specific initiative or something separate. It's yet another way to have a positive impact on the world around them. It's growing rapidly as is the pushback to ESG investing as well, right? Thank you. Jeff was going to do good stuff. Appreciate that. Continuing the conversation about young investors now, Goldman Sachs taking a survey of its 2400 interns to get their perspective on the world today and some fascinating takeaways including how they invest, which unsurprisingly lines up with the wealthy Millennial survey, 28% invest in stocks, 15% of ETFs and 12% in cryptos. You might ask, why do we care what Goldman Sachs interns think? This is an extraordinary cross section of young America, Taipei, highly successful young people, 68 languages spoken among these 2400 interns. They're not your average run of the Mill interns as all I'm trying to point out here, but some interesting takeaways. What struck you? You know, what struck me was some of their priorities when looking for a job. You mentioned the fact that a lot of them are Taipei. Obviously, very, very driven group of individuals, 34% saying that they're putting a huge emphasis on what they do day to day, 21% say who their colleagues will be only 20%.",https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2iE41vefT4k,91,2022-10-12 20:27:38
3182," A very, very, very driven group of individuals, 34% saying that they're putting a huge emphasis on what they do day to day, 21% say who their colleagues will be. Only 12% though putting companies' purpose. And the reason I bring this up is because when we talk about Gen Z, when we talk about this generation, other results have shown this real focus on a company's purpose, how that is among the top priorities here for somebody who is seeking a job. So that not necessarily reflected in this survey, at least when you take a look at majority, also only 8% focusing on advancement. I thought that that would have been a little bit higher as well. And then also just plans to retire. And I like this because they're very optimistic, 35%, saying that they want to retire between the ages of 55 and 65. On the other hand, 29% nearly a third want to work as long as possible. I also want to redo this survey in 10 years. And on the find out, those 29% of people would still say that they want to work as long as possible. I think they will. Yeah, I don't know. Check in on that every decade. I think for every decade you work, that enthusiasm is probably going to tap for doubt. I thought it was interesting. Obviously, it's a very day to driven business that they're in. When it came to where they turned to find their truth when they came to getting information, 40% turned to friends and family, 35% turned to digital news outlets. So really this shift is where people are getting their information from. They consider clearly friends and family the more trusted source that they tend to go to. And then social media came in at about 14%. So I know, obviously, Twitter has this, it seems like this has this massive outreach but in terms of where people sort of get their final information from and the sources that they trust, I thought that was interesting. And I know we talk a lot about the return to work. And 99% of them said that they believe that relationships are best formed in person. Because there is something that gets lost if you don't get to have that. At least at least some sort of face-to-face interaction. So you really get a sense of people. A lot can get lost in translation over text or video chat. I was happy to hear that. You mentioned Twitter. TikTok was a surprise. Only 1% of these interns post on that. They all said really overwhelmingly Instagram is their platform, both posting and following. How do they pay for stuff? 47% use an app. Only 2% cash. A lot of fascinating takeaways. They prefer shopping in person over all of the time. I was surprising to me. I would have thought the online app would have been much much. Yeah, 2% cash is not king for the kids. Maybe in the markets right now. Not for the young people. App on their phone. You know, I'm slowly using Apple Pay more and more. When she start, it is life changing. I'll say that. All right, well, come here. Next, Microsoft revealing a slew of new products today. We'll tell you all about them next.",https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2iE41vefT4k,92,2022-10-12 20:32:30
3183,"e Apple and Google are among the major names in tech unveiling their newest products in recent weeks, and now it's Microsoft's turn. The company unveiled a slew of new Surface products earlier today. You said, Medi, Microsoft corporate vice president joins us, along with Yahoo Finance tech editor Dan Howley to break it all down. So thank you for joining us. I want to first get your instincts here. We have a very crowded market. What were the standout products for Microsoft so far? Today there's really a couple of big things. One is the next major update to Windows 11, which really makes a lot of improvements in accessibility, insecurity, and productivity for people as well as better gaming. And then a number of updates with our new devices on our Surface line. So we have a new Surface laptop 5 and a Surface Pro 9, both of which are 50% faster than the predecessors. They're amazing for hybrid work and learning. And the Pro 9 has new capabilities that let you take advantage of the cloud and AI to do some incredible creativity that you haven't been able to do before. You said this is Dan. I just want to get a sense of who you think the customers are for these types of devices, really. You have the hybrid Pro 9, you have the laptop, you have the studio, and you have some adaptive technology there. Who's really the audience here? Yeah, good question, Dan. It's a pretty broad audience. So if we start with the two most mainstream products we have. We have the Surface Pro 9, which is our 2-in-1. It's our tablet that can replace a laptop. It's designed for the mobile professional that likes to move around or the person who's running from the house, running the home and moving around. It's a laptop and a keyboard. It's a great device. We also have then the laptop 5, which is essentially similar class, but more of a laptop form factor. Again, great for businesses, business professionals, but also great for students and great for people in the home. Those are our mainstream devices. They start at $9.99 and they go up from there. Then we have a very high end, probably our best creativity device. It's the Surface Studio 2 Plus. It's designed for creators, professionals, programmers, designers, graphic designers in enterprise. That's a more expensive device, obviously, but it is the absolute best creation device. Finally, as you mentioned, we do some number of great accessories for people with disabilities. One in five people in the US deal with some form of disability and these devices let you use your Surface devices in a much easier form. I guess where are you seeing most people use their computers now? We're in the hybrid work world at this point. It seems like it's staying that way. Where are they really sticking to? That games chat, what is it? Sorry, what was the last part you said, Dan? It games chat or work. How are they using this? They're using it for quite a variety of things. For people at work, they're using their laptops for obviously remote work. They're doing video conference calling. We've seen 300 million more apps use like Discord, Slack, Teams, ReChadternet is now used in a very less way from home. Also, of course, for a creation with Microsoft 365 and productivity devices. Then a lot of gaming. A lot of gaming gets done on it. Gaming's still at an all time high.",https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2iE41vefT4k,93,2022-10-12 20:36:35
3184," Also, of course, for a creation with Microsoft 365 and productivity devices. And then a lot of gaming, a lot of gaming gets done on it. Gaming's still at an all time high. So we see a lot of that in home use. We see people doing things like telehealth. They're doing online shopping from home. They're doing communications and connecting with family and friends. So they're doing a variety of tasks. As a whole, what we've seen over the last two years, use of Windows PCs and Windows 11 is up significantly. It's up 10% total minutes per device. We see 20% more people using Windows PCs in the past. And that's because the relevancy of the PC in our lives has probably never been greater. And use of the, we are seeing a slow down overall than what we're seeing with PC demand. How is Microsoft navigating this space? And what does the next generation of the PC look like? Yeah, it's a great question. You're right. We're in a tough macro environment. So it's very hard these days, whether it's interest rates up or the war in Europe and the like, a big part of what's good about the PC is it is really the best value for your money if you're buying an electronics device. And a big part of that is, as I was just talking about, usage is up, that's the proof in there. Where we see things going is we see continued new use cases opening up on the PC. Like I mentioned, they're being used now in a way that they weren't before for video conferencing because of the remote work. We're seeing, like I said, online shopping quite a bit. I saw recently that you were just talking a little bit about how new generation likes to shop in person, but broadly people want to shop at home. And we've seen a huge amount of that. We offer a coupon feature in Edge now. We've saved over $1.4 billion for people with coupons. The average person can save $100 when shopping online using Microsoft Edge browser. So I think we're going to see some of these new use cases open up for shopping, for health, for gaming, for creation. And I think that will continue. All right, well, a big thank you for joining us this afternoon, you, Seth Medi, and our very own Dan Howley. Thank you both. All right, coming up, Major League Baseball hopes it's deal with CBD maker Charlotte's Web becomes a home run. Charlotte's Web CEO tells us how the deal came together next.

3185," To do this, can we grind the butter and sugar into egg whites? Let's slow heat it up. Then webpage Take me out to the cannabis game Major League Baseball, the first of the four major US sports leagues to sign a sponsorship deal with the CBD company. Technically a cannabis compound, Charlottes Web today becomes MLB's official CBD company. Jack Torturellis is the CEO of Charlottes Web and joins us now good to see you. Want to talk about how this deal came together and what it means for the industry. If you could just dispel a little bit of the misconception out there about what exactly is CBD and what's its application for athletes? Yeah, so sure great thanks for having me on you know simply put MLB and CW Charlottes Web are changing the future of wellness for athletes and fans together. You know MLB's decision reflects what players and fans really want today by bringing botanical wellness options to support the everyday lives of athletes and fans particularly around mental wellness. You know things in each states like staying calm under pressure recovery after exercise, maintaining the focus when it counts and sleeping like a champ. You know these are players that are on the road 162 games in a season seven months a year and we really believe that they have, they believe quite strongly that having the mental balance, the balance between the mental health and the physical health is super important and that's why they chose to open up the category and do it with Charlottes Web which is you know the industry founder of CBD and the leading company in CBD and purely because we have and we're uniquely qualified to be able to do this with the science and the credibility we have including the NSF certification that we got for our sports line and NSF as you know is the goal standard for sort of quality in CBD and botanicals. The sponsorship deal it's clearly huge for your company it's huge for your industry what do you think this does just in terms of the conversation that will likely have around CBD and the adoption that we could see as a result of it? Yeah I think it's a game changer for us and particularly given you know 180 million fans all of their social platforms that we now have access to is a microphone and the microphone is going to be really used for education telling telling consumers telling athletes telling trainers you know what CBD is and what it isn't it's not marijuana it's hemp and I think that's an important part of what they want to get across and we want to get across and we think it's huge for the industry and most importantly huge for Charlottes Web which again you know is uniquely qualified from the science and credentials point of view to be able to have this partnership come to life and I also want to point out that Charlottes Web has five of seven hemp patents and again the credentials are unquestionable which is why NSF certified our products to support. Doc mentioned it's the first of the four major US sports to have a CBD deal. How much resistance was there to a sponsorship deal like this and do you think the other leagues will follow? I don't think there was a resistance at all I think and the MLB was really a first mover a thought leader in this space very aligned in terms of wellness for players botanical wellness and again helping the mind not just the body and so you know the deal came together with two like-minded organizations wanting to do you know wellness solution for their players and it was just a great process and a real partnership it's not what I would call a traditional you know sort of sponsorship deal but it truly is a partner a partnership and as you may know that there are MLB is now a shareholder in Charlottes Web as a result of this this strategic partnership. You know that's interesting there why would you say it's not typically why you wouldn't describe it as a traditional sponsorship type deal. Yeah because it's not a it's not a pay to play right I mean the two parties now with MLB",https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2iE41vefT4k,96,2022-10-12 20:47:15
3186," Typically, why you wouldn't describe it as a traditional sponsorship type deal? Yeah, because it's not a it's not a pay to play, right? I mean, the two parties now with MLB being a shareholder in Charlotte's web, our interests are aligned to grow value through wellness and through our products that offer those solutions for need states, the consumers and players and their fans, ultimately have. So both parties are aligned in a mission of wellness. Both parties are aligned in terms of quality and safety for athletes, first and foremost. And it was really coming together with two like-minded organizations. I wanted to see this coming live. So what's the plan, Jacques, to pursue teams, specific players? And beyond that, the other leagues, the NBA, the NHL and the NFL? Yeah, look, I think all the leagues will ultimately get there. And again, congratulations to Major League Baseball for being at the forefront and being the first mover. I think right now, look, it's day one of our partnership and what we're really focused on is amazingly sort of execution excellence to show the value that our products bring to fans and consumers, to show we can do for players. And ultimately, that's what we're focused on right now. In terms of influences and teams, I strongly believe that influences use of products and are real advocates that they're authentic and not just paid spokesperson. And so if we do anything like that, it'll be with someone who's credible, authentic, and uses of products. Do you know specific players that use the products? I really don't want to talk about that, but I do know, you know, I do know players that have, yeah, and that have been public about it. I wanted to give you a minute to just tell people that don't know the story of Charlotte's Web. It's not about the nursery rhyme. This is Charlotte as one of the more influential people in this industry in terms of how changed medical marijuana laws some feel across the country if you could give us a bit of that backstory. Yeah, no, it's great. You know, Charlotte Figgie was, you know, the first sort of person that came into contact with the brands and the brothers. The company was founded by the seven Stanley brothers. All still shareholders, all still engaged in the company when direction or another. And it was about having a little girl who had 300 seizures, you know, a week and finding a hemp based solution for her. Our original formula, which is still the same formula we have today, you know, some 10 years later, really gave her her life back and her family's life back. And so, you know, at one point, there was a 15,000 patient waiting list for our products and the brothers gave product away because they believe so strongly in helping, you know, from a wellness point of view and providing quality of life for people with our products. And on the back of that story, we created an industry. You know, this is, this was the first company in CBD. It's the market leader in CBD. It's the only company that has seed to shelf sort of quality standards and vertical integration. And so we're very proud of the origins. We're very proud of the family and we're delighted to be able to bring this moment to them and our shareholder is more, more, more generally. Congrats, Nadeel. Interesting to see where it heads from here. CEO of Charlotte's Web, Jacques Tortoroli. Thanks so much. Appreciate that. All right, over to Sean. And now we look at what's moving after hours. All right, Dave, let's take a look at some of these trending ticketers. We have applied materials, a duck creek, a victorious secret. We also have digital world acquisition core of news breaking here just a second. And go, let's kick it off with applied materials. The stock moving to the downside here off just about 1.5% news from the company saying that they are cutting their fourth quarter adjusted EPS forecast, missing the streets estimate. A lot of this has to do with the new export regulations that we got from the Abbot in administration last week. Take a look at that five day chart. You can see the drop shortly after those regulations were announced the stock off nearly 15% in the past five days. It's been a tough go at it for the stock since the start of the year, year to date, off just about 51%. Let's take a look at duck creek here, the soft wear play moving to the upside up just around 6.5% here. The company raising its 2023 revenue guidance that beat the streets estimates now expecting 320 million to 336 million. The estimate out there was for 325 million for the fourth quarter results beating on both the top and bottom lines here, the fourth quarter adjusted EPS.",https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2iE41vefT4k,96,2022-10-12 20:49:57
3187," $336 million. The estimate out there was for $325 million for the fourth quarter results, beating on both the top and bottom lines here. A fourth quarter adjusted EPS coming in at $3 cents. Revenue at $80.7 million. The estimate out there was for $73.2 million. Let's take a look at Victoria Seeger. Remember this company is starting to trade as a standalone company just over a year ago. You can see the stock moving to the upside here. Up just around 4% the move higher coming ahead of its investor day tomorrow. Now the company releasing its strategic growth plan ahead of that investor day. They will focus on three areas. Strength in core, ignite growth, transform the foundation. A lot of it has to do with growth adding brands, especially what they're seeing on an international level. They also updated their guidance here. They see third quarter operating income to come in at the top end of the range here today. Though you can see it's been a rough go for Victoria Seeger. It's been around 41%. I also want to take a look at digital world acquisition here, especially in after hours and move to the upside. You can see it up just around 8.7% news here that Google is adding true social to its play store. Now the news here coming to Google saying that it is approved a true social for distribution on its play store. The Google spokesperson telling Bloomberg that true social can distribute the app on Google Play as long as it complies with its developer guidelines. So again, the stock moving to the upside here after hours up nearly 8% of course, so you're to date still well in the red off just around 68%. Michelle. All right, thanks, Sean. Well, my stock to watch for tomorrow is Delta. We've been talking about airlines today. The airline reporting earnings ahead of the open and results are expected to show profits and revenue rising from a year ago. The estimates earning for share of $1.55 on revenue of $12.89 billion. Now the stock has had a rough year so far underperforming the SFP 500 the last three months you saw they down to 6%. But there is some optimism on the sector as people return to traveling post pandemic, especially with the strong dollar. So certainly one to watch for tomorrow morning. All right, coming up Netflix has its site set on the Jersey Shore. We'll tell you why and what the streaming diet hopes to accomplish after the break.

3188," 2 exhale You know, I'm gonna get a little bit of a little bit of the same thing. Just my back last year from victims families, Dahmer, monster is Netflix's second most watch series. Yahoo, finances, Alexandra cannell is here with the details. All we talked about the fact that it was a hit right off the bat. I haven't watched it yet, but people love it. People love it. I haven't watched it yet either. I am. I'm happy to watch it. I've heard it's an emotional roller coaster, but America has a massive amount of money. I've seen it in a mass more than 701 million hours viewed, making it the second biggest series to date for Netflix behind stranger things. So it actually de-throwned Bridgerton. And you know when you're dethroning Bridgerton that you have a massive, massive hit on your hands. For a little context behind that number, stranger things season four racked up 1.35 billion hours viewed in the first month. So the fact that Dahmer even came close is a big deal. So I think it's really a big deal. So I think we're doing really well. Great thing for Netflix, but also a great thing for Ryan Murphy. This is his third year into his five year contract with Netflix. He signed a $300 million deal back in 2018. And this is really the first series from him to really drum up that big response that Netflix wanted. So people have been a little critical saying whether or not Dahmer is really worth that $300 million price tag. And it's not going to be giving out $300 million contract. And Shonda got one too. She got one too. And that was huge to follow up. That was the heyday of Netflix when they didn't care. They were just giving out money left and right. That's not going to happen in car. But true crime. Obviously it's a win every time. And obviously a lot's changed since those 300 million dollar deals, including a considerable subscriber fall off this year for Netflix. But the streaming giant has ended running to build a massive production company. And I think it's going to be a little bit more about that. Yes, you said it 300 acres Jersey Shore about 50 miles from New York City, New Jersey governor. Phil Murphy is all about this. He's been dying to bring some more Hollywood productions. Two New Jersey. There's a lot of artists. There's a lot of creatives there, especially with the close proximity to New York. And if this deal does go through, it'll be the second largest studio for the company after New Mexico. So we could be able to do that. So I'm really happy to be able to do that. So I fully approve this move by Netflix. But we'll see what happens once this deal officially goes through. They were in talks last year. So despite the profitability struggles, despite the fact that they've been losing subscribers, they still seem to be full steam ahead on this. So that just indicates to me that they want to produce more content and better content. And all they can do out trying to track those new subscribers. All right, it's been a scary year for snap. Shots shares down more than 75% this year. But snap rolling out a new activation during this spooky season. You can now virtually try on and buy Halloween costumes directly on the Appia partnership with costume design and manufacturing company disguise. We decided to give it a try and sticking with the streaming theme there from Ali Netflix and Disney and Disney. I thought I'd go with the cobra Kai since that season five debut has been so successful. And Shana, Shana, what'd you go with? I did. Hocus Pocus. Sticking with the streaming theme here Disney plus. What is it's posture? Is your thing? No. Swap game. You guys can tell how much I've watched either of those and there's there's Jared Blyckery in the Ghost Busters.

3189," I think this is a really cool tool, especially being able to buy them right there on the app. I mean, I love it. I love how easy they're making it for people because you know, there's always that rush. The closer you get to Halloween and it was like fighting for this and that. If you could just sit down and do it. Now the fit though might be an issue. I don't know because I feel like some of these Halloween costumes are quite small. So if you can look as good as you do with the pictures, I'm more for it. But I think I want to try it on in person. Just in case, although Jared is really selling me on this on this Ghostbusters outfit. I think you look very so serious. I think that's all done by me. I think it's interesting. Look, Snap has had a rough go obviously. It's the ad market and social has been difficult. But activations like this are smart. They have a really interesting activation with SoFi, Stadium where the Rams play football, the NFL's Rams where they use a filter, a snap filter on the jumbo charts, although show a fan and make them look all silly and crazy. I don't know what the investor story is per say. But it's nice to see some new activations. Well, and they're also not the only ones who are doing this too, right? We talked about Amazon. You're able to virtually try on shoes. They launched that earlier this summer. Pinterest and Google has also been starting to leverage AR to try and really separate themselves from some of the competition out there. And Lauren, some of those more customers. So I think it's a smart move from Snapchat. They need though. My one criticism, they need some more costumes though in terms of options. So we're going to have a lot of options at least just yet. But I might be co-brokai, Rachelle. I might be going there. Yeah, you're right. Trigney. It suits you. It suits you. I'm not going to lie. It did seem like your thing. And you had the serious face and the growth of the sleeves and everything. John's show, baby. I couldn't show. And you look lovely. And you look lovely, sort of. Well, that'll do. We'll have to leave it there. We'll have to see what we'll wear on Halloween. But that'll do it for today's edition of Yaya's Fine Arts Life. To the store at 3PM Eastern, we'll see you then. Bye.

Earlier in the case, Jones had been found liable for defamation. He is infamous, of course, for touting conspiracy theories and with sued by the families and that agent after repeatedly and falsely claiming the school showed shooting was a hoax with plaintiffs saying they were harassed by Jones' followers. And by dance, the owner popular social media app Tiktok reportedly in talks with record labels to create a music streaming service for two rivals Spotify and Apple Music. The Sequoans the Wall Street Journal, that service would reportedly be integrated inside of Tiktok. Bitesense actually already has a music streaming service called Rezzo, but it's limited to countries like India and Indonesia. Rezzo's poor revenue streams are reportedly a sticking point with record labels, right? All right, everyone. Well, let's keep tracking the markets here this morning, the Dow Jones Industrial Average, the S&P 500 and the NASDAQ composite, all deeply in the red here, this after a hotter than expected is just seeing CPI print. And we've seen this decline initiated exactly in time with when that CPI report dropped from more on today's activity. Let's get on over to Jared Blyckery at the Wi-Fi Interactive. Jared, what are you seeing in the tape this far? Ouch. That's what I'm saying today. Let's take a look at the NASDAQ. That's down the most here, over 2 and a quarter percent. Over the last four days, so this week it's down another 4%. Let's check out the last seven days because we had some down drafts last week down another 9%. When we look inside the market, only energy has been in the green crude oil, actually under a little bit of water here. And we'll talk about that in a second, but consumer discretionary, just taking it on the chin and down another 2.75% followed by tech and then real estate. Let's take a look inside the NASDAQ here. We got Amazon down 4.5%. I believe it's just about to test its lows of the years. Here's the year-to-date chart. You can see, indeed, here we go trying to see if we can bounce from there, but too early to see if that's going to happen just yet. Tesla hitting another one year low. It has now taken out these May, June, July, rounded bottom lows here, so that is down 40% this week. And if you want to know the culprit, you got to take a look at the US dollar. I'm going to show you one of our screens here. This is our heat map of the US dollar versus everything else. The pound, a very interesting scene that's going on there, also the Japanese yen. By the way, the pound, the Bank of England, maybe scrapping those tax cuts in favor of, guess what, tax heights in a month, but that US dollar very much weighing on equity markets here also want to get a quick check of crude oil as a lot of criticism heaped on OPEC plus, including the international energy agency itself, haven't seen that in a while. So what's going on here? Crude oil down 4.10% of a percent, guys. Jarra Blickery, thanks so much.

3193," Music Music Music Music Music Music Music Music More pressure for Coles. The longtime activist semester is now urging the company to make changes to its board, including replacing the chairman or face another proxy fight. Coles shares are down by nearly 50% so far this year. This is where we find Sazie's. I got to say I thought the activists had already done this. Like they've leveled so much at the company I just figured that this was already part of it. This is, right. This is McHellam and Jonathan Duskett and he's been on many times with us talking about his views on Coles. Well, guess what? He's still over 5% holder in Coles and he's tired of this crap. He's an ovary. He just doesn't understand why you still have the chairman of the company that's Peter Bonepartth continuing to lead this company in that capacity. He's been on this board for 14 years and I think Jonathan really put a lot of cut up him briefly this morning. He put a lot of thought, I think, to crafting this letter. He wants to work with Coles, except that Coles is bored. Notably, Bonepartth has not want to work with him and really drive any change. This has been an absolute disastrous year for this company. I would argue disastrous three years under CEO, Michelle Gast, terrible job. This year, you came out of the second quarter with a major inventory bulge. Oh, guess what? Keep in mind a couple of months ago, they had a really what appeared to be a solid offer to take Coles' private at $53 a share. Look where this stock is trading out right now. It's $26. That is massive value destruction. What Duskett is calling here, he's tired of Peter Bonepartth. He's tired of some other board members that what he calls a shadow board that is preventing the company from making any operational changes. He wants some of these long-tangled Coles people off this board so some positive fundamental changes can happen. He's not calling for the company to be sole per say. He just wants to see it better run so the stock price could go up because the results improve. It really is that simple and worth noting too. It is interesting. I remember very briefly covering Jones' a power group when Bonepartth was CEO many years ago. He didn't want to sell the company back then and that's why in many respects he was ousted and it looks like he's running the same plane book at Coles. But again, this is situation not going anywhere and frankly guys it's one that continues to baffle me. How this board can continue to be overbordered with cushy paychecks at the same time they're not delivering. Same goes for the management team. It's really, really strange. Coles shares down 47% a year to date. We're continue to track those shares of Kate, S.S. We're coming up on the other side of this short break. Our founder and CEO Kathy Wood.

3194," An exclusive interview you do not want to miss this. It is Thursday, October 13th here in New York City on Brad Smith with Julie Hyman and Brian Stasi and Ugly Day on Wall Street after another red hot inflation report. CPI month over month coming in at 4 tens of a percent in a move higher. The economic data keeps on coming. Jewels over to you for some housing news as well right now. 6.92 percent Brad that is now the average 30 year fixed rate mortgage. That data just coming out to us from Freddie Mac. 6.92 percent by the way is the highest going back to April of 2002. All of this of course goes back to the Fed raising interest rates and also has already had ripple effects throughout the housing market putting pressure on pricing, putting pressure on demand and affordability. We've been watching these mortgage numbers very, very closely because obviously they have really ratcheted up the monthly cost for people who are taking out a 30 year mortgage in order to buy a house. So we've got that number, we've got that CPI number all of it pointing to continued inflation at least for now. But now we're joined by someone who has her eyes on potential deflation. That of course is Kathy Wood, our Founder and CEO and you recently wrote an open letter to the Fed where you warned about deflation. We talked to Michael Darda of MKM at the top of the show where he said the Fed is making the mistake of looking at backward looking indicators. What should the Fed be looking at Kathy when it's trying to really assess what is happening with inflation? Sure. Hi Julie. Hi.",https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6_2e_wGpQzc,3,2022-10-13 14:05:29
3195," What should the Fed be looking at, Kathy, when it's trying to really assess what is happening with inflation? Sure, hi, Julie, and Brian. Well, if you look at what's happening in the pipeline, what you're seeing in terms of commodity prices are some very serious declines both from their peaks and year over year now. So that is sort of, we would say that's upstream inflation that is heading towards the PPI and then ultimately the CPI. So we've got gold prices, and in fact, I looked at them yesterday. I had thought that the last two years gold had been trading within a 1700 to nearly $2,100 range, and that's true it has, and it has broken down. This is a really good leading indicator of inflation. What caught my surprise yesterday was looking at where gold was in 2011, it was roughly this level. So you can say since 2011, more than 10 years, we haven't had a big burst in a big breakout in the gold price. And that is informing our decision here. Gold is a leading indicator of inflation, and it has not broken out, it is breaking down. And then the second thing that we're looking at is the inventory glutt around the world, and especially in the United States, it looks like some of the best supply chain managed companies in the world have overordered, they ignored their automated enterprise resource planning system so ERP systems and double ordered triple ordered so that Nike, for example, its sales were up only three and a half percent globally last quarter, and yet its inventory was up 44%, and in the United States, they were up 68%, and if you look at it in transit, they're up 85%. So that's just one indication we're seeing lots of inventory overhangs, and even online sales are suffering. Amazon just had its second prime day, and it showed no increase, which is really from a year over year, which is telling us that either units are down or prices are down. So I think the CPI that we got today is a lagging indicator. It always is a lagging indicator, and we're seeing a lot of prices in the pipeline that are falling. So, Kathy, let's talk about what this means for the Fed, and your open letter to the Fed, where you urge them to consider some of what you're talking about right now. The market after today's data is now more fully pricing, and not just a 75 basis point increase at this upcoming meeting, but at the one after that as well. Do you think the Fed should be done? Do you think they should even raise 75 basis points at this upcoming meeting, or do you think they should stop here and give some time for their increases to make their way through the economy? Yes, as we're thinking about this question, we compare what Chairman Powell is doing to what Chairman Volker did in the late 70s, early 80s, when he was fighting an inflation problem that had been building for 15 years, Vietnam War, great society closing the gold window. That was a real inflation problem that built up over 15 years. This inflation problem has been 12 to 15 months by the time the Fed started addressing it, and we think it's much more a function of supply chain imbalances caused by COVID, and then again, by Russia's invasion of Ukraine. These are very, very different circumstances. So what the Fed has done this time around is it has increased interest rates. If they go another 75 basis points, which is very likely on November 2nd, they will have increased interest rates from 0.25 to 4%. And that's a 16 fold increase. What did Volker, in the early 80s, he took interest rates from 10 to 20%. That's a two fold increase after consumers and businesses had gotten used to...",https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6_2e_wGpQzc,4,2022-10-13 14:09:33
3196," interest rates from 10 to 20%. That's a twofold increase after consumers and businesses had gotten used to dealing with inflation and working around it over 15 years. This is a real shock to the system. And I do believe we will see the ramifications. In many ways, we're seeing housing shutting down. And I think we're gonna see a lot of other activities shutting down as well. We believe we're in a recession and we believe this recession now will be sustained. And if we see an increase in GDP, it's probably because either inventories are continuing to increase or imports are coming down as companies try to unwind their inventories. Kathy, so do you see a severe recession? And then how long do you think this bear market will continue? Well, what's interesting, I think many people are coming around to the idea that we're in a recession or we're going into a recession. The first two quarters with real GDP growth negative to us means we're in a recession. And now that many people are worried and are beginning to see recession for us far as the eye can see, we are looking at this recession a little bit differently. We think it's going to be a function of this massive inventory overhang and that it's going to be a serious inventory correction, but it's not going to be anything like we saw in 0809. That was a systemic financial problem caused by the mortgage and financial meltdown. We don't think this is the same thing. So now that many economists are starting to agree with us that we're in a recession or going into a recession, we feel that they might become a little bit too alarmist. If this is just an inventory recession and I think the Fed will have a lot to do with whether or not it is. This is a shock though to the system and this idea that we have an inventory overhang, we think it's going to get bigger as consumers pull back low saving rates, 3.5% versus 8% where it was before COVID. And so we'll see. We think this holiday season is going to be pretty tough. And so as you kind of read it, you're shopping list for that holiday season, Kathy, and you think about some of the ways that equity valuations are starting to price in that recession to the best of their ability. Is there a big buy that you now kind of think through or evaluate going into the end of the year here? Well, you have to consider the source here and our focus, our sole focus, is on disruptive innovation. And we also believe that innovation solves problems. We had a tough time going into COVID with our kind of strategy and then we had a boom in our strategy during COVID because guess what? We needed the genomic revolution to help sequence the coronavirus and figure out tests and vaccines and our kinds of companies helped with that. We think with supply chain issues and with the food and energy prices caused by this shock, this rushes invasion of Ukraine, that once again, innovation is going to help solve these problems. Electric vehicles, there's an accelerated consumer preference shift towards electric vehicles like Tesla because of oil prices. And we think there's no stopping that trend now. And in terms of food prices, we do believe that gene editing is going to help us figure out how to produce crops in areas that are less fertile than the Ukraine, the bread basket of Europe, with less water, less fertilizer, less pesticide. So we're going to continue to see the miracles associated with the genomic revolution. But our other strategies as well, whether we're talking about robotics, solving the labor shortage, energy storage, I mentioned electric vehicles pulling us away from oil consumption, artificial intelligence, which is going to help every company become...",https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6_2e_wGpQzc,5,2022-10-13 14:13:56
3197," energy storage, I mentioned electric vehicles pulling us away from oil consumption, artificial intelligence, which is going to help every company become more competitive if they use their data and combine it with other data in effective ways. And then blockchain technologies, which is going to take the middle men out of a lot of businesses and take the cost out of a lot of businesses, helping us to solve this inflation problem. So again, consider the source. We think innovation solves problems. It certainly gave us an appreciation of that during COVID. Our strategy was high flying. And we think we have even more problems right now. So stay tuned. Kathy, this economic shock that you talk about in large part at the hands of the Fed, does that cause a shock to one of your long term holdings in Tesla in terms of the stock price and also the company's financials? Well, certainly all stocks are experiencing difficulty in this environment as the market tries to understand how far the Fed is going to go and how deep this recession is going to be. So Tesla, as I mentioned, is a solution to the problem. It's very interesting. If you look at gasoline demand this summer in the United States, it dropped below COVID levels, the worst of COVID, and it dropped to levels that we have not seen since 1997. That's real demand destruction. And it couldn't have happened. We do not believe without electric vehicles at the margin, taking huge share from traditional automobiles. So if we had to be concerned about an industry, it would be the traditional auto industry. We think that gas powered vehicles are going to be obsolete within the next five to ten years. And the traditional auto industry has to figure out a way to migrate into electric vehicles and into the next big phase, which we think Tesla is leading, the autonomous taxi platform phase. So lots of changes here. Traditional industries are in harm's way as innovation pushes through accelerated by some of the turmoil out there. Kathy, when we last talked back in the spring, I believe it was just at the beginning of the Elon Musk Twitter saga. Now we are maybe, maybe getting to a little bit of closure in that case. But I would post you the same question that I asked you then, because a lot of time is elapsed in different events have happened. Are you at all concerned about Musk's attention wavering now that it looks like he is in fact going to be taking over and likely at least having a pretty heavy hand in running Twitter? Well, we are prolific users of Twitter. Our gives away its research. We give away our research not when it's finished, but as it's evolving. And our most prolific platform, social platform out there is Twitter. I'm kind of excited to see what Elon will do. I actually think he'll work closely with Jack Dorsey and maybe open up the ecosystem, take away the censorship, make it much more transparent. And I think add more value to that ecosystem. You don't think that it'll be a mess if that happens. It'll just be sort of a free for all where it's tougher to find commentary of value. You know what's interesting about Twitter and we found this. We have a lot of debate around our own strategies. We can filter that debate ourselves. So we can unfollow people if we think there's bad behavior, but that's our choice. And we can follow those people who we think are moving discussions, whether it's about innovation or the economy, moving discussions along. So I think there's a lot of wisdom out there. And we're kind of sick of the nonsense that we see on some of these social platforms. And Twitter, I think, is going to give us more tools.",https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6_2e_wGpQzc,6,2022-10-13 14:18:09
3198," And we're kind of sick of the nonsense that we see on some of these social platforms. And Twitter, I think, is going to give us more tools to filter out the nonsense and get right down to business. I certainly would like to filter out a lot of the nonsense sometimes on their caddy. I want to ask you more broadly about our guests and your funds. I was looking at art K in particular and the fun flows that we have seen, which were seeing sort of bigger swings to the up end of the downside earlier in the year. They've gotten a little more muted as of late. You talk a lot about your three to five year time horizon, which I think makes sense, but I wonder how long how patient investors are going to be particularly in an environment where they are seeing losses, not just in our K, but in lots of other areas as well. Yes. And I think one thing that helps our clients is our research. And they see that it's first principles research. We have the long term time horizon. And we're seeing spectacular exponential growth opportunities. And not only one by one, the various platforms I just described, but the convergence of those platforms. So one ask her of feeding another. And I think many of our clients understand that they're short innovation, truly disruptive innovation. If you own the NASDAQ or the NASDAQ 100 right now, and you look through that index, this is not the index that I grew up with in the 80s and 90s when we were looking for innovation. We'd go to the NASDAQ. But if you look through the NASDAQ now, and especially the NASDAQ 100, what you see are 25% of the names touching disruptive innovation. The rest of them are kind of me too. They look like other indexes, the fangs, Microsoft, Nvidia, Tesla would be our only overlap. And then you look further and more deeply into these indices. And you see names that you'd never expect to be there. Food and beverage, utilities, rails, brick and mortar retail. These are not innovation companies. So what we've done at ARC is we are pure play innovation. And we'd like to think we are what the NASDAQ used to be in the 80s and 90s. And it used to be a very productive place to invest with a long-term investment time rise. And so I think our sharing our research and our pointing out to investors, look, what you think you own in innovation is not what it used to be. And what ARC is doing is really back to the future. We're all about investing in the future as opposed to indexes, which are more about past success. Those companies that have been extremely successful have risen to the top of these indexes. But if we're right, in these five platforms that involve 14 different technologies are going to disrupt the traditional world order, then investors need to get to the right side of change. And one of the other things that we do, that's one of our missions and values, is to educate. That's why we give our research away. And we want to educate not only investors, but parents and grandparents about how the world is changing, how radically it's changing, and how it's ever more important to get, especially students on the right side of change, so that they can enjoy these incredible growth opportunities and not be disrupted by industries that will be sunsetting, shall I say? Kathy, a three to five year time horizon means not only kind of midterm or recession proofing your companies, you're not just recession proofing your portfolio, you're also kind of midterm proofing your portfolio, you're a general election proofing your portfolio. And so, you know, Eric, how do you go about identifying disruptive innovation that then doesn't get disrupted by public policy or political agenda? Well, one, we have a six metric scoring system, very much focused on innovation. One of the scores is thesis risk. thesis risk has a lot to do with government policy.",https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6_2e_wGpQzc,7,2022-10-13 14:22:30
3199," very much focused on innovation. One of the scores is thesis risk. Thesis risk has a lot to do with government policy. And so in the early days of ARC in 2014-15, we were thinking, okay, government may be very concerned about the safety of autonomous vehicles. But as we've moved through these last eight years, what we've seen, thankfully, is the government and regulators in particular, very focused on data. And what does the data say? The data says that most fatalities and accidents, 85, almost 90% of them are caused by a human error. If we take the human being out of the equation, then we're going to save up to 35, 40,000 lives in the United States, the fatalities per year, and up to 1.25 million around the world. So that is a noble goal. And we've been very gratified to see the regulators looking at the fatalities in Tesla's vehicles and informing us that for the most part, most of those fatalities were caused by human error. And for the second, that people who are driving Tesla vehicles are much safer thanks to the various automated driving capabilities now. Up to 40% safer than in most other cars. So we're very focused on what governments are studying in terms of the data. And if they stick to the data innovation typically, it solves problems and makes the world a better place. Really, always a treat to get some time with you. Kathy Wood, ARC, Invest Founder and CEO, always nice to see you. We'll talk to you soon. Appreciate the time. Brian, Julie as well. Thank you. Thank you. All right, let's stand in the economy here. Inflation is still running hot as we saw in today's consumer price index. That comes as economic growth continues to be sluggish and recession calls pick up on Wall Street. Let's dive into the economic outlook with Jar Bernstein, who is a member of the White House Council of Economic Advisors. Jarred, always great to talk with you. I don't know if you heard, but we just had a noted investor, Kathy Wood, on calling for a potential economic shock because what we're seeing with inflation and the Fed will have to get your take on it. Well, I think the underlying fundamentals when it comes to particularly the labor market remain very strong in this economy. And that's a really important tail when family budgets are challenged by these high price levels. So when you have an unemployment rate of 3.5%, you're adding hundreds of thousands of jobs for a month, 10 million jobs since this President got here. That's going to help working families offset some of the pressures they're facing on the price side. But it certainly doesn't get the job done. We've got a lot more to do in that space. And that's why, at the direction of the President, we have focused, like a laser, on doing all we can to ease price pressures on the supply side of the economy when it comes to the ports, when it comes to shipping costs, air freight costs, energy costs. And of course, the Inflation Reduction Act with its reduction in costs for medical care, for premiums, for prescription drugs, and also for clean energy. So I think the question is, A, is there a strong labor market at your back, the answer is yes, B, is this administration doing everything we can to help ease those pressures, also a firm yes on that one? Jared, I want to pick up on the energy part of all of that. In particular, listen, I know you're not a foreign policy guy, but obviously what's been going on between the US and Saudi Arabia has been getting a lot of attention. And the Saudi support of the OPEC production cut, which has been problematic for the global energy market. If we were looking for prices to continue their downward trajectory, what can the White House do and what is it doing domestically in terms of continuing to push for more production domestically? Well, let's set the level here with just a little bit of...",https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6_2e_wGpQzc,8,2022-10-13 14:26:59
3200," domestically in terms of continuing to push for more production domestically. Well, let's set the level here with just a little bit of a background on what's been going on in energy markets because I certainly agree with a lot of your characterization, but we got that in the CPI report this morning, which is a motivation for our discussion, a gas prices are actually down about 5 percent in September and at an annualized rate of almost a third, about 30 percent in the third quarter. And of course, that reflects almost 100 days of declining gas prices. Now to get to your question, and also to reference back what I was talking about in terms of what this White House can do to help, that reflects the very large distribution of 180 million barrels of oil from the strategic reserves. That's ongoing to be clear. It's another 10 million barrels coming October, November. So that's an ongoing addition to global supply. But we have to do more, especially in the light of this misguided, and I think a very wrong headed decision by OPEC Plus. I'm not going to talk about the geopolitics that's not my lane. I will say the president has consistently since then gone out and talked about the importance of sharing some of those wide profit margins with consumers to give them a bit more breathing room at the pump. If you look at the spread between the wholesale and the retail price, it's still quite elevated. But let's not forget that at the pump, the national price, about $3.90 gallon, is down over a dollar from its peak in June. We need to see more of that kind of breathing room for consumers, and that's one of the things we're going to keep pressing on. The reality is that individuals households, they can't afford to stop spending on some of the necessities, whether that's food, whether that's energy prices, whether that's some of the rent prices even that we've been tracking. And so even with a longer, more protracted, kind of an era of higher inflation, higher prices that people are paying, what do you believe from the White House side are some of the longer term implications of that that may also begin to show up on the back end? So here's my answer to that. I think when you're thinking about that question, which looks around a corner, corners are very hard to look around right now. As you know, everybody's crystal ball is kind of cracked. Inflation is a global phenomenon. It's higher in many other countries than it is here. But I think the right thing to do is ask yourself, are the institutions most directly responsible for this challenge doing what they need to do? The Federal Reserve absolutely yes, okay? They're their pivot, they're tightening campaign. I'm not going to get into the details because we stay out of their knitting, but they're very much engaged as they should be the president has endorsed that pivot. Are we doing everything we can as I've tried to explain yes in the energy space and the supply chain space helping to unsknarl supply chains, inflation reduction act, ship sack, infrastructure act helping to boost the economy supply site. Our policies, makers doing what they need to do. Is it taking effect? Well, if we dig into the inflation report today, we see goods inflation was actually flat in September. That's useful, but of course, housing inflation, shelter inflation created more pressures. Well, is the feds action cooling the housing market unequivocal? Yes, it takes time for that lag to work its way into the CPI, but we're already seeing some cooling in the housing market actually non-trivial, both on the rental side and the ownership side. I'm chair, just very quickly. We've been starting to hear not just from Kathy Wood, but other economists that inflation forward looking inflation indicators are already starting to come down. So just to put your pure economist hat on for a moment, is inflation going to take care of itself? Should the fed and the White House actually maybe take a step back here and say inflation will come down without us having to push things into a recession? Well, I think that's a complicated question that gets into a lot of debates, some of which would have me a lot more into the feds knitting than I'm willing to go in this position. You're right when I was a pundit chin-flapping plane. I get into this all day. It's a good question, but from our perspective, we want to respect the feds independence. I think the question again redounds quite simply to the following. The fed is the first and foremost inflation.",https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6_2e_wGpQzc,9,2022-10-13 14:31:20
3201," But from our perspective, we want to respect the Fed's independence. I think the question again redounds quite simply to the following. The Fed is the first and foremost inflation fighter. This President has said we deeply respect their independence. So we're not going to comment on their granular policy, but he has said that this pivot that they've made is a very appropriate pivot given the challenge of price pressures. On our side, you've seen, well, let me put it this way. I have never been part of a White House or any other job in my long political economy career, where we've done more to try to help on the economy supply side. I never talked about dwell time in my long career. That's the amount of time that containers spend in ports. Now I wake up every morning and check dwell times, and they are significantly down through put through the ports is at historical levels, shipping costs, air freight costs, down significantly. Those actions have our fingerprints on it. We worked closely with the private sector, so there's a real partnership there. But again, the question to get away from the granular who's doing the right thing and the timing of all that, very complicated, quite. Nobody has the right answer to that. What you really need to ask is are there relevant institutions that fight inflation doing what they need to do? And the answer for this White House and for this Federal Reserve is an unequivocal yes. Jared, all of us have gotten to get a big education about supply chain terminology to be sure. Jared Bernstein, member of the White House Council of Economic Advisors, thank you so much for your time this morning. Appreciate it. Thank you. Coming up, we'll get another check on markets and dig into some of the moogers here as we see. A market's still sharply in the red, but well off the lows here. This is Yahoo Finance Live. We are seeing stocks still lower the Dow right now off of 186 points, about 1%, but as you can see, we are well up off the lows of the session here, even though we are still sharply lower. So that initial alarm over CPI, fading a little bit as people try and game out what the Fed is going to do. Next, we are seeing a similar phenomenon with the S&P, although it's still down 1.2% or so, and the NASDAQ down about 1.9%. So likewise, we continue to watch what's going on with yields here, the 30-year-yield 3.9.",https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6_2e_wGpQzc,10,2022-10-13 14:35:51
3202," down 1.2% or so and the NASDAQ down about 1.9% or so. Likewise, we continue to watch what's going on with yields here. The 30 or yield 3.92% and the 10-year yield coming just a hair back below 4%. Also in terms of movers, we're watching shares of Kroger and Albertsons. Bloomberg is reporting that the two grocers are in talks potentially to combine that an announcement could come as soon as sometimes this week or the next week. The Albertsons shares, sharply higher Kroger shares, a little bit lower. Coming up, we're going to battle it out in our bull versus bear segment this week. So the focus will be on meta, put on your VR goggles, we'll be right back. Welcome back. It is time to battle it out in our bull versus bear segment for the week. This week we put the spotlight on meta. Need him, senior analyst, Laura Martin has an under-perform rating on the stock saying costs will exceed revenue growth over the next two years. Welcome Laura. We've also got Aby Bernstein, senior analyst, Mark Schmohlich, reiterating his outperform rating saying he sees light beyond the dark. Welcome Mark as well. Okay, so let's get into this. First and foremost, we've got to talk about the advertising revenue right now for meta platforms, especially as so many companies are pulling back on some of their ad spend really looking at some of their cost restructuring as well. And so Laura, I want to go to you first on this as we see even more of that demand for digital advertising continuing to unfortunately see this vacuum given the restructuring that many companies are doing. What does that mean and net out for what should we should expect going forward for meta platforms and the underlying subsidiaries and Facebook Instagram? You're right. The macro environment continues to deteriorate. We think many ad driven companies will miss their fourth quarter earnings. In meta's case, not only is just the macro environment deteriorating, but they're losing a lot of user time to tick talk. And that continues to happen. Tick-tock now is up to 75% share of adults under 25 here in America, which is the highest ARC per region for meta. So we're worried about both ad unit availability as people move time into tick-tock and we're worried about demand softness at the advertising level and 100% of meta's revenue comes from auction. So if you have...",https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6_2e_wGpQzc,11,2022-10-13 14:39:58
3203," people move time into TikTok and we're worried about demand softness at the advertising level and 100% of Meta's revenue comes from auction. So if you have a falling demand for units, you get light pricing for the units that you do have to sell. Mark, when I get your reaction to that, I mean, you're calling this a make or break quarter for Meta. Absolutely, you know, and I think Laura's right that there's certainly all these, you know, the very loud bear case right now where, you know, it is time to prove it even in this tough macro environment and, you know, there's really kind of three legs of things that they that they need to go off and, you know, effectively dispel one is on the engagement side. And, you know, since they had that for one quarter where they lost a million users, they've gained about 40 million Facebook glue users. Now granted much of that's international, but domestic sell fine. On the revenue front, it is a tough macro, but, you know, we're seeing them actually set up a little bit better actually starting to gain back some share while it from advertisers. Primarily as, you know, they've made some improvements on advantage, sorry on, you know, the idea of a front, they've launched advantage plus, which certainly helps a lot of advertisers, you know, make decisions around kind of automating the, the ad delivery process. And they've launched a lot more ad inventory ramping up advertising load on reels, launching new ad inventory elsewhere. And so, you know, we're starting to see them make progress against much that's been weighing down the stocks since the end of last year. Mark, wanna stay with you for a hot second? The reality of the revenue construct for, for meta, especially as they make a big push into the metaverse, I mean, my goodness. Are we gonna be buying $1,400 glasses to wear augmented reality glasses to wear within our households or even at work? Who knows? I bought one, not saying everybody else, well, so let's write it out. But, you know, I think where we are right now, that certainly captures the headlines and certainly the number that they've been spending, you know, to kind of build out that meta, their metaverse ambitions is, you know, certainly kind of stickers. Not to change the whole name. Exactly right. You know, but I don't think that matters right now for the stock to work, right? Because I think the stock is back to questions around really core fundamentals, folks can understand, you know, that that's like a more long-term initiative. I imagine investors will love it if they were spending a lot less on it. I think we're gonna see some of that discipline. They're not gonna ban anything at all. You know, but you certainly see discipline that, you know, investment in growth areas is gonna be tied to core performance. You know, and so I think investors do need to see that discipline. And so long as engagement is holding and revenues are turning the corner off the bottom, you know, I think they kind of will allow them to continue to kind of build up, even if it's not necessarily desired, but you know, it's certainly a long-term view for sure. Laura, you've called Metacio America's CTO. So what do they need to get right with the metaverse for that to actually hold true? And that figure is Mark Zuckerberg. Yep, so we need to make a distinction between the stock call, which my attitude is, why would you ever get an invest in a stock where you're spending $10 billion a year, but the payoff is in 2030. You should go sit somewhere else. Energy is fine with me or banks, don't care. Those are all fine, but do not sit in a stock that pays off in 2030, which is the stock call. I think what he's talking about in terms of changing the world of computing for consumers is really innovative and interesting and risky. But bringing on the CEO yesterday of both Microsoft and Accenture, great. Says he's got some great enterprise partners and I don't think consumers want to pay $1,500. I think that's the exception. But I think Accenture could pay by thousands of $1,500 goggles. So I think it's interesting what he could do for America and for the consumer over a 10-year frame. Having said that, you know, I would say that, you know, we would move to the sidelines and use meta as a source of funds because that's no place to be as the return on capital deteriorates. Just as we wrap up this conversation, wanna get both of your kind of biggest risks for meta. And I mean, if I'm gonna bring myself into this conversation, it really is who that consumer is because it's about the time spent on these platforms and engaging even with the hardware that they decide to move forward with in order to make either the metaverse real or to just drive up engagement in the screen wars, if you will. Laura, I'll start with you. I think Mark Zuckerberg is telling us he doesn't think he has a core business. He is moving to Reels because it competes with TikTok.",https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6_2e_wGpQzc,12,2022-10-13 14:44:39
3204," I think Mark Zuckerberg is telling us he doesn't think he has a core business. He is moving to Reels because it competes with TikTok. He is moving to the metaverse and he's changed the name of this company, which tells me he doesn't think his core business that he built 15 years ago is actually a business anymore. Otherwise, why would you do these two things at once? Take on an extra $10 billion a year in metaverse spending in a midst of a recession in the ad market on the revenue line? So I think the big question here is, is there a core business that meta that can persist and has an exit multiple? Mark, what about you? Yeah, look, if you take a look at the motivations behind it, we've gone through these changes in the past from desktop to mobile. Mark and the team over there at Meta certainly remembers that well with the existential questions of should they build an app and participate in that ecosystem. And then in the meantime, they've been hit by changes that Apple makes, the gatekeepers in this current environment make. And so they understand that at some point there's going to be another computing platform change. They don't want to be stuck in the application layer. Now, I don't think that is a signal that the core business is certainly kind of, you know, expiring or anything like that. Now, there is certainly this barricade that at some point, you know, social media does go the way of my space or, you know, or Yahoo, but the data is not as important. What is it all social media that goes the way of my space? No, it isn't. And I think, you know, we miss, you know, kind of sitting here in the West that, you know, abroad, Facebook is internet. That's how people access it. And if you kind of take a look at the global charts of who's downloading new apps for the first time, Facebook and Instagram are right at the top. Now, a great, a lot of that's international, but it's still massively growing. We're still growing global internet penetration. And Facebook remains important for how you access it. But, you know, I don't want to fault the company for figuring out that if you're Apple sitting here, yeah, we should try to build an iPhone to kind of, you know, participate and own the next new thing. You know, I understand the motivations behind it. It's a long-term view. Doesn't mean that there's any issue. We still use desktops. So I don't think there's anything to kind of suggest from that investment aside from perhaps the magnitude, you know, that there's any issues with the health of core. All right, we got to give you the gong for the Yahoo ding there. All right, Laura wins by two points. Need him, senior analyst, Laura Martin and A.B. Bernstein, senior analyst, Marc Schmiller, great to have you both here with us today. And everyone's coming up. We'll do a quick check of the markets. It's a roundout fist 10 AM hour on a dismal day for the U.S. major averages and markets. Are you ready? Cool.",https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6_2e_wGpQzc,13,2022-10-13 14:49:18
3205," America has long run on Duncan, but a change in the company's rewards program. It has some loyalists rethinking where they go for their a Java run. Let's talk more about all things Duncan and what's on the menu here with Duncan, President Scott Murphy. Scott, great to get some time with you coming to us from inside a Duncan location. Curious on what you're seeing in traffic? There's so much economic cross-currents coming at consumers right now. What does that breakfast day part look like? Yeah, and first of all, thanks for having me. I really appreciate it and I can't wait to talk about our new loyalty program, Duncan Rewards. In terms of traffic, you know, I've been listening to your segment all morning on inflation and everything that's going on with the consumer. We feel really good about the breakfast segment. We feel really good about our brand and how we stand tall. People need their coffee and their breakfast sandwich to start their morning, so we've seen really strong results for our brand in the last couple of months. Scott, full stop. I was critical to changes in the rewards program, but it's coming from a place of love. I have to dunk an app. I go to dunk it all the time, and a lot of other people seemed to have caught my vibe. Have you looked at what you made here and are making any changes now to respond to consumers? Yeah, so, and I know it comes from a place of love from you, Brian. Absolutely. Here's what I would say. We rolled out our Dunkin Perks program in 2014, and we haven't made any changes in the last eight years. And we went out and we talked to our core users and we said, what do you want from a program? And they said they wanted three things. They wanted more variety, because in the old program, you could just get a beverage. They wanted more flexibility, and we've now given them a chance to stack points so they can buy a drink for themselves. They can buy a sandwich for their family, or a whole meal for the soccer team. And they said they wanted recognition. So big users like you want to be recognized. And we now have a boosted status. And so we've put those three things in place. We're really excited about this new program. We gave out four billion free points in the last three days, and the response has been overwhelming with positive. Okay, fair enough. That's good to hear, but the birthday drink is the, it's the industry standard. Like I know, I would like to get a free birthday coffee until I ultimately dropped dead and six feet under. I mean, do you think you'll bring that back? So we're talking about that for sure, Brian. But one thing we did do is, well, we did take that piece away. What we added is come in either the day before your birthday, the day of your birthday or the day after, get three times points, points that won't expire as long as you come a couple times a year. And you can actually get something besides just a beverage. You could get a donut, you could get a sandwich, you can get avocado toast, a lot more flexibility, which is what our guests wanted. So you're really monitoring some of the taste profiles, the trends on what consumers are moving towards in their purchases for anything from lunchtime to, you know, starting off the day. So where are you still seeing the most traffic at what point in the day to really make some of the menu decisions and changeovers there? Yeah, we're certainly a morning day part business. So 70% of our business happens before 11 AM. And honestly, when COVID happened and we had that shutdown, we were all very nervous when the commute was not happening. But people shifted their behaviors a little bit and they came to us a little later in the morning and they came for a couple beverages, maybe to share with their spouses while they're working at home. But really, the trend that's happening is all around ice beverages. And we invented ice coffee. We're a leader, whether it's ice coffee, whether it's cold brew, our new refresher line. It's all about ice beverages and great attachment with snacking items to that. Hey, Scott, it's Julie here. I mean, I gotta say it's like, I guess I want to know a little bit more about the whole recession, spending patterns, et cetera, because you sound super positive. And I'm just wondering what signs, if any, you see a trade down, for example, of a drop in traffic, of any kind of sign that, you know, the anecdotal and data pain that we are talking about every day, if you guys are seeing any evidence of that. Yeah, we do see some of it. And here's what I'd say anecdotally. What happens in our business is, when things happen like fuel prices or you see other spikes in inflationary environments, people pull back a little bit and maybe they stop coming quite as frequently to a dunking or some of",https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6_2e_wGpQzc,14,2022-10-13 14:53:07
3206," is when things happen like fuel prices or you see other spikes in inflationary environments, people pull back a little bit and maybe they stop coming quite as frequently to a Duncan or some other restaurant, but especially with Duncan. I think after a couple days or a week, people realize they need their morning Joe to get started, right? They need their coffee to fuel their day and we've seen it come right back up. And I think uniquely positioned for us, Duncan, it is a value offering, right? So we've got great products, both beverage and food at a great price point at the speed of Duncan. I think that's an unmatched combination out there. Uh, Scott, I go to my local Duncan every Saturday, and it's just a ritual I have. And every time I'm in line, launch a huge in the morning, which is a good thing I'm sure, but everybody's buying coffee, notably iced coffee. How big a percentage is donuts now on your business and what does that menu look like? Yeah, donuts are about 20% of our product mix right now. You're right. Ice coffee is the future that last year was the first year we sold more ice beverages than hot beverages. That's what the next generation of consumer wants. They want these iced cold beverages. They want highly colorful products that they can share on Instagram. But I will say our donuts, no one does donuts like we are. We are obviously a national and a global leader on donuts. You got to come try our spider donut, which we just rolled out for Halloween. We've got a jack-a-lantern donut. There's nothing more shareable and more fun and a nice treat to yourself than a donut. As you've got more people returning either to office or to schools that breakfast wars, that's continuing to brew and heat up, what's Duncan's positioning in that breakfast war? And what are going to be the keys to essentially helping it retain that consumer mind share and that dollar at the beginning of the day? Yeah, a couple things. First of all, we have an incredible brand with a lot of brand love. So we tap into that loyalty like that new program. The second is some degree of everyday value or targeted digital value. So through our app, we are going to have the ability to have laser-focused offers that go right to you and what you want and give you incredible value in our program. And then the last thing I'd say is we've got, it's through our app, our ability to order ahead. So Brian, when you see those long lines, you download the app, order ahead. It'll be ready when you get there and the crew will hand it to you and you'll be off and running for your busy day. Scott, I just, I need the birthday drink back. I'm going to Duncan anyway, lad. I'm going to get off of here. I'm going to Duncan. I just need the birthday drink back. Please, please. Brian, I'm going to come deliver coffee to you personally on your birthday. I'll take that. April 4th. There we go. Yeah, done. Deal. Duncan, President Scott Murphy. Thanks so much for joining us this morning. Appreciate it. Thank you guys. Coming up, everyone, we're going to do a final check of the markets on the other side of this short break.",https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6_2e_wGpQzc,15,2022-10-13 14:57:44
3207," Remember to subscribe and set the notifications on! Well, that was quite a two hours. Hope you enjoyed the ride. We certainly did, even as we see markets continue to sell off. The sell off is definitely not as acute as it was right after we got that CPI data. Right now you've got the NASDAQ still leading losses down 1.3%. But it was down double that earlier. SME 500 the same and has paired its losses to the lower end of the market. Well, that was quite a two hours. Hope you enjoyed the ride. We certainly did, even as we see markets continue to sell off. The sell off is only now down around 30 points. So could we actually end the day higher that would be quite something even with these ratcheted up interest rate expectations?

3208," The blickery in for a Keiko Fujita. And here's what I'm watching today coming in hot. Lower gas prices aren't low enough or high enough to keep a little inflation. It surprises to the upside-sending stocks lower. 100 bips on the Fed. For November, is that on their radar? We're going to chask ICG's Nick Brooks to break it all down next. Crude oil among the risk assets sliding after the numbers hit. This as the IEA says OPEC plus cost could tip the global economy into recession. We're going to speak with Saxo banks ahead of commodities on exactly that. And Ark Innovation Founder CEO Kathy Wood spoke with our morning team about its holdings. And that open letter to the Fed. We're going to bring you more from the conversation. First, let's get a check of the market action. It is a down day here. We can see the Dow off almost 100 points. Parents, some of those losses, S&P 500 and Nasdaq under water as well. And taking a look at the bond market. Wow, we saw the 13-week Keiko not shown right there scream higher, but also the 10-year. That is up about seven basis points in the five year, the lower part of the curve. That is up 12 basis points. And I want to check the Wi-Fi interactive now. I'm going to show you the S&P 500 futures. And this is going to show you what happened at 8.30 AM when we got the lowest or excuse me, the highest core CPI print this cycle. And that was a big down move in the futures. You can also see here 10-year treasury note futures, big down move there. That means the yields shot up. And I'll show you what happened to gold. Gold taking a leg lower even WTI crude oil. It did take that initial downside action, but that has been subsequently reversed. And we got to take a check on the world's, I think most proxied risk asset, I don't know the call it, that Bitcoin. That is also taking two legs lower. So no recovery insight for Bitcoin as it heads to 18,000. That is basically the low of the year. So pretty critical to watch this going forward. And Americans still feeling the pinch when it comes to the price of groceries in September, the price of food increased by 0.8% compared to August. Brooked to Paulmas here with the details. And where did we see some of these biggest jumps broke? That's right, one of the biggest categories. We saw the jumps in cereal and bakery products. Now this is considered the highest. Since the late 70s and early 80s, I was confirmed by Steve Reed and economists at the Bureau of Labor Statistics. Of course, those higher pricing being driven by higher gasoline oils, transportation, weighing on the cost of both groceries and farmers alike. Of course, energy costs here decreased by 2.6% gas laying down 5.6%. Making it cheaper to transport goods, but still higher. Of course, also Dickens is going to say consideration, rising worker wages and prices for impact costs like packaging, fertilizer there. And now here, if you take a look, cereal and bakery products being driven higher by, of course, that rushes Ukraine invasion that happened earlier this year. Also, fruit and vegetables being impacted here, up 10.4% due to a historic drought facing the western half of the country impacting crop yields there. We got to talk about egg inflation here. It looks like some items, including eggs are seeing a bit of a price decline. Others not so much. I just wondering what items are sticking out to you. That's right. Well, to make it clear, Americans can still inspect sticker shock here when they go to the grocery store. I did it. Yeah, exactly. There's really no relief just yet. Of course, we see right here that eggs, month of a month, down 3.5% milk, down 1.3%. But this is doable to some of the impact, some of the climate events that happened over the summer. Of course, egg expires were covering from the spring's avian influenza outbreak. That's what Dr. Michael Spenson of Wells Fargo telling me. But dairy dealing with a hot summer, they are in key markets. Also, vegetables dealing with that record, transportation costs, shipping costs, expected to decline here, but still taking a toll on prices here. And now if we take a look year over year, of course, higher prices across the board. Some of the highest increase here. Flower, lettuce, potatoes, margarine, milk, and eggs. Eggs, once again, seeing a bit of relief, but still up 30%. Now, Jared, as you know, this is a volatile index. They are hard to judge whether or not next month. We might see a tick up, a tick down there. But I also want to note that citrus, somebody to keep a look out here on Wednesday, the US Department of Agriculture, said that Florida's orange crop this year will be the smallest in 1943. Now, that's not even taking into account the effects of hurricane Irene. So lots of fold out here, but Americans still expecting higher prices across the board.

Silver lining for you and I, Broca, I hear that our lunch time is getting picked up today by corporate, but today only really appreciate that report in all seriousness. Lots of higher prices to digest. Young finances broke to Paul. Thank you. Sticking with this morning's CPI report, let's welcome in and Nick Brookes, ICG head of economics and investment research for his reaction to the numbers and Nick. Let me just get your thoughts, your frontline thoughts on those headline numbers here, especially that core reading, which just shot up excluding food at energy. Yeah, I think that's the key problem. I mean, the headline number has been sort of gradually coming down since June, but the real focus is on the core inflation, which of course is what the Fed really cares about. And that just keeps going up. And as you were highlighting, food inflation is very high. Shelter inflation has also been a key driver of the rate, healthcare costs, and pretty much across the board and services. So the problem with this type of number is, I don't think the Fed wants to continue raising rates. I think the Fed recognizes quite clearly that the economy is probably going into a slowdown over the next couple of quarters. But as long as those core inflation rates remain so high, they need to keep raising rates to keep it under control. So I think bottom line is, and the market seems to think we're going to get 75 basis points from the Fed in November. And now markets are starting to price potentially another 75 in December. So not a good place to be. Yes, I even saw 100 basis point raise in November being price as I think the probability was 2% max. But just goes to show you the extent to which the Fed, which has really been consistent on its messaging. I was going through the FOMC minutes that were released yesterday. No big surprises at CPI, of course, being the bigger report here. But we've seen central bank action out of the bank of England, the bank of Japan just get completely reversed. I mean, you look at the debt of the UK or the currency of Japan trading like emerging markets here. What do you make of the central bank or reaction? How painted into a corner are they? I think they're all painted into quite a severe corner. And I'm based here in the UK, and I won't start talking too much about the UK. But they're in a very, very tight spot. And I think the problem is central banks haven't faced anything like this since the late 70s, early 80s, where you've got extreme inflation. And it's broad-based. And the central bank recognized that growth is coming down. And if it wasn't for these inflation rates, they'd probably be cutting rates. But bottom line is they're worried that inflationary expectations could get out of control. And we'll get the feared wage price spiral that becomes self-fulfilling. So they have to talk tough. They have to act tough. Until inflation rates start coming down, even if it means recession. Well, and we've gotten comments from CEOs who may or may not be talking their books. But Jamie Dimon sticks out in particular, especially ahead of earnings, which we expect imminently this week. Tomorrow morning, and he's talking about another 20% decline in the S&P 500 already on its way there over the last couple days. Just wondering what you see in terms of the markets set up, any levels you're looking at. What are you looking for in the eventual rebound when we find a bottom finally? Yeah. I think there are a couple of things. My own view would be that a lot of the rate increases are in the market. So if you look at swap rates, if you look at forward rates, I think a lot of the central bank hikes that are coming are actually in the market. I think where perhaps the market has not yet priced appropriately is the risk of quite a severe earnings decline as we move into potential recession. So I think the PEs need to come down further and the earnings are also likely to come down further. So I think there is certainly likely to be more downside on equity markets. The other point though I'd make is I think very similar to what we saw during the COVID, the worst of the COVID pandemic. I think it will be very sector focused. I think there are going to be some sectors that are clearly going to be hit much harder than others in this type of environment. But there also be.",https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6_2e_wGpQzc,18,2022-10-13 15:10:30
3210," I think it will be very sector focused. I think there are going to be some sectors that are clearly going to be hit much harder than others in this type of environment. But there also be some sectors that will perhaps be less affected. So I think one does have to take a more nuanced approach if one has a medium term view on an medium term investment horizon. Investors need the nuanced view because the Fed is not playing the nuanced scheme. Well said here Nick Brooks, ICG, head of economic and investment research. Thank you for your time today. Thank you. Before we go to break, check in on shares of Delta. You can see that company if we can get it on the screen there in a second. The company beat on revenue in the third quarter and we spoke with CEO Ed Bastion who had this to say about airfare cost cuts that will benefit customers like you and me. We thought what happened earlier this spring when we pushed ourselves a little faster than we thought we could and the reliability suffered. So I'm confident we can get there by next summer. And as we bring that additional capacity back, that's going to help probably take a little bit of the pressure off of pricing for consumers. But more importantly for Delta, it's going to enable us to get much better cost productivity and we'll be able to pass along some of that cost savings onto our customers. Starting up, feeling the domino effect. Quite material says it'll take a big hit on export curves for China and that's its founder giant TSMC, that's Taiwan.

3211," flashing warning signs with the latest headlines from Taiwan semi adding to the gloom the Taiwanese group cutting its budget for 2022 But shares higher on better than expected results for more we have yeah finances in S for a Inness more gloom for the chip sector under a lot of pressure already Yeah, that's right and if we look at the Philadelphia semiconductor index I mean right now it's rebounding, but it had opened lower was down as much as a 4% earlier today And a 4-day chart will show you that it's down 5% and a year to day chart shows you's down 43% But let's get to that chip sector that you were just mentioning and TSMC That it beat on the top in the bottom line cutting capital spending and also Warning about slowing consumer demand. So moving into the fourth quarter TSMC warning that it's seeing demand bladdish right now. It's rebounding the stock It's up 7% but I also just want to mention that look the chip sector has been dealing with the fallout of the new government Regulations the Biden administration's export control. So you've got applied materials lamb research applied material saying that their fourth quarter is going to be Impacting impacted by this new regulation. So you've got this regulation on the one hand And then you got some of these chip makers that are talking about slowing consumer demand on the other hand impacting and keep in mind that the chip sector also is going through periodic cycles, so it was expected that in the second half of the year that we would see Demand slowed down slower and it's it's these stocks are such that the kind of they've kind of been the way the pandemic style stocks have been Really high during the pandemic and then losing steam this year Hey, we don't need any nuance on that we know the hit that they've been taking and a lot of green on that board It was read quite a bit earlier. All right, Yahoo finances and that's for a thank you for that report Schneider electric one of the largest energy and power equipment providers in Europe and abroad unveiling new research in corporate ESG efforts at its Presentation in Las Vegas and finding while there's a little intention from companies to do green and be green Actually a lot of that intention. There's not enough follow-through for more. We have a mere Paul Schneider electric president North America And thank you for coming here today This is all part of your presentation at the innovation summit Las Vegas Just tell us a little bit about the event and what we can expect from that Well, first of all, thank you for having me and yes We're here with 1500 customers about 20% of the Fortune 500 is here and the conversation we're having is how do we move from an intent to action There's been a lot of commitments made about getting to net zero and that's great More of those commitments are getting certified with science-based targets, which is an important next step But really deploying the technologies and learning by doing is how we're going to create innovation that we desperately need and That's really what we're talking to our partners customers and broader strategic alliances about here The thing that's most important right now is that we remember that sustainability is also an efficiency driver So it's got a bottom line positive impact and I think that is going to be an acceleration point for all of the sectors And a lot of the impetus behind the eat well behind the clean air Movement and clean energy movement has to do with government subsidies just wondering what the status of that is We hear a lot about that with respect to Tesla and some of the other big makers, but there's a lot going on behind the scenes as well as we beef up our infrastructure It's government subsidies for sure especially for consumers and it'll act as a catalyst for consumers to make the right choices People want to do the right thing and if it can be also Providing a better experience then these incentives are just going to make that transition happen faster Think about people buying an EV once they buy an EV they have an opportunity to put solar in their home when they do that They can add a battery and then with technologies that we can work with the utilities to also make them Producers of energy and maybe even sell some of that back in the right environments to the broader grid So there's a real evolution where consumers are going to become prosumers And we think this evolution is going to be catalyzed by things like the inflation reduction act But I want to go back to my earlier point sure investment and clean tech is about also making environments more efficient Not just in terms of being more green but operation",https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6_2e_wGpQzc,20,2022-10-13 15:19:02
3212," reduction act. But I want to go back to my earlier point. Sure. Investment and clean tech is about also making environments more efficient, not just in terms of being more green, but operationally more efficient. So it actually saves money in the long term. And we've published research with the Schneider Sustainably Institute that in existing buildings, we can build payback periods under eight years, not only making the buildings more efficient and in places like Las Vegas at the largest Hilton property in the world, we're demonstrating that as an act of solution. What is what's some of the tech behind this, what you call next generation industrial technology that's being used to empower workers, specifically, how does this all fit together? So look, one key element is to bring digital into the space. As consumers, we've been living in the digital and internet era for about 20 years. But in the industrial space, data and digital assets are just being deployed at scale. And what digital does is it makes the invisible visible and brings all of that opportunities for optimization. What it also helps us do is take our scarceest resource, which is people, and help them focus on the most important places where they can innovate and be creative. That is also going to create a lot of new jobs. We think there's an incredible opportunity in the clean tech space and solar, the number of electricians we're going to need, and we're investing. In addition to working with people like Nika, the National Association of Electrical Contractors, we're investing with community colleges to make sure the next generation is ready to work in this IoT environment. Finally, we're also investing in manufacturing. We announced an additional $46 million invested in the United States to prepare for this wave of electrification. And that's on top of 100 million we invested in our factories last year. Well, appreciate your time here. I've got to leave it there. I'm here, Paul Schneider, Electric President in North America. Thank you. Coming up, if you think the S&P's 2022, excuse me, 2022 punch has been steep, spare a thought for Kathy Wood's flagship fund. It has plummeted at more than twice the pace. So how is she feeling? My name's like Tessla and Roku now. You're going to hear from her up next.",https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6_2e_wGpQzc,21,2022-10-13 15:23:24
3213," Built-Th глаза Cream cheeseーブリケк Welcome back. We saw a red inflation print this morning with CPI coming in at 0.4% for the month and Kathy Wood weighed on one of the prints and more with our morning show today with us now is Julie Hyman and Julie. Lots going on in that interview. She talked about golden deflation, but also the dreaded R word recession. Yes, and it was sort of linked in with what she's talking about with deflation as well. The chief see some deflationary impulses out there going on under the service, particularly in commanding. She did talk about gold. And so she talked about if indeed we are seeing deflation come down the pike, then the risk with the fed raising rates is that yes, we will see recession. This is a real shock to the system. And I do believe we will see the ramifications in many ways. We're seeing housing shutting down. And I think we're going to see a lot of other activities shutting down as well. We believe we're in a recession and we believe this recession now will be sustained. And if we see an increase in GDP is probably because either inventories are continuing to increase or imports are coming down as companies try to unwind their inventories. It's pretty interesting, Julie. Everybody talking about what the Fed is going to do in November and December, but a lot of traders already pricing in rate cuts for the end of 2023. I have to see how that pans out. But you also asked her about Elon Musk and the purchase Twitter, of course, Elon and Tesla being one of the great disruption plays that she has. But what are her thoughts on Elon taking over Tesla? Well, she doesn't have Twitter in the portfolio anymore. We should mention that, but she does have Tesla. And Tesla is one of the things that's done better in that portfolio amidst what has not done well overall. Right. The arc, arc, arc, that benchmark ETF is down more than 60% for the year thus far. It's down in today's session even as other things are turning higher. So I asked her, what's the risk that Elon gets distracted and are you worried about what he's going to do for Twitter? She said she's excited about what Elon Musk could bring to Twitter. Listen, we are prolific users of Twitter. Our gives away its research. We give away our research not when it's finished, but as it's evolving. And our most prolific platform, social platform out there is Twitter. I'm kind of excited to see what Elon will do. I actually think he'll work closely with Jack Dorsey and maybe open up the ecosystem, take away the censorship, make it much more transparent. And I think add more value to that ecosystem. You know, it was interesting. I asked her, like, isn't it going to be a mess though? And there's all this stuff. And she said, no, she said two things. I thought we're as interesting. And one, she said she herself will be able to filter out. And she thought that a Twitter under Elon Musk could offer users maybe more filtering options. And so that it wouldn't necessarily be a noisy, harassing, ugly place under an Elon Musk scenario. We'll see. When it comes to Twitter innovation under the old regime, we just got that edit button after what, 10 years. So yeah, I think it could be a little bit chaotic. I'm interested to see all the changes. I hope it doesn't break. I don't think it will because as news people were, were prolific users of, we are. It's actually like Cathy Wood. Yes. Very prolific here. Thank you for that. And great interview, by the way. Thank you. And finances Julie Hyman. All right.

3215," Now on to oil, OPEC plus slash shits production targeted by 2.1 million barrels per day. Last week the move threatened to raise gas prices in the U.S. and was seen as a critical blow to the President Biden ahead of the midterm elections. Now today something of a rare warning. The International Energy Agency says higher prices could be a tipping point for the global economy as it sits on the brink of a recession. Now let's move to oil market fundamentals. Now joining us from Copenhagen is Oli Hansen, Saxo banks, head of commodities strategy, Oli, great to have you here today, a rare rebuke for the Paris-based agency, the IEA. What's going on behind this? Maybe some politics? Well it just clearly highlights Jared that we are seeing a politics playing an in greater part in this oil market. We're obviously still trying to work out what really happened last week in that meeting in the OPEC plus meeting. The initial response, I initially thought that this was a good for Russia and bad for the global consumer and it seems like that's the tone that's been adapted. It's really a dangerous game right now, cutting production at a time where we're seeing an economic slowdown because it does several things. First of all, as the IEA says, it carries the risk of hurting demand even more, but also carries the risk of central banks being more aggressively on the hiking foot for longer. That's clearly not what the market needs right now. We need to start to look for peak in these yields and peak in the dollar and so on. That potentially could prolong that period. Well let's talk about the dollar here. We've seen the dollar screaming higher versus all kinds of currencies including, I think the top three in the basket that I'm looking at are the Argentine peso, the Turkish lira and surprise surprise surprise surprise, the Japanese yen, which is a third largest currency traded in the entire world. That's quite a trio to have at the top, but I'm wondering with all these central bank actions with the Bank of England and also the Bank of Japan, seemingly running out of bullets here, all that action resulting in opposite movements in their prices that they wanted in the first place, what do you think the outcome is for global currencies led by the US dollar here? Well the response that we've seen so far today after that, higher than expected inflation print, could indicate that the market is starting to get into a bit of a selling fatigue in the stocks, buying fatigue in yields and the dollar. We've seen quite a sharp turnaround as you mentioned there. It could also just be the fact that the market say, well we are clearly going to see a turnaround in inflation sooner or later and we are getting closer and we can also see the sub components of the increase today that we are seeing some sub-components down to ease down a bit. So there is expectation that inflation will peak, but at the same time also that will bring us to the point where we potentially could start to talk about peak hawkishness and that really could be a turning point when the Fed, when we get the idea that the confirmation that the Fed is starting to look in the other direction because that could be the beginning of some dollar weakness which the global economy is sorely neat right now and also lower yields which we also add some most ability to the market. Well Lisa, a little tamping down of the volatility that we've seen there in the yields market, but I want to take it back to commodities looking at the Wi-Fi interactive here. This is commodity prices over the last month and up in the upper left is heating oil. That's up 14 percent followed by orange juice. That's up 11 percent maybe something to do with hurricanes there, but then our Bob Gasoline wheat aluminum. The list goes on here. Are we in fact seeing maybe another upturn in the commodity cycle here after a bit of a respite where we saw a lot of these prices just club down to very low levels this year? Well that is our general outlook that we are in a situation where we see tight supply across several markets basically supporting prices enough to put prices even on a further upward trajectory. Even though we have this worries about economic slowdown, but if we look at the the the the market you just mentioned there apart from the hurricane which is impact the orange juice it is really it's got Russia written all over it. It's sanctions potentially on on aluminum. It's Ukraine wheat supplies and it's a diesel demand because we are we are here in Europe getting close to the embargo which means we have to find out these levels.",https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6_2e_wGpQzc,24,2022-10-13 15:36:23
3216," on aluminium, it's Ukraine, wheat supplies, and it's a diesel demand because we are here in Europe getting close to the embargo, which means we have to find out these levels where we are already now having a multi, well at least a decade low diesel stock in the US. We did have the report coming out earlier today and it just shows that diesel stocks continue to drop. So that's really a substitution for gas right now and that's right, these price size elevated as they are. We have to leave it there but really appreciate your insights here, Saxo banks, head of commodity strategy, Oli Hansen, thanks for joining us from Copenhagen, enjoy your evening. All right, let's get to our chart of the day and this has to do with a part into demand, which is starting to ease according to real estate data provider, real page, it's all rental demand, turn negative in the third quarter for the first time in 30 years. Negative demand means more people are moving out than in suggesting that higher rent prices are taking a toll on would be renters after last years, resurgent and rental demand, having moved recently myself, experiencing 37% price increases, I can testify to this rental inflation and sticking with real estate mortgage rates have jumped to their highest level in more than two decades. The average rate on a 30 year fixed loan increased to 6.92% as of today, Thursday, according to Freddie Mac's weekly survey, last time we saw that was April 2002.

3217," After this morning's CPI report, you've got to take a look at this on the Wi-Fi Interactive. These are the futures, S&P 500 futures. Now up over one in three quarters of a percent, I want to show you what happened at 8.30 AM. Got this huge drop here, but now we are higher than we were just before the report. And if we take a look at the year-to-date action on the S&P 500, this is pretty significant here when you're going up on a bad news day. That is potentially bullish. We got a firm rejection of these lows here around what is at 3,600 or 3,500. And so we're going to have to see if this continues. But I want to show you a very similar market. It just in terms of price reaction. Here we have Bitcoin. Now we did get this big down draft at 8.30 AM, followed by another one a bit later. And now we are heading higher. But you can see Bitcoin not reclaiming all of those losses. But we want to stick with this. The crypto market and joining us now to discuss how it's huge. Roberts quant insight head of analytics. And we want to get your take on what's going on with Bitcoin this morning. And because it's had an incredible correlation with stocks, particularly the tech sector. Absolutely. Actually, you've just taken my punchline now away from me. So what quant insight does just to back up a second and to give some context is we look at macro factors. So growth and inflation measures of financial conditions like real yield, sleep of the yield curve, what feds up to and measures of risk appetite. And then we look at all different assets across equity markets, bond markets, commodities, FX. And more recently in the last few years crypto as well. And give a sense of the macro characteristics of that asset. And whether that asset is rich or cheap to prevailing macro conditions. For a long time, for a first couple of months of this year, crypto was not trading as a macro plate. It was trading off crypto technicals. But in April, it came into a new macro regime. And to your line, it is trading very much to characteristics of it are exactly the same. As a US tech stock. The difference being whereas S&P NASDAQ have all been cheap on our models beaten up in the last couple of weeks. Crypto looked expensive. So in a way, we've been waiting for this price action. The valuation gap is not extreme, but both Bitcoin and Ethereum, they both look modestly richer on our models and macro fair values world over while the swap price has been holding in there. So we've been waiting for price action like this. Let me ask you something because Bitcoin is knocking to the downside on the lows of the year, which also coincidentally happened to be the highs roughly speaking of that huge bull market in 2017. Many years ago, just wondering what you think in the price action happens, should that floor, temporary floor maybe be breached here? 18,000, what's the next level? Yeah, absolutely. Well, I would defer to Chartis and Tech Lannaries who know that better than I would. But yeah, Charting 101 tells you that if we take out those levels, then clearly it doesn't look good. And the crypto winter, which I think people hoped was beginning to go to maybe form a base. And could potentially be looking to reverse higher. This would suggest that actually the bear market was just pausing for breath and the charts would point to significant downside. But that's very much a technical analyst perspective. As I say, we come exclusively from a quantitative macro perspective. Well, let me extend that then to the general currency markets, where we've been describing. I've been talking about this almost the whole show the incredible strength of the US dollar that we've seen here. What are your, what is your quantum analysis at the macro level? Levels show you in terms of the pain that the US dollar rise this year is having on other currencies, especially big ones like the yen and also the pound at a record low versus a dollar. Yeah, absolutely. That's a very fair comment. And I think you are seeing that the stress and strains of the current global monetary policy tightening cycle is actually manifesting itself first and foremost in overseas markets, the strength of the dollar. It calls that 20 billion unilateral intervention from the Japanese and dollar yen a few weeks back. We've all seen the russians in sterling and guilt markets. Some of those have their own idiosyncratic flavours and they're in the case of the UK and the mini budget. But you can say that the reason we got here in the first place is being the strength of the dollar for the first nine months plus of 2022.",https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6_2e_wGpQzc,26,2022-10-13 15:45:02
3218," in the case of the UK and the mini budget, but you can say that the reason we got here in the first place is being the strength of the dollar for the first nine months plus of 2022. The interesting thing from our modeling perspective to go back to your question is that for the first five, six months of the year, all the major FX crosses were very much macro plays. It was interest rate differentials. Sometimes it was nominal rate differential, sometimes a different cross mic feed more of real yield differentials, but it was very much about a hawkish fed and kind of outstripping its central bank peers. But a few months back, our model confidence was just captures how good a job macro is doing and was explaining price action in FX some to fall and fall aggressively. So the interpretation from our side has actually the last couple of months in the dollar rally has been less to do with fundamentals and actually more to do with non macro factors. And I suspect key amongst those is probably actually being trended momentum and its CTA flow just fought in the one way trend and pushing things higher more than it's been about macro. No, if that's a case and it's all about momentum, I'd say we're in for a ride because these things tend to go parabolic before they reverse. Hugh Roberts, quant insight head of analytics, really appreciate your insights here. Coming up, social insecurity benefits would jump at the start of the next year as a cost of living adjustment battles inflation. But are we getting the most out of the system?

Joining us now is Jimmy Hopkins, Carson Group Managing Partner of Wealth Solutions. So really big jump here. I'm guessing probably the biggest jump in a lot of our lifetimes, right? Yeah, it's the largest jump since 1981. So you might be able to tell if you can see me, but I actually was born right after that. So yeah, I have not seen one of these in my life and to put in perspective right 2020, we had about like a 1.3% increase. We had a couple years of zeros before. And I think everybody knows inflation's been high this last year and that's where the cola's coming from. Well, let me ask you because we've seen a lot of prices in the sub indices jump by a lot more than 8.5% we're talking about here, especially when it comes to rent and food at times. Is this enough? And how are people, how are retirees who are living off of their benefits, adjusting to this high inflation era? Yeah, and that's a great question. Now give a little bit of a positive spin on this. So we saw that number right and you see the CPI that most people see was about 8.2% here. And that's we track off of something called the CPI U for that main number of most people looking at. This actually comes from something called the CPI W. And that's actually up here at this 8.7%. So we actually saw a higher increase in the cost of living adjustments than the one on the chart right now that 8.2. And actually if you go look at there's another number called the CPI E, which actually tracks the spending of seniors. Now I have not seen the September data yet. I pulled it up this morning. They still only have August in there. But if you run that back August to August 21 to 22, that actually was about 7.7%. And so that's actually tracking what our seniors are spending. So the good news there is right now it looks like seniors are actually spending on items that are not seeing as high of inflation as a general population. So I'd say that's a good thing. Now the hard part is seniors live on more of a fixed income stream and those adjustments don't occur till next year. So they are trailing right now, right? The adjustment. And that's how Social Security always works. We adjust for the next year. So they're feeling it in their pockets today. And I have to imagine there might be some pent up purchases here for somebody living on a fixed income. Maybe they're staple items. Maybe they're things that they need. But also there could be some discretionary purchases. Given the length of time since we've seen anything happen like this before you were born looking good, by the way, I would ask do we have any idea where we could see some of this money end up in our current ecosystem, in terms of our current economy? Yeah, I think one of the things to think about right now is our people are going to start pushing off some spending. I was in an interview earlier today talking about holiday spending. And I think I saw about 14% of Americans that they already started back in August. They're trying to spend those expenditures out. I think that's something to pay attention to as we head into this holiday spending, we want to see this money being spent. We've got millions and millions of Americans that are impacted by Social Security. And it tends to provide people look at this as their income replacement, right? Their paycheck replacement. So a lot of people are using Social Security for those basic expenditures. And they're pulling from other things more as they're discretionary. So I don't know if this is going to have a direct impact right now. I think most people are still probably moving along, not adjusting their spending this year due to this COLA increase next year. But this is a serious thing. I mean, it is a good amount of money increase. If you think about it, I think it's 130 something dollars increase on average over the previous year. So more than a thousand dollars total next year that will be going out into our seniors pockets. But so flip side of that, this number also increases something called the taxable wage base. And so that went from I got 147, 147,000 to about 160,000. So that went up 13,000 dollars, which if you apply the 12.4% Social Security taxes to it for workers, that's about $1200 more in taxes that will pay next year for going into Social Security too. So we see an increase in benefits. We also see an increase on the flip side. And the taxes we will pay if you're earning that much money back into Social Security. But we appreciate your insights into this issue. Very near and dear to hearts of many in our audience, Jamie Hopkins, Carson Group Managing Partner of Wealth Solutions. Now for a random story of the day. And this one is a, it's a bit mind blowing.",https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6_2e_wGpQzc,28,2022-10-13 15:53:57
3220," Our audience, Jamie Hopkins, Carson Group Managing Partner of Well Solutions. Now for a random story of the day. And this one is a bit mind blowing here. Researchers at cortical labs have grown brain cells that have learned to play the video game PONG. The research team grew many human brain cells grown from stem cells and some from mouse embryos and connected it to the video game, the electrodes. Dr. Brett Kagan, who led the study says there are so many more research areas that can be explored in a comprehensive way and even plans to test the impact alcohol has on the many brains ability to play PONG. I'm calling this Pete, the Petri-Desh Pong player and I hope that we're going to have more of this. Now driving the development with the dream team, Japanese giants Honda and Sony. Now they are teaming up with something completely different here and Yahoo Finance is probably supermanian. I know you have the details of this for our audience. Now I might have got a bit distracted here with Pete talking about our Petri-Desh Pong player but this is an important development for the EV space. What are the details? Yeah you know Jared, it's Honda and Sony teaming up here. Maybe Sony is providing the brain cells if you will for this car. So essentially this is the IRA at work. They're going to actually make this Honda Sony car in Ohio, most likely in Ohio, Honda's plant there, taking advantage of the tax incentives and things like that to build this car. So we're going to see probably the full production model or a full mock up at CES this year. But big picture here is this is a car that's going to be powered by Sony's software entertainment services, even level for the autonomy and A-DAS type systems going to be powered by Sony and Honda will make the actual physical car itself for the batteries and the motor and the actual shell. And this thing with one of the big key features of this car is that it's going to be a premium sort of low volume car and Sony and Honda want to use subscription services software services to kind of make this recurring revenue streams that posted this one time, here's your money, give me the car. So they want to really focus on that subscription stuff offering as well. Another big part of it is that the industry wants to make fewer like new cars, right? They want to make fewer design, fewer shells and cars. They want to actually update the software, update componentry inside and that's the way they'll actually kind of make money. That's what Tesla does. I mean the model that's been offered over 10 years, that car's not going anyway. Anyway, going away anytime soon. It's more about the software and also upgrading the internal componentry and that's what Sony and Honda want to do here with this car. Hopefully we'll see you in January. And let me ask you along that vein. We saw a BMW roll out heated seats as a subscription service. That was not necessarily well received by the market. Lots of haters there that I saw on my Twitter feed. So there are some pitfalls to trying to get that recurring revenue. Are people becoming more acclimated to this? Where do you see this going? I think it's more along the lines of how we pay for apps on our phone. I think there's Sony seeing this car as almost like a big smartphone. It's a way for you to actually kind of add services like that and you might be willing to pay for a Spotify app or something like that monthly or one time basically. As opposed to like the physical features like heated seats that got a lot of blowback, BMW actually kind of backtracked that because it saw it as such. You're telling me you're building this actual feature in the car than not letting me have it. So you might have see stuff like autonomous features, things like that that you can actually add on a software and people might be okay with that as a subscription add on. Yeah, I can't wait until we get those subscription service where you don't have to keep the car itself. I think that's around the corner as well. Yeah, who finances, products who are median always appreciate you stopping by here. And let us call it turn around Thursday, stocks plunging 300 points and then reversing to the upside. Let's take a look on the Wi-Fi interactive before we go here and we are seeing green across the board, Russell 2000 and the Nasdaq, those are each up 1.51 percent, S&P 500, 100, up a little bit more and the Dow is leading the way. You can see it's up 1.86 percent for the four days in this week. Actually, we got to do three days. Forgot Monday was a holiday. We are seeing the Dow up 1.88 percent. Also taking a look at the bond market. See what's happening here. The 10 year yield, whoa, you know what? I got a surprise. I forgot. This popped up on my radar a little bit ago. It's just brands, the maker of Twinkie, ticker TWNK. That is at a record high. And I got to say, it has been making record highs many times this year as a lot of stocks have been faltering. So, hats off to the good folks at Twinkie. But I do want to get to some other sector action for today. Here's the Nasdaq 100. We can see Microsoft down 3 percent. In video, also down 3 percent. And then we can see the Nasdaq 100. And then we can see the Nasdaq 100. And then we can see the Nasdaq 100.",https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6_2e_wGpQzc,29,2022-10-13 15:58:17
3221," But I do want to get to some other sector action for today. Here's a NASDAQ 100. We can see Microsoft down 3%, Nvidia also down 3%, Tesla up about 6%, 10% and I'm going to put a 1-year chart on. You can see we took out these lows here from May, June, July. It looks like we have risen back above and this isn't too dissimilar from some of the averages and the price action that we've been seeing in there. So is this a turnaround Thursday? I'll tell you what, when stocks go up on really bad news, could be the case. All right, we got one more thing to check here. I do want to check in on our leaderboard. Excuse me, I'm going to go back to the Wi-Fi Interactive. Regional banks taking the lead there up to 1.5% followed by stocks. That is a semiconductor insects and then that followed by gambling, value stocks, momentum. Momentum on a tarot here. I'm not going to delve into the irony there, but that is up about 1.5%. We're going to have to go, but we're going to be back in a little bit and I will be back Monday morning. You can catch me back. Goodbye. Multinational earnings could very well be.",https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6_2e_wGpQzc,30,2022-10-13 16:02:46
3222," our country revenues are generated overseas. So as we sort of think about the strength of the dollar overseas as well as the weakening economic backdrop, particularly in places like China and Europe, a lot of these multinational earnings could very well be coming under pressure through the third quarter. But currency markers, I think, are very much sniffing out this weak sort of global backdrop in this challenging environment that global central banks find themselves in, particularly with the Bank of England and the Bank of Japan, on one end, particularly in the Bank of England, they're hiking interest rates to try to assert that stabilize their currency. While they're also, they're just finishing out buying bonds by the end of this week to try to stabilize the bond market, very, very difficult environment for global central banks to try and navigate. And so, certainly another layer of uncertainty and complication in the markets. And I do think this means that the dollar is probably going to remain pretty strong through the end of the year and into next year. As Julie mentioned at the top, we're going to be kicking off this earnings season, some of the banks were set to hear from them. And with that in mind, a lot of chatter around how strong the household balance sheet is. From your perspective and what you've been reading through, where are household balance sheets and especially going into next year, what is that kind of tenor of the consumer likely to be? I still think household balance sheets are in decent shape. I will acknowledge that we do anticipate another quarter of a build up in loan loss provisions across banks. This would be the sixth consecutive quarter that banks have decided to build up those loan loss reserves. And that is certainly going to act as a drag on overall bank earnings. And I think it's very much them being taking a slightly more conservative approach, just recognizing that, just about every analyst and market participant is calling for a recession sometime in 2023. And so I think banks really just want to fortify their balance sheets ahead of that. But when we look at the data today, we certainly acknowledge that consumers have been dipping into those pandemic-related savings. They've also been running up some of their credit card balances. But I would argue this is more of a normalization in credit card spending and usage, not necessarily a consumer that's becoming overextended. If you actually look at revolving credit as a percentage of disposable income, leading up into the pandemic, that number was sitting at around 6.5%. And now, after consumers decided to pay down some of those credit card balances over the course of the pandemic, that number has picked back up to around a 6% level. So we, and to add to that, we haven't necessarily seen consumer delinquency rates pick back up meaningfully. So I think today, consumers are still in a decent shape. Labor markets are still tight. Nominal wages are still strong. And that could certainly provide some support for consumers over the short term. But again, as businesses become a little bit more sour about the economic outlook, you'll start to see those hiring freezes, start to lead into job cuts and in layoffs. And then that's when the consumers really are going to start to come under pressure. Jordan, is the reality that the bear market is just not going to end until there is any whiff of a Fed pivot? To a certain extent, I think that's fair. And the reason why the pivot is so important is because there's still room for the Fed to actually be more hawkish. I know you've got the Fed that's settling a roughly 4.6% term right next year. But I think the real question is, when is the federal funds rate going across CPI? And I think it's going to cross sometime at the middle of next year. The challenge is I think it crosses out a higher Fed funds rate, not a lower inflation rate. And so I think the Fed and we'll get to submit sometime this afternoon, I think it's certainly going to continue to show that while some committee members are concerned about a slowdown in the economy, there's still laser focused on trying to bring that inflation and more importantly, maintaining that in their credibility as an inflation fighting entity. And so I think you do kind of have to see that Fed pivot because markets don't like higher rates. And the Fed may actually be in a position to do a little bit more over the course of the first half of next year.",https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6_2e_wGpQzc,31,2022-10-13 16:06:51
3223," you you mm ro you Pepsi co is the hottest ticker page on Yahoo Finance right now as the food giant way profit estimates and raised its full year forecast for sales and earnings. Joining us now is not other than PepsiCo Vice Chairman and CFO Hugh Johnson. Who? Great to see you as always. You just got off the earnings call. I was on the earnings call as well. I think the street was very surprised by how strong your sales came in. Is this the reality that your business is still going to do pretty darn well even in a mild recession? Yeah, good morning. Nice to be with you guys. You know, I think it will historically we have done well as we've moved into recessions. Obviously, a 16% growth rate for PepsiCo is an extraordinary number. But that said, we do think that we'll continue to perform pretty well. Regardless of the economic environment, one of the beauties of consumer staples is, while people may trim their purchases in durables and more higher end goods. In a difficult environment, people want a bit of an affordable luxury and a bag of chips or a beverage is something that they can treat themselves well and give themselves a smile. So we should perform well through good and bad economy. I'm all for smiles, Hugh. Absolutely. Are you still pushing through price increases though in the fourth quarter? We did. Beginning in the fourth quarter, we took some more pricing. Again, all of that is based on commodity input costs, which continue to be higher. For the year, we'll be in the high teens in terms of our commodity input costs. So our pricing has been a little bit less than what we've experienced in inflation. But frankly, we focused on all the other aspects of our cost structure as well. So while gross margins were down a bit, operating margins were up as we've managed the balance of the cost structure very tightly. Hey, Hugh, it's Julie here. I just want to dig into pricing a little bit more. So average price is up 17% year over year. Average sales volume or overall sales volume, I should say, went down a little bit. How much are you going to be able to continue to raise prices? And do you expect volumes to continue to trend lower? It's a great question. We started the year with relatively high pricing, and we assumed that, in fact, volumes would do worse than what they have. Whole variety of reasons as to why that's the case, I think, for number one, prices are increasing everywhere, not just in our categories and in our company. Number two, household balance sheets for at least the upper eight deciles are still remarkably strong here in the United States. So as a result of that, we think we can continue to take whatever pricing we need to address the commodity inflation that has actually impacted us. In terms of that inflation, you guys know, and we've talked about in the past, we tend to forward buy on commodities about six to nine months. So as we see some moderation in commodities, we'll be able to manage our pricing going forward, but that's going to be a delayed effect because of our forward buying. What type of replenishment have you seen among your partners, your channel partners who are selling through so much of the inventory that you do produce, especially...",https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6_2e_wGpQzc,32,2022-10-13 16:11:00
3224," because of our forward buying. What type of replenishment have you seen among your partners, your channel partners who are selling through so much of the inventory that you do produce, especially knowing that consumers who are looking for deals, they might be buying in bulk for some of the products that you offer that you bring to the market in order for themselves to be able to see some type of deal on their side. Yeah, it's less an issue for us than I think is elsewhere. Because our number one, our Southeast snack products have a limited shelf life. So you really can't buy too much in bulk on those products. And then on beverages as well, because our pricing tends to be relatively even. We used to do much more high low in terms of pricing. It's now a little bit more level. So the desire to sort of load in on those products when the prices are low, that opportunity doesn't exist anywhere. Candidately, we think that's better for the consumer. And what we've seen is consumers look at the category more favorably when the pricing is more consistent. So given that we control distribution all the way to the shelf for the majority of our products in a number of markets, that load in fact is really not an issue for us the way it might be for some other companies. Hugh, let's talk currencies for a moment. You guys say now the currency transition is going to cause about a two and a half percentage point hit to the top and bottom line for the full year. That's up a half a percentage point from previously. We've been watching all kinds of wacky currency moves, particularly when we talk about the British pound and the actions that the Bank of England are taking. I think you guys get about 2.5% of your sales from the UK if I'm not mistaken. How much of a problem are central banks? How much of a challenge I guess I'll ask that more diplomatically, is that posing for you in your business? I mean, currency whenever the dollar strong obviously impacts our international profits when we dollarized them. That said, at a two or two and a half percent level, we view it as relatively manageable. We don't hedge on translation of earnings. We only hedge transactions, frankly, because hedging translation doesn't create any real economic value. In fact, it has a cost to it, so it destroys economic value for shareholders. But at the level we're at right now, we view it as a manageable issue, not something that it's going to be disruptive. Hugh, you got some questions on the call about Gatorade. Early next year, I would say you're making a big push into caffeinated Gatorade via a product called Fast Twitch, I mean, 200 milligrams of caffeine. That's a lot of caffeine. How big a role do you think Gatorade will play in the entry drink market starting next year? Well, Gatorade broadly is doing really, really well right now. The base Gatorade, Gatorade zero is probably going to be a billion dollar business pretty soon. GFIT, the product that we introduced earlier this year is capturing occasions outside of the core sweat occasion for Gatorade. So we think that franchise is very extendable. One of the places we've seen athletes, and Brian, I suspect you probably use a product like this as well as athletes will use caffeine as a mechanism for driving performance. We viewed it as an opportunity. We certainly got requests for it from some of the professional teams that frankly use it as a performance assist as well. So we decided to launch the product and we think it's going to be a terrific product. How big it'll be? Hard to say at this point, but we do know there's a market out there. We're excited to participate in it. Well, we have you in the market that we see right now where evaluations have significantly lowered. Do you see more of an accelerated opportunity for deal making for looking at some of the brands that have looked kind of inquisitive or tasty, if you will, for a company in Pepsi and bringing them on board? Well, we've done a few deals over the past couple of years and obviously we like to spend the time to make sure that we integrate those deals properly in order to ensure we get the success we anticipated out of them. Look, the reality of it is we look at everything. Anything that's close to our space will always take a look at. At the same time, we're very, very disciplined in terms of the way that we approach actually executing a transaction. So I agree with the evaluations are down, but just sometimes something isn't inexpensive. It just costs less than it used to. All right. Wise words there. PepsiCo Vice Chairman and CFO Hugh Johnson. Hugh, thanks as always for taking the time with us.",https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6_2e_wGpQzc,33,2022-10-13 16:15:33
3225," Something isn't inexpensive. It just costs less than it used to. All right. Wise words there. PepsiCo Vice Chairman and CFO Hugh Johnson. Hugh, thanks as always for taking the time with us. Thank you. Good to be with you guys. The majority of bosses won employees back in the office full time. The new survey from five are found that 52% of employers want their workers back in person five days a week. But 42% of workers say they would consider quitting if that were the case. Five or CEO Micah Kaufman joined us now. Five or by the way, a platform for freelance workers. Micah, it's good to see you. So there's obviously tension here, right? There is this ongoing tension in the market. How do you think it ends up resolving itself? Thanks for having me on the show again. We're definitely seeing a very polarized view between managers and employees. And I think that if there's something very clear is that managers want this to be 2019 again. And employees cannot move back from having the experience of the past two or three years. And wanting to have more flexibility into the work, I think that some of that is going to be resolved. But the fact that those employees are actually going to leave. And I think in order to receive that level of flexibility, a lot of them are actually going to turn into freelancing, which allows them to define the level of flexibility that they're looking for. Okay, so that kind of answers or begins to answer my next question at least. Which is where would they go if they if they did leave? There are still for a lot of the companies that are either in a hybrid or purely virtual reality for their workplace and collaboration. There's still some of the hiring freezes that are in place. Some places looking at cutting and trimming their staff. So where would the opportunities be to still retain that virtual lifestyle, even if going to or looking for other employment opportunities? That's correct. I think that a lot of companies, those who are freezing or rethinking the way they want to employ talent are really making a shift between fixed expenses and variable expenses. And when you think about variable expenses, a lot of it is being answered by free answers. So a lot of the talent that are going to continue looking for that level of flexibility are going to turn into freelancing. And we're seeing very high levels of talent coming to us to five or in similar platforms to look for that level of flexibility. So, Michael, does that mean a recession would mean just a hiring boom for freelancers? I think that at some point, yes. Because again, I think that more and more companies are thinking about the shift between fixed and variable expenses. So obviously that is going to fuel. If you go back to the wake of the previous recession right around 2009, we've saw a boom in freelancing. We saw a boom in new business formation. And a lot of these businesses cannot actually afford full-time employees. So they turn into platforms such as Fiverr to find the stun.",https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6_2e_wGpQzc,34,2022-10-13 16:19:34
3226," I'm saying we saw a boom in new business formation. And a lot of these businesses cannot actually afford full-time employees. So they turn into platforms such as Fiverr to find this talent. Mike, at this end, we've got now this proposal, although it's sort of vague on the part of the Biden administration to reclassify workers, which there's some thinking that it might eventually make some workers who are classified as freelance before us to come on the book's full-time. Any thoughts on that or the likelihood of that happening and the effect that that could have on your business? Yeah, I think that with the fact that freelancing is becoming a huge force in the workplace, statistics show that by the end of this decade, by 2030, 50% of talent is going to be engaging in freelancing in some form or the other. Policy makers are trying to figure out what to do with this huge cohort. And I think that in this space, we need to make a distinction between skilled and unskilled labor. So if you look at Fiverr as an example, on Fiverr, freelancers have total freedom regarding their work, what they offer when they offer it from where. So that level of freedom is something that is highly sought for, but it also comes with the price. I mean, you can't lead a totally free lifestyle and then expect to be considered to be a full-time employee. In other aspects of gig economy, maybe the situation is slightly different because they have less freedom on what they offer and how much they charge for it. This has been in the making for quite a long time and we're actually working close with policymakers to figure out how we can level the plain field for freelancers in aspects such as access to affordable medical insurance. But that's it, as I said, if you want to lead the lifestyle that allows you total freedom, you can't also expect to be considered as a full-time employee when you're not. Michael, just while we have you, over the past recessions where the gig economy roles have been available, we've seen this flow into some of the roles for freelancers or even just workers who are looking to take their own employment under their own control. For your business at Fiverr, given some of the investments that you've made into the business to try and unlock these larger projects, more engagement, what from the Fiverr perspective would you be looking towards to really navigate a recession as well yourself as a business? Yeah, so I think that a lot of businesses we've talked about fixed versus variable expenses, I think that a lot of businesses are actually focusing on identifying their core competencies and hiring full-time around those core competencies and looking for the more peripheral areas of expertise and turning into freelancers around those types of expertise. That could be if your core is technology, maybe something that is not in your core is going to be marketing or design in which cases they start to think about how to integrate freelancers into their workflows. This is why we've seen the appearance of the chief freelancer officer, which is a new role within companies, within HR, that thinks about how to integrate that level of talent into organizations. We're seeing that rising throughout the past few years and this is accelerating right now. Micah, good to see you. Thanks for being here. Micah Kaufman, who is Fiverr CEO. Appreciate it. Thank you.",https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6_2e_wGpQzc,35,2022-10-13 16:23:58
3227," you Chicago.ared ash. independent contractors to employees. Fox Advisors founder and CEO Steven Fox joins us now for some analysis on this. Steven, has this now been priced in any potential change that may come in the first half of next year? It isn't now fully priced into these stocks. You know, actually I think it's more than priced into this stock. I think regulatory concerns have been sort of the hand-ranging events since these companies were public. And what we've seen is that the companies have been able to manage through these events and actually continue to improve their business model. So I think it's being overdone at this point. Lift has said nothing is immediately going to change about its business model just yet. Of course, that's what the company would say. Given the fact that, yeah, there's still a lot of discussion that has to take place in the near term in order to see any type of reclassification go forward. But what extent should customers at the end of the day, if this does move forward, expect their prices, their fares to also have to be adjusted? Yeah, that's a great point because all the companies obviously could still raise prices to offset any higher costs. I think it's also important to keep in mind that what happens at the federal level is independent of what happens at the state level. So companies have been in discussions with various states. I think the most encouraging thing you saw without out of the state of Washington this year, which signed into law in an independent contractor plus agreement, which basically allows for some benefits, sort of this IC plus gives the driver's flexibility plus benefits and the companies are working to pass those costs through to customers and also reducing other costs tied to other pieces of the business to offset some higher costs as well. Steven, as we potentially go into a recession, what effect will that have on the sort of driver service dynamic? In other words, could there potentially be more people who are available to be drivers? Unfortunately, if they're a layoffs or, you know, does Dubra lift get away with paying them less? Like, how is, what are gonna be all those knock on effects? Yeah, I don't think Uber and lift get away with paying them less, especially in this political environment. And I don't think they're looking to pay them less. I think if you go back and look at what the companies have had done, forget about what they've said, but what they've done for their drivers specifically over the last couple of years, they've worked to make their expenses come down through various methods. They've also worked to make their time on the network much more efficient. Obviously, if they're sitting around waiting for a ride, it's not as efficient. So it's really important to step back and say, okay, in a weaker economy, how dependent it has, the consumer become on these rideshare opportunities, whether to drive or also to ride, and how do the network utilization rates look? On top of that, you know, the real on-tap market is still the enterprise. So large companies with multiple pockets of spending on transportation and food delivery, as they consolidate those things, those are real profitable opportunities for lift and uber that they can also translate into their drivers to make money. Right, a lot of focus on driver utilization to make it more incentivized in order for drivers to actually want to be on the platform and be able to take advantage of more rides. But then there's also the thought of if this goes through and that changes the classification, does that actually make it more intriguing for new drivers to sign up and increase the supply side of this broader kind of supply demand equation that ultimately has a major kind of, a major delta on prices here for consumers. Yeah, so one time has that much energy and substance.",https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6_2e_wGpQzc,36,2022-10-13 16:28:31
3228," broader kind of supply demand equation that ultimately has a major kind of a major delta on prices here for consumers. Yeah, so one of the interesting things that I think Wall Street doesn't appreciate enough is that when you talk about these networks, the companies aren't playing checkers, it's more like three-dimensional chess. So when you look at supply versus demand, like take the UK for instance where Uber is now providing benefits to the drivers while giving them flexibility, they're cost of going up, but then other costs have gone down in terms of actually providing, you know, looking at driver incentives for example, they don't have to provide as many. And so they're attracting probably more drivers now passing on some of the cost of the customers, but competition has followed. So you're getting a little bit of that network benefit I think. How it plays out in the US is going to be on a region by a region basis. But generally speaking, I think the companies have the way to manage through this and continue to march towards evict doggles where they've been set, like at Lyft and Uber. Thanks, advisors founder and CEO Stephen Fox. Early this week the Board of Directors officially approved XPO logistics plan separation of its freight brokerage business. The company also named a new CFO. I had the chance to speak to the company's current CEO and founder Brad Jacobs about the restructuring at the company. I'm here at the Greenwich Economic Forum with Brad Jacobs, the founder and CEO of XPO logistics, although not much longer. Brad is great to see you in person. And I say not much longer of course because the company is spinning off RxO which is logistics business, you just announced what that's effective on November 1st I believe. So talk to me about what's happening now, what the process feels like and what investors can expect from the two companies. It's very exciting. After 10 months of working really hard with large number of people working long hours, we're this close to the spin and we'll create two separate companies that will be an inch wide and a mile deep in what they do. And therefore they're likely to do it much better. So we'll have a pure play less than truck load business. That'll be XPO and we'll have a pure play non-asset truck brokerage business called RxO which is best in class truck broker. So it's very exciting. And you're not going to be running the day-to-day business any longer. That's correct. Do you have some plans yet for what the next thing, the next Brad Jacobs chapter is going to be yet? Well, I want to try to repeat what I've done before which is to have companies that over a 10-year period or so create at least 10 times return on the initial capital. And so I'm not a private equity firm in trying to make two or three X and let's not make any. I go for things that are 20X, 30X, the big ones. So I'm looking for that. I'm looking for the next big thing. And where any hints of what in what industry or where you think the opportunities are, because especially right now, it's tricky time, right? It's the best time to start a business when valuations are low and it's fear out there and there's not a lot of competition because a lot of people are nervous about not being courageous because they're nervous about what they're doing.",https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6_2e_wGpQzc,37,2022-10-13 16:32:39
3229," time, just start a business when valuations are low and it's fear out there and there's not a lot of competition because a lot of people are nervous about not being courageous because they're nervous about where the economy is going and so forth. That's when you want to get it. That's when you want to buy. When valuations are reasonable and there's not a lot of competition, but I don't know. I'm still gainfully employed at CEO for a few more weeks. Sorry to get you to, don't mean to get you to jump ahead too soon. But let's talk a little bit more about the environment. You and I were just talking before now about all of the negativity that we're hearing, right? From Redalio to Jamie Dimon, the IMF cutting, it's GDP forecast. Well, to the Jones and Holy. Yeah, all of it. I mean, you have a really good figure on the pulse of what's going on in the economy because of moving things around. So what do you see? So I don't always get it right. I often get it right, but not half a hundred percent of the time. My take is we're probably, so when you see all these really great minds, they'll come out and universally say, oh, it's really bad coming up. That's usually historically been the final pre-capitulation phase. So everyone agrees that, oh, it's really bad. And then you have the final plunge. That's the time to buy. When everybody says, oh, it's down this, it's going to keep going down more. That's the time to do it. So I'm really having my antennas up for it because I don't think, I don't think this downturn, which is likely to happen, is going to last for a long time. And there's, don't forget, there's two things. The economy and there's the market. Yes. And the market is usually a couple quarters ahead of the economy. Right. So we could see, so the capitulation you're talking about is the market. In the market. Yes. The economy might lag that. Yeah, economy could lag. Could as the straights go up as quantitative tightening gets tighter, you could see as a significant slowing in the economy. But the world has become such a small world and so well informed. And so many people understand economics now. It didn't turn the great financial crisis. I don't think it'll last long. I think there'll be such pressure to, okay, now we reduced inflation. Okay, now let's get some growth going again. I don't expect a long, long downturn. I expect a short, maybe significant downturn. Now, one of the things that was a detail in the latest jobs report made me think of you. And that had to do with trucker jobs, which fell by 11,000 in the month of September. And I'm just curious what that tells us. The number of truckers hired, I should say, fell by 11,000. Well, a metric that we watch very closely, Julie, is for every truck job, truck driver posting that we post, how many people apply for it? That's about 45% just in the last several months. So there's a lot more people coming back into the job market as the economy gets a little tougher. So there's the pendulum is swinging on that. Don't get me wrong. It's still very tough to hire truck drivers. It's a lot less tough than it was even a few months ago. The inventory climbs that we are seeing, by a lot of not just the retailers, but in other industries as well. How is that affecting your business and the loads of things that you guys are trucking around? Well, the transportation business does better. The industry is a whole when inventory is a low, not high. There's more restocking and there's more goods being moved. But what you see right now is really interesting. As a result of all the craziness of the pandemic, people got the wrong, they have a lot of inventory, but it's often the wrong inventory. They have too much of this and too little of that. So there's still a lot of activity. So goods are still flowing. Goods are still flowing, but not as much as more. Not as much. Yeah. But it's an interesting dichotomy. You observe the same thing I observed today at the Greenwich Economic Forum. It's pretty downbeat. It's pretty dire. People have their their warrior face design. When you talk to my echo chambers a little bit different, my echo chamber is CEOs of large companies, chief supply chain offices, large companies, entrepreneurs of small businesses who need their goods move. And they're not as negative. They're not as positive as they were say a year ago. They're less positive, but they're generally growing. They're not contracting. They're just growing less. All right, I have one final fun question for you. The Tesla semi. How much is that going to change the trucking industry? It depends on the price point. So we're a partner to one of the big OEMs for their electric vehicle, uh, semis. And actually we call them semi. The semi. The semi conductor. The semi conductor. And we call them semi. Sorry. No ring. Sorry. But the. The.",https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6_2e_wGpQzc,38,2022-10-13 16:37:14
3230," uh... semis and actually we call them semi-semis semi-semis semis and semis and semis and semis are no we don't but the the semis are they're beautiful and the truckers love them and they're slick and they're well-designed they accelerate fast and are safe and they've all kinds of gizmos in them but they're really expensive and so that the economics aren't there yet now if the economic if the technology advances in the manufacturing process advances such that they become cost effective yet very transformative make sense alright bad jake up so vexfield thank you so much it was great to see you in person really appreciate it thanks so it was fun there because brad was sort of an antidote to a lot of the darkness i mean he you know he's not saying everything is wonkydorian fantastic but part of it is the force of his personality part of it is what he's seen on the ground he he was a little bit of a counterbalance to some of the worst case scenarios that we're hearing out there you say tomato i say tomato yeah i think that's it's interesting to what he said though about the uh... the tesla uh... semi truck it's going to be fascinating when those trucks eventually hit the road because at some point it sets a stage for driverless semi trucks in this country yes but as he said the price has to come down to make sense which makes sense right also critical time for the business given the spin-off that's moving forward and drew wilkerson is going to be the new CEO of that spin-off and he had even in this most recent earnings period talked about how the company has a long track record of growing gross profit even through economic cycles and they're confident right now they're going to continue to do that i for one can't wait to see what brad is going to next the next thing he's going to tackle it's tough to see him leave this industry he is this industry that you podcast. We'll quick check on the commodity space right now and looking specifically at oil. We are seeing both WTI crude and Brent crude to the downside. WTI down about more than 2% Brent crude down about 1.9 there. For more on the commodity space, let's bring in Suki Cooper, a stand chart executive director and precious metals analyst. Suki, good to talk to you. You've specifically been looking at gold right now. Sort of what has traditionally been more of a safe haven play, but it sounds like you think there's more downside to comp. Gold has really been caught in the headwinds of the strength of the dollar and the scope for further rate hikes. And while we think that the Fed is not done with its rate hikes, I think there's another 75 basis points that's likely to come in an November meeting and another further 50 basis points in December, we think these are going to present strong headwinds for the gold market. But we do think that the downside is quite well supported. We're seeing quite a good price elastic response in terms of demand from India and China. And there's still that concern around the session risk and perhaps the need for flight to safety that is buffering some of the downside for gold. But we do think that there's more downside risk to come as the year comes to an end and into 2023. We see gold prices heading further towards 1600 towards the end of next year. So 1600, we're at 1675 right now. Is 1600 the support level you're talking about? The case pool.",https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6_2e_wGpQzc,39,2022-10-13 16:41:24
3231," the toward 1600 towards the end of next year. So 1600 we're at 1675 right now, a 1600 the support level you're talking about? The key support that's coming up next is around 1650. So this is a level that we've seen physical demand materialising and now we're entering a period where we tend to see seasonal demand from India, Diwali falls in the 24th this month, we have the wedding season as well. And we've seen in markets like China, the physical premium earlier last month's long to levels that we last saw in 2015. So that price drop that we initially saw below 1700 was greeted by quite strong physical interest in the gold market. So the next level to look at from here will be 1650 and then beyond that is 1600. If we breach those two levels, then we're really looking to the cost of production on where that provides a guideline and for the gold market. And we tend to see in a longer and basis and here I'm looking at around about 40 years that gold prices tend to trade a third above the average cost of production. And that guideline suggests to us around 1550 to 1600 is where that floor from the production side should materialise. So much of the price moves as you point out really driven by the stronger dollar and we have seen it climb up again today looking at something like the Japanese yen well above or below depending on how you look at it, those intervention levels. I mean how much higher do you think the green bag goes as you track those metals and moving in tandem? It's really pivotal for the communist complex as a whole. The dollar strength has been a headwind for not just gold but for silver, platinum and playdium. It's really damp and that upside risk. We think that there's likely that we may see further dollar strength and perhaps we'll see something of a stabilization coming in the first part of next year and that's really when we might see some of that pressure on gold prices starting to ease. But if we look at the correlations for the gold markets, its strongest consistent relationships since the start of this year has been with the US dollar. That correlations jump in above 60% at the moment but last year that relationship had started to pivot towards real yields and nominal yields. That relationship still matters for gold. It's in close second but at the moment it's the strength of the dollar that's proven to be a key headwind. Now it's not to say that gold can't rise if we see dollar strength. If both dollar and gold are benefiting from safe haven demand, we can see them both rally. But in the current environment, it's the concerns around slowing demand over the longer term but there's also concerns around higher rates that's really weighing on gold and it's not benefiting from safe haven demand at the moment. So bottom line Tsukiya, you should investors be putting their money here or is there a better value in the precious metals space? If we look at the entire complex on a longer term basis, the industry bias precious metals fundamentals are set to tighten. If we look at markets like Plastinum and Pladium, we think that towards the end of this year we're going to see much tighter markets. As the auto markets start to recover, we were anticipating at the start of this year a rebound around about 11% in global auto production but we've scaled back our expectations closer to 7%. But into 2023 we're still expecting the double-digit rebounds in terms of global auto production and PGMs are critical in terms of growth that we see in the auto industry. So those are two markets where we expect in more off-sider risk towards the end of this year but on a longer term horizon, perhaps silver is the metal where we might see more off-sider risk and given the demand from the solar energy given the electrification of vehicles, this is strong growth that we're likely to see but that demand is like to take two to three years to materialize. So over the longer-run silver has positive prospects but in over the next few months we think there's more upside risk for Plastinum and Pladium at least in the short term. Sookie Cooper, Stan Chard, Executive Director and Precious Metals, analysts, good to have you on today. Thank you.",https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6_2e_wGpQzc,40,2022-10-13 16:45:49
3232," you We're taking with the ESG investing theme here a new study by PwC found that nearly nine and ten institutional investors believe that asset managers should be more proactive in developing new ESG products but fewer than half of asset managers were planning to launch new ESG funds. So what's an investor to do? Joining us now is Bruce Usher a Columbia Business School professor an author of the new book investing in the era of climate change and Bruce you've been arguing that despite the economic backdrop this is kind of the time to be investing in some of these green names. Walk me through that thesis. It's really about the macro trends climate change. We know climate signs. We know that after 300 years of building a global economy that's putting emissions into the atmosphere. We've got 30 years to decarbonize to avoid catastrophic climate change. So you've got consumers pushing to buy more sustainable goods. You've got employees saying they want to work for sustainable companies. You now have investors looking at those trends. Company leaders saying we need to meet those trends. You have government action like the global risks of climate change manifesting themselves. More violent storms, heat waves. So all these macro trends are all pushing the same direction. They're going to be with us for decades to come. How do you break that down though for investors who are looking at this and saying well okay there's questions about yes she funds and we'll get into that in just a bit. But in terms of the names there's you know EVs which some would argue that that's actually not a long term play in terms of impact on climate change. So when I looked at this sector 20 years ago, how long I've been in it. The big challenge then was there was nothing to invest in. If you look at the whole solar power market everything globally does less solar than one coal plant. Last year the investment solar more than 100 coal plants worth and gaining. So the big picture here is that the opportunity to invest is now trillion dollar sectors. We've got the EV sector. All the automakers are going EVs. The key question is why? The reason is that those products are better than the incumbent product there's other before. So you look at EVs specifically suggest that why the EV sales so good because consumers love them. Consumers prefer EV products that flying out the showrooms in fact the car makers can't keep up with them. They prefer the products but it's still a very small portion right we're talking roughly what 5%? What 5%? But now analysis has shown that around 5% you get a tipping point in these markets. And that's what the automakers are seeing. You have to ask why they all rush into this market. What they see is 5 years ahead. When they're planning new cars they're looking 5 years in the future that's how long it takes to roll it in a model. And what they see is an all-the-evee future because it's a better product, consumers like it and then we have these trends around climate change. So that's what's really pushing that and that's what's creating the investment opportunities. When consumers and businesses go in this direction the market opens up to investors. We have seen incredible amount of inflows into ESG funds over the last few years. A bit of a reckoning so we'll argue that's happening right now not just this being politicized but you've also got those like Deutsche Bank some other names who are now being called out for greenwashing the funds that the names that were included in these funds were not necessarily sort of green so to speak. What do you think? I mean what do you think is happening here? How does this manifest itself from an investor perspective? Those who've been putting money behind these saying they were anticipating some impact coming from these funds well turns out that's not actually what ESG investing is. That's correct, exactly. And there's a real misunderstanding around ESG. ESG investing is really very simple. It's saying look when I look at potentially investing in assets I look at financial numbers, I look at management, I look at all these things and then also to be a smarter investor what else could this investment at risk?",https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6_2e_wGpQzc,41,2022-10-13 16:50:06
3233," It's saying, look, when I look at potentially investing in assets, I look at financial numbers, I look at management, I look at all these things. And then also, to be a smarter investor, what else could put this investment at risk? What else could change the outcomes? Look at risks like flooding or hurricanes or wildfires. How could that affect my investment? If you wouldn't go out by a house, a second home on the coast, would you want to know if it's going to flood? Would you want to know that? That'd be a smart thing to know. That's what ESG investing is. It can make you a better business manager. It can make you a better investor. The challenge, though, is it doesn't really address climate change. Just because you're deciding on a walk away from that house, I'm going to pay less for it because it's at flood risk, that doesn't reduce the risk of flooding. That's the challenge. So how do you invest from an impact standpoint? So from impact standpoint, it's much more important that you go beyond ESG investing. And there's really two strategies that I write about my book. One is what we call thematic. So pick a theme that you're excited about your comfort with. If you're really interested in renewable energy, invest in the solar or wind fund. There's plenty of those out there. That's a way to really channel money into a solution. Or if you're interested in EVs, into IBV company stocks, or funds, those are thematic funds. There's also now new funds coming out in green hydrogen, other leading technologies. So you can have a thematic focus, equity, debt, venture capital, as you wish. Or you can have what we call impact first focus. So this is very special in the sense that it's really only for high net worth investors. Impact first is not falling if I do share responsibility. It's saying, I really want to dress climate change. I'm going to put my capital into that. I might get a return. The return might be decades from now. But it's going to have great impact. And that's where you're really investing in technologies. Aren't you commercial? This goes well beyond say solar and EVs. This is some new technologies like direct air capture, for example. And really quickly, what about green bonds? So green bonds are issued by companies because they see these trends coming. They see these sustainability trends, consumers want it, investors want it. It's again thinking about how is how is they will be carbonizing and what does that mean for my business. The green bond makes perfect sense. But again, a green bond is not going to have tremendous impact on the environment. It's just a very sensible investment. Okay. Good to differentiate those two. Bruce Astro, Columbia Business School professor and author of the book, Investing in the era of climate change. Thanks for joining us today. Thank you. All right. Let's take a look at United shares up just around one and a half percent. Who does this work? Hong Kong waxes. Good afternoon. That was my welcome. I look forward to it But I'm still have other about30 to 30. New velocity. lifting its third quarter guidance. It looks like demand is very strong amongst the airlines. What's your assessment? Yeah, thanks for having me. So a couple of things. Number one, yes, you're right, demand, especially for international is very strong. We've seen a shift in mix in the last couple of months from domestic leisure to international and mostly international leisure.",https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6_2e_wGpQzc,42,2022-10-13 16:54:42
3234," National is very strong. We've seen a shift in mix in the last couple of months from domestic leisure to international and mostly international leisure. And I think that's somewhat behind the United decision to add more leisure international destinations for next summer. We did a preview on Friday for the earnings season and we said we thought American Delta United had the best opportunity for positive surprise because we've gone from the first say four months of the year when we saw international down something around 60 percent, 50 to 60 percent from 2019 levels and now we're down closer to 15, 155 percent. So you've seen that big increase as markets have opened up. People have shifted and started flying further, especially Transatlantic, not so much Trans-Pacific but Transatlantic. And business we've gone from being down about 40 or 50 percent earlier in the year to being down 25 percent earlier in the year. So I think those two elements and we've still seen strong domestic leisure but instead of being up 30, 35 percent, it's up closer to 10 percent, 15 percent. So you've seen that mix shift which has huge positive implications for revenue and I think the Delta reports tomorrow first, you just mentioned that and I think you'll you'll hear them talk about that for the rest of the quarter and or the rest of the current quarter, yeah, fourth quarter. And I know obviously the industry still dealing with some of these staffing shortages as well. How is this affecting some of the more profitable routes for these airlines? I'm sorry, I missed the first half. They're doing more of these what as well. As we're still seeing some issues when it comes to things like labor shortages and we continue to see some of these kinks getting worked out. How is this affecting some of the most profitable routes? Yeah, so we're having these issues with to your point with respect to infrastructure. So it's not just labor, it's air traffic control, it's airport infrastructure. I don't know when you flew last but I was at airport, so it was to airport yesterday and the day before and stores are closed, they haven't reopened, they can't find people. And we're seeing a lot of that and and so that's going to inform growth for for 2023 and probably 2024. And not only that, you didn't specifically ask about this but the OEMs are behind on deliveries so their airlines don't have the and they don't know when they're getting the aircraft. So from an airline perspective, it's really hard for network planning to think about where they're going to grow and where these aircraft are going to go and not knowing whether you're even going to have the aircraft. United is in a really unique position because they didn't retire a lot, they didn't retire any as a matter of fact of their wide body aircraft during the pandemic. So they are in a really great position to be able to shift capacity around their network and grow into some of these domestic leisure markets. That's part of why we have United rated and outperform and the others retire their aircraft and in part they were older so it made sense to retire them but they're having issues because the OEMs are behind on deliveries or having issues getting our aircraft to be able to grow, grow going going forward. So we think we'll probably talk a lot about that too. Yeah, Holly, you mentioned the supply chain issues, the volatile jet fuel prices, difficulty hiring and retaining employees. A lot of this focus is going to be on how exactly these airlines are going to rain in costs at this time. What do you want to hear? What do you expect to hear over the coming weeks? Yeah, so the first thing I'd love to hear from them is labor contracts. Every, the big four airlines have open pilot contracts. American has an open flight to tenant contract. I would love to hear them talk about there. They probably won't because they don't like to talk about open labor contracts on earnings calls, but I would love it if they could give us some confidence that maybe by next summer a lot of these contracts would be negotiated and ratified. That would be great both from an investor perspective.",https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6_2e_wGpQzc,43,2022-10-13 16:58:39
3235," give us some confidence that maybe by next summer a lot of these contracts would be negotiated and ratified. That would be great both from an investor perspective and from an employee perspective. I think it would be nice. If the pilots, the flight attendants knew what they were going to be earning and I think that would be good to get that resolved. We also, as you mentioned earlier, we need to attract people to the profession. I mean, we can't just do it overnight. We need to start with young people, younger people. But yes, I'd love to hear that. I think we're going to hear a lot of discussion about their loyalty programs. The number one credit card that everybody has that Americans mostly have, anyway, is a cashback card and then that's usually followed by a gas card. But if you live in a hub city, you probably have an airline card and your spend is probably high and you, but it takes a while to earn a free ticket or an upgrade. So the airlines like having that dollar today because it's not going to be redeemed for months yet and it definitely helps. But if there's the shift in mix to more leisure-oriented travel from business and corporate travel, that's going to inform the way the airlines think about loyalty going forward. So I'd love to hear them talk a little bit about that. Demand for the holiday season. I'm starting to hear from people that fairs are getting a little out of control and so they're driving versus flying. I feel like everybody goes home for Christmas, but not everybody goes home for Thanksgiving. And in my investor calls lately, I've been hearing people echoing that and saying, we're driving this year for Thanksgiving or we're doing Thanksgiving at our house this year. We're not going. We have to buy four tickets, five tickets, whatever. It's just gone really aggressive. Especially given how far fairs have come in the last, say, 18 months because obviously in the worst part of the pandemic, the airlines were discounting and in the last six or nine months, they've been raising fairs pretty aggressively in part to cover higher costs. But in part to discourage some demand. But yeah, flights are full. They're like 90 percent. Well, they're more there. They're almost always going out with very few free available seats. Certainly airlines and flyers as well, having to be more strategic at the moment. A big thank you to Helena and Becca for joining us this afternoon. Thank you. In this episode of Influencers, Marty Walsh, US Secretary of Labor. The biggest question we have is getting people back to work in the labor market. I mean, lots of jobs still open in the country. So we have some work to do here at the Department of Labor. It's no secret. I'm a union guy. I have a union book in my pocket, but I represent all workers in America. What's happening is we're still living in COVID. We're still living in the pandemic and the pandemic's not gone. So they're still fear out. Hello, everyone. Welcome to Influencers. I'm Andy Sirware and welcome to our guest, US Labor Secretary Martin Walsh. We're here in front of the Labor Department in Washington, DC. Thank you very much for having us, Secretary Walsh. Thanks for having me today on this nice cool day in Washington. It is a bit brisk, but you're used to that being from Boston, right? Yeah, not too bad. Yeah, it's a lot colder in Boston today. That's right. So I want to jump right in and ask you about the labor market. Jobs report the other day a little bit weaker than expected in terms of creation, but the unemployment rate below 4%. That's good news. But I want to ask you what you're most concerned about when it comes to the labor market in the United States right now? Well, I think obviously the biggest question we have is getting people back to work in the labor market. I mean, lots of jobs still open in the country. So we have some work to do here at the Department of Labor and in working about retraining workers in new skills, for new opportunities that they left their previous job for. They haven't gone back to a job. I think that that's one thing that we have to do a better job of. And that meaning by that when I say better jobs, such as the federal government's working with states.",https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6_2e_wGpQzc,44,2022-10-13 17:03:05
3236," They left their previous job for they haven't gone back to a job. I think that that's one thing that we have to do a better job of. And that meaning by that when I say a better job, it's not just the federal government's working with states and cities to create opportunities. You know, I'm a former mayor so we did a lot of job training in the city of Boston. And I did a lot of work of attracting new companies to Boston because we had workforce there that could do the job. So I think we're in a very different situation right now. This isn't about attracting new companies and filling those jobs. This is about filling jobs that remain open. So 2022, that's going to be, we've done in 2021, 2022, the present has tasked us with that priority of making sure that we get as much job training out there that's going to get real impact and get people back to work. What about black Americans, though, Secretary Walsh? The numbers were a little bit weaker there for that particular group. Is that a concern for you? Yeah, we have to be a lot more intentional when it comes to black Americans. Historically, the unemployment rate for black Americans is often double out of white Americans. But if you dive, you have in deeper and some of the jobs that black Americans have, you know, high paying jobs. So we have to create better pathways. And I think that we have to do, you know, myself and I've been partnering with Secretary Gidona from Education and Secretary Mondo from Commerce and working to how do we create better pathways, whether it's out of high school, into community college, college, working with businesses, working with labor, moving forward. So we have to do, we have to be more intentional about our work there. Some places have done a really good job of it down in Atlanta. I've done some good work on it. But there's not enough of those stories around America yet. Another area just to dive in a little bit into the market is restaurants leisure and that sector of the economy, which has just been whipsawed, obviously, by COVID, are the steps you can take there? Well, it's a little different. I mean, we did see some of the largest gains in employment in those areas, but there's still a lot of openings in those areas. And I think that the issue of restwares restaurants have, it goes a lot deeper than just hiring. It goes with the COVID implications with shutting down, having to go to take out, having a remote, having to build barriers in their restaurants. So, you know, again, a lot of restaurants have done, people have said to me in the beginning of the pandemic when I started this job here at Secretary Labour, that the unemployment benefit was keeping people from going to work. And quite honestly, when the unemployment benefit expired, people still didn't go back in some of those industries. So again, I think those industries are reimagining how do they hire people, how do they get more people engaged in coming into work in those places. And I do feel that they will come back. The pandemic, you know, we have these conversations all day long about, what do you think is going on in the economy? What's happening? What's happening is we're still living in COVID. We're still living in the pandemic. And the pandemic's not gone. So, there's still fear out there. There's still lack of child care out there. There's still concern about people going working with the public. So, all those challenges we move forward here, as we get more people vaccinated, and we do a better job of testing, I think more people feel comfortable going back to work. Another faster the economy that has caught a lot of people's attention lately is inflation. And we just saw that record number come out, or 40 year high, I should say, 7% the other day. And I'm wondering how that's impacting the labor market. Well, certainly when you think about that number that came out the other day, it's not something that I want to talk about. We want to see it go the other way and see more people going to work. But I think we have to look at it through the lens of the whole picture. And we look at what's happened in 2021 with President Biden after he took over, putting out the vaccines getting Americans vaccinated. 81% of the think of all adults are vaccinated out in our country. 6.2 million new jobs, 3.9% unemployment number, 84% of the industries that were affected by the pandemic, people gone back to work, we're seeing lows in highs in job creation and lows in unemployment benefit, so the other biggest decreases. So those are all positive signs. And then we also have to do some more work. We have to make sure we continue through President Biden's economic plan to work on the issues of lowering inflation, bringing forward the experts and the economists saying by the end of the year, we'll see that number tactical the other way, which is a good sign, but that doesn't help anyone today. So President is making sure that the impact he has is going to have a big impact at the kitchen table. And you mentioned the vaccines and I want to talk about vaccine mandate of course and ask you about enforcement, obviously still in front of the Supreme Court. But where do things stand in terms of administration forcing that with the companies right now? Well, I don't think you have to force a company. I think most companies have stepped up, but it is, ultimately it's going to be the responsibility of employers making sure their employees are safe, making sure that the workplace is safe.",https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6_2e_wGpQzc,45,2022-10-13 17:07:45
3237," I don't think you have the force of companies. I think most companies have stepped up, but it is, ultimately, it's going to be the responsibility of employers making sure their employees are safe, making sure that the workplace is safe, making sure they have the proper PPE and social distancing, if you will, inside their establishments, a little trickier when it comes to production lines and things like that where people are working close, tight quarters. But I think at the end of the day, regardless, in favor of the Department of Labor, medical experts have said that this is the right thing to do. People have said this is the right way to go. We should be doing this. Many companies support us, but even with or without what the ETS says, it's still the responsibility to work with employers to make sure that workplace are safe for their workers. Do you have a plan if the Supreme Court strikes it down? The plan is that we're going to be asking employers to continue to make sure that workplace are safe. We're doing that before. I think that I've spent the last couple of weeks here talking to some of the largest employers in the country. We talked about vaccine programs they have. All of these companies have programs set up in them already. They've already thought about this. They've thought about this from probably mid-2020 to today to make sure they create a safe space for their employees. Number one, to keep them safe. But also number two, to create an environment that people want to come back to work. Secretary Walsh, aren't there problems with enforcement given the shortages of test kits? And what is the administration doing there to make that happen? Well, obviously there's issues around right now and supply getting more test kits made. And the ETS, if it's passed or within the effect now, but if the Supreme Court rules in favor of the Department of Labor, the testing is going to be for those that are unvaccinated. So that's a lot smaller number than people that are vaccinated. I want to shift gears and ask about some labor and negotiations and strikes around the country. In March, there was a union drive at an Amazon warehouse in Alabama and President Biden called for no intimidation. The federal agency has found that Amazon did legally intimidate workers during the union driver. You disappointed that Amazon defied the president's words? Well, there's going to be another vote there. I don't know if the data's set yet, but I saw that the other day. There's going to be another vote there in that. So there'll be an opportunity for the employees to see if they want to unionize there. Certainly the president's feeling, my feeling is everyone has the right to organize. And they should be able to organize without any interference. And I think that that's for any company in America. Same with Starbucks. There's a lot more unionization going on with those stores. Is that surprised you? Not really. You know, when you look at the numbers, what's surprising is the polling number is 70% of millennials feel they look very favorably upon unions. And when I say surprise, I'm happy to see that. I grew up in a labor family and as a kid, you know, not everyone had the same feeling. And my family, my father and myself, my uncle, and my brother and cousins who felt that way. So it's good to see that there is definitely an interest in unionization again. Union's bring opportunities for people in this country that otherwise wouldn't have the power of cut to bargaining, the power of fighting for raising their wages, the power of pensions, the power of other people. And the power of other kind of pension plans for one case. So I think that there's opportunities here for us to rebuild the middle class by that. And certainly I support collective bargaining and I support unionization. But I also support it being done the right way. So if people want to organize, they should be able to organize. And if people choose not to organize, they should have that right as well. Thank you. Thank you.",https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6_2e_wGpQzc,46,2022-10-13 17:11:46

3239," a post office. You used to be a well sought after job. I think it still is. I mean good benefits and things like that. But again, I think that this pandemic, you know, I think we all, I don't know if happened to you, happened to me. We had an opportunity to have a lot of downtime thinking about, you know, I was the mayor of Boston when it began. And you know, I went to work every day, but I'd be home at five o'clock that never happens as mayor. And you'd have a lot of time to think about where you are in society, where you are in your job. And people took that time and had a lot of good quality, family time, saying wait a second, I want something different. Let me ask you about Proposition 22 in California, which is a really interesting and critical issue about gig workers and whether or not their employees. Where do things stand with that? You know, what we're focused on here is on misclassification of employees right now, looking at who's being misclassified and the severity of misclassification. When people are misclassified, they lose out on wages, they lose on the benefits, they lose on the protections, they lose out on a whole bunch of different things. And, you know, some of those misclassification that we look at, people like dishwashers, everyone thinks of Uber and Lyft as gig working, but some of it's also misclassification of dishwashers in restaurants. So, you know, we're working through a process here and we're looking at making sure that workers have their rights, that the rights that are owed to them. In October, you visited Striking Kellogg's workers. And I'm wondering, how do you make the decision when to visit Striking Workers or not? Well, I can't visit every strike in place in the country, but generally when I go there, if I go to a strike, it's to support workers, but it's also to create and open to a pathway. I'm willing to step into any negotiation, leaving negotiation that's needed in this country to solve it. If workers are on the street striking, that means that the problem, that's a problem for the company, it's a problem for the workers. The workers make any money and the company is not producing whatever they produce. So I think that when you get to a strike, it's too late. So I think it's important for us to continue the dialogue, stay at the table, even if it's hard feelings, employers and employees should stay at the table and get those negotiations done. My time as Mayor Boston, I intervened on several strikes that were successful. My time as Secretary of Labor, I've intervened on several strikes that have been ended in a good way. So I do feel that we need to keep those conversations dialogues going. The build back, better build appears to be dead at this point and Senator Manchin has effectively blocked it. I think it's fair to say there are some labor provisions in that bill. Does that strike you that Senator Manchin is anti-labor, therefore? I wouldn't say it's dead. I would say that it might be on pause a bit, I hope. No, I would not say Senator Manchin's anti-labor. I've had many conversations with the Senator. Certainly he represents the people in the state in West Virginia, the miners in particular, their union eyes that he represents them very tough, very strongly. But I think that there is hopefully dialogue will continue as we get into the new year, a little further into the new year. And there are some great provisions in the build back, better build that I'd love to see come into existence. Pre-Candygaden, childcare, adult care, job training money, all of those are important for our economy moving forward. It also looks difficult to get that $15 minimum wage law passed. I saw that Kroger was paying $25 an hour up in the Midwest, had a job opening there. What are the chances that I'd ever had? I can't understand why somebody is against a $15 minimum wage, a baseline minimum wage for families. It just doesn't make any sense to me. People use the excuse, well it's going to hurt business. It doesn't hurt business. Look at the states where the minimum wage is $15 an hour or look at the companies that have raised their minimum wage to $15 sometimes $25, $18. Those companies are raising their wages because they're doing great. They're not raising their wages because they're going out of business. So in states aren't going out of business and losing business because of that. So I don't quite understand why we don't have a $15 now, a federal minimum wage right now in our country. The Department of Labor did raise the minimum wage for federal employees this year, going into effect January 1st and I think we'll see some benefits of that, at least for families. You talked earlier, I think to us as a matter of fact, about modernizing unemployment insurance in this country. And I'm wondering where things stand with that effort. Is that something you'd still like to pursue? Oh, we're doing it right now. We have the Mornization Office here at the Department of Labor.",https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6_2e_wGpQzc,48,2022-10-13 17:20:42
3240," in this country. And I'm wondering where things stand with that effort. Is that something you'd still like to pursue? Oh, we're doing it right now. We have the modernization office here at the Department of Labor in the UI system. We got a $2 billion investment from the American Rescue Plan. We're working on getting grants out to cities and towns, not cities, out to towns, states across the country, very encouraged by both Democratic and Republican-led states, are very engaged with the Department of Labor in modernizing their system. Speaking of states around the country, I think you visited 30 last year. 60 cities, 30 states. What did you learn? Why do you want to do this and what did you learn? Well, I learned that the challenges that American workers have are in every state in this country. I found that it's been great going around to the states because I come from Massachusetts, I come from the Northeast, and anyone that knows us, we pretty much stay where we are. But I've had a chance to go all over the country down to Memphis, and out to California, and to Alabama, in different places. And it's great to talk to people. What I do know, the biggest thing I've seen, and I wouldn't say this is great, but the challenge and struggles people have in America, whether it's around child care or any good wages, that's a big problem in our country. One thing people have criticized workers for, if you will, is that they are not moving as much as Americans used to. I don't know whether that's the case or not, but I've heard it anecdotally. In other words, people are sort of stuck in towns that may be depressed, and they should move to places where there's more job creation. Do you think that's true or...? That's the first I've heard of it, but I definitely think that we should be making investments in those towns that are depressed and bring more jobs to those areas. And I think that's the responsibility of government to do that, to create more opportunities for people in the cities and towns so they can build their towns up. Rather than people exit cities and towns, try and create opportunities in the cities and towns. Secretary, I want to ask some questions about you personally, and growing up, and back in Boston, which you talked about. When you were a young child, you had a battle with cancer, and I'm wondering how that informed you in your life, and you're thinking about things. Yeah, when I was seven, I was diagnosed with Burkutslum Pharma, which is a form of childhood cancer. I dealt with it. I got it in 1974, so the prognosis back then was not as good as it is today, thank God, with medicine. But as a child, it didn't inform you, but as I got older, I realized that what my family went through, and what I went through, made me think a little differently about how I govern, how I lead, and really thinking about making sure opportunities. So, for example, in Massachusetts, I was proud to vote for universal health insurance in Massachusetts. We did it before Obamacare, and it was a good vote because I knew that there were thousands of families in Massachusetts, like the same place my family was in 1974, that didn't have a lot of money and resources, but create an opportunity for families today to have health care. You followed your father into the union, and I'm wondering what you talked about, but I'm wondering, what did you take away from that? What did you get out of that? And what drew you to that, actually, besides just your dad? Well, first and foremost, I shouldn't have dropped out of college to go on the, and my father was dead against it, but I did drop out. And what I learned was the ability for hard work and what it means, and understanding that, you know, I'm fortunate in my life, the opportunities I've had in my life, and my father went to work every day, and millions of people at my father went to work every day, and got dirty and came home. It was able to support a family, raise a family, put food on the table. My father was able to live with dignity when he retired because he had a pension. My father was able to die with dignity because he knew that his pension would be able to go to my mother when he died. So that union gave my family the opportunity from the time he came off the plane in Ireland when he joined the union to the day that he passed away, and my mother still has that same pension my father had. What's the biggest difference between being the mayor of Boston and the U.S. Labor Secretary? Oh, when you're the mayor of the boss, you know, President Biden is my boss, and I'm going to President Biden is my boss. I work with the guys over there, and ladies over there should say, no, it's a little different. It's an executive role being mayor, and it's executive slash policy role being Secretary of Labor. And obviously the geographic reach of the Secretary of Labor's job is 50 states and also territories in our country.

3242," you What about partisan politics here in Washington Secretary Walsh? Is it different than from Boston and how have you been able to deal with that? Completely different than when I was in the Massachusetts House Represents. You know, many of the Republicans in the House were friends of mine. And you know, you might have an argument debate on the floor, but when you walked out the door, it wasn't personal. And I think the partisan stuff here in Washington is a little too much. And I think the American people are being turned off by it. I think that we have to realize that whether you're a Democrat or a Republican or an Independent, you represent people. And you represent all the people in the district, they're not just the... I'm a Democrat. That doesn't mean that Secretary Labor, I represent just Democrats. I represent everyone in America who is looking for anything from the Department of Labor. That's what I do. And I think we have to think about that more in the country. All right. Speaking of Massachusetts, I have to ask you, it's been reported you've considered running for governor of Massachusetts. Anything to that? Yeah, I haven't considered anything. You know, I am the Secretary of Labor. You know, I got a call from my governor, Chai Baker, who I had a very good relationship when I was the mayor of Boston. He's retiring. I congratulate him on his retirement. And I'm focused on my job as Secretary of Labor. Final question, Secretary. What do you consider what would you like to have as your legacy? Oh, God. Honestly, I'm not a big legacy guy. I want to make sure that people I work with every day that their legacy is strong, honestly. And I'd like to see the Patriots win about six more Super Bowls. That actually is probably going to be very difficult right now. They're not looking that bad. We'll see. We'll see. They're not bad right now. Mac Jones is okay. He's looking quite of back. He's only a rookie. More in the playoffs. That's all that matters. Right. All right. U.S. Labor Secretary Martin Walsh. Thank you so much for your time. Thanks for having me today.

3243," It is Thursday, October 13th here in New York City on Brad Smith. Jes goes out there with made v winter, sl Weftkami,ris District everyone sunk into тол November灶 A measbolts of 2002. All of this, of course, goes back to the Fed raising interest rates and also has already had ripple effects throughout the housing market, putting pressure on pricing, putting pressure on demand and affordability. We've been watching these mortgage numbers very, very closely because obviously they have really ratcheted up the monthly cost for people who are taking out a 30-year mortgage in order to buy a house. So we've got that number, we've got that CPI number. All of it pointing to continued inflation at least for now. But now we're joined by someone who has has her eyes on potential deflation. That, of course, is Kathy Wood, our our our confessed founder and CEO and you recently wrote an open letter to the Fed where you warned about deflation. We talked to Michael Darda of MKM at the top of the show where he said the Fed is making the mistake of looking at backward looking indicators. What should the Fed be looking at Kathy when it's trying to really assess what is happening with inflation? Sure, hi Julie, and Brian. Well, if you look at what's happening in the pipeline, what you're seeing in terms of commodity prices are some very serious declines both from their peaks and year over year now. So that is sort of we would say that's upstream inflation that is heading towards the PPI and then ultimately the CPI. So we've got gold prices and in fact, I looked at them yesterday. I had thought that the last two years gold had been trading within the a 1700 to nearly $2,100 range and that's true it has and it has broken down. This is a really good leading indicator of inflation. What caught my surprise yesterday was looking at where gold was in 2011. It was roughly this level. So you can say since 2011 more than 10 years, we haven't had a big burst in a big breakout in the gold price and that is informing our decision here. Gold is a leading indicator of inflation and it has not broken out. It is breaking down. And then the second thing that we're looking at is the inventory glucked around the world and especially in the United States. It looks like some of the best supply chain managed companies in the world have overordered. They ignored their automated enterprise resource planning system so ERP systems and double ordered, triple ordered so that Nike for example, its sales were up only 3.5 percent globally last quarter and yet its inventory was up 44 percent and in the United States there were up 68 percent and if you look at it in transit, there are up 85 percent. So that's just one indication. We're seeing lots of inventory overhangs and even online sales are suffering. Amazon just had its second prime day and it showed no increase which is really from a year over year which is telling us that either units are down or prices are down. So I think the CPI that we got today is",https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6_2e_wGpQzc,52,2022-10-13 17:37:41
3244," over year, which is telling us that either units are down or prices are down. So I think the CEPI that we got today is a lagging indicator. It always is a lagging indicator. And we're seeing a lot of prices in the pipeline that are falling. So Kathy, let's talk about what this means for the Fed and your open letter to the Fed, where you urge them to consider some of what you're talking about right now. The market after today's data is now more fully pricing and not just a 75 basis point increase at this upcoming meeting, but at the one after that as well. Do you think the Fed should be done? Do you think they should even raise 75 basis points at this upcoming meeting? Or do you think they should stop here and give some time for their increases to make their way through the economy? Yes, as we're thinking about this question, we compare what Chairman Powell is doing to what Chairman Volker did in the late 70s, early 80s, when he was fighting an inflation problem that had been building for 15 years, Vietnam War, great society closing the gold window. That was a real inflation problem that built up over 15 years. This inflation problem has been 12 to 15 months by the time the Fed started addressing it, and we think it's much more a function of supply chain imbalances caused by COVID, and then again by Russia's invasion of Ukraine. These are very, very different circumstances. So what the Fed has done this time around is it has increased interest rates. If they go another 75 basis points, which is very likely on November 2nd, they will have increased interest rates from 0.25 to 4%, and that's a 16 fold increase. What did Volker do in the early 80s? He took interest rates from 10 to 20%. That's a two fold increase after consumers and businesses had gotten used to dealing with inflation and working around it over 15 years. This is a real shock to the system, and I do believe we will see the ramifications, in many ways we're seeing housing shutting down, and I think we're going to see a lot of other activities shutting down as well. We believe we're in a recession, and we believe this recession now will be sustained. If we see an increase in GDP, it's probably because either inventories are continuing to increase or imports are coming down as companies try to unwind their inventories. Kathy, so do you see a severe recession, and then how long do you think this bear market will continue? Well, what's interesting, I think many people are coming around to the idea that we're in a recession or we're going into a recession. The first two quarters with real GDP growth negative to us means we're in a recession. Now that many people are worried and are beginning to see recession for as far as the eye can see, we are looking at this recession a little bit differently. We think it's going to be a function of this massive inventory overhang, and that it's going to be a serious inventory correction, but it's not going to be anything like we saw in 0809. That was a systemic financial problem caused by the mortgage and financial meltdown. We don't think this is the same thing. Now that many economists are starting to agree with us that we're in a recession or going into a recession, we feel that they might become a little bit too alarmist if this is just an inventory recession. But I think the Fed will have a lot to do with whether or not it is. This is a shock, though, to the system and this idea that we have an inventory overhang, we think it's going to get bigger as consumers pull back low saving rates, 3.5% versus 8% where it was before COVID. And so we'll see. We think this holiday season is going to be pretty tough. And so as you kind of read your shopping list for that holiday season, Kathy, when you think about some of the kind of ways that equity valuations are starting to price in",https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6_2e_wGpQzc,53,2022-10-13 17:41:58
3245," And so as you kind of ready your shopping list for that holiday season, Kathy, and you think about some of the kind of ways that equity valuations are starting to price in that recession to the best of their ability, is there a big buy that you now kind of think through or evaluate going into the end of the year here? Well, you have to consider the source here and our focus, our sole focus, is on disruptive innovation. And we also believe that innovation solves problems. We had a tough time going into COVID with our kind of strategy. And then we had a boom in our strategy during COVID because guess what? We needed the genomic revolution to help sequence the coronavirus and figure out tests and vaccines and our kinds of companies helped with that. We think with supply chain issues and with the food and energy prices caused by this shock, this Russia's invasion of Ukraine, that once again innovation is going to help solve these problems. Electric vehicles, there's an accelerated consumer preffership towards electric vehicles like Tesla because of oil prices. And we think there's no stopping that trend now. And in terms of food prices, we do believe that gene editing is going to help us figure out how to produce crops in areas that are less fertile than the Ukraine, the bread basket of Europe, with less water, less fertilizer, less pesticide. So we're going to continue to see the miracles associated with the genomic revolution. But our other strategies as well, whether we're talking about robotics, solving the labor shortage, energy storage, I mentioned electric vehicles, pulling us away from oil consumption, artificial intelligence, which is going to help every company become more competitive if they use their data and combine it with other data in effective ways. And then blockchain technologies, which is going to take the middle men out of a lot of businesses and take the cost out of a lot of businesses, helping us to solve this inflation problem. So again, consider the source. We think innovation solves problems. It certainly gave us an appreciation of that during COVID. Our strategy was high flying. And we think we have the more problems right now. So stay tuned. Kathy, this economic shock that you talk about in large part at the hands of the Fed, does that cause a shock to one of your long term holdings in Tesla, in terms of the stock price and also the company's financials? Well, certainly all stocks are experiencing difficulty in this environment as the market tries to understand how far the Fed is going to go and how deep this recession is going to be. So Tesla, as I mentioned, is a solution to the problem. It's very interesting. If you look at gasoline demand this summer in the United States, it dropped below COVID levels, the worst of COVID, and it dropped to levels that we have not seen since 1997. That's real demand destruction. And it couldn't have happened. We do not believe without electric vehicles at the margin, taking huge share from traditional automobiles. So if we had to be concerned about an industry, it would be the traditional auto industry. We think that gas powered vehicles are going to be obsolete within the next five to 10 years. And the traditional auto industry has to figure out a way to migrate into electric vehicles and into the next big phase, which we think Tesla is leading, the autonomous taxi platform phase. So lots of changes here. Traditional industries are in harm's way as innovation pushes through accelerated by some of the turmoil out there. Cathy, when we last talk.",https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6_2e_wGpQzc,54,2022-10-13 17:46:15
3246," These are in harm's way as innovation pushes through accelerated by some of the turmoil out there. Kathy, when we last talked back in the spring, I believe it was just at the beginning of the Elon Musk Twitter saga. Now we are maybe, maybe getting to a little bit of closure in that case. But I would post you the same question that I asked you then because a lot of time is elapsed in different events have happened. Are you at all concerned about Musk's attention wavering now that it looks like he is in fact going to be taking over and likely at least having a pretty heavy hand in running Twitter? Well, we are prolific users of Twitter. Our gives away its research. We give away our research not when it's finished, but as it's evolving. And our most prolific platform, social platform out there is Twitter. I'm kind of excited to see what Elon will do. I actually think he'll work closely with Jack Dorsey and maybe open up the ecosystem, take away the censorship, make it much more transparent. And I think add more value to that ecosystem. You don't think it'll be a mess if that happens. It'll just be sort of a free for all where it's tougher to find commentary of value. It's interesting about Twitter and what we found this we have a lot of debate around arcs own strategies. We can filter that debate ourselves so we can unfollow people if we think there's bad behavior, but that's our choice. And we can follow those people who we think are moving discussions, whether it's about innovation or the economy moving, moving discussions along. So I think there's a lot of wisdom out there. And we're kind of sick of the nonsense that we see on some of these social platforms. And Twitter, I think, is going to give us more tools to filter out the nonsense and get right down to business. I certainly would like to filter out a lot of the nonsense sometimes on Nerkati. I want to ask you more broadly about arc invests and your funds. And the funds that we have seen, which we're seeing sort of bigger swings to the up end of the downside earlier in the year. They've gotten a little more muted as of late. You talk a lot about your three to five year time horizon, which I think makes sense. But I wonder how long how patient investors are going to be particularly in an environment where they are seeing losses, not just in our K. But in lots of other areas as well. Yes, and I think one thing that helps our clients is our research. And they see that it's first principles research. We have the long term time horizon. And we're seeing spectacular exponential growth opportunities. And not only one by one, the various platforms I just described, but the convergence of those platforms. So one ask her feeding another. And I think many of our clients understand that they're short innovation. Truly disruptive innovation. If you own the NASDAQ or the NASDAQ 100 right now and you look through that index. This is not the index that I grew up with in the 80s and 90s when we were looking for innovation. We'd go to the NASDAQ. But if you look through the NASDAQ now and especially the NASDAQ 100, what you see are 25% of the names touching disruptive innovation. The rest of them are kind of me too. They look like other indexes, the fangs, Microsoft, Nvidia, Tesla would be our only overlap. And then you look further and more deeply into these indices. And you see names that you'd never expect to be there food and beverage utilities, rails, brick and mortar retail. These are not innovation companies. And so what we've done at ARC is we are pure play innovation. And we'd like to think we are what the NASDAQ used to be in the 80s and 90s. And it used to be a very productive place to invest with a long-term investment time horizon. So I think our sharing our research.",https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6_2e_wGpQzc,55,2022-10-13 17:50:53
3247," and 90s and it used to be a very productive place to invest with a long-term investment time horizon. So I think our sharing our research and our pointing out to investors look what you think you own in innovation is not what it used to be and what ARC is doing is really back to the future. We're all about investing in the future as opposed to indexes which are more about past success. Those companies that have been extremely successful have risen to the top of these indexes. But if we're right in these five platforms that involve 14 different technologies are going to disrupt the traditional world order, then investors need to get to the right side of change. And one of the other things that we do is one of our missions and values is to educate. That's why we give our research away and we want to educate not only investors but parents and grandparents about how the world is changing, how radically it's changing and how it's ever more important to get especially students on the right side of change so that they can enjoy these incredible growth opportunities and not be disrupted by industries that will be sunsading shall I say. Kathy, a three to five year time horizon means not only kind of mid-term or recession-proofing your companies, you're not just recession-proofing your portfolio, you're also kind of midterm-proofing your portfolio, you're a general election-proofing your portfolio. And so, you know, ARC, how do you go about identifying disruptive innovation that then doesn't get disrupted by public policy or political agenda? Well, we have a six metric scoring system, very much focused on innovation. One of the scores is thesis risk. Thesis risk has a lot to do with government policy. And so, in the in the early days of ARC in 2014-15, we were thinking, okay, government may be very concerned about the safety of autonomous vehicles. But as we've moved through these last eight years, what we've seen, thankfully, is the government and regulators in particular very focused on data. And what does the data say? The data says that most fatalities and accidents, 85, almost 90% of them, are caused by a human error. If we take the human being out of the equation, then we're going to save up to 35, 40,000 lives in the United States, the fatalities per year, and up to 1.25 million around the world. So, that is a noble goal. And we've been very gratified to see the regulators looking at the fatalities in Tesla's vehicles and informing us that for the most part, most of those fatalities were caused by human error. And for the second, that people who are driving Tesla vehicles are much safer thanks to the various automated driving capabilities now. Up to 40% safer than in most other cars. So, we're very focused on what governments are studying in terms of the data. And if they stick to the data, innovation typically solves problems and makes the world a better place. Really, always a treat to get some time with you. Cathy Wood, Ark, Invest Founder, and see you. Always nice to see you. We'll talk to you soon. Appreciate the time. Thank you, Brian. Julie as well. Thank you. Thank you. All right. Let's stay on the economy here. Inflation is still running hot. As we saw in today's consumer price index, that comes as economic growth continues to be sluggish and recession calls pick up on Wall Street. Let's dive into the economic outlook with Jair Bernstein, who is a member of the White House Council of Economic Advisors. Jair, always great to talk with you. I don't know if you heard, but we just had noted investor Cathy Wood on call.",https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6_2e_wGpQzc,56,2022-10-13 17:54:57
3248," Jar Bernstein, who is a member of the White House Council of Economic Advisors. Jar, always great to talk with you. I don't know if you heard, but we just had noted investor Kathy Wood on calling for a potential economic shock because what we're seeing with inflation and the Fed, we'll have to get your take on it. Well, I think the underlying fundamentals when it comes to particularly the labor market remain very strong in this economy. And that's a really important tail when family budgets are challenged by these high price levels. So, when you have an unemployment rate of 3.5%, you're adding hundreds of thousands of jobs per month, 10 million jobs since this President got here. That's going to help working families offset some of the pressures they're facing on the price side. But it certainly doesn't get the job done and we've got a lot more to do in that space. And that's why at the direction of the President, we have focused like a laser on doing all we can to ease price pressures on the supply side of the economy when it comes to the ports, when it comes to shipping costs, air freight costs, energy costs. And of course, the inflation reduction act with its reduction in costs for medical care, for premiums, for prescription drugs, and also for clean energy. So, I think the question is, A, is there a strong labor market at your back, the answer is yes, B, is this administration doing everything we can to help ease those pressures? Also a firm yes on that one. Jared, I want to pick up on the energy part of all of that in particular. And listen, I know you're not a foreign policy guy, but obviously what's been going on between the U.S. and Saudi Arabia has been getting a lot of attention and the Saudi support of the OPEC production cut, which has been problematic for the global energy market. We were looking for prices to continue their downward trajectory. What can the White House do and what is it doing domestically in terms of continuing to push for more production domestically? Well, let's set the level here with just a little bit of a background on what's been going on in energy markets because I certainly agree with a lot of your characterization, but we got that in the CPI report this morning, which is a motivation for our discussion. A gas price is actually down about 5 percent in September and at an annualized rate of almost a third, about 30 percent in the third quarter. And of course that reflects almost 100 days of declining gas prices. Now to get to your question, and also to reference back what I was talking about in terms of what this White House can do to help, that reflects the very large distribution of 180 million barrels of oil from the strategic reserves. That's ongoing to be clear. It's another 10 million barrels coming October, November. So that's an ongoing addition to global supply. But we have to do more, especially in the light of this misguided and I think a very wrong headed decision by OPEC+. I'm not going to talk about the geopolitics. That's not my lane. I will say the president has consistently since then gone out and talked about the importance of sharing some of those wide profit margins with consumers to give them a bit more breathing room with the pump. If you look at the spread between the wholesale and the retail price, it's still quite elevated. But let's not forget that at the pump, the national price, about $3.90 gallon is down over a dollar from its peak in June. We need to see more of that kind of breathing room for consumers and that's one of the things we're going to keep pressing on. The reality is that individuals households, they can't afford to stop spending on some of the necessities whether that's food, whether that's energy prices, whether that's some of the rent prices even that we've been tracking. And so even with a longer, more protracted kind of an era of higher inflation, higher prices that people are paying, what do you believe from the White House side are some of the longer term implications of that that may also begin to show up on the back end? So here's my answer to that. I think when you're thinking about that question, which looks around a corner, corners are very hard to look around right now. As you know, everybody's crystal ball is kind of cracked. Inflation is a global phenomenon. It's higher in many other countries than it is here. But I think the right thing to do is ask yourself, are the institutions most directly responsible for this challenge doing what they need to do? Because in other cases, modern scientists, technology族, their Sultanate, their perlu, industrial sucker, savez came along with an intellectual Haus and launched by Hertz,",https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6_2e_wGpQzc,57,2022-10-13 17:59:33
3249," But I think the right thing to do is ask yourself, are the institutions most directly responsible for this challenge doing what they need to do? The Federal Reserve absolutely yes, okay? They're their pivot, they're tightening campaign. I'm not going to get into the details because we stay out of their knitting. But they're very much engaged as they should be the president and has endorsed that pivot. Are we doing everything we can as I've tried to explain yes in the energy space and the supply chain space helping to unsknarl supply chains, inflation reduction act, chip sack, infrastructure act helping to boost the economy supply site. Are policies makers doing what they need to do? Is it taking effect? Well, if we dig into the inflation report today, we see goods inflation was actually flat in September. That's useful. But of course, housing inflation, shelter inflation created more pressures. Well, is the Fed's action cooling the housing market unequivocal? Yes, it takes time for that lag to work its way into the CPI. But we're already seeing some cooling in the housing market actually non-trivial both on the rental side and the ownership side. I'm chair, just very quickly. We've been starting to hear not just from Kathy Wood, but other economists that inflation, forward looking inflation indicators are already starting to come down. So just to put your pure economist hat on for a moment, is inflation going to take care of itself? Should the Fed and the White House actually maybe take a step back to here and say inflation will come down without us having to push things into a recession? Well, I think that's a complicated question that gets into a lot of debates, some of which would have me a lot more into the Fed's knitting than I'm willing to go in this position. You're right. When I was a punitive chin-flapping plane, you know, I get into this all day. It's a good question. But from our perspective, we want to respect the Fed's independence. I think the question again redounds quite simply to the following. The Fed is the first and foremost inflation fighter. This President has said we deeply respect their independence. So we're not going to comment on their granular policy, but he has said that this pivot that they've made is a very appropriate pivot given the challenge of price pressures. On our side, you've seen, you know, well more... Let me put it this way. I have never been part of a White House or any other job in my long political economy career where we've done more to try to help on the economy supply side. I never talked about dwell time in my long career. That's how that's the amount of time that containers spend in ports. Now I wake up every morning and check dwell times and they are significantly down through put through the ports is at historical levels, shipping costs, air freight costs, down significantly. Those actions have our fingerprints on it. We worked closely with the private sector, so there's a real partnership there. But again, the question to get away from the granular who's doing the right thing and the timing of all that, very complicated, quite... Nobody has the right answer to that. What you really need to ask is are there relevant institutions that fight inflation doing what they need to do and the answer for this White House and for this Federal Reserve is an unequivocal yes? Jared, all of us have gotten to get a big education about supply chain terminology to be sure. Jared Bernstein, member of the White House Council of Economic Advisors, thank you so much for your time this morning. Appreciate it. Thank you. Coming up, we'll get another check on markets and dig into some of the moogers here as we see.

We are seeing stocks still lower the Dow right now off of 186 points about half 1% but as you can see, we are well up off the lows of the session here, even though we are still sharply lower. So that initial alarm over CPI fading a little bit as people try and game out what the Fed is going to do next. We are seeing a similar phenomenon with the S&P, although it's still down 1.2% or so and the NASDAQ down about 1.9%. Likewise, we continue to watch what's going on with yields here the 30 or yield 3.92% and the 10-year yield coming just a hair back below 4%. Also in terms of movers, we are watching shares of Kroger and Albertsons. Bloomberg is reporting that the two grocers are in talks potentially to combine that an announcement could come as soon as sometimes this week or the next week Albertsons shares sharply higher. Kroger shares a little bit lower. We're going to battle it out in our bull versus bear segment this week. The focus will be on meta.

3251," Welcome back. It is time to battle it out in our bowl versus bear segment for the week. This week we put the spotlight on meta. Needham, senior analyst Laura Martin has an underperform rating on the stock saying costs will exceed revenue growth over the next two years. Welcome Laura and we've also got a B. Bernstein senior analyst Mark Schmohlich reiterating his outperform rating saying he sees light beyond the dark welcome mark as well. Okay, so let's get into this. First and foremost, we've got to talk about the advertising revenue right now for meta platforms, especially as so many companies are pulling back on some of their ad spend really looking at some of their cost restructuring as well. And so Laura, I want to go to you first on this as we see even more of that demand for digital advertising continuing to unfortunately see this vacuum given the restructuring that many companies are doing. What does that mean and net out for what should we should expect going forward for meta platforms and the underlying subsidiaries and Facebook Instagram? You're right. The macro environment continues to deteriorate. We think many ad driven companies will miss their fourth quarter earnings. And in meta's case, not only is just the macro environment deteriorating, but they're losing a lot of user time to tick talk. And that continues to happen. Tick-Tock now is up to 75% share of adults under 25 here in America, which is the highest ARP who region for meta. So we're worried about both ad unit availabilities as people move time into tick talk. And we're worried about demand softness at the advertising level. And 100% of meta's revenue comes from auction. So if you have a falling demand for units, you get light pricing for the units that you do have to sell. Mark, want to get your reaction to that? I mean, you're calling this a make or break quarter for meta. Absolutely. And I think Laura's right that there's certainly all these, you know, the very loud bear case right now where it is time to prove it even in this tough macro environment. And you know, there's really kind of three legs of things that they need to go off and effectively dispel. One is on the engagement side. And you know, since they had that for one quarter where they lost a million users, they've gained about 40 million Facebook Blue users. Now granted much of that's international, but domestic's out fine. On the revenue front, it is a tough macro, but we're seeing them actually set up a little bit better. Actually, starting to gain back some share of wallet from advertisers. Primarily as, you know, they've made some improvements on advantage, sorry, on, you know, the idea for on they've launched advantage plus, which certainly helps a lot of advertisers, you know, make decisions around kind of automating the the ad delivery process. And they've launched a lot more ad inventory ramping up advertising load on reels, launching new ad inventory elsewhere. And so, you know, we're starting to see them make progress against much that's been weighing down the stocks and seeing the last year. Mark, what a stay with you for a hot second. The reality of the revenue construct for for meta, especially as they make a big push into the meta verse. I mean, my goodness. Are we going to be buying $1,400 glasses to wear augmented reality glasses to wear within our households or even at work? Who knows? I bought one, not saying everybody else will. So I'll try it out. But, you know, I think where we are right now, that's certainly captures the headlines and certainly the number that they've been spending, you know, to kind of build out that meta, their metaverse ambitions is, you know, certainly kind of sticker. Shot it changed the whole name. Exactly right. You know, but I don't think that matters right now for the stock to work, right? Because I think the stock is back to questions around really core fundamentals. Folks can understand, you know, that's like a more long term initiative. I'm imagine investors will love it if they were spending a lot less on it. I think we're going to see some of that discipline. They're not going to bend in anything at all. But you certainly see discipline that, you know, investment in growth areas is going to be tied to core performance. You know, and so I think investors do need to see that discipline. And so long as engagement is holding and revenues are turning the corner off the bottom, you know, I think they kind of will allow them to continue to kind of build up even if it's not necessarily desired. But, you know, it's certainly a long term view.",https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6_2e_wGpQzc,60,2022-10-13 18:12:22

3253," going on with the consumer. We feel really good about the breakfast segment. We feel really good about our brand and how we stand tall. People need their coffee and their breakfast sandwich to start their morning. So we've seen really strong results for our brand in the last couple of months. Scott, full stop. I was critical to changes in the Roarth program, but it's coming from a place of love. I have to dunk an app. I go to dunk it all the time. And a lot of other people seemed to have caught my vibe. Have you looked at what you made here and are making any changes now to respond to consumers? Yeah, so, and I know it comes from a place of love from you, Brian. Absolutely. Here's what I would say. We rolled out our Dunkin Perks program in 2014, and we haven't made any changes in the last eight years. And we went out and we talked to our core users, and we said, what do you want from a program? And they said they wanted three things. They wanted more variety. Because in the old program, you could just get a beverage. They wanted more flexibility. And we've now given them a chance to stack points so they can buy a drink for themselves. They can buy a sandwich for their family or a whole meal for the soccer team. And they said they wanted recognition. So big users like you want to be recognizing we now have a boosted status. And so we've put those three things in place. We're really excited about this new program. We gave out four billion free points in the last three days. And the response has been overwhelming with positive. OK, fair enough. That's good to hear. But the birthday drink is the industry standard. Like I know, I would like to get a free birthday coffee until I ultimately drop dead and six feet under. I mean, do you think you'll bring that back? So we're talking about that for sure, Brian. But one thing we did do is, well, we did take that piece away. What we added is come in either the day before your birthday, the day of your birthday or the day after, get three times points, points that won't expire as long as you come a couple times a year. And you can actually get something besides just a beverage. You could get a donut, you could get a sandwich, you can get avocado toast, a lot more flexibility, which is what our guests wanted. So you're really monitoring some of the taste profiles that the trends on what consumers are moving towards in their purchases for anything from lunchtime to starting off the day. So where are you still seeing the most traffic at what point in the day to really make some of the menu decisions and changeovers there? Yeah, we're certainly a morning day part business. So 70% of our business happens before 11 AM. And honestly, when COVID happened and we had that shutdown, we were all very nervous when the commute was not happening. But people shifted their behaviors a little bit. And they came to us a little later in the morning and they came for a couple beverages, maybe to share with their spouses while they're working at home. But really, the trend that's happening is all around ice beverages. And we invented ice coffee. We're a leader, whether it's ice coffee, whether it's cold brew, our new refresher line, it's all about ice beverages and great attachment with snacking items to that. Hey, Scott, it's Julie here. I mean, I gotta say it's like, I guess I wanna know a little bit more about the whole recession, spending patterns, et cetera, because you sound super positive. And I'm just wondering what signs if any you see of trade down, for example, of a drop in traffic of any kind of sign that, you know, the anecdotal and data pain that we are talking about every day if you guys are seeing any evidence of that. Yeah, we do see some of it. And here's what I'd say anecdotally. What happens in our business is, when things happen like fuel prices or you see other spikes in inflationary environments, people pull back a little bit and maybe they stop coming quite as frequently to a Duncan or some other restaurant. But especially with Duncan, I think after a couple days or a week, people realize they need their morning Joe to get started, right? They need their coffee to fuel their day and we've seen it come right back up. And I think uniquely positioned for us, Duncan, it is a value offering, right? So we've got great products, both beverage and food, at a great price point, at the speed of Duncan. I think that's an unmatched combination out there. Scott, I go to my local Duncan every Saturday. I mean, it's just a ritual I have. And every time I'm in line, I want your huge in the morning, which is a good thing I'm sure, but everybody's buying coffee, notably iced coffee. How big a percentage is donuts now on your business? And what does that menu look like? Yeah, donuts are about 20% of our product mix right now. You're right.",https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6_2e_wGpQzc,62,2022-10-13 18:24:26
3254," And is donuts now on your business? And what does that menu look like? Yeah, donuts are about 20% of our product mix right now. You're right. Ice coffee is the future. That last year was the first year we sold more ice beverages than hot beverages. That's what the next generation of consumer wants. They want these ice cold beverages. They want highly colorful products that they can share on Instagram. But I will say our donuts, no one does donuts like we are. We are obviously a national and a global leader on donuts. You got to come try our spider donut, which we just rolled out for Halloween. We've got a jack-a-lantern donut. There's nothing more shareable and more fun. And a nice treat to yourself than a donut. As you've got more people returning either to office or to schools that breakfast wars, that's continuing to brew and heat up. What's Duncan's positioning in that breakfast war and what are going to be the keys to essentially helping it retain that consumer mind share and that dollar at the beginning of the day? Yeah, a couple of things. First of all, we have an incredible brand with a lot of brand love. So we tap into that loyalty like that new program. The second is some degree of everyday value or targeted digital value. So through our app, we are going to have the ability to have laser-focused offers that go right to you and what you want and give you incredible value in our program. And then the last thing I'd say is we've got, it's through our app, our ability to order ahead. So Brian, when you see those long lines, you download the app, order ahead. It'll be ready when you get there and the crew will hand it to you and you'll be off and running for your busy day. Scott, I just, I need the birthday drink back. I'm going to Duncan anyway, lad. I'm going to get off of here. I'm going to Duncan. I just need the birthday drink back. Please, please. Brian, I'm going to come deliver coffee to you personally on your birthday. I'll take that. April 4th. There we go. Yeah, done. Deal. Duncan, President Scott Murphy. Thanks so much for joining us this morning. Appreciate it. Thank you guys. Coming up, everyone, we're going to do a final check. Of the markets on the other side of this short break. Well, that was quite a two hours. Hope you enjoyed the ride. We certainly did.

We're gonna chask ICG's Nick Brooks to break it all down next crude oil among the risk assets sliding after the numbers hit This as the IEA says OPEC plus cost could tip the global economy into recession We're going to speak with saxo banks head of commodities on exactly that and our innovation funders CEO Kathy would spoke with our morning team about its holdings and that open letter to the Fed We're going to bring you more from the conversation First let's get a check of the market action. It is a down day here We can see the Dow off almost a hundred points pairing some of those losses SMP 500 in Nasdaq Underwater as well and taking a look at the bond market Wow, we saw the 13 week Kiko not shown right there scream higher But also the 10 year that is up about seven basis points in the five year the lower part of the",https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6_2e_wGpQzc,64,2022-10-13 18:32:31
3256," The bond market, wow, we saw the 13 week people not showing right there scream higher, but also the 10 year that is up about seven basis points in the five year the Lower part of the curve that is up 12 basis points, and I want to check the Wi-Fi interactive now I'm going to show you the S&P 500 futures and this this is going to show you what happened at 8 30 a.m When we got the lowest or excuse me the highest core CPI print this cycle and that was a big down move in the futures You can also see here 10 year treasury no futures big down move there That means the yields shot up and I'll show you what happened to gold gold taking a leg lower even WTI crude oil it did Take that initial Downside action, but that has been subsequently reversed and we got to take a check on the world's I think most proxied risk asset I'm going to call it that Bitcoin that is also taking two legs lower so no recovery Insight for Bitcoin as it heads to 18,000 that is basically the low of the year So pretty critical to watch this going forward and American still feeling the pinch when it comes to the price of groceries in September the price of food Increased by 0.8% compared to August Brooked to Paul must hear with the details and where did we see some of these biggest jumps broke That's right one of the biggest canons worries. We saw the jumps is in cereal and bakery products now This is considered the highest since the 70 late 70s and early 80s. I was confirmed by Steve Reed and economists at the Bureau of Labor statistics Of course those higher pricings being driven by higher gasoline oils Transportation weighing on the cost for both groceries and farmers alike of course energy costs here Decreased by 2.6% gasoline down 5.6% making a cheaper to transport goods, but still higher Of course also to kids can say consideration rising worker wages and prices for impact costs like packaging Fertilizer there and now here if you take a look cereal and bakery products being driven higher by of course that rushes Ukraine Invasion that happened earlier this year also fruit and vegetables being impacted here of 10.4% Due to a historic drought facing the western half of the country impacting crop yields there We got to talk about egg inflation here. It looks like some items including eggs are seeing a bit of a price decline Other is not so much. I just wondering what items are sticking out to you. That's very well to make it clear Americans can still inspect sticker shock here when they go to the grocery store Yeah, exactly. There's really no relief just yet. Of course we see right here that eggs a month of a month down 3.5% milk Down 1.3% but this of this is doable to some of the impact some of the Climate events that happen over the summer of course eggs buyers recovering from the springs avian influenza outbreak That's what doctor Michael Spence in a Wells Fargo telling me but dairy dealing with a hot summer They are in key markets also vegetables dealing with that record transportation costs shipping costs Expensive to decline here, but still taking a toll on prices here And if we take a look year over year of course higher prices across the board some of the highest increase here Flower lettuce potatoes Margarine milk and eggs eggs once again seeing a bit of relief, but still up 30% now jarred as you know This is a volatile index there hard to judge whether or not next month We might see a tick up a tick down there, but I also want to note that citrus Somebody to keep a lookout here on Wednesday the US Department of Agriculture said that Florida's orange crop this year It'll be the smallest in 1943 now. That's not even taking into account the effects of hurricane Irene So lots of fold out here, but Americans still expecting higher prices across the board Silver lining for you and I broke I hear that our lunchtime is getting picked up today by corporate But today only really appreciate that report in all serious and it's lots of higher prices to digest Young finances broke to Paul. Thank you sticking with this morning CPI report Let's welcome in and Nick Brooks ICG head of economics and investment research for his reaction to the numbers and Nick Let me just get your your thoughts your front line thoughts on those headline numbers here Especially that core reading would just shut up excluding food at energy Yeah, I think that's the key problem. I mean the headline number has been sort of gradually coming down since June But the real focus is on the core inflation, which is of course is what the Fed really cares about And that just keeps going up and as you were highlighting food inflation is very high Shelter inflation has also been a key driver of the rate health care costs and pretty much",https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6_2e_wGpQzc,65,2022-10-13 18:37:07
3257," keeps going up. And as you were highlighting, food inflation is very high. Shelter inflation has also been a key driver of the rate, healthcare costs, and pretty much across the board and services. So the problem with this type of number is, I don't think the Fed wants to continue raising rates. I think the Fed recognizes quite clearly that the economy is probably going into a slowdown over the next couple of quarters. But as long as those core inflation rates remain so high, they need to keep raising rates to keep it under control. So I think bottom line is, and the market seems to think, we're going to get 75 basis points from the Fed in November. And now markets are starting to price potentially another 75 in December. Yes. So not a good place to be. Yes, I even saw 100 basis point raise in November being price as I think the probability was 2% max. But just goes to show you the extent to which the Fed, which has really been consistent on its messaging. I was going through the FOMC minutes that were released yesterday. No big surprises at CPI, of course, being the bigger report here. But we've seen central bank action out of the bank of England, the bank of Japan, just get completely reversed. I mean, you look at the debt of the UK or the currency of Japan trading like emerging markets here. What do you make of the central bank or reaction? How painted into a corner are they? I think they're all painted into quite a severe corner. Now, you know, I'm based here in the UK. And I won't start talking too much about the UK, but they're in a very, very tight spot. And I think the problem is, you know, central banks haven't faced anything like this since the late 70s, early 80s, where you've got extreme inflation. And it's broad-based. And you know, the central bank recognized that growth is coming down. And if it wasn't for these inflation rates, they probably be cutting rates. But bottom line is they're worried that inflationary expectations could get out of control and will get the, you know, the feared wage price spiral that, you know, become self-fulfilling. So they have to talk tough, they have to act tough until inflation rates start coming down, even if it means recession. Well, and we've gotten comments, commentary from CEOs who may or may not be talking their books. But Jamie Diamond sticks out in particular, especially ahead of earnings, which we expect imminently this week. Tomorrow morning, and he's talking about another 20% decline in the S&P 500 already on its way there over the last couple days. Just wondering what you see in terms of the markets set up on any levels you're looking at. What are you looking for in the eventual rebound when we find a bottom finally? Yeah. I think there are a couple of things. My own view would be that, you know, a lot of the rate increases are in the market. So if you look at swap rates, if you look at forward rates, you know, I think a lot of the central bank hikes that are coming are actually in the market. I think where perhaps the market has not yet priced appropriately is the risk of quite a severe earnings decline as we move into potential recession. So I think the, you know, PEs need to come down further and the earnings are also likely to come down further. So I think there is certainly likely to be more downside on equity markets. The other point though I'd make is I think very similar to what we saw during the COVID, the worst of the COVID pandemic. I think it will be very sector focused. I think there are going to be some sectors that are clearly going to be hit much harder than others in this type of environment. But there also be some sectors that will perhaps be less affected. So I think one does have to take more nuanced approach if one has a medium term view on an medium term investment horizon. Investors need the nuanced view because the Fed is not playing the nuance game. Well said here Nick Brooks, ICG head of economic investment research. Thank you for your time today. Thank you. Before we go to break, check in on shares of Delta. You can see that company if we can get it on the screen there in a second. The company beat on revenue in the third quarter. And we spoke with CEO Ed Bastion who had this to say about airfare cost cuts that will benefit customers like you and me. We thought what happened earlier this spring when we pushed ourselves a little faster than we thought we could and the reliability suffered. So I'm confident we can get there by next.",https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6_2e_wGpQzc,66,2022-10-13 18:41:37
3258," So what happened earlier this spring when we pushed ourselves a little faster than we thought we could and the reliability suffered. So I'm confident we can get there by next summer. And as we bring that additional capacity back, that's going to help probably take a little bit of the pressure off of pricing for consumers. But more importantly, for Delta, it's going to enable us to get much better cost productivity and will be able to pass along some of that cost savings onto our customers. Coming up, feeling the domino effect. The fly material says it'll take a big hit on export curves for China. And that's his founder, giant TSMC, that's Taiwan. Taiwan semi, well, they're slashing capital spending in another sign of trouble for this sector. We're going to take a look at the movers after this. Welcome back. Chipmakers still flashing warning signs with the latest headlines from Taiwan semi adding to the gloom. The Taiwanese group cutting its budget for 2022, but shares higher on better than expected results. And more we have, the finances in S4A and more gloom for the chip sector under a lot of pressure already. Yeah, that's right. And if we look at the Philadelphia semiconductor index, I mean right now it's rebounding, but it had opened lower, was down as much as 4% earlier today. And the four day chart will show you that it's down 5% and a year-to-date chart shows these down 43%. But let's get to that chip sector that you were just mentioning and TSMC that beat on the top in the bottom line, cutting capital spending and also warning about slowing consumer demand. So moving into the fourth quarter, TSMC warning that it's seeing demand bladdish. Right now it's rebounding the stock. It's up 7%. But I also just want to mention that look the chip.",https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6_2e_wGpQzc,67,2022-10-13 18:46:36
3259," TSMC warning that it's seeing demand bladdish. Right now it's rebounding the stock. It's up 7%. But I also just want to mention that look, the chip sector has been dealing with the fallout of the new government regulations to buy an administration's export control. So you've got applied materials, lamb research, applied materials saying that their fourth quarter is going to be impacting, impacted by this new regulation. So you've got this regulation on the one hand. And then you've got some of these chip makers that are talking about slowing consumer demand on the other hand, impacting. And keep in mind that the chip sector also is going through periodic cycles. So it was expected that in the second half of the year that we would see demand slow down, slower. And it's these stocks are such that kind of, they've kind of been the way the pandemic style stocks have been really high during the pandemic and then losing steam this year. Hey, we don't need any nuance on that. We know the hit that they've been taking and a lot of green on that board, it was read quite a bit earlier. All right, Yahoo, finances and S for it. Thank you for that report. Schneider Electric, one of the largest energy and power equipment providers in Europe and abroad unveiling new research and corporate ESG efforts at its presentation in Las Vegas. And finding, while there's little intention from companies to do green and be green, actually a lot of that intention, there's not enough follow-through. For more, we have Amir Paul Schneider, our electric president, North America. And thank you for coming here today. This is all part of your presentation at the Innovation Summit Las Vegas. Just tell us a little bit about the event and what we can expect from that. Well, first of all, thank you for having me. And yes, we're here with 1,500 customers, about 20% of the Fortune 500 is here. And the conversation that we're having is how do we move from an intent to action? There's been a lot of commitments made about getting to net zero, and that's great. More of those commitments are getting certified with science-based targets, which is an important next step. But really deploying the technologies and learning by doing is how we're going to create innovation that we desperately need. And that's really what we're talking to our partners, customers, and broader strategic alliances about here. The thing that's most important right now is that we remember that sustainability is also an efficiency driver. So it's got a bottom line positive impact. And I think that is going to be an acceleration point for all of the sectors. And a lot of the impetus behind the, well, behind the clean air movement and clean energy movement has to do with government subsidies, just wondering what the status of that is. We hear a lot about that with respect to Tesla and some of the other big makers, but there's a lot going on behind the scenes as well as we beef up our infrastructure. It's government subsidies for sure, especially for consumers, and it'll act as a catalyst for consumers to make the right choices. People want to do the right thing. And if it can be also providing a better experience, then these incentives are just going to make that transition happen faster. Think about people buying an EV. Once they buy an EV, they have an opportunity to put solar in their home. When they do that, they can add a battery. And then with technologies that we can work with the utilities to also make them producers of energy and maybe even sell some of that back in the right environments to the broader grid. So there's a real evolution where consumers are going to become prosumers. And we think this evolution is going to be catalyzed by things like the Inflation Reduction Act. But I want to go back to my earlier point. Investment and clean tech is about also making environments more efficient, not just in terms of being more green, but operationally more efficient. So it actually saves money in the long term. And we've published research with the Schneider Sustainable Institute that in existing buildings, we can build payback periods under eight years, not only making the buildings more efficient and in places like Las Vegas at the largest Hilton property in the world, we're demonstrating that as an active solution. What's some of the tech behind this, what you call next generation industrial technology that's being used to empower workers, specifically, how does this all fit together? So look, one key element is to bring digital into the space. As consumers, we've been living in the digital and internet era for about 20 years. But in the industrial space, data and digital assets are just being deployed at scale. And what digital does is it makes the invisible visible and brings all of the...",https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6_2e_wGpQzc,68,2022-10-13 18:50:20
3260," but in the industrial space, data and digital assets are just being deployed at scale. And what digital does is it makes the invisible visible and brings all of that opportunities for optimization. What it also helps us do is take our scarce resource which is people and help them focus on the most important places where they can innovate and be creative. That is also going to create a lot of new jobs. We think there's an incredible opportunity in the clean tech space and solar, the number of electricians we're going to need and we're investing. In addition to working with people like Nika, the National Association of Electrical Contractors, we're investing with community colleges to make sure the next generation is ready to work in this IoT environment. Finally, we're also investing in manufacturing. We announced an additional $46 million invested in the United States to prepare for this wave of electrification. And that's on top of 100 million we invested in our factories last year. We appreciate your time here. I got to leave it there, Amir Paul Schneider, Electric President North America. Thank you. Coming up, if you think the S&P's 2022, excuse me, 2022 flood has been steep. Spare a thought for Kathy Wood's flagship fund, it has plummeted as more than twice the pace. So how is she feeling? My name's like Tesla and Roku now. You're going to hear from her up next. we're going on найдulee. Welcome back. We saw a red inflation print this morning with CPI coming in at 0.4% for the month and Kathy Wood weighed on one of the prints and more with our morning show today with us now is Julie Hyman and Julie. Lots going on in that interview. She talked about golden deflation but also the dreaded R word recession. Yes, and it was sort of linked in with what she's talking about with deflation as well. The chief see some deflationary impulses out there going on under the service particularly in Camarro. We talk about gold.",https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6_2e_wGpQzc,69,2022-10-13 18:55:31
3261," And it was sort of linked in with what she's talking about with deflation as well. The chief see some deflationary impulses out there going on under the service, particularly in Camarro, and she did talk about gold. And so she talked about if indeed we are seeing deflation come down the pike, then the risk with the fed raising rates is that yes, we will see recession. This is a real shock to the system. And I do believe we will see the ramifications. In many ways we're seeing housing shutting down. And I think we're going to see a lot of other activities shutting down as well. We believe we're in a recession and we believe this recession now will be sustained. And if we see an increase in GDP, it's probably because either inventories are continuing to increase or imports are coming down as companies try to unwind their inventories. And it's pretty interesting, Julie, everybody talking about what the fed is going to do in November and December. But a lot of traders are already pricing in rate cuts for the end of 2023. We'll have to see how that pans out. But you also asked her about Elon Musk and the purchase of Twitter, of course, Elon and Tesla being one of the great disruption plays that she has. But what are thoughts on Elon taking over Tesla? Well, she doesn't have Twitter in the portfolio anymore. We should mention that. But she does have Tesla. And Tesla is one of the things that's done better in that portfolio amidst what has not done well overall, right? The arc, arc, arc, that benchmark ETF is down more than 60 percent for the year thus far. It's down in today's session even as other things are turning higher. So I asked her, what's the risk that Elon gets distracted and are you worried about what he's going to do for Twitter? She said she's excited about what Elon Musk could bring to Twitter. Listen. We are prolific users of Twitter. Our, uh, gives away its research. We give away our research, not when it's finished, but as it's evolving. And our most prolific platform, social platform out there is Twitter. Um, I'm kind of excited to see what Elon will do. I, I actually think he'll work closely with Jack Dorsey and maybe open up the ecosystem, take away the censorship, uh, make it much more transparent. And I think add more value to that ecosystem. You know, it was interesting. I asked her, like, isn't it going to be a mess though? And there's all this stuff. And she said, no, she said two things. I thought we're interested in one. She said she herself will be able to filter out. And she thought that, um, a Twitter under Elon Musk could offer users maybe more filtering options. And so that it wouldn't necessarily be a noisy, harassing, ugly place under an Elon Musk scenario. Let's see, when it comes to Twitter, innovation under the old regime, we just got that edit button after what, 10 years. So, uh, yeah, I think it could be a little bit chaotic. I'm interested to see all the changes. I hope it doesn't break. I don't think it will because, uh, as news people were, uh, were prolific users of, uh, it's great. We are. It's like Cathy Wood. Yes. Yes. Very prolific here. Thank you for that. And great interview, by the way. Thank you. I have a few finances at Julie Hyman. All right. Now, doubly doubling down on consumer finance, Apple and Goldman Sachs will offer a new, high yield savings account for the Apple card saying it'll come with no fees or minimum posits. The idea is that users can use and manage the account directly from their existing wallet. Apple pay was launched in 2014. And the joint credit card, Apple card was established by both groups in 2019. Cora coming up, chorus of Doom sayers. There was Damien Diamond's recession call. Then the IMF saying the worst is to come now in a rare warning. The IEA, that is the international energy agency, joins the negative sentiment brigade saying, op-ed plus cuts could tip this world the entire world into a downturn.

3262," A you you you today, with coming after an initial drop of just over 500 points here. S&P now up nearly 3% trading in the widest trading range that we have seen for this index since March 2020. Take a look at the NASAT composite. That's moving to the upset up just over 2% Russell 2000. Also railing today up just around 2% as well. Taking a look at the sector action here. And clearly we are seeing some broad base buying across the board, energy, financial technology, among the leaders lagging as consumer discretionary. If you can call that still up over 1% today. Take a look at some of those individual names that is leading us to the upside here. I mentioned the rally that we're seeing in big tech. Take a look at Apple. Apple up just over 3% today. Microsoft up over 4% Google staying in the green here and video up just around a 4% taking a look at the semis. We're also seeing some buying there. Now this is a group that has really been beaten down over the last several months, but particularly over what we've seen in the last five trading days. And again, we are seeing gains across the board Qualcomm and Intel there among the biggest gainers in Backroof. And then also the buying that we're seeing in some of these bank stocks ahead of earnings tomorrow.",https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6_2e_wGpQzc,71,2022-10-13 19:02:55
3263," Qualcomm and Intel, they're among the biggest gainers in that group. And then also the buying that we're seeing in some of these banks, stocks ahead of earnings tomorrow, JP Morgan up nearly five and a half percent, Wells Fargo up just over four and a half percent, Goldman even up just over four percent years. So, Michelle Broadbeast buying across the spectrum, certainly a very different picture as we head into the final hour training that what we were looking at shortly after the opening bell. And that does certainly seem to be the case with crypto as well as we take a look on the interactive for the action there. We saw Bitcoin bouncing back there this afternoon, as long along with the broader markets. I mean, look at the dip that we saw and shooting off straight to the races there in the middle of the afternoon. It has been an interesting week for crypto again with the SEC dashing hopes for a bit coin spot ETF from wisdom tree marking more than a dozen rejections for such ETFs. We do see a mixed picture for cryptocurrencies overall, ether still down, obviously, because it has not been fairing while ever since the merger. But in terms of crypto, we also saw Morgan Stanley and Leschina Shah suggesting that the cryptocurrency ecosystem, but not blockchain itself is becoming more centralized, finding, quote, reliance on the running of a large portion of the blockchain on a single or small group of cloud service providers becomes a non negligible risk to consider. So a little bit less risk there, at least she sees in the short term, Dave. All right, sounds good. My friend. Let's get you up to speed now on the housing market inflation, not the only thing heating up today mortgage rates jumping to a 20 year high now averaging 6.92% on the 30 year fix that's up from 666 a week ago and well more than the double the 305 from one year ago. Now Lawrence Yoon, the chief economist at realtor.com saying quote, even with an anticipated fall in home prices in some markets, principally in California, homes will continue to be unaffordable while rents are squeezing non owners. Now there is a glimmer of hope here on that front in terms of the rents rents grew 9% last month. That's the first single digit increase in a year according to Redfit. Demand is cooling for rentals and a record amount of building will improve supply. We expect it more than 400,000 units will come on the market this year. Haven't seen that in back back years since the 70s, Shana. All right, well that CPI print is the big story of the day coming in much hotter than expected inflation rising 8.2% in September and a year or year basis. We want to bring in Vince Reinhardt, Drifus and Melon, a chief economist, Vince, it's great to see you. So certainly it's interesting when you take a look at the market's reaction, but from an economist perspective, I guess this change your outlook at all just where we are in the economy right now, and what we could expect in the coming months. No, it just seals the deal for what the Fed will be doing in the near term 75 basis points that it's upcoming meeting in November and other 50 in December. What it tells you is that inflation, once it gets high, gets entrenched. The worrisome thing about the consumer price index report this morning was core inflation, strip out food and energy. That's growing 6.6% that's a 40 year high. It's getting into the prices of goods and services that are sticky and sticky lives up to its name. Hard to bud, but once they start going, they have momentum. And that's the Fed's problem. Inflations brought her base now. And we know that the Fed is playing catch up. And at this point, they want to do too much, rather too little to really get inflation under control. When you pass through some of the minutes that we just recently gone, how does that factor into some of these data points that are going to continue to come out being that this is the last CPI print we're going to see before the midterms? You're exactly right. That was the headline they wanted out of the minutes that were published yesterday. FOMC participants basically said, you could do too much, you could do too little. There's more danger if you don't do enough. While they fred it a little bit about what it means economic activity, they were much more concerned about inflation getting embedded and inflation expectations rise up to the same. So right now, monetary policy choices pretty easy. It's unpleasant, but it's easy. Because when inflation is so far above your 2% goal, they all know what to do and what they need to do is raise.",https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6_2e_wGpQzc,72,2022-10-13 19:07:48
3264," pleasant, but it's easy because when inflation is so far above your 2% goal, they all know what to do. And what they need to do is raise rates, and that's what they'll be doing. And they'll be doing tighter longer, and just about every CEO in the conference boards suggest a mild recession. Next year, and just about every guest on this show says the same. But Vince, is that going to be enough to drive down inflation? We're seeing earnings at least early on that show people there's no demand destruction. Despite dramatically higher prices, what will bring down inflation to 2% of its just mild, we get anywhere near it. Ultimately, it would be the Federal Reserve that returns inflation to its goal by being willing to keep the policy rate high for a long time. I actually don't think they'll get there next year. And that is because inflation is stubborn. And as you say, the economy slips into a recession when the unemployment rate starts rising. As inflation gets nearer to their goal, not near enough to it, they're going to have much more difficult policy choices. And chances are they'll blink. I.e. they won't keep rates high enough to get inflation back to 2. They'll satisfy themselves that inflation in the neighborhood of 2, even if it starts with a 3, is sufficient progress to ultimately get to the vehicle. And then you've been in the room before you've been part of the very similar types of discussions. What can you tell us? What do you think the conversations are like now inside the Fed when we do get a print like today's? So I think it's a combination of what I alluded to earlier. A lot of unanimity when inflation is so high, the urge to tighten is across all FOMC participants. But you're beginning to see them put markers down about the next fight. And the next fight is next year when the unemployment rate is rising, when the economy is in recession, some of them are going to want to slow the process down. And so underneath all that good feeling, underneath them all saying the same thing about the need to raise rates a lot in front load policy to accommodation is a beginning of this showing of the seams. Where they're worried, where there'll be a difference of opinion, where it's set show up, concerns about rising unemployment rate or recession, and global economic recession. That's back on the board now, particularly this week when the IMF and the World Bank annual meetings are ongoing. They're all going to the same meetings. They're all here in the same thing. Yes, you need to tighten. You also need to be aware that everybody's tightening monetary policy and their significant risks of financial stability. And then obviously the IMF releasing their global outlook, seeing reduced growth also in some of the major economies expecting a slow down there. They looked, they talked about the EU, China, and the US. How do you see the fact that we're such an interconnected world now with our economies? How do you see that playing out in terms of the pressure it might put on the US economy? A lot. And it's not global monetary policy accommodate. A coordination is actually emulation. When the Fed raises interest rates, it puts upward pressure on the exchange value of the dollar. It puts downward pressure on everybody else's exchange rate, which is a force for inflation in Europe, in Japan, in emerging markets. Most central banks don't like it, and they're forced to follow the Fed up. So part of the message this week is recognize Fedors are we're all following you. That means your footprint is bigger on the global economy than you may appreciate. And that problems in the global economy will blow back to the US economy. That's the concern about next year. And as I want to close with the housing market, now mortgage rates certainly little rise and fall dramatically with rates, but more than 10 years, but needless to say another 75 point, it's probably going to take us above 7%.

3265," It appears to be the first breaking point. So look, the Fed's got to work the tools it has in terms of the monetary transmission mechanism. There's basically two reliable features. You raise rates, you choke off housing, you raise rates, you tend to put upward pressure on the exchange rate of the dollar. That's unpleasant for people looking for homes, and it's unpleasant for our trading partners facing downward pressure on their own exchange rates. I would think that housing is going to be troubled for a while. And the place to see that is actually abroad. In the UK, where more of mortgage activity is at variable rates, you see a much more sharper contraction and activity. Indeed, you see an inability to get mortgages at some point over the last couple of weeks. That's the future for the US. It just takes longer because we rely so much more on fixed rate mortgages. But as you said, fixed rate 30-year mortgages has been more than doubled in a year, and it's going up probably into the sevens next year. Indeed it appears, Sue. All right, Vince Reinhardt, appreciate your time here, sir. Thank you. Coming up, we're just getting started here on Young Who Finance Live Netflix on bailing the details.

3266," Markets in rally mode, despite a hotter than expected inflation print this morning, the Dow now trading above 30,000. Look at that 900 plus points up. What a rally Ryan Dietrich, Carson Group, chief market strategist is with us. Ryan, this is this is quite a day. This is quite a year. We're going to talk to Wall Street Plenty. Let's just speak to Main Street for a minute who's just confused because we get a bad inflation print, we get a good reaction from the market, we get a great job report and the market's do the opposite. Tell Main Street what to make of today. Yeah, well first off, thanks for having me on a day where things are green. Yeah. Which is something to talk about here. That's nice, nice change. But just today, we had the disappointing number, obviously markets were lower, but you look at what happened, we just corrected 50% of the overall bull market that we had off those 2020 lows, 3500. That's a normal type of retracement. We found some buyers there, wasn't shocking. The VIX, the fear gauge. It didn't surprisingly, didn't spike massively higher this morning. That would be a clue. The obvious market knew something and the rally came on. That's the biggest thing for Main Street, the people are really worried. Believe me, you're not the only ones confused. This year is very confusing for a lot of people, but think about this. In June 16th, we made those lows, 200 approximately, 200 stocks in the S&P made a new low. Just yesterday, we made new lows less than 80 stocks, made 52 week lows. What does that mean? Price is making new lows, but less stocks are. That Main Street, everyone listening, is an improvement. That's how major lows conform. There's less stocks going down, and that's a real positive sign. We're going to be speaking of that positive sign. The Dow up over 3% S&P not too far behind. Nasdaq up over 2.5%. Do you think today's gains does this rally that we're seeing have legs? Yeah, we think it does. I mean, there's lots of ways we can look at this. Right? I mean, I mentioned the VIX. You look at sentiment polls. We're near some of the most bearers we've seen, guys, since major lows, March 2009, March 2020. Expectations are so low. It's not like things are great. Believe me. We're going to see this earnings season, how corporate America is looking. Roptimistic earnings are still going to justify this economy growing. But expectations have just simply gotten so low. And let's not forget this. Believe the last 17 bear markets, six of them bottom in October. Believe me, it could be random. Maybe not. October is more of a bear market killer. The worst two starts year ever, other than this year, this is the third worst start, 74 in 2002. All right. Bottom in the first two weeks, two weeks of October. We just do it again. Believe me. Two in and watch later. We think we're optimistic that we can have another pretty good low in October. And then those regular fourth quarter strong seasonals that take place in a midterm year can take over. And we can have a pretty good size rally the rest of this year before the year is all said and done. And Ryan, how about the fact that it's a midterm election? Yeah, what are investors hoping for in this sort of environment? Yeah, great question. So let's put it this way. I think gridlock, right? You don't want too much power one way or the other. And you look at the way the election, how it might swing. You know the incumbent party that won the presidency, tends to lose some seats. But we don't think there's going to be too much power one way or the other. And that could be what matters. But for the average investor listening, just know this. We say do not invest in your politics, right? Just invest in the fundamentals. But think about this. If you looked at what the S&P did, the day of the midterm elections, go back to World War II. All right. One year later, the S&P was higher every single time, up 14.1%. So whatever happens, markets hate uncertainty. Get that election out of the way, the uncertainty out of the way. Then then markets tend to do pretty darn well. Last point on this, the second year of a new president. So this year, historically extremely weak. Believe me, this year is weaker than we expected. At the same time, this isn't abnormal to see weakness the second year of a new president. And things get a lot better that third year. And the economy can keep growing in our view. It should lead to pretty good sized gains into this year and into next year. Don't get me wrong, man. We love to see the rally. We love your positivity. You know that. But if I said dinner on the S&P being higher in one month than it is today, you'd say what? And that's an off. Where are we going for dinner is what I would say. I mean, okay. Some were expensive. Yeah, good steakhouse. No, higher.",https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6_2e_wGpQzc,75,2022-10-13 19:20:54
3267," today you'd say what and that's an off. Where are we going for dinner is what I would say. I mean, okay. Some were expensive. Yeah, good steakhouse. No, higher. I mean, believe me. So let's put it like this. October and November are the top two months in a midterm year. We talked about some of those things. I mean, I know we know inflation's high, but overall, this beach ball is really low, right? Really, really low. Once you let go and that momentum go up, we think, you know, this time next month, you can buy me a steak. I'll come to New York. Yeah, we think that S and P is going to be a decent deal higher. I'd be happy to buy you dinner, man. If I lose this bet and that is a bet, it's on tape. Is there anything that you see then that tells us inflation might be cooling? Yeah, I mean, believe me, this number is disappointing. Yesterday's number is disappointing. But yes, you know, you look at some of the individual surveys like Rents. Rents are actually down month over month last year. The government data doesn't show that because government data takes like nine months for it to get in there. Use cars and really started coming back down. The government data doesn't show that because again, they're not as real time when it comes to this. So those are some potential positive. Just look around, right? Commodity prices have come back significantly. Again, so those are some shining, I don't know, I'm worried. Some potential bright spots in a really dark sea when it comes to inflation. But at the same time, what's priced in and what's not? The market is pricing in massive inflation, massively higher rates. The Fed is not infallible. This time, 15 months ago, the Fed saw one rate hike this year. All right. I'm not calling them out. I'm just saying that's what it was. Six months from now, I doubt if the Fed's going to be nearly as hawkish as they are right now. Well, Brian, when you take a look, I guess what we're going to see play out in the markets over the next several weeks. A big, important factor here is going to be earnings. We're starting that tomorrow. We're starting a number of the bigger earnings with some of the bigger banks we heard from Pepsi earlier this week. They were actually able to weather this in certain environment, high inflation very well. What are some areas, or do you think do you spot any trends just in terms of companies that are best positioned to weather some of the downturn that we could see, even though you have a pretty optimistic outlook here. Yeah, that's a great point. So earnings coming up, right? Energy is supposed to have massive earnings growth. We know that. But the number two is industrials. Industrial is supposed to see over 20% year-over-year earnings growth. You don't usually have a recession when that happens. And you look under the service of industrials on a relative strength basis, versus yes and P500. Industrials are breaking out to like one and a half year highs on a relative strength. So to see industrials that strong under the service with small caps, with gin violated, the gin lows, with healthcare hanging in there, with regional banks actually making new highs and relative strength, things are perfect. We get it. But these are some shining lights and some positives that are under there. And industrials to me is a really good looking group that could be a big winner this earnings season. So Ryan, then, for investors watching this, wondering what to make of this period between now and November, how should they be viewing the market? Where are the opportunities? Yeah, kind of hinted at some of them. So we like value over growth still, your industrials, your energy, those materials. I mean, those are some groups that still look pretty good to us. We haven't liked big cap tech for a while, more neutral at best. I just look at this multi-year running growth, right? And technology, some of these names still look kind of top heavy, honestly. So we like kind of small caps look pretty good in value. Those are some areas we still like. We're just big picture, this big bear market that we've had. We think this time six to 12 months or now, I know it's cliche to say, but there are some really good opportunities. Absolutely. That's small caps. Small caps are historically cheap, relative to large caps. That's another positive we think there. All right. Lots of great stuff. A big thank you, Ryan Dietrich, for joining us this afternoon. Have a good one. All right. Coming up, Netflix reveals what's included in its new basic with ads plan. We'll tell you if it stacks up against its rivals. And also be sure to tune in to Yahoo Finance's All Market Summit Monday, starting at 9 a.m. Eastern time, GM CEO Mary Varra, Microsoft CTO, our CEO Satya Nadella are just two of the big industry leaders that will be joining the program.

3268," Picture Let's go. Netflix finally revealing the price of its ad supported tier Yahoo finances. Alexander Canal here with the details. Ali, what can you tell us a lot of the focus here on the price? A lot of focus on the pricing. Six dollars and 99 cents in the US. That's pricing is going to change depending on the country. Roll out in 12 different countries. The bulk of them will be rolling out on November 3rd except Canada, Mexico, November 1st. Users can sign up for this and in Spain, November 10th concludes that roll out. Now in terms of that $6.99 price tag in the US, Netflix told me on an earnings call, but a call prior to the announcement that they are not heavily anchoring the pricing based on competition, especially considering that Netflix Disney with ads cost $7.99. So perhaps a little bit more strategy there, but rather they said they want to provide that entertainment value. The company also shrugged off concerns when it comes to users. Potentially trading down to the ad supported tier, they estimated that total revenue will be neutral to positive with the comparable plan. And then in terms of these ads, how they're going to impact the user experience, four to five minutes of ads per hour with tight frequency caps. So basically they don't want users to see the same ads over and over again. Each ad will be 15 seconds or 30 seconds in length. It'll either be pre-roll or it will air in the middle of programming, which I probably am not going to be do keen about it by a user of this ad tier. But I did get a chance to preview some of these and it looks like the ones that are mid-roll are those on the shorter side about 15 seconds. Should be interesting to see the ad market when this rolls out. They also say Neil Sendata will be part of the next wave. Help or hurt the overall picture for Netflix. I think it definitely helps. Historically, Netflix has been a little bit coy when it comes to viewership that started to change once they began releasing their weekly top 10 list. So this is going to help advertisers really get a sense of the scale for some of these shows and how they can best program their ads within it. We saw Amazon recently partner when Neil Send for more clarity on Thursday night football. So this is something I think is going to be a net positive for Netflix. And I'm sure as soon as this rolls out investors, analysts alike, they're going to be closely watching this one, especially considering Neil Send is the main ratings tracker for a lot of those big cable.",https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6_2e_wGpQzc,77,2022-10-13 19:29:33
3269," Sure, as soon as this rolls out investors, analysts alike, they're going to be closely watching this one, especially considering Nielsen is the main ratings tracker for a lot of those big cable and broadcast television networks. So we're sort of entering this era where broadcasts and streaming are starting to converge. Yeah, and now, I mean, it's no surprise we know that Wall Street, I guess more broadly speaking, has been very bullish on the ad support to tear potentially what that could do in terms of subscriber growth going forward. But Rochelle was interesting that $6.99 price tag was a little surprising. I was expecting it to be a little bit cheaper given the fact that their base plan is at $9.99. I mean, I agree. I think they maybe didn't want to put people off too much. They didn't want there to be such such a big price difference. I actually thought it was a pretty good price myself. I'm still not willing to downgrade because I don't, I just don't like my things being interrupted. My time is precious. I think it was interesting that on the advertiser side though, they sold it on a fixed price basis first and they said that they nearly sold out all their inventory at launch. So at a time when we're seeing a lot of advertisers and marketers pulling back, this they seem to be all in on. Obviously you have a big target right there. I thought that was interesting. And Dave, what do you think? Are you willing to perhaps downgrade? Would you pay a little bit less to get the interruptions? Right, and that's really the big question. How does it change consumer behavior? And so we had a poll about what people would do with this $7 a month for the ad tier. How would it change your Netflix subscription? There's good news and there's bad news in here. The majority of you said you will not change. So that's the good news. I think the bad news is that only encourages 9% of you to join Netflix if you're not already. That is probably not the number that they are hoping for. Now this is a small sample size. For me, I'm in that majority. Yeah, I won't make any change based on a $7 per month price tag. My question is if this doesn't work, what's next? What's the okay then? Because they're not in sports. They're not in news. They said they're not going near it. They're not in merch. They don't have park. They don't have what Amazon or Disney or any of their competitors have. What next? Yeah, and I think that's a really big question that a lot of people are asking themselves. I think right now in terms of content, they should be focusing on buildable, franchise content. They spend a lot of money on these one-off movies that people could just watch and then give up. But what about the multi-series? What about, you know, if you look at something like a Game of Thrones and now they have the prequel House of the Dragon, they're starting to dabble in that a little bit, but I think they need more of that on the content side. And another thing I want to note just on the ad tier, another negative is that there's going to be a limited number of movies and TV shows that will not be available on the ad supported due to licensing agreements. They said it's a very small number. We don't know what. We don't know what. They said between 5 to 10% of overall programming, depending on the country, but that is a lot. And also, you can't download these shows on the ad tier because of technical complex. That is no small number. And if you want to play in, like, the amount of Netflix that I download. That may be the sole reason we have it. That is no small number. You know what? I was all in for downgrading for the ad supported tier. I know. I don't use it that often, but when you go to use it and not being able to have that, that is not a fine print. That is not fine print. That is not fine print. Yeah, that is not fine print. But it isn't going to be interesting to see, I guess, how many new subscribers they are able to get on board here. What you said just in terms of the amount of time for the ads, it was only a 30 second or 15 second mid-of-the-roll. Four to five minutes in an hour. I don't know. 15, 30 seconds. Yeah. It's not that bad, though. It's not terrible, but yeah, I am curious how many people will sign up. Well, we will see soon enough right, Alicanael. Thanks so much. Well, come here up next, Kroger, reportedly going shopping for a merger. We'll tell you who it might be. forbidden店.",https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6_2e_wGpQzc,78,2022-10-13 19:34:07
3270," good It's time for Triple Play, the three stocks that we're watching in the final 30 minutes of trading. We've got Proger, Delta Airlines and Digital World Acquisition Core. So my pick, a US grocery giant in the making with my pick, Proger, Ticket-KR, in talks to my rival Albertsons in an all cash deal according to Bloomberg. Proger shares, as you can see, that up about 1%, but look at Albertsons up more than 11%. Now that announcement is actually possible this week. Proger is the number two grocery seller with a 9.9 market share. You have Albertsons in fourth place with 5.7%, still a long way off to not warm up off the tops while they have more than 20% of market share, according to numerator. Now, if this deal goes through, it would be the largest US retail transaction in years, but it's a big if, though, as regulatory pushback is likely, according to Oppenheimer, due to some of these overlaps in West Coast states, including California and Washington, and also in big metro areas, including Vegas, Phoenix and Chicago, according to Churchill Capital and let's Nick Papas. He also has some rural areas where there aren't that many grocery stores, and they would be the dominant player there. Now, when you have high inflation, we were talking about food prices being up 11%, these sorts of merges have already drawn scrutiny from the Biden administration, so sure we'll have to be keeping a night on this one to see if it goes through. Yeah, I think the regulatory question is here, is really center here, whether or not is going to get approval. If, in fact, we do see this deal happen, it is expected to happen before the end of the week, just leaving tomorrow for it to be announced. I think operationally, the feedback, at least from the street, right away, has been that that would make sense, but of course, the approval process, that is really what is hanging in the balance right now. In terms of how big they are, Proger is already the largest supermarket operator ahead of this potential deal. It has a $32 billion market cap, Albert sends 15 billion, so we do see that combination certainly could potentially change the grocery landscape across the country. All right, my pick today is Delta, the stock jumping after reporting a profit, $695 million for the third quarter, higher fairs helping offset those rising jet fuel prices. Now the carrier also offered upbeat fourth quarter guidance, noting a resurgence in corporate travel and signs of a big holiday rush as two of those driving factors. Now CEO Ed Bashin telling Yahoo Finance earlier that he doesn't see consumers pulling back on spending.",https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6_2e_wGpQzc,79,2022-10-13 19:38:49
3271," in corporate travel and signs of a big holiday rush as two of those driving factors. Now CEO Ed Bashin telling Yahoo Finance earlier that he doesn't see consumers pulling back on spending in terms of travel because of inflation. Rather, he says that they are quote, prioritizing investing in themselves, experiences and services rather than buying things. Despite the near-term positive momentum, though, Raymond James did caution that the lack of detail 2023 guidance is quote, unlikely to switch any investor cost concerns amid labor, fuel and broader macro concerns. Dave, when you take a look at the numbers, initially looking very positive here for Delta, I thought that that point from Raymond James was pretty important here as we go into this uncertain time of potential pullback here in 2023, too much uncertainty to give that detailed guidance. It does make you. I guess wonder how bad. It's just no pullback insight. We also saw on the inflation print today up 8% airfare is month to month and up 43% year over year when you combine the inflation report with the Delta earnings and they're showing no demand destruction. I don't know, man, this is a lot like Pepsi. We just don't see people stopping, traveling, stopping buying some of these consumer staples. The airfare's united was up on this. JetBlue was up on this. American was up on this. All 3 plus percent on the day. So good news for the entire sector. My play is digital world acquisition. Corp shares of the blank check company jumping big time today on news. Former president Donald Trump's truth social media platform will be allowed on the Google Play Store. That covers 44% of all smartphone users who of course have Android devices. It had been banned prior. According to Google, though, truth social agreed to enforce content moderation and to remove and block users who publish posts that insight. Violence, DWAC is currently pushing to extend the deadline for the merger with Trump media currently set for December 8 without the extension or the completion of the merger. They will be forced to liquidate shares are down 94% in the last 12 months, but they are up today. We mentioned the balance 14 plus percent. This on the very day that the House had another public hearing on the January 6th insurrection. They're voting this afternoon to see if they'll deal subpoena Donald Trump. Of course, we'll never see him at these hearings. It'll kick way till after midterm until delay this forever. I'm stunned at this increase, though, Michelle. I give this deal a true social no chance. My perception is deals never changed. I just cannot see a path to success. Not sure about you. Now, I mean, and when they talk about the extensions, we heard from DWAC CEO Patrick Orlando. Basically, he's already said, if they don't get more of these extensions, the deal is going to fall apart. A lot of people were wondering now that this Twitter deal with musk is supposed to go through. Do you still need DWAC? Will you already have a platform? For some of these ones that perhaps sprung up because of the limitations of Twitter, even though there is some hope, obviously, with it being in the Google Play Store, if there's no deal, it doesn't really matter if the app makes it to the Play Store. I think the performance has just been so rough here going back year today with the stock off 64% of these investors are just looking for any sort of good news, which is why we're seeing the pop today. But I'm with you. I really don't think that this excitement in this is going to last. All right, coming up next, the price of grocery rising once again in September. We'll tell you just how much prices are jumping next.",https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6_2e_wGpQzc,80,2022-10-13 19:42:18
3272," Music We're keeping an eye on the oil and energy markets, especially after that hot CPI report showed that the energy prices were up nearly 20% in September compared to a year ago. A very own inesphere is hit with a closer look. And that's what are you seeing? Well we're starting watching oil prices today. We did see a bump in those. You're looking at WTI that's up more than 2% settling at $89.11 per barrel. Meanwhile, Brent Crude settled at $94.50 a per barrel up 2%. Earlier this week, oil prices had been lower over concerns of further rate hikes. So energy prices increased 19.8% in September of that CPI print that you just talked about. That's compared to a year ago, month over month, energy prices declined by 2.1%. And just looking at those components, you had the gasoline index which fell with the natural gas and electricity indices those rows. Shell. I'll find a says inesphere. Thank you for that update. Shona. Well speaking of higher prices, your grocery bill just keeps going up inflation data out today showing September at home food prices up another 7% of a percent on a monthly basis, bringing that year over year surge to just around 13%. And taking a look at some of these costs here, the price of bread jumping 14.7% from a year ago, eggs up more than 30% coffee up nearly 16%. Butter, a pastagorean 26%. Let's bring in Bill Baruch, Blue Line futures, President Bill, when you're looking at prices like that, you have to think it can't keep going up, but it seems to just continue to trend to the upside. Is it going to get even more expensive from here? Well, the sad news is, food prices in the grocery store tend to be some of the most sticky. And once they move those prices up, they may not come back down. But it's going to be a tough one here. And really, it's matters to what the crop looks like. And we're in harvest right now in the U.S., soybeans and corn. But we looked out the South America. They've had a tough planting season with very dry weather. And then, obviously, orange juice. Everybody loves their orange juice. And it could be the worst crop in 80 years. So there's a lot of questions behind that. And that's something that we have Blue Line. We put a lot of agriculture research out daily. And that's something we were poking to back when the Russian invasion of Ukraine started was that these prices had moved up. But once they came off, it was a matter of, you know, what is the U.S. crop look like? There are other factors in the world that are going to impact these prices rather than just the war in Ukraine, which is the bread basket of the global economy.",https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6_2e_wGpQzc,81,2022-10-13 19:47:07
3273," world that are going to impact these prices rather than just the the the war in Ukraine, which is the bread basket of the global economy. Yeah, you know, and we've seen some dent in demand with House and we've seen some dent in demand with used cars, but food is unlike all these things. Of course, fruits and vegetables surged 1.6% for the month. What will bring these prices down if you're the Fed? You know, I think if you're looking at it from the Fed's standpoint, I mean, they they are concerned with the food prices. They are concerned with this stickiness here, but the real question when we're looking at Fed policy and where it's going, the direction it's going, it's it's going to be really rely on OER. The owner's a little bit rent and that's the one third of CPI. It's been extremely sticky. Does it roll over at some point in quarter one? And that could really be the sign that inflation has top. That's that's going to be the question and that's going to allow the Fed to to live their foot off the gas. I mean, you could also you got an interesting move here in the market where where you have the equities and then really commodities have begun to follow and really all sets started with the US dollar. The US dollar spiked on on the hot CPI number, but once the US dollar came off, it's allowed for a relief of downward pressures and stocks in commodities. And so once you get this move back up, you're actually you're reflating these assets. Now, not at this level, but does the move continue and that's something we've been noting at the like futures too is the potential blowoff top in the US dollar really began about two weeks ago at the end of September with with the UK move and how the cable had fallen out of bad and you know the end of the euro were already pretty weak, but when you get sharp reversals like that in the US dollar that began in potentially a lower high right now, we could be at the start of a top in the dollar which will stoke prices and your grocery bill make it to be higher, just simply because of commodities being priced and dollars will rise. Bill, when we're trying to figure out I guess how much higher just in terms of percentage, are we talking a couple of percent? Are we talking a huge jump that we could potentially see? What do you think? Huge jump in the average food prices at the grocery bill. Well, you know, if you look at things, I saw an anecdote of a I saw on Twitter somewhere and I wish I could credit the person that tweeted it or retweeted it, but it was a picture of a bakery and a picture out of bakery and the baker had put a list of every ingredient and the cost. And everything across the board from granulated sugar to flour to powdered sugar to eggs, everything was doubled to maybe even almost triple the price. So you're seeing things, those prices that he's stating, I'm sure he's buying it as some sort of wholesale or, but you're looking at prices that have increased dramatically much more than what you may see in these CPI numbers. So the real hard cost that's hitting home is much more and that's the problem. And even different distortions that have taken place throughout the year, I mean, there's been different sort of different fires at different, different meat processing plants, outages at meat processing plants, chicken farms, things like that have also had an impact. And it's really odd to see that such a wide number of those taking place, but there's been, you know, these sorts of distortions that are taking place in this post-pandemic world that have also stoke prices higher. Want to quickly pivot to energy? We saw some relief there in the inflation print, but of course, that number's lagging and gas prices now up to 391 from 370 a month ago, where they headed. Well, you know, we've been extremely bullish energy for a, for really since June, June of 2020. And it's something that we put out research every single day at Blue Line Futures. And I personally write about the S&P, the NASDAQ, crude oil, and silver and gold. And specifically for crude oil, we've always had a bullish tone. We actually went neutral when crude oil did break below $93 back in August. I think it was August, you know, early September. And at that point, we said, you know, look for $75. $75 could be the floor. We traded down to 76 to crude. And we've responded off this massive level of support that really a cleansing, if you will, of prices. I mean, a lot of people from a trading perspective.",https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6_2e_wGpQzc,82,2022-10-13 19:51:03
3274," and we've responded off this massive level of support that really a cleansing, if you will, of prices. I mean, a lot of people from a trading perspective got, you know, sort of ingrained that crude oil by the dip, by the dip, and you're going to get paid, continue to buy the dip, and we needed a little bit of a cleansing. It really wasn't that much of a cleansing, but it allowed some relief and for the price of crude oil to go higher. Now we're back, you know, in roughly $90, let's call it, although we're a bit below here today. It really matters, you know, with OPEC taking production offline. I don't think that, you know, the headline drop of two million barrels per day in their production was, is the actual impact. It's more like 900,000 barrels per day, but it's definitely created some geopolitical tensions, which I think could stoke the price of oil higher. However, I'm not extremely bullish right now. And I've actually put a neutral tone in our research because they do think with the White House right now they're throwing the kitchen sink to try and keep prices suppressed. I don't think this is a good thing. And I think it's going to hurt in the end. But in the near term, over say the next month, you have this expiration of the November futures contract coming up next week, and then you get to the end of the month and then in midterm elections. I think that the White House will continue to release SPR and sort of go face to face here with Saudi Arabia. That could keep prices suppressed in the near term. And I think that would just be a tremendous buying opportunity back on your 80 bucks if we get it. Yeah, prices above four bucks by the midterms, bad news for the Biden administration. All right, Bill Baruch, Blue Line futures. Good to see you, Matt. Thank you. Coming up, Apple and Goldman Sachs are teaming up again. Stay tuned to hear what they're offering you. Next. Next. Next. Apple and Goldman Sachs teaming up again. This time on high yield savings accounts for Apple Card users. You'll be able to take rewards from your Apple Card and additional funds from other bank accounts into the Goldman account. Apple Card users can generate interest on their cash back which come in one to three percent increments, depending on whether the purchases were made by Apple Pay on Apple products or with select merchants. An annual interest rate wasn't included in today's announcement. Now, Sean, I know that you use Apple Pay and we're seeing obviously Apple going even further with this ecosystem. We're really trying to make sure they're tapping to every part of your life. What do you think about this move? No, I love me with the map.",https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6_2e_wGpQzc,83,2022-10-13 19:55:13
3275," We're seeing obviously Apple going even further with this ecosystem. We're really trying to make sure they're tapping to every part of your life. What do you think about this move? No, I love me some Apple pay. I do. I'm addicted. I use it every day for multiple times a day. I do think it is smart. We know that Apple has been focused on their services segment. This obviously would be a next. I guess pushed us into the whole payment space. There are rumors also that it's coming out with an affirm competitor in terms of buy now, pay later that they'll reportedly be pushed to next year. I think the interest though that's going to be offered is going to be key to this. Like Rochelle just said Dave, we don't have any details just in terms of what exactly that's going to be. Bangra did take a look at some of the competitor offerings out there saying that they're in the 2.2 percent to 3.05 percent range. It makes sense. I don't know how widely used it's going to be, but I think it's a natural step here for Apple. Initially, maybe not, but long term, I think this is huge upside for Apple and frankly, no downside for you, the consumer. I mean, there's no annual fee. There's no minimum deposit. There's no balance requirement. So what is the downside? You're going to have this dashboard on your phone that shows you the cash back. You're getting into your account. So it's kind of an immediate gratification thing. And to your point, services is where it's all about. We talk a lot about iPhone sales, but services, music, Apple TV, cloud, news plus. Fitness plus and now banking and the other side of this we haven't talked about is the Goldman Sach side of this, which is interesting. They become more like a conventional bank in this aspect and have access now to consumer deposits, which changes the whole picture for Goldman Sachs and all upside in that regard too. So hard to think of a downside other than more information that we're giving to Apple, but at this point, we're throwing in that. Yeah. And you're right to point out it is a huge win for Goldman too. They have clearly been working on growing their markets business. It hasn't grown on, I don't think as maybe as quickly as some had initially anticipated that it would be now that this gives them more exposure, exposure here to consumer deposits, which is a huge win for Goldman in that consumer push for show. I mean, as you bring up markets there, when you think of how many iPhones and people's pockets, the sort of collaboration here, I mean, this is a huge win, I think for both sides. So one will definitely be keeping an eye on. Alright, coming up, we're counting down to the closing bell on Wall Street. So stick with us here on Yacht & Finance line.",https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6_2e_wGpQzc,84,2022-10-13 19:59:46
3276," 🎵 sirupare奖 All right, we're just a couple of minutes from the closing bell. Let's bring in Jared Blyckery to break down the glowing market action because of course we rally on bad inflation prints. That's what we do, man. That is correct. But I'll tell you what, this is actually good news. Actually bad news is good news. We're going to figure that out. All right, I want to show you the NASDAQ here. That is up over 2 and 1 third percent. But you really get a feel for what happened today if you look at the futures. This is the S&P 500. Just want to show you that. Was that dip on CPI? And this is what a recovering rally looks like. Now, if you take a year-to-date look on the candlesticks, I just want to show you this huge green candle down here. You can see it even better on this three-month chart. Wow, that is a reversal. I went back in history. The last time we got a new 52-week low and a big upside reversal closing up, 2 percent and more. Bunch of these caught the bottom in a bunch of bear market. So I'm going to be writing this up for tomorrow. You guys watch out for it. In the meantime, I want to leave you with a few heat maps here. Here's a sector action for today. Those value stacks up more than 4 percent energy and financials. Tech also up more than 3 percent and materials right there with them. Those are all the outperformers. I'm just going to show you what the NASDAQ 100 looks like on a good update. There you go. Apple up 3 percent. So is Microsoft Tesla up 2 percent, guys. And here's the closing bell on Wall Street on this Thursday. Right before my birthday. We hope Jared's birthday does help the good news here. Continue with the rally on Wall Street. Now of 825 points, this would be up 2.6 percent NASDAQ up just over 2 percent today, a huge reversal from what we saw shortly after the opening year. You look at some of the sector action that we're seeing today. All 11 of the S&P sectors moving to the upside, some of the largest gains coming from energy, financials and technology. So you're going to take a closer look at the action that we saw today. Let's bring in Ross Bayfield, Baird Investment Strategy, analyst. We also have Joanne Fini, advisors, capital management partner and portfolio manager. Great to see both of you. Ross, let me start with you just in terms of the reversal that we saw today. The bad news is good news here for the market. What do you make of it? Well, look, I'm a long-term bull. I'm an optimist, but reading that CPI report, I found it difficult to find any good news. Core CPI accelerating, broadening out. Presents a real problem for the Federal Reserve. So to me, maybe this was a sell the news type of event or just a sentiment positioning reversal, but it doesn't change the path of the Fed. It doesn't change what they have to do over the coming months. So maybe a lot of it was priced in getting near those 2022 lows. However, it's hard to find a lot of good news out of the CPI report this morning. I'll take the good day when we can get it, but maybe if there's good news, you can tell where it was. So, Joanna, hopefully you can help us figure this out, given how much stickiness we saw in this CPI report. Well, you know what? When I was a kid, he played Twister, and you have to be pretty skilled at Twister to figure this one out, I think. But bending over backwards a little bit, one can imagine that this print showing how resilient and broad inflation is and the challenges of the labor shortage and wage pressures does make it very clear that the Fed has to be adamant about solving this problem. It gives the Fed no wiggle room, which means that the Fed is going to raise rates and continue to raise rates until it solves the problem. Now, for the long term economic health of the United States, that's a good thing, because it really means that we're going to get this inflation problem under control. The Fed's not going to have an opportunity to pull.",https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6_2e_wGpQzc,85,2022-10-13 20:04:02
3277," long-term economic health of the United States, that's a good thing because it really means that we're going to get this inflation problem under control. The Fed's not going to have an opportunity to pause or to go light. So that might be something that's convincing investors that, okay, the Fed has no choice. They're going to have to solve this problem. Not going to be any wiggle room. There's no chance they're going to pause and make a mistake. You know, so a longer term, it could be that investors are saying, okay, the bad news is all in at this point. There's no room to maneuver around this. Fed's going to have to go raise rates. They're going to solve this problem. Longer term, we're going to have inflation come back towards that 2% target, and that's going to be good for the ultimate economic growth of the United States economy, which means maybe it's time to get into these companies that ultimately are going to do well in a healthy economy. We know there's a lot of cash sitting on the sidelines, and we've seen it before over the summer with these little tentative dips and rallies. It's a time to get back ending to own these stocks because a lot of them have gotten cheap. So I think it's partly all the cash that was sitting on the sidelines. And now I think it's conviction that the Fed will have no choice but to be adamant and determined about solving the inflation problem. And ultimately, that's good for the long run health of the U.S. economy. Dre, I'm outstanding at Twister. Far be it for me to solve this riddle, though. I can not even begin to explain that rally, but there is some optimism in your voice. Ross, do you see any opportunity? Yeah, absolutely. We'll look with sentiment as negative as it's gotten. Positioning as negative as it's gotten. Valuation, both in fixed income and in stocks, approaching something like we haven't seen in quite some time. I think there's some real opportunity if you're a long-term investor to start lagging in to, if you want to average in during this volatile time. So yeah, there are sectors we like, sectors that we think have tougher roads ahead, but overall, if you're a long-term investor, we haven't seen a starting point like this in quite some time. Now, it might be a rocky road in the near term, but we're long-term optimists. So if you want to look at sectors, energy leading to that, I think is a really good example of a sector that's been leadership that has a really good trend is going to have some really good earnings quarters over the next few quarters. On the flip side, the fact that the Nasdaq trail today, I think is emblematic that some of those big tech names are still a lot to work through before they become kind of the tech names that were used to over the last decade again. Joanne, you teased some of your picks too. Give us it inside scoop. What do you like in this market? Yeah, so when you're potentially heading into a recession, even if it's not so severe, something we've seen in the past, right? One way to help your portfolio during a time when some stocks are going to be weaker, they're going to be more aligned on consumer spending in the short term, is to move towards stocks that have the growth opportunity that's really structural. We still need more data centers. We still need more internet capacity. There's a lot more use of the internet from not just consumers, but firms, IOT devices, whether that's cars or factory equipment. So that's something that still needs lots of investment. And so the company's that enable that, whether it's parts or chips or software, cybersecurity is another area, which is going to be under continued pressure. Palo Alto is one of our favorites in that cloud data center space, whether it's a Broadcom or an Amazon. I know it wasn't one of the ones that rallied today, but they're a critical provider and it's mostly traded down on the retail side. And then you can go to a real contrary and play and look at home builders. Because the fact of the matter is with rental costs so high as we saw in the CPI print, people have to live somewhere and this millennial generation needs housing. And as rents get more expensive, that makes housing even with high mortgage rates, you know, something that becomes more palatable. What we're seeing is them trade down, getting rid of some of the extras on those new homes and buying something cheaper to help offset the high mortgage rates. So we really like Lunar. It's trading at 5.8 times. And we think that, you know, you'll be real happy with that kind of purchase over the next three, you know, three plus years and potentially even sooner. And Ross, I know you said you take the longer the, but for some people who perhaps have a short a time horizon, where do you see opportunities? I mean, near term, I think the volatility is likely to continue and we are headed towards some sort of economic slowdown. I mean, that is the intention of the Fed, whether it's a soft landing or a hard landing, you know, there is a slowdown coming.",https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6_2e_wGpQzc,86,2022-10-13 20:08:29
3278," are headed towards some sort of economic slowdown. I mean, that is the intention of the Fed, whether it's a soft landing or a hard landing, there is a slowdown coming. And so you want to position defensively and you want to position with leadership. Now, it's kind of a more near-term tactical view of it. Again, I actually think at these rates, at these yields, treasuries, some investment grade debt, starts to look really attractive. But on the equity side, like I said, I think energy is leadership. I think being a little bit more defensive in the near-term probably makes some sense because the Fed will continue to raise rates at least into the first quarter of next year. Inflation, as it proved today, is broad, is still a problem. And so we're headed towards a slowdown, even if milder by historical standards. And we think that's the case, given where the labor market is and given the consumer position. It's still a slowdown. There still will be some contraction of earnings. And so you want to position for that in those kinds of sectors. And certainly the Fed, not going off course, especially with this latest CPI data. A big thank you to our market panel, Ross Mayfield and Joe Anfini. Thank you so much. All right, well, the January 6th committee has voted to subpoena form of President Donald Trump for both testimony and documents. It's his, in his final hearing before the midterm elections, the committee played dramatic, never-before-seen video of what was happening as members of Congress sought safety. Take a listen. There has to be some way we can maintain the sense that people have that there's some security or some confidence that government can function and that we can elect the president of the United States. Do we go back into session? We think go back into session, but now apparently everybody on the floor is putting on a three-guest mask to prepare for a breach. We're trying to get more information, putting on their tear gas masks. We also learn this afternoon, the Supreme Court rejected Trump's request to intervene in the fight over the classified documents seized from his Mar-a-Lago property. Now, there were no dissents. All right, coming up, mortgage rates hit a 20-year high but didn't even more pressure on home buyers. That's it.",https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6_2e_wGpQzc,87,2022-10-13 20:12:37

3280," that the supply picture will improve with builders earlier this year in the first six months, really ramping up construction of single-family homes. But they have gotten obviously a naturally spooked by the developments in the market, the pullback on the buyer side. So they are cutting back on single-family. They are actually continuing with the multi-family side. But for home sellers, the interesting picture is after roughly two months May and June where we saw new listings on realtor.com pick up. We've actually seen them retreat. It seems that for a lot of homeowners, they are worried that they have missed the peak of the market and many of them are holding back. And I'll add there is a seasonality component, right? We are past the peak market activity. Summergenesis, most volume and naturally fall in winter. We see a slight fallback from that. But by and large, I think for a lot of sellers, the real concern right now is if they are looking for a trade-up home, they're paying higher price plus a lot higher mortgage rates. So that might end up locking in effectively a lot of potential sellers over the next few months. Is the Fed going to break something in the housing sector, George? Well, the Fed is already, and we heard Jerome Powell already say that its intent is to significantly cool housing, right? He used the words housing correction is needed because the over competitive pace we signed 2020-2021 have put a lot of people on the sidelines. So I think as far as the Fed is concerned, the correction we're seeing in housing in terms of demand pulling back, medium prices are already coming down from their summer peaks. These are in a sense, is the very prescription the Fed is trying to apply to housing and bike extrapolation, the economy. I think for a lot of market watchers, the question is, has the Fed done enough, at least based on CPI not yet? And so, you know, the Fed do too much, right? Can we have too much of an over correction? And I think the jury is still out on both accounts. So the Adelec had balanced the Fed trying to make their due a graduate from Realtor.com. Thank you so much for joining us this afternoon. All right, well, Social Security's cost of living adjustment for 2023 will increase 8.7 percent as the largest gains since 1981. Now, who finances Kerry Hanon joins us with the details, Kerry, what do we need to know? Well, I'm telling you, this is a big bump up. It's really going to allow Social Security recipients to tread water a bit better, right? I mean, we've seen this big bump up and inflation this year. This will make a big difference in their checks starting in January. Again, this will be, you know, for the average check, maybe $140 in each monthly check will be a bump up for an average one. And so it's really important to focus on this as something that a lot of people think of retirees living on a fixed income. Well, guess what? Social Security is not fixed. It is adjusted for inflation. So even though it's a little backwards looking, moving forward into 2023, we'll be seeing some breathing room. Let's say they're going to get some breathing room. And Michelle, you partner this with the Medicare, the dip in the premiums for the Plan B premiums coming up in 2023. And that's a nice little boost for retirees looking at what has been a tough year this year in pain for groceries and rent and gasoline and all those other things. So this is welcome news. And Carrie, speaking of high inflation, I bonds, I want to bring this up because of rates on I bonds, even though they have been very strong here, they're expected to drop. What can you tell us about that? Yeah, yeah, good one. Because they are tied to this whole issue that the equation gets out now. We're not going to know officially until November 1st, because they get adjusted twice a year, May 1st, November 1st. This what the analysts I talked to today said, now right now through the end of October, these I bonds are paying 9.62 percent. But what we're looking at moving forward for that November 1 number based on the CPI numbers, which goes into that equation, is around 6.4 percent. Could be 6.5. But what happens is, and the Treasury is suggesting, if you go to Treasury direct right now, they're saying try to get that, you know, lock in by the 28th of October so that you have your bond in hand by the 31st. But here's the good news. You'll get paid for the first",https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6_2e_wGpQzc,89,2022-10-13 20:21:27
3281," you know, lock in by the 28th of October so that you have your bond in hand by the 31st. But here's the good news. You'll get paid for the first six months that you hold that bond, that old rate, that 9.62 percent. And then after that, the next six months, say it is the 6.4 that we're looking at, you get the combination of the two, which I'm telling you, it's pretty attractive. It could be like, say, 8 percent for the year. So this is something, as I often say, this is a not a sexy investment, but it is a safe investment. Certainly an investment that has really gained popularity here over the last several months. I'm sure we will continue to talk about it. Carrie Henning, thanks so much for joining. Well, coming up, Amazon's slew of smart devices aim to make your home life easier, but they also collect a lot of your data. Stay tuned to hear just how much next. Amazon's second prime day event of the year or prime early access sale as retail giant is calling it has concluded and the numbers are in. Now, according to market research site numerator, the two day sales all nearly 45,000 prime orders from almost 19,000 households. Now, the average spend on those orders was around 100 bucks with most households placing just one order over those 48 hours. This site also broke down purchases by category with household essentials being the most popular, comprising 29 percent of purchases and health and beauty and apparel and shoes that coming in second and third respectively. About 29 percent of shoppers say that they use the sale to buy holiday gifts with Amazon gift cards being the most popular item.

3282," While you might soon be able to be unboxing some of these new shiny Amazon devices, the online retail giant slew of smart home devices are collecting a treasure trove of data from its millions of customers. So what does Amazon know about you and what's it doing with that information? What you're joining us now to discuss this is Washington Post Technology Colomest, Jeff Fowler. Go to have you on the show. Obviously, even when we were looking at the data, 12% of the purchases made there for Amazon Prime on these smart devices, I got a ring, I've got an echo. What does, what information did these devices collect for Amazon? Well, are you ready to get a little creeped out because I spent the last couple of weeks just trying to tally it all up. You know, I'm a tech columnist and I have many of these products in my own home where I've used them over the years. So I just tried to add it all up and I made a little list to share with you just to the top level here is Amazon. If you get their dream home, if you buy all their gadgets, they'll gather data about you when you're talking, when you're sleeping, when you walk by them, when you show your face, when you cough, when you snore, when you come home or leave home, when you turn on the lights, when you turn up the heat, when you play a music, when you watch TV, I mean, I could keep going and going and going with this list. The point is, you know, Amazon has pushed much further than any other big tech company, not only to make devices for this smart home, but also to make sure that they're collecting data out of them that they can use for their own purposes. I have to point out, Jeff Bezos happens to own the Washington Post. So it's listening to you right now, maybe the bosses. After knowing all this, do you still have an Amazon smart device plugged in in your home and what was the most concerning form of data that it is recording? Yeah. So I think the one that is the most popular in America is the Echo speaker. It's in fact one of the best selling speakers of all time. I do have something in my house. I'm a little bit unusual because I'm the tech guy for the Washington Post. So my job is to have all the things. So I also have the Apple one and I have the Google one. In terms of what is the most disturbing kind of information, for me, it's the stuff where Amazon just doesn't even give you a choice for them to collect all this data and to keep it, for example, their ring, doorbells and security cameras. They used to tell people that, oh, you're totally in control of what happens with that data. But we've now learned that there are about a dozen cases so far this year where Amazon has just handed over that footage to police without the permission of their owners. So I think stuff like that is really the areas where people Americans are going to get kind of upset here. So Jeff, two things, is there something that people can opt out of or if they're not comfortable with that? And also, from what I understand, Amazon doesn't sell the data. So then what are they actually doing with it? Yeah, so two really good points. This is sort of what Amazon always likes to say. It's actually lines that they borrowed from Facebook before, right? Facebook also doesn't sell our data. Yet they seem to have done plenty of use for it. And they, you know, Facebook also offers you lots of little opt out buttons. The truth is the default matter and the defaults for many of Amazon services just collect a lot more data. They just know that you're not going to bother to go in and change the setting that tells them not to keep recordings of stuff that goes on in your house, for example. So yes, you can do it. And in fact, we made a guide at the Washington Post as our privacy research guide, or we'll like walk you through a bunch of the settings you can adjust for Amazon to get them to collect less data. But you know, most people really just aren't going to take the time. And that's kind of the problem. And now they've got this $140 halo rise, which tracks your breathing during your sleep. God knows what else to what end? What do you think Amazon is trying to accomplish here? You know, Amazon is, it understands that data is power. You know, it's the oil of our economy. And with all of this data about our lives, they can do a lot of stuff. Many of their more recent acquisitions, in fact, have involved, and products have involved their bodies, right? They're trying to buy one medical, they bought a pill pack, the pharmacy company, products like the halo, and they also have the halo tracker or gather data about their body. One of their visions is to become kind of the AI doctor.",https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6_2e_wGpQzc,91,2022-10-13 20:30:07
3283," products like the Halo, I mean also the Halo tracker are gathered data about their body. One of their visions is to become kind of the AI doctor and to be able to do that, to be able to provide useful information to people, they just need to know a lot about our bodies. So we are giving it to them. In some cases, we're paying them to let them gather data about us, but they can then analyze and try to use and sell back to us later. It makes me feel even worse. We've talked about Echo and Ring, but even things like smart blinds. For people who are sort of ring comparisons with things like SkyNet and wondering where does this go from here? When it is, where does it is, in terms of AI and robotics, you've got your room being now nosy as it's vacuuming your house. How should consumers take this? What should they take away from this report? Yeah, I think a couple of things. First of all, everybody's going to have to make their own decisions about what they're comfortable with a company knowing about them, and also what they're comfortable with one of the largest corporations in human history knowing about them. Amazon should get some pressure back from us for those of us who think that it's collecting too much and storing too much, and they should be hearing this. So I hope they're listening to our conversation here today, because I think a lot of their customers feel this way. The other thing is, they don't have to design their products this way. We're often kind of given false choices as tech consumers that, you know, well, you know, either they're going to take all our data or we won't get to live in the future. And it's just not true. They don't have to design their products. And in fact, some of their competitors have not, if you look at the way that Apple, for example, handles a lot of smart-hung devices and data, they work very hard to make sure that they're not storing it, that they're not keeping it. So I think it's really just about us as consumers pushing back and saying, hey, we have some rights here to Amazon. Of course, everybody wants your data, including meta who roll down this new VR headset, $1500, you got to try this thing out. Your thoughts on it, and your thoughts on the metaverse, where we are right now. Yeah. Well, since we were just talking about privacy, I'll tell you the one eyebrow-raising thing about this new headset, is that it contains a whole bunch of cameras now on the inside that are looking at your eyes or eyebrows or cheeks, your mouth, you name it. And it's kind of a lot of information to know about our bodies. And I was really not satisfied with meta's answer about how they were going to keep that data private.

Let's say you're watching Netflix, and Netflix could gather data about when you laugh at certain points in the show or when you're crying, because that's the kind of thing that this technology will enable. On the metaverse more broadly, it's been seven years since the first Facebook Oculus product came out of the Rift. I reviewed that at the time, and when I was sitting down looking through the six demos that meta gave me of the new Quest Pro, I was kind of struck by, we haven't really gotten very far. I think the term I used in my review for the post was, it's the Metaverse. It just doesn't really push the boundary that far. It's never felt further away the idea that the metaverse is a place where lots of us in our normal everyday lives, where jobs and being creative are going to use this thing. It feels like they've really got a long ways to go. A long, long way to go. Wash your post tech columnist, Jeff Fowler. Great to have you, man. Appreciate it. You bet.

3284,84 Today's CPI friend came in hotter than expected at 8.2% but our senior column this Rick Newman has found some bright spots in today's report. Rick we have been asking so many guests over the last two hours to give us some good news no one's been able to do it so tell us what you think is good in this report. Well you have to squint a little bit but I've been paying a lot of attention to what's happening in transportation and if you look at what has happened with the inflation rate for new cars and especially for used cars the inflation rate is actually coming down. Remember when the price of used cars at the beginning of the year the annual inflation rate was like 45% for used cars and we were all like how did that happen? Well we know now that the price of used cars was surging by so much because there weren't enough new cars. There has been a persistent shortage of new cars available and that has a lot to do with the semiconductor shortage. That shortage is still there but it's getting worked out and we have seen the inflation rate for used cars come down from around 45% of an annualized rate earlier this year. The annual rate now is around 7.5% I think that's still too high but at least that situation is getting better and of course gasoline inflation has been improving but it seems like we've seen the end of the gas price decline and it's probably going to stabilize around $3.90. The rest of the report there are a lot of things going wrong and we are not getting the break in inflation that a lot of people have been hoping for. Yeah how big a concern is this for President Biden said today the report shows some progress against his fight against tire prices. Perhaps you explain what that progress is but how big an issue is this for Democrats? Remember just a couple of months ago Democrats in Congress passed an energy bill that they named the Inflation Reduction Act. I think one of the reasons that they gave it that actually silly name is that when inflation does come down inevitably it will they'll be able to say see we did that because we passed this thing called the Inflation Reduction Act. It worked. It was like magic. Without a doubt they hoped they would be able to say that by the time of the mid-term uh,https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6_2e_wGpQzc,93,2022-10-13 20:38:56
3285," They'll be able to say, see, we did that because we passed this thing called the inflation reduction act. It worked. It was like magic. Without a doubt, they hoped they would be able to say that by the time of the midterm elections, which are now less than a month away in on November 8th. And they can't. They cannot say that we have meaningfully brought inflation down. I mean, it's down about a little more than a percentage point from the high point it was at over over the summer, but an inflation at 8.2%. Nobody is going to declare victory on that. I guess the one thing Democrats can hope for is that the big declining gas prices has made people feel a little bit better that has corresponded with a minor uptick in consumer confidence and a similar small uptick in President Biden's approval rating. But it hasn't gone high enough. Biden's approval is around 43 or 44%. I think for Democrats to have a good shot at holding on to both houses of Congress, Biden's approval would have to be around 50% even higher. And he just is not going to get their by November 8th. So this is last inflation report we're going to get before the midterm elections. We are going to have one more employment report and we're going to have one more federal reserve meeting. But everybody now seems to think the Fed is is certain to raise by another three quarters of a point and other big height coming. So if inflation comes down, it's going to have to come after the midterms. Yeah, it's going to need gas prices to stay with a three in front of it as well. Rick Newman, good to see us. Sir, thank you. Diet and exercise is so pre pandemic. The new way to lose weight is through diabetes drugs, even Elon Musk tweeting his endorsement of the drug wagovie. What's the investor story behind this and other diabetes drugs in demand now? Michael Nadalkvic is the vice president of equity research at Cohen, good to see us. Sir, so novosy only company with FDA approval to market wagovie. They also make ozempic in that category. You have 130 dollar price target on novo. How much does that factor in what could be a game changer in weight loss? Yeah, so you know, novo Nordisk is one of the leaders in diabetes and they're really an execution story. Yeah, they market one of the marquee drugs and what's called the GLP one class. That's the drug ozempic that you mentioned, which is indicated for diabetes treatment. And this class of drugs, where as I mentioned, novo is one of the leaders is growing at a double digit rate. And that seems to be something we can expect for the foreseeable future. So based almost entirely on their prospects and diabetes, we think novo Nordisk is a company that investors should take a look at. In the meantime, they have this outsized opportunity in obesity treatment. And obesity is a market that at least to date has not materialized in a real way for various reasons, but we think that that is always to change and novo Nordisk is really the tip of the sphere and is well positioned to take advantage of what could be a multi billion dollar opportunity over the next few years. Yeah, Michael. And the govie is the marquee drug there. Yeah, Michael, give us a better sense just on when you talk about the massive opportunity there. How big it could be in five years from now. What more specifically do you think that number could potentially look like? So I'll actually defer in part to novo Nordisk guidance. So their ambition is to sell 25 billion DKK in 2025 that that's roughly five billion or so a little bit less in US dollars and obesity drugs. So, you know, that kind of brings estimates down to earth a little bit. If you look at just the number of people in the US and globally that have obesity or overweight, it's hundreds of millions. And so you can get to some eye watering estimates pretty quickly if you if you dial up the penetration rate. Historically, hurdle to penetration of these drugs has been payers and market access. We think that's beginning to change, but that will probably be a headwind that that brings estimates closer to where novo Nordisk's mind is for 2025 and beyond. Stunning number on our screen nearly 42% of this country is obese. I know you do not cover Eli Lilly, but the FDA did agree to a quick review of their competitive drug, which is Moongaro. Are they similar in makeup and how they work? And how does this change the cap the ceiling for novo? So I'll quibble just a little bit with your question there. You know, the FDA's.",https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6_2e_wGpQzc,94,2022-10-13 20:43:00
3286," Does this change the cap the ceiling for Novo? Yeah, so I'll quibble just a little bit with your question there. You know, the FDA is requiring two of the four phase three trials for the drug is called Terzepity from Lily before they'll review it for obesity. And those are already due to read out in kind of Q2, Q3 of 2023. So the it might not be all that quick, although it is quicker than perhaps it could have been. But you know, in a market like obesity, which is really nascent. And as I said, we think is beginning to materialize in a real way. You know, the phrase arising tide lifts all boats probably has never applied more. So Lily entering the market with Terzepity, which is a highly effective weight loss drugs, it acts similarly to the way that Novo Nordic we go. He does. It is perhaps slightly more efficacious, perhaps slightly less tolerable, though that's to be determined in real world use. It's probably good for both companies and we think there are more than enough patients to address with both drugs. Michael, what can you tell us just about the cost of these drugs? Yeah, so you know, we actually know the list prices. So we go, if you just as an example, as a list price around $1,500 a month. But if it's covered by your insurance, you would pay something well below that. You know, so out of pocket, we don't anticipate in the US at least it'll be a major out of pocket market for these drugs. They're probably to expensive. Very interesting. How do both of these work or all of these drugs in this category essentially appetites a presence and therefore really band aids that you'd have to stay on potentially indefinitely? Yeah. So they do work primarily through appetite suppression, although there's some other mechanisms where they provide health benefits. You should, if you're on one of these drugs, physicians should keep a patient on them indefinitely. And there's solid data that demonstrates that if the patient goes off, then the weight comes back. So that's how they're labeled. That's how they're intended to be used. We'll see in the real world what treatment durations actually look like. But it's not really a band aid in that sense. You know, obesity is an illness and these are drugs that are meant to treat that illness in a way that's very similar to diabetes where it's a chronic disease and they need to be treated chronically. Michael Nadelka, Vitch of a cow and thanks so much for joining us. Really appreciate your insight. Yeah. Thank you.

3287," [♪ music principled aviato music playing in background playing outside beat music playingoloной beat music playing in background isn't necessary to crack off like an asshole a kid待, to make Scrubs go crazy for everything."" plays high notes. Add the corn mustard Maggaret sophisticated Add the networking Amazon, Walmart and Target have already released their holiday hiring plans, but the news may point to signs of weakness in the labour market. Julia Pollack, Zyprakruti Chief Economist, joins me now as part of our career control series sponsored by Straight Talk Wireless. Julia, good to have you back on the show. So as we look at some of the trends that we've been seeing, so as we look at some of the trends that we've been seeing in hiring, leading up to the holidays, what does that tell us though? As we take a look back, as we take a step back and look at the overall market right now. Oh, I just... This is about the toughest environment that employers can be in for holiday hiring. So on the one hand, you have a situation where employers really don't want to be caught flat, but if they don't want to risk under hiring, when there's going to be a surge of demand, but they also are very concerned about the future outlook and the possibility of a downturn, and so they don't want to over hire. And so they're being a bit cautious and a little bit slow to kick off holiday hiring. And even as we look at the market, solid but supply constrained labour market, it's as it for crypto described, jobless claims are rising 9,000 to 228,000. What is your reaction to this job claims data and what this means for where we really are in the labour market? So layoffs and firings remain very, very low and that jobless claims number is incredibly low by historical standards. So there aren't yet too many layoffs taking place. In the most recent jobs report, we saw that job gains remain incredibly broad based over the past 12 months they've been broader than ever before. And yet there are some industries that are disproportionately affected by rising interest rates, by high inflation, by a strong dollar, and we are seeing some pain there. So for example, consumers are getting a little bit more wary about big ticket purchases. They can't dip into their house and use it as a piggy bank quite as easily anymore. And so car dealerships have shed jobs in the last month and so have building supply stores. So it's not easy to pay for your renovation by refinancing your house. And obviously as we talk a lot about things like hiring, freezes, job losses, we are seeing it in some sectors more than others as we talk about the tech sector often on here. But we're also seeing a lot more strategic hiring. So what are some of the more in demand positions and some of the really prime candidates that some of these companies are targeting right now? So this has been a very exciting time where because the labour market is so supply constrained, companies have had to streamline and centralise their hiring processes and revamp them quite dramatically. So companies are doing things like speeding up the time to hire. They're also increasingly posting jobs remotely and advertising them in multiple environments so that they can increase diversity and speed. Those are the two things that many companies are going for now. They're learning to hire for skills, not degrees and experience, and to sort of try to figure out who is going to be a good fit even if they don't fit the traditional mold. And they're having some success. These experiments are paying off and I think we're going to see innovations in hiring that improve the candidate experience and employee experience for generations to come. So talk about some of those innovations because on the one hand you have quiet quitting. You have a lot of people who could be lost in first up when they look at who perhaps could be most at risk. And you look at who's most at risk and where you see the future of work heading with innovation. What is that telling?",https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6_2e_wGpQzc,96,2022-10-13 20:52:04
3288," A lot of people who could be, you know, lost in first up when they look at who perhaps could be most at risk. When you look at who's most at risk and where you see the future of work heading with innovation, what is that telling you? So this is a labor market where there is still an increase in remote work in parts of the economy where there's tremendous potential. That increase has huge implications for the geography of work in America. We're seeing people increasingly open to moving in our monthly zippercruder job-seeker surveys. They are also being pushed by inflation in rent prices to consider opportunities more broadly across the country. Employers are also looking at candidates and increasingly hiring regardless of location. So that's one exciting move where people are sort of moving around for opportunity. And then we're also seeing an increase in the extent to which employers are having to behave in their HR departments like sales teams and like advertising and marketing teams. They are being more proactive. They are finding candidates passive talent often. People before they even apply and actively reaching out to them in our most recent survey, 37% of Americans hired in the last six months said that they had been reached out to. They had been recruited by someone at the company. So the job found them, they didn't have to find it. Now I also want to get your reaction. Obviously the Labour Department proposing this shift in gig workers being classified potentially as employees. You also have boomers being sort of left out of this, of this research and people coming back into the workforce and how that could impact the economy. How do you see some of these potential changes impacting what we see in the labour force say in the next year or so? So gig work, you know, we see in all the research that has been done is very valuable for workers because of its flexibility and converting those jobs into permanent payroll positions while it would improve benefits and have many benefits would also reduce that flexibility. And so there are trade-offs and I think those will become sort of abundantly clear as we go down that path. When it comes to labour force participation, you know, primate workers, even women, encouragingly have mostly recovered, almost fully recovered. We've seen younger workers actually see a boost in their employment opportunities and we've seen participation rise among teenagers and among workers with disabilities. So some people have been given better opportunities before because employers are expanding their recruiting efforts and because jobs have become more inclusive with the rise of remote work. That said, older workers have left this economy in much larger numbers than in any prior recession. They were displaced in enormous numbers. They faced the largest barriers to returning and it seems as though they are no longer coming back in large numbers. So they will leave a permanent gap and make this labour market as it permanently supply constrained unless we find other sources of labour perhaps by raising immigration caps or by improving our education and training programs. So a lot of demographic shifts to keep an eye on there. Thank you for breaking that down for a studio bullet. Have a good afternoon. Thank you very much. Thank you. All right, my stock to watch tomorrow, JPMorgan Chase, the bank marks the unofficial start, the third quarter earning season, analysts expect earnings to come in at $2.88 per share, which is down from a year ago.

Where is the Mac dot com encourages the public to push McDonald's to add craft mac and cheese to the Big Mac? The site has a direct link to tweet at McDonald's with the hashtag where is the Mac craft saying in a statement quote, we believe that the time for change is now. And we are hopeful that America's most iconic burger, the Big Mac, will start to add the most important Mac of all. Rochelle, are you in or are you out? I like Mac and cheese. I don't want it in my burger. You put making a side dish. Do something. That's way too much. The Big Mac is already a lot adding Mac and cheese that I can't. That's too much for me. What about you, Sean? Way too much for me. Although I didn't know this until reading this article, craft put out a statement saying that for years we've seen our fans add craft mac and cheese to their burgers from the comfort of their home. So even though Rochelle, you and I aren't necessarily on board with this, it does seem like there is a group out there, a market for this. Maybe this is why it's gaining some traction.

3294," percent year date, you have layoff sweeping the industry met a snap, you name it. And Rita saying the tech industry has learned a lot most notably staying focused. Here's what he said. Well, I think one of the good lessons is to stay very focused. I think one of the things that the call it the 10 plus years of bull market is allowed. Kind of like let's experiment with X, let's experiment with Y, let's experiment with Z. Let's just try lots and lots of things. And I think one of the things to say it is good to innovate. It is good to do new things. But let's go like intensely. It's almost like some of what we learn from Steve Jobs at launching at Apple is like focus on a couple of things that you're launching really intensely and trying to make them as good as possible. And I think that's that's kind of one of the lessons for investors and executives and employees. And in terms of, you know, don't don't don't kind of like spread out like spaghetti all across the field. Read it. Read is right on. And basically that is my take for this one. This great reawakening inside of tech suite. See, sweets is in fact happening. Wow, it's some kind of graphic right there. He's like I said, he's very right on in my view. Evolution is happening across across the tech industry. And he is right. You know, we have seen the past five years amazing technology is created. Absolutely full stop. But there's been a lot of things that tech has worked on that are money losing outfits that really have no reason of being created inside of tech companies right now in this environment as a tech company or really any company. You have to be focused and rally around a series or one or two key strategies that you can do really well and that you're known for really well in a strong, really in the marketplace. And I think read is right on here. So I'm looking forward to hearing more from read on Monday for all market summit. I almost forgot what I talked about, but nonetheless, I look forward to seeing you. And how much is that tech actually improving society and improving business as well? That's going to be a major question mark going forward from here, whether it's social media companies or chip companies or some of the cloud companies. All of that has a larger question to answer moving forward if it wants to continue to benefit from some of the accelerated growth that it's seen in years past. And perhaps that all priced into their future as well. Once we finally do see them move forward with some of that vision and strategy, you are going to hear more from that conversation with Reid Hoffman and our on Brian Saasie as well during the all market summit next week Monday. And a lot of other conversations. I'm also a lot of other exciting. All right, guys. Coming up. We've got some breaking news on the state of the consumer. Stay tuned for this. It's nice. All right.

3295,"cussion Welcome back, you're watching Got Who Finance Live. We've struck this the top of the 10 a.m. hour here, Brad Smith here with Julie Heimann and you're seeing Brian Sazi on screen there as well with 30 minutes into trade. Let's take it swiftly on over to Julie Heimann who's got some fresh news, breaking news and consumer sentiment as well. Yeah, consumer sentiment coming out better than estimated from the University of Michigan's October preliminary reading 59.8 is that reading 58.8 is what analysts had been, economists had been estimating it's also an increase from the prior month. They've heard conditions whoo, up better than estimated 65.3, economists weren't even looking for a reading above 60, their expectations though are lower. So people that feel good now but they don't expect that they're going to continue to feel good. 56.2 is that expectations number. The one year inflation number expectations ticking up to 5.1% and the five to 10 year inflation expectations ticking up to 2.9% are pretty fascinating here and also kind of in line with what we have been hearing right from corporations as well. So kind of a confirmation that just as Jamie Dimon said today, consumers are in good shape right now right. They're feeling good right now. The consumer balance sheet is in decent shape. People are spending. It's what's happening next that people are worried about. Yeah, exactly. To continue to uncertainty over future trajectory of prices, economies, financial markets around the world indicating a bumpy road ahead for consumers that all kind of laid out within the commentary on this as well, sauce. Yeah, just an interesting report and I would say just strange, shortened to the point better than expected. Doesn't really, I would say, job with the retail sales report but nonetheless a good read on the consumer. Welcome, Reid, for the consumer ahead of the start to the holiday. Shopping season, but let's get back under earnings season, which is now officially in full swing results from the JP Morgan city, Morgan Stanley and of course Wells Fargo. David Allison runs point on the Hennessy large cap financial fund. David, market has seemed, at least initially seemed to like some of these big bank earnings. Do you think that enthusiasm is justified? Well, I think the stocks have been down a lot. So the fact that they're up a little bit tells me that the world didn't come to an end again. So I think the stocks have been really bad. And so the fact that they're rebounding is sort of a sigh of relief. I think generally the fundamentals are good. I mean, obviously the margin is expanded because rates are moving up and there are primary beneficiaries of that. But what you're not seeing is any real credit deterioration. So you've had a massive move in rates. You've had a massive move in the market that has gone down that's taken money away. Sentiment is not great on Wall Street. And yet you don't really see any movement in credit. So it's interesting to note how strong these banks are, even though we have this fear of recession and the...",https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GRIayi6dbGM,2,2022-10-14 14:04:37
3296," really see any movement in credit. So it's interesting to note how strong these banks are, even though we have this fear of recession in the end of the world that seems to be the talk every day. Yeah, I mean, the end of the world trade can at least from what I've been told. Only be right once, and you hope that we don't reach that point. But when you think about some of the activity, even that we're seeing here on the day as well, David, as the markets have slipped back into negative territory, there we had a moment ago, all three major averages in negative territory. After beginning the day, pretty strong, and what seemed like would be another add on to yesterday's momentum, even though it was a whipsaw day yesterday, as you kind of look into the rest of this quarter, what would you need to see in order to have some confidence that a bottom had been set in during this fourth quarter, going into what economists are expecting in a recession at the midpoint sometime, 2023? Well, my general broad thoughts are that we've had a pretty good move in rates. Two years ago, I think the two year was like 15 basis points, and now it's 4 plus percent. So I think we're through the bulk of the rating increases, meaning we're not going to go to 8 or 10% on the three-month T-build. That's my opinion. I think what we're heading into now is an earnings issue for all of the companies, not all of them, but enough of them. Obviously, the financials aren't seeing any earnings issues. There's concern that there will be that rates will go up, credit will kick in, loan demand will decline. And I think it would be interesting to see what happens the next couple of weeks as the non-financial start to report and tell you what's happening away from the financial economy. Again, the banks came into this downturn, very strong, very conservative. They haven't made, they don't want to make bad loans. They've got plenty of capital. They're benefiting from the rise in rates in the NIM. So this group is not really indicative of what's happening out there in the marketplace yet. Well, there are some hints of it, right? If you look at this, David, in JP Morgan, for example, yes, net interest income doing fantastically. But if you take out net interest income, revenue actually didn't do as well. They're raising their provisions for credit losses. They're seeing a decline in lending already. How much worse do you think some of those indicators, even if the banks are going to get worse? Well, I don't, you know, it's, I guess, is an investor in these stocks to be completely honest. I am looking forward to credit troubles. I am looking forward to higher rates. I am looking forward to the market getting very concerned about the health of the banking industry, because that's going to generate the opportunities for me to buy the better names and outperform on the way up. So, you know, that's the raw truth of what I do is, you know, I don't want what we have now to continue, because I can't really compete with the other companies in the marketplace that grow. They create new products. We need cycles for this industry to really make money for investors. And my hope, again, I've been doing this for 40 years. You know, I'm hoping we have a downturn. I'm hoping we have a recession. I hope we have higher non-performers that create lower stock prices that I can buy as the economy recovers, the Fed, if it's and all that stuff. Okay, so David, tell us. So what are the better names then? What are the ones that you're looking to get cheaper? What are the ones you're most excited about getting cheaper in this kind of tumultuous period? Well, the ones that are going to have credit problems, and I don't think the bigger companies are going to have that. They've just been too conservative, they're too liquid. So the smaller banks, the mid-tier banks, maybe not the real small ones, where they've made loans, the loans to deposits are higher, they don't have as much liquidity. If credit kicks in on a negative thing, then they'll hopefully go down a lot more and I'll be able to buy them. But right now, there's no problems in the industry. And this is the frustrating part for an asset manager. If there's no problems, there's nothing to get back.",https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GRIayi6dbGM,3,2022-10-14 14:09:12
3297," or now be able to buy them. But right now, there's no problems in the industry. And this is the frustrating part for an asset manager. If there's no problems, there's nothing to get better. There's no reason for the stocks to go up. So we need things to go wrong for this group to get really attractive. And right now, the first eight, four, five companies that have reported, everything's great. Non-performers are OK. Lone growth is OK. Yeah, they're preserving here and there. But they're just being super conservative. And I would do the same thing. So we'll see what happens. But I think you'll see more issues with the economy in the non-financials for the next couple of months. I think that the struggle, the real challenges in the world is not the financial system. It's away from the financial system. David Wells Fargo is a top 10 holding in the fund. Does that company frustrate you? They had a couple I would argue, two good come back quarters to kick off this year. They come out here this morning. I would argue, expense is still high. It announced a charge. The home business under pressure, auto is under pressure. What do you make of that name? Well, again, it's a large cap fund. So I'm not going to own a $2 billion bank. So you have to own something big. But the valuation is reasonable. They've got a great historical franchise. They've had some management issues for the last four or five years, which have been very frustrating, not quite as bad as CityCorp. But certainly, they've had some struggles. And the valuation is just too cheap to ignore. And the embedded franchise value of those deposits is just too large and too powerful. And you're seeing the benefit of those deposit franchises now in higher net interest income. Just while we have you here as well, David, there's an interesting tidbit within the consumer sentiment survey that had come out just a moment ago. And particularly as we think about the consumer and the higher net income consumer as well, if you see them start to be impacted to the same kind of detriment, maybe not the same detriment. But as they're citing here negative influence on their personal finances, the highest in five months, what does that start to spell out more broadly about where consumer mindset in the economy is trending towards? Well, presumably, the Fed is doing, or is making things happen the way it wants to have them happen, meaning they're slowing the economy down. And that's showing up in certain things. Obviously stock prices are down. Home prices have stopped going up 2% a day. So I think the issue here is who's going to really feel it more. And I just don't believe that the financial, the large financial companies, the banks, are going to feel the real bite of this recession, at least not yet. It's going to be the other companies. It's going to be the companies that have reported, even you look at Nike and you look at, those companies are going to hurt a lot more than the banks are. The banks since 2008 have been in a box, they've been regulated, they've been forced to be liquid, forced to be conservative, forced to have tons of capital. And now that's paying dividends for them, in a sense that they're not seeing the struggles. So you're not really seeing what's happening yet in the economy. And I think the financials are not a good example of that yet. And so I think the numbers you're seeing are going to impact the non-financial a lot more than the financial come. David Allison, who was point at the Hennessey large cap financial fund, good to see you. Have a good weekend. Thank you. You too. All right. Thanks. All right, before we head to break, we're keeping an eye on two stocks. First out, Morgan Stanley, the analyst Ben, Swinburn, defending Spotify with an overweight rating inter-earning. Shortly, Swinburn says the stock could choose to be heard by rising interest rates, but Spotify's business remains strong. Also looking at Abercrombie and Fitch, which got slapped with a 90-day catalyst by rating mouthful. There, nonetheless from a city analyst Paul Legeway. Legeway thinks ANF's valuation has gotten too cheap to ignore given the brand's revival. All right, coming up, Y'all, finance is Jennifer. Sean Burder has an exclusive interview with San Francisco Fed President Mary Daley. You won't want to miss it. We'll get that.",https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GRIayi6dbGM,4,2022-10-14 14:13:33
3298," All right, coming up, Y'all, it's Jennifer, Sean Barter has an exclusive interview with San Francisco Fed President Mary Daley. You won't want to miss it. We'll be right back. Welcome back to Yahoo Finance. I'm Jennifer, Sean Barter. Well, on the back of that hot CPI report that showed a core reading, rising to the highest level in 40 years, investors are wondering what this means for the Fed. And if they'll get more aggressive here to weigh in is Mary Daley, president of the San Francisco Federal Reserve Bank. President Daley, welcome back to the program. So wonderful to have you. It's wonderful to be here. I look forward to it. So I want to kick off this conversation and get your reaction to that CPI report and whether it changes the course of policy for you. If we look at the reading on inflation, it appears to be actually moving in the wrong direction, right? We saw core inflation, which excludes those volatile energy and food prices rise 6.6% last month up from 6.3 in August in 5.9 in July. Do you still see the Fed funds rate rising somewhere on the order of 125 basis points this year, or does the Fed need to get more aggressive on the back of this report? Sure, and you know, the CPI is one part of the dashboard of indicators we look for. It's an important one and it does show the data not cooperating. It was a very disappointing report, but I would offer it wasn't that surprising, right? We would hope that inflation would start to come down faster, but I was prepared for it to just be sluggish in its response. It's a lagging indicator. So what I'm also looking at is what's going on in the inputs to inflation are demanded supply showing any signs of coming back in balance. And here I would offer two things that you see the labor.",https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GRIayi6dbGM,5,2022-10-14 14:17:56
3299," What's going on in the inputs to inflation are demand and supply showing any signs of coming back in balance. And here I would offer two things that you see the labor market cooling. It's still very strong, but it's cooling. You also see housing demand cooling. So the housing market is softening. And then today's retail sales report, which had showed flat spending is really another sign that we're getting some cooling. And that we will eventually feed through to inflation. And so my own sense is that we went in, I went into this, intermeeting period, if you will, thinking that we needed to continue to raise rates to further restrict the economy. And we'll have to be data dependent about what actual rate hikes we take, because we have domestic conditions, but we're also working in a global economy. And there's a lot of uncertainty and risks out there. And we have to think about those in the context of exactly what we do. But there's literally no doubt in my mind that we need to put more restrictive stance of policy in the economy to further get demand and supply and balance so that consumers don't have to worry about such high inflation month after month. So given that you think this is a bit of a lagging indicator and you do see some signs of cooling elsewhere in the economy, does this keep the Fed basically on course for what's been set out for the next couple of meetings or what's your sense there? Well, let's go back to the summary of economic projections, lovingly called the SEP. And that often isn't it is stale right after it's produced. But in this case, I think that's a really good guide post from our last meeting about what the path of policy is likely to look like. And then it's all about how do you get there? What's the path? And the SEP, if you remember it, it came out between four and a half and five percent rates as the best estimate of what rates would be at the end of next year. And it also said that we could get up into the fours into restrictive territory by the end of this year. And I still think that's a reasonable, really reasonable way to think about it. And I'm quite certain that some digital restriction is going to take place. And I do know that that's right for the economy. We are tightening into a strong economy. And so we need to bring it back down to something that looks a lot more sustainable in terms of the pace of growth. OK, so then to be clear, 125 basis points higher on that, but, but, but funds rate this year. And then looking at a peak of around four and a half to five percent next year still seems to be the run of play in your mind. Is that correct? Well, what I would say, Jennifer, and I just want to be crystal clear. I know people would like us to write down the exact numbers for the rest of the period. But there's too much uncertainty for that to be prudent for us. We need to be data dependent, extremely data dependent. So clearly the domestic data are pointing to further rate hikes. And I'm very supportive of continuing to put restrictions in place. I see the SEP is a good starting point and guide post for people to say that's generally where the Federal Reserve will be heading. That's consistent with my own views. But I also want everyone here listening to recognize that we're not on a preset course. We are a data dependent fed. And if more is necessary, we'll take it if less is necessary, we'll adjust. But we're not talking about at this point in my mind, you know, pausing or stopping. Nor are we talking about, you know, changing our overall strategy because the data are coming in about like we would expect. Monetary policy, actually the lag inflation is a lagging indicator. It is a hardship that continues to print so high. And I am very focused on that hardship. And I'm very mindful as my context tell me all the time that we want to make sure that price increases, that inflation doesn't become embedded in psychology. And that's why you'll hear me say again and again, we are resilient as an FOMC as a fed at restoring price stability. Even that you said monetary policy operates with a lag, you still think he would raise up to about four and a half, five percent and then, Oz at that point in 2023. Well, I think that's exactly the question we have in mind and why there's a big difference between what rate you get to and then holding it that you holding the economy in a restrictive stance of policy also continues to bridle it. So we'll end at a rate that we think is appropriate in in terms of where to stop and look around. But we still need to get the rates up in order before we ever do that and they'll go.",https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GRIayi6dbGM,6,2022-10-14 14:22:06
3300," ended a rate that we think is appropriate in terms of where to stop and look around, but we still need to get the rates up before we ever do that. And then we'll go to what I would think of as what I call oftentimes a raise and hold strategy where we raise it. And then we let that sit for a while. But we are always even in that reason hold piece adjusting to the economic conditions as they come in. We are not on some sort of course that can't correct if the economy needs more, bridal or needs less bridal, but really that's how I think about it. Get you between four and a half and five is the most likely outcome and then raise to those levels and then hold at that point for some period of time. You said there is a narrow path to engineer a soft landing for this economy. There is a window for that. You think it is possible. That said this week we heard that the IMF downgraded its global outlook. It says the worst is yet to come and it warned about over tightening from global central banks and the possibility of precipitating an unnecessarily harsh global recession. At the same time we also heard from JP Morgan CEO Jamie Diamond, who believes we could see a recession in the next nine months or sooner, given the impact of inflation on the consumer. They also said in their earnings report that they're setting aside 800 million for loan loss reserve. My question is where do you pin the odds of a recession in the next day six to 12 months. It's fascinating to me that we continue to be asked mostly by the media and others that about recession. But when I'm out in my context of nine western states that travel all over the United States, I'm not hearing signs of recession. I'm hearing signs that we'd like to grow more but we can't find workers or consumers saying when is inflation going to go away. My life would be great if we didn't have such high inflation. People have plenty of jobs opportunities. We still have a strong labor market. We have good consumer spending, even though it's flat. It's still people are spending. People are doing things that they want. I also point to one more data point that you didn't mention yesterday. I believe the conference board came out with their CEO survey and those CEOs 98% expected some sort of a slowdown. But they all, you know, what I remember from the report that was really meaningful and it's consistent with what I hear when I talk to business contacts workers, community groups is that people expect the slow down to be there, but they expected to be short lived and not very deep. That's a very different landing. That would I in my mind is the soft landing we're trying to achieve. We need to slow GDP growth substantially to get us back in demand supply balance. The labor market needs to cool further we're adding over 200,000 jobs per month in the last report. And that's another 100,000 over what it takes to just keep things study, you know, then just absorb the new entrance that come into the labor market. So clearly we're running fast demand and sluggish supply. Those things have to come back into balance. The feds tool, while it's blunt, it does directly affect the strength of demand and we're committed to bringing demand back in line with supply. You mentioned that business executives expected there is a recession. It would be a milder one. How deep of a recession is the fed willing to tolerate as you try to quell inflation and bring it down and frankly as a recession, what's needed to really get inflation under control? You know, that's not how I think about my work. Actually, we have a dual mandate full employment and price stability. My job as I see it is to treat those like they are for most people those things are related. They don't want only one or only the other. And so our job is to ensure that we can get a balance of both get jobs. Everyone who wants a job can find one, even if it takes a little bit longer as the unemployment rate moves up, they're still going to find a job and inflation comes back down to something closer to 2% in next year, you know, something closer and then gets to 2% in the course of the next two years. Those are critical things for us to achieve. And so I'm not thinking of it in terms of recession. I do think of it in terms of cooling the economy so the demand and supply come back into balance and Americans can go to bed at night and get up in the morning, not worried about whether the prices they paid a day.",https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GRIayi6dbGM,7,2022-10-14 14:26:18
3301," cooling the economy so the demand and supply come back into balance and Americans can go to bed at night and get up in the morning, not worried about whether the prices they pay today are no longer going to be there tomorrow and they're not going to be able to afford the basic things they need to have their lives and livelihoods. I do want to ask I do want to ask you about one other economic scenario since inflation has proven pretty sticky and if that does expect below trend growth this year for the next couple of years as your hiking rates to pull the demand side of the economy. What's the risk that a stack flationary environment could emerge and how would the committee approach that. Well, so again, I think of stack flation that's a it's frankly a big scary word but look at the consumer sentiment that came out today there it's it's rose and then the future expectations slow to course for for for growth but that's consistent with what the economy needs. I think of what we're doing now as bringing inflation down so that we can have a durable expansion and we know that durable expansions are the ones that are best for the labor market best for all the groups that we care a lot about and that high inflation is a tax a regressive tax that's literally eating away at the lives and livelihoods of Americans we're able to bear it so when I think of that I think of slower pace of growth delivers lower inflation puts us back in balance gets us in the best position to grow once again at trend and I don't have any data right now that suggests that that's not possible. President daily want to thank you so much for your insights so appreciate it and hope to talk with you again soon. I look forward to it. Thank you so much. Thanks so much that's Mary daily president of the San Francisco Federal Reserve bank will be right back. Thank you. Thank you. Thank you. Thank you. Thank you.",https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GRIayi6dbGM,8,2022-10-14 14:30:05
3302," Welcome back to Yahoo Finance, everyone. U.S. retail spending came in flat in September. However, consumer sentiment coming in above estimates, even as Americans' expectations for inflation, they worsened. For more, on the state of the economy, we have Stephen Rashido, who is the Mizzouho America's chief U.S. economist. Great to have you here with us this morning. First, just help us break down the market reaction that we've seen over these past two days to some of the economic data that really factors in everything from prices that consumers are paying to the sentiment from consumers right now. Well, I think when you're looking at the overall economy in this environment, you have to keep in mind, too, thanks. One thing is, if the economy is showing more resilience than people had expected, given the pace of Fed rate hikes, that's number one. But we often forget that they've only been tightening since March of this year. So it's what, seven months into the process and the shortest possible lag between monetary policy and economic impacts of six months. That's the shortest possible lag. It's a long and durable lag, and it tends to be sometimes to the much longer lag. So the fact that we're continuing to see inflation remaining stubborn on the upside and we're continuing to see a more resilient underlying economy, always back into the fact that the labor market has not had any major significant change. And this is the critical issue. The labor market continues to be a critical piece of the equation to get inflation down and to slow the pace of underlying economic activity. And in an environment in which we're dealing with a real labor market shortage, it's really hard to do this. And therefore, there's going to be much more additional rate hikes coming down the pipeline from the Federal Reserve. Steve, I don't know if you were able to catch it, but we just had San Francisco Fed President Mary Daley on and she gave a range of potential rates where they would like to go potentially 4.5% to 5%. If we reached that 5% level, is the US economy still growing and by how much? Well, again, I actually have a higher terminal rate at this particular juncture than President Daley has and that's not surprising. The SEP issue was quoting, did not take on board the latest inflation numbers or the latest retail sales numbers or for that matter, the latest we clean unemployment claims numbers. And the answer to your question is the economy could still be growing because we're going to be there by the end of this year and early next year. So it might not be into the real recessionary environment until we get into the second quarter of 2023, given the underlying resilience in the economy. So the answer is we're going to have to see higher rates than are currently discounted in the marketplace and higher rates than she's discussing in her commentary a few minutes ago. Steven, it's Julie here. We've had a lot of folks come on the show and say the Fed is not quite looking at the right indicators and that that means there is this big risk of overshooting, but it sounds like you think the Fed should be even more aggressive or will end up being more aggressive here. So what indicators are you watching right now is sort of giving us a good snapshot of what's going on? Look, and watch the weekly initial unemployment claims numbers. They are the best real-time measure that we're looking at in terms of labor market. And what we're seeing is, yes, people may be losing their jobs, but they're getting alternative jobs very quickly and not showing up either in the claims numbers or showing up in the continuing claims numbers. The labor market is the key here. And given the fact that we have a real labor shortage, this is the battle that the Federal Reserve is fighting against. And this is the battle that they have to win before they can get any declines of inflation that are going to be considered sustainable on an ongoing basis. And until we get there, we're not, one of those things we're going to know when we get there, we're not going to be able to forecast it ahead of time. So all this analysis that we're doing about what the terminal rate should be really has to be viewed against the live input of data coming in, which is why people at the Fed like price, you know, a unit of data that no one is going to see in favor of this from underground numbers has to say, unfortunately, it can't be moving down, there's none. And, those, the empieza notices, those are the summit numbers that we're going to get",https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GRIayi6dbGM,9,2022-10-14 14:35:40
3303," The rate should be really, you know, has to be, has to be viewed against the live input of data coming in, which is why people at the Fed, like President Daly, are telling you, we're data dependent. And what we see so far is nothing has really changed. That would change our view with regard to monetary policy. And I tend to agree with them as well. Steve, you said in your notes to us that the, by the dip strategy here is misguided. What is misguided about it? And is it still, for those who are asking themselves, should I be buying this dip? Is the answer from your perspective still no? And the answer is yes, it's still no. And the reason for this market's don't really yet discount what's going to come. There are going to be corporate failures. There are going to be banks that have significant problems. There is going to be economic pain that comes about as a result of what the Fed is doing. But the Fed really has no alternative, which is the other thing. So people seem to think the Fed has an alternative. There is no alternative to what they're doing. Allowing inflation to get embedded in the system is a long-term problem that is going to require even more pain down the road. So the Fed's prescription is take your medicine now, get it over with, and let's get it done with. And I think they're doing exactly what they're supposed to be doing. And I think people keep on wanting to look through to the other side of this story. The problem is this other side of this story could be further out in the calendar that investment horizons are set to. And that's the real reason why it's misguided. Stephen Reciutto, a Mizzouho America's chief US economist, always good to get some time with you. Have a good weekend. You too. Have a great weekend. Home Depot, co-founder Bernie Marcus slams the body of administration in a chat. I had with him about his new book. We'll have that interview next.好不好 mü'm gym Masters M M M M M M M M M M M M M M M",https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GRIayi6dbGM,10,2022-10-14 14:39:56
3304," I'm Deepo Coffounder, Bernie Marcus. Had some choice words for the Bonn administration in my exclusive chat with him on his new book called Kick Up Some Dust. He also reflected a bit on starting home depot during a period of high inflation. If you don't read history, you don't know history. We're right back where we started and we opened up during the Jimmy Carter days and in the flash, she was 20 percent, interest rates was 20 some odd percent and people were struggling. Manufacturers were struggling. We opened up in the middle of this and fortunately because of the capital market, we had cash. So we had to pay our vendors ahead of time. We paid vendors the day they delivered the product, which is uncalled for. I mean, it just doesn't happen. But we want to keep them in business. And I can tell you, there are hundreds of manufacturers who are major manufacturers today that we kept in business those days by paying our bills quickly so they can have the cash to buy product to keep the people working. And it was not an easy time. But here we are all over again. We don't learn less. Inflation is killing us. People are struggling. You know, a gallon of gas versus putting food on the table is not a place you want to be. But our customers now have that. It's unfortunate. We just still learn. Just to learn. Do you feel as though the economy doesn't feel like the same economy that it did back in 1979? Well, it's, it was easier. It was easier now to fix it than it was then. He caught or didn't have the tools. You know, he had all these people kept captive in Iran. He had, he opact really against him. And if you remember oil and gas rationing was pretty horrible. You had numbers and you couldn't get gas if you didn't have a certain number. Well, we have a president that just doesn't believe in that. We're sitting on tons of oil and gas and he doesn't allow us to drill. It's, it's, it's basically stupid. I can't come up with another word. It's stupid. And we will continue to suffer this. This inflation and our people will continue to struggle with high prices as long as he maintains this, this facade of climate control versus allowing us to do the things that we should be doing. I don't know. People live on a different planet. I think I, I feel one day I wake up in the morning and say, where the hell are they coming from? I don't understand it. What, why are they defending, not drilling when in fact climate change, you could put them off over a period of time and do it over the next 30 years, 40 years and do it intelligently, but not slam down on it and kill everybody today. So it's hurting everybody today, not good. I know you're a big free market guy, Bernie, I mean, that's how you created or helped create Home Depot. I do you mentioned, you mentioned capitalism a couple minutes ago. Do you think capitalism is under attack in this country? Oh, yes. It's under attack in universities. You have professors who are socialists, what teaching is to the young people. And we had a poll at one point that was very frightening because it showed that almost 50% of the young people would vote for socialism over capitalism. They just don't know. They get to their hearts. They don't get to their brains.",https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GRIayi6dbGM,11,2022-10-14 14:43:28
3305," people would vote for socialism over capitalism. They just don't know. They get to their hearts, they don't get to their brains. And unfortunately we have a whole group of people growing up today where they think in terms that socialism is good for America whereas in fact capitalism is what puts food on the table. It's allowed people to grow, allow people to develop economics and independence and they don't get it. When they get it it's like so many friends of mine say that their kids were socialists. I'll put till they got their first job and they took all money out of their paycheck to pay taxes and all of a sudden they became capitalist. So that may be the story. Always an entertaining, entertaining chat with Home Depot co-founder Bernie Marcus again, author of the new book Kick Up Some Dust. All right coming up going viral TikTok plans to build US fulfillment centers will break down what this means for the popular social media app next. Let's get down to business with a look at some other headlines we're watching now. SpaceX's Starlink satellites have been a vital source of communication for Ukraine's military since they arrived last spring. SpaceX CEO Elon Musk was said earlier this month that the operation has cost SpaceX $80 million and will exceed $100 million by the end of the year. But now he says this company cannot donate more Starlink Terminal to Ukraine's army or continue funding the ones it has already has. It's asking the Pentagon to pick up the bill which he says would cost more than $120 million for the rest of the year could cost close to $400 million for the next 12 months.",https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GRIayi6dbGM,12,2022-10-14 14:47:43
3306," Pentagon to pick up the bill, which he says would cost more than $120 million for the rest of the year, could cost close to $400 million for the next 12 months. The Russian-installed governor of Ukraine-Southern Kursan region Vladimir Saldoy told residents on Thursday to take their children and flee. Asin Moscow is losing its grip on the territory claims to have annexed following shelling from Ukraine. Saldoy was saying on telegram that the target that the missiles hit our hotels, residential houses, markets. There are lots of civilians. A departure of civilians would be a blow to Russia, especially due to the area's strategic importance. United Airlines looking to boost its fleet of wide-body jets, the airline operator studying offers for Boeing 787 Dreamliner and Airbus's A350. It's been in talks with the plane-makers for months, according to Bloomberg. CEO Scott Kirby told pilots at a Denver training session that the airline is planning a triple digit order with multiple wide-body models being considered. The shares of the cloud computing company Nutanix have been surging today, that's after reports the company could be seeing takeover interest from being capital. Right now, it's uncertain what prospects actually exist for a deal, but the acquiring company would likely have to pay a big premium to Nutanix's nearly $6 billion market value. The shares of 24% right now, Brad. All right, thanks so much, Julie. Well, TikTok is doubling down on e-commerce, the popular social media app looking to expand its footprints in this space by building fulfillment centers in the U.S. Yeah, we'll finance this. Kelsey Barbario joins us now with the details. All right, what do we need to know about this? It looks like, yeah, they're trying to compete with Amazon. What's going on? So, honestly, it looks like, according to reporting from Axios, we've got them filling out job list. They've got jobs listed. I'm so sorry. I am a little nervous to be here with you guys. Thank you. No, so Axios did some reporting that it looks like there are job listings up on LinkedIn for about a dozen different jobs for fulfillment centers that are going to be international. So, it looks like they're going to be getting into the e-commerce business a bit. And now, TikTok has a lot of people shopping on their platform as it is. They've got about 23.7 million people that are looking to make at least one purchase likely this year. That's according to insider, I believe. But no, so we've got, yeah, there's a ton of people. There's so much opportunity there, and they're really trying to get into that and take some of that market share from companies like Amazon, who have got Amazon Storefront, which is really popular on TikTok, and like to know it aboard style. Yeah, interesting here. And at the same time, there's all these things that TikTok is getting into that we know about, right, or that are reported upon. And one of them is that there would be some sort of QVC-like shopping feature. I mean, I know live shopping is kind of this big and growing thing, but it seems like it hasn't totally reached critical mass. Is there already a lot of live shopping on TikTok happening? I wouldn't say the QVC style that it sounds like they're trying to get into. I know that Facebook did something similar to this before. And now it looks like they're trying to make a partnership with TalkShop Live. There's nothing official there yet, but that could be something that's pretty big for them. I do know that they were testing this also in the UK and in Asia, and it wasn't very successful. I think that one of the big problems there is that a lot of people that are purchasing things from creators like the authenticity factor of it. They like feeling like it's just a creator going about their regular life, making videos about the things that they enjoy. And so I think if you kind of take away that natural element of it, there might be a problem. So I know they had issues getting creators on board in those other markets, so it would be curious to see how that happens here. I mean, I always set up a ring light in a camera when I'm doing my plant, dead duties, and now it's a... Of course. Of course it's authentic, right? I mean, but this is a big deal because TikTok reported they went through a round of layoffs in July. What does this new kind of e-commerce push really tell us about the future of the company here? Yeah, like you said, they started off with about 1,500 employees here in the US in 2020, which is pretty strong. They've been going at a pretty great clip ever since then, but then as of July, they did pull back and say that they were going to halt a little bit of their hiring. But I think that's just kind of following suit with what other tech companies are doing at this point. They're looking at the economy and they're not really sure what's going to happen. But I do think that a lot of their revenue right now is coming from add dollars. And so I think that they're trying to find a way to diversify the way that they're making their money and they see so many people, millions of dollars, if being spent through these affiliate networks, like StyleLink and RewardStyle, and they just... They want to get a little piece of that.",https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GRIayi6dbGM,13,2022-10-14 14:52:38
3307," By the way that they're making their money and they see so many people like millions of dollars of being spent through these affiliate networks like StyleLink and Reward Style and they just they want to get a little piece of that. Right. It's all about making this advertising kind of element really attractive for the marketers out there especially knowing that they're looking for conversions. That's why all these platforms are trying to make it more shoppable. We'll see what that looks like within Tiktok. Would you buy anything on Tiktok? Oh I buy things on Tiktok. I'd be buying anything off to you. Yeah, okay. Oh yeah. All right well, I'm behind the curve here. Thanks so much for joining us here in Studio. Yeah, we'll find in Sizzone, Kelsey Barberio. Coming up everyone, Julie's got this week's winners and alluzers on the other side of the bring. from red hot inflation data to volatile market swings. We've seen it all this week, and Julie's got some thoughts here. It's time for our winner and loser of the week. All right, so where should we begin, Julie? Let's start with the winner. Let's start with positive, right? Because maybe because I have a little more to say about the loser of the week. The winner of the week, actually, if you look in the S&P 500, the best performer on the week is Moderna. Hey. And Moderna is down again today, and it's been down quite a bit this year, something like 47% and 48%. But it did have a positive week, up about 12%. Because the big question surrounding Moderna has been what next? Now that it proved the viability of the mRNA platform, not just it, but of course the Pfizer-BiannTech vaccine for coronavirus as well, well, how then was that platform going to be used? And we got one sign of that this week, when Moderna signed on with Merck, that the two are going to try to make an mRNA-based cancer vaccine. Now it's early stages, but this is one of the early concrete signs of what we're going to then see from...",https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GRIayi6dbGM,14,2022-10-14 14:57:30
3308," RNA-based cancer vaccine. Now, it's early stages, but this is one of the early sort of concrete signs of what we're going to then see from it. So that was one of the winners. I saw it the week after the stock has been a loser this year. Soz. It is about some losers, Julie. What do you got? OK. I got one big loser for you. And that, unfortunately, for those in the UK is quasi-quarteng, who is the now resigned fire, depending on how you want to put it. Chancellor of the checker over there, who had been really closely allied with Liz Truss. And he came out with a letter today talking about his resignation. Of course, he was really the architect, along with Truss, of their big mini budget, which, among other things, was going to change the tax structure that came at a fire for proposing a tax structure on high earners, for example, a reduced tax structure. He sent his letter today. The economic environment has changed rapidly since we set out the growth plan on 23rd September in response together with the Bank of England. And excellent officials at the Treasury. We've responded to those events. And I commend my officials for their dedication. The economic environment changed because of this plan coming out. So it's just to come out with a statement like that. Yes, the conditions continue to deteriorate in the UK in terms of inflation going higher, just like it is here in the US. But it's a little disingenuous to say the economic environment has changed rapidly when you were one of the architects of that economic environment changing rapidly. In other words, seeing really a plunge in the British pound, for example, and a lot of pension funds in the UK becoming stressed. And then the Bank of England having to step in and help them with some easing to the system. So quasi-quartone, sorry for him, loser of the week. Yes, loser of the week there. You mentioned depending upon who you asked, whether it's fired or resigned. If it's the BBC, they say, well, the Bricks, they say SACT, according to the BBC. He was SACT, indeed he was. All right, everybody. Hope you have a great weekend. A kick off of Jeeta will continue our big bank discussion on the back of those earnings reports with speed capital management, bills meet. And don't forget on Monday are all markets summit happening. Monday the 17th, featuring interviews with CEOs from Target, General Motors, Microsoft. You don't want to miss that. It will be a full day of very big stuff. And have a great weekend in the meantime.",https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GRIayi6dbGM,15,2022-10-14 15:01:33
3309,". Welcome to Yahoo Finance Live. It is 11 a.m. here in New York City. I'm a Kiko Fujita. Here's what I'm watching at this hour. Big banks kicking off earnings season this morning with JP Morgan, Morgan Stanley Wells Fargo and city leading the way. We're going to break down the numbers with speed capital management, CIO, built need in just a few minutes. Oil prices down as global recession fears and waiting demand outweigh concerns over supply. The global head of energy at KPMG joined us this hour to discuss the repercussions of the recent OPEC plus decision. China braces for a historic party congress president Xi Jinping expected to secure an unprecedented third term but concerns about a slowing economy could rain on his parade. But first let's do a quick check of the market action on this Friday. Another choppy session on our hands here after the historic turnaround rally that we saw yesterday. You see all three majors right now in the red. The Dow down 42 points the S&P 500 down 29 and the Nasdaq down 129. Result season kicking off with some big banks announcing their Q3 numbers this morning and that is the focus of our show JP Morgan was the headliner topping estimates thanks to higher rates. Those CEO Jamie Diamond once again pointed to hurdles and headwinds on the horizon. Let's bring in Bill Smith, speed capital management, CIO, bill. This is kind of the super bowl for you, right? You've got all the big banks reporting today. It certainly feels like if you look at somebody like JP Morgan, we're kind of back to the discussion we had a few years ago. Last year we were talking about low loss reserves being pulled back. Now we're seeing an increase there because the concerns on the horizon around the economy. Yeah, it's so interesting that after all the work that's been done, these banks have been way more capital than they need even during a sharp recession. It's all set up that way. So you've taken the worst of the downside out of the risk associated with these companies because they have a wide mode that they have the deposits of the largest adult population group, the millennials because they have the best mobile banking apps. And now over the next 10 years, those millennials are going to be outstanding customers on the lending side, what they call the liability side in the business. And then the second picture you got from these reports is Wall Street is stinking and Main Street is doing well. Elaborate on that one for me. Well, trading and IPOs and all that kind of stuff is disappearing as a profit center. And at the same time, the average person in the United States is seeing their wages go up quite a bit. So it looks like the have-nots are going to win for a while. And that could be true of the next entire next decade, which is the way that the 1970s were where we had inflation that the have-nots were getting better bargaining position from a labor standpoint. And capital for the most part was treated very poorly unless it was invested in something that benefited from inflation. Yeah, I mean, let's talk about that bit more, Bill. I mean, JPM, one of those names that you do own. Obviously, we looked to these bank earnings for any kind of color on where the economy is headed. And yet, there still does seem to be a bit of a disconnect between where sentiment is and where actual spending is. And we kind of heard that from JP Morgan today when they said they haven't necessarily seen a significant pullback in consumer spending. Yeah.",https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GRIayi6dbGM,16,2022-10-14 15:05:19
3310," has certainly seen a significant pullback and consumer spending. Yeah, that's a great point, a great question. So about 80% of what goes on in the United States economy goes on regardless. Just go back and look at 07 to 09 and you'll realize that 80% of what goes on always goes on. It's that 20% of variable GDP that the recession hits, right? So if the economy contracts 4%, it means 20% of the 20% that's variable got hit. And so we feel the pain, right? Because people live a lot in that variable part of their life, not in the fixed part of their life. So that's where the concern is, but from an investor standpoint, a company is worth the net present value of the future income stream and the future cash flows. And 4% less for a year in a 20 year time continuum doesn't really change the net present value of a business very much. And that's where people make all their mistakes. They sell their stocks because of recession because they're going to get less 4% less affection from the economy. They don't do that with their spouse. They certainly don't do that with their spouse. Bill, another sector we've been watching really closely is housing and we got some color on that front from some of these bank earnings in terms of where mortgage rates are right now. Home lending originations, at least with Wells Fargo, down nearly 60% year over year at JPM, that was down 71%. How much worse do you think things are going to get on that front? Well, they've lost all the stupid stuff. You know, the people buying four houses and flipping. You know, all that stuff is going away, all the fluff. And I think Stuart Miller, the head of Lenard, said at best two weeks ago on his earnings call, he says, we're going to manage our way through this difficulty in the next 12 months so that we come out on the other side with dramatically larger market share. We own the largest home builders because over the next 10 years, there's 92 million millennials. They were seven years slower than other age groups getting started buying houses and they will buy houses the next 10 years. And that happened in the 70s with high inflation rates. We had the biggest home building boom of the last 60 years in the 1970s with sky high mortgage rates. So that sounds like you're not so cynical moving forward. I mean, you're not a cynical some others who've said that, you know, these higher rates are really going to accelerate some of the losses we've seen on that side. No, you're talking to a guy whose first mortgage was 13.5% in 1983 on a state buydown. We were anxious to get it because we had one child one on the way. That's why we like you, Bill. Some context there, right? Historical context, important. Let's talk a bit strategy right now. I'm you sort of alluded to some of these names that you think would be good buys right now. Obviously, you know, sort of the traditional thinking has been that with these big banks, especially, they could benefit on the back of higher rates. There's the macro story sort of weighing on that as well. Which one of these names you think is best positioned to write out some of the choppiness we're likely to see over the next several months? Well, we have owned Bank American JP Morgan since 2012. And if you think people are skeptical of them now, you should go back and relive 2012, right? I mean, people didn't know whether they were going to survive. Remember, we had the C-Car meetings and the Fed would give them a hard time and wouldn't let them buy back their stock when it was cheap and wouldn't let them pay dividends and so forth. So this tribulation compared to that tribulation is peanuts for these folks. They're way overcapitalized. They're super strong. So we like Bank American JP Morgan. They are the largest deposit banks to millennials because they have the best mobile banking. And now they're going to get to have them as people that borrow money for necessity purposes. And by the way, that's a powerfully positive influence in the economy. And then we love American Express because they're the favorite credit card of the millennials who, despite the fact they're getting married in record numbers this year and going to have kids in the next five years, we'll still drag those little kids all over the place on exotic travel with the travel points they get on our American Express card. And I hear you chuckling, you're probably a customer. Yeah. Just laughing at the context here. Well, we love to have you on the show.",https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GRIayi6dbGM,17,2022-10-14 15:09:54
3311," the travel points they get on our American Express Card. And I hear you chuckling, you're probably a customer. Yeah. Just laughing up the context here. Well, we love to have you on the show. Really appreciate your time today. Bill Smith, Speed Capital Management, CIO. Thank you. Well, retail sales remaining unchanged in September or missing, economists forecast of a 0.2% rise. To help break down the report, let's bring in Yahoo finances in as fray, a big data week for you this week. Retail sales, what do we see? Yeah, that's right. And so keep in mind that retail sales also, they are not adjusted for inflation. And remember that retail sales include many categories, like groceries, like vehicles, furniture, et cetera. But two interesting points from this report. First of all, excluding gasoline and auto, is retail sales grew by 0.3%. And also what's interesting is the weakness in some of these categories that we've seen. So electronics fell, furniture fell, also auto sales, those came in weak. So these are some big ticket items. And you could say that, for example, with electronics, well, a lot of people during the pandemic were buying electronics. And now they're using services more and going out more so they don't need more of that. Furniture, you know that the housing market is slowing down. So you would see a slow down in furniture sales as well. And auto sales, well, auto prices have gone up too much. And so perhaps this means the consumer is really pulling back. Another big story we're watching, and not in the US across the pond here, UK Chancellor, Acquasi Quarting, ousted by Prime Minister Liz Trot, just 38 days after taking that role. Obviously, this on the back of that initial proposal on the tax cuts, which I think by all accounts was quite disastrous in the rollout. But what can you more can you tell us about the market reaction that we've seen on the back of this? Yeah, so we did see the pound falling. We saw a bond yields being volatile. A 30-year yield of 11 basis points, the 10-year yield of six basis points, Prime Minister Trot saying that the U-turn for this corporate tax cut basically, that this is going to reassure the markets. Because we know what the markets did when these tax cuts were announced. And she said parts of the mini budget just went too far. This is to reassure those markets that were going well. I think it's also to save the bond market as well. Yeah, put one too far, kind of putting it mildly, when you look at the market reaction on the back of that. That's certainly a story we'll continue to watch. And that's thanks for that. Thank you. Well, deal making in the grocery space, leading to some big stock moves, shares of Kroger and Albertsons. Both moving to the downside here. After the second largest grocery agreed to buy Albertsons, the deal is valued at $24.6 billion with Kroger buying shares of Albertsons at a 16% premium to its closing price Thursday. The boards of both firms unanimously signed off on the deal. It still needs approval from regulators. And you see both of those stocks taking a hit today. Kroger down about 3.5% Albertsons down nearly 7%. Coming up, bearing the lead, oil supply concerns dominate after OPEC plus cuts. But isn't it demand we should be watching a signs point to recessionary cliff edge? We talk energy on the other side. Thanks for revisiting this. I'll see you later all the way. Dear fellows, Mr. Thompson and Len Luckler.",https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GRIayi6dbGM,18,2022-10-14 15:14:38
3312," way. Well, the follow-up from the OPEC Plus decision to slash supplies continues. President Biden has suggested a review of the relationship with Saudi Arabia, which is, of course, a long-time Washington ally. The move by the oil-producing group stands in direct conflict with Biden's goal of ensuring lower prices for U.S. consumers. And this coming just weeks before the all-important midterms here. The U.S. says the Saudis presented no market basis for the cuts. Let's get to Regina May, or KPMG's global head of clients and markets. Regina gets a talk to you today. Let's start on that comment that we got from President Biden saying there's no market basis. And yet, you look at where oil is trading right now. We're right back below the levels we were at when that OPEC Plus cuts decision was first made. So, I mean, what does that suggest in terms of, you know, where the real fears are at the end of the day? Is it about a potential global recession and is significant pull back in demand? Well, I think the market reacted to the headline of the secure of 2 million barrel per day cut. When the reality is that OPEC is producing 3.5 million barrels per day lower than their stated production photos. So, I saw it more as just a realization, an acknowledgement of what's actually happening on the ground. The one thing that was important was the Saudis are starting to signal that they don't have spare capacity. But I think we understand more of the supply side constraints because that's what we've been living with for the last few months and some of the peak pricing that we saw over the summer. Now the price is coming back down to earth because I think, as you mentioned before the break, the demand side pressures are where there's a lot of uncertainty. China still not come back fully online. There's lots of concerns now about what COVID could do over the winter. You know, we're worried about a recession. So, I think that's brought the price back down. But we saw a nearly 20% jump in WTI just in the last two weeks. And I think it's coming back down to a more realistic price projection. Specifically in the supply side, we had so many oil analysts come out on the back of that OPEC Plus decision saying essentially look despite this announcement of 2 million barrels caught a day. At the end of the day, most of these OPEC members do not meet their quotas. I mean, what's the realistic number we should be looking at in terms of how much comes offline as a result of this decision? Well, I think that the real number that I was looking at is about 800,000 barrels per day because I just looked at what the reductions were from Saudi, Kuwait and the UAE. So those are parts of the world that do have spare capacity. And when I visit the region, you know, you hear different things from the different executives. So that was what the real cut was. But the EIA is forecasting that the US is going to exceed 2019 production into 2023. So I think the world is starting to get a little more comfortable that we have been looking up at.",https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GRIayi6dbGM,19,2022-10-14 15:18:57
3313," US is going to exceed 2019 production into 2023. So I think the world is starting to get a little more comfortable that we have the supply that we need, especially if we face into a reduced demand environment. If we see a really severe winter, and we don't see the recession that folks are expecting, and we see demand continuous spike, then we're going to see a lot of upward pressure on price. Let's talk about where those prices could move. I mean, you pointed to some demand concerns there, especially coming out of China. We're all watching to see what kind of messaging comes from this party Congress over in China from President Xi specifically on the economy. But you said we're still talking about a tight supply here. So when you say upward pressure, how much more upside do you see going into the winter? I'm worried a lot about a potential big spike in the winter. If we have a really, really cold winter, that's where I think we could see prices back close to 100, maybe even in triple digits. But I'm hedging against that. I really think the prices are closer to where they should be. I've said WTI and Brent should be in the 80s. That was what OPEC plus was trying to do. It's sure the price back up because they saw the market potentially overreacting to some of the demand concerns and not paying enough attention to the supply. So I think that's in part what drove their 2 million barrel per day headline cut, which is just making transparent to the rest of the world what was actually going on. And Regina, I know you can't speak to specifically sort of the political environment and all of this, but it does feel like there are increasing lines being drawn geopolitically when you think about what happened between Saudi Arabia, Slash, Russia, OPEC and the U.S. You've got the Western European countries and pushing their sanctions as well against Russia. I mean, at the end of all of this, wherever that end may be, how's the oil market going to look? I mean, how fragmented do you think things could get? Well, I think, Eki, the same that has always surprised me is there's four fundamentals of how countries and markets need to manage energy. And that first and foremost is energy security. Second is affordability. Third is reliability. Fourth is sustainability. No doubt the climate agenda is huge and we are facing a climate crisis. But the world was focusing more on number four. There's almost like a maslow's hierarchy of needs. If you don't have the energy that you need and it's not affordable and it's not reliable, then governments and policymakers need to get very heavily involved. And so that's how I would characterize what we're seeing today is the realization your previous gifts talked about the 70s. I'm a child of the 70s. I remember long gas lines during oil embargoes. We're relearning the lessons from decades ago and hopefully we do a better time this time around. Yeah, a lot of people kind of drawing parallels looking back in time in history right now with so much going on. KPMG's global head of clients and markets, Regina Mayer, good to have you on today. Well, coming up, the final frontier, Elon Musk, Warren SpaceX can't help Ukraine indefinitely. So the question here, could the crucial Starling terminals be pulled? And if they stay, who pays? We'll get into that on the other side.",https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GRIayi6dbGM,20,2022-10-14 15:22:51
3314,"... We'll space access saying it can no longer pay for critical satellite services in Ukraine. And it's asking the Pentagon to pick up the tab. And according to reporting at a CNN, Musk appears to have confirmed the report in a tweet, writing in part, strange that nothing was leaked about our competitors and space launching communications, Lockheed and Boeing, who get over $60 billion. Now, the same CNN report, reference SpaceX figure shared with the Pentagon. Take a look at this. 85 percent of the 20,000 starlinked terminals in Ukraine were paid for or partially paid for by countries like the U.S. Poland or other entities. Who also paid for about 30 percent of the internet connectivity. Now, SpaceX says that costs about $4,500 each month per unit for the most advanced service. Musk has said there are around 25,000 terminals in Ukraine to break it all down. Let's bring in Praz, Supermanian, and Praz. The reason we're talking about this, some context here, is that earlier this year Elon West started seem to apply that we're doing this good thing where we're going to be donating starlink that this was all being paid for by SpaceX. That's not necessarily the case in this story out of CNN, really does point to the cost of operating it, who's footing the bill, and what this means ultimately for the future, because Ukraine has really come to rely on this for connectivity. From what I understand, it's a huge part of their operations against Russia. They need this connectivity. You know, when we first heard about Musk donating the starlink service, we thought this was free. They were actually out of their pocket, sending them the actual terminals and paying for the service, but it turns out, it looks at 85% is inputted by the U.S. and actually Poland paying a lot for this terminal. So a little surprise there. Also the odd timing, it's like Musk also kind of noting the fact that after he put out that supposed controversial peace plan, and then the Ukrainians were... Queen Russia and Ukraine, which seemed to suggest that he was more in line with the Russian thinking. Exactly, not so much the Ukrainian side, and then Ukrainians were upset about that, and then all of a sudden, oh, by the way, you get a pay for this, according to the CNN obtained report letter that they sent to the defense department. So like I said, odd timing here. It's sort of a strange sort of... I really don't understand why Musk would even put out this sort of image that he's actually donating this stuff in actual... Actually, actually he was not. It's not a cheap service. SpaceX is not a charitable organization. It is a company that's trying to be profitable, and it's cost a lot of money, so I understand that part. SpaceX worth 120 billion valuation. Musk worth 200 billion personally. So I think it's hard for people to sort of kind of round out the, hey, we're going to... You need to get paid for the service when the actually you guys are actually worth. I've got a lot of money. Musk obviously never wanted to stay silent, especially on...",https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GRIayi6dbGM,21,2022-10-14 15:27:35
3315," I think it's hard people to sort of kind of round out the hey we're going to you need to get pay for for the source when you actually you guys are actually worth a lot of money. And Elon Musk obviously never wanted to stay silent, especially on Twitter when he's been getting a lot of pushbacks since that report came out from CNN last night. What have we even hearing from him today? Well, we saw today, you know, I mentioned that from late last night about how, hey, the LEO connectivity is a very expensive business, it's not cheap, we are digging out of our own pockets to do this, so don't expect us to pay for this going forward. We're talking about 120 length of the entity of the year and then I think 300 to 400 million through next year. So it is not cheap, you know, SpaceX is trying to get their model off the ground, so I totally understand that. So that's what he's saying right now, but I think you sort of caught in the cross here, is it of do you support Russia or Ukraine and why are you actually kind of debating this right now? The grand scheme of things, now that we kind of know that the numbers in terms of, you know, what the connectivity, the service itself is going to cost, how significant is startling to the future of SpaceX? Because this is something that, you know, it's been getting a lot of attention because this is a real use case in Ukraine. They have to your point really come to rely on this service, but in the grand scheme of things for SpaceX, how big is startling? I believe it's, it was supposed to be a big component of their profitability, it's a service that they can offer, not only is it 4,500 for that high end terminal service, but also it's 50 bucks a month for families and other people to use that in places like India, for instance, like they want to deploy that there. It is a big part of their sort of mission to kind of not only just send elevators into space with rockets, but also to sort of connect everyone through the world through global satellite internet. So it is a big part of that story and a big part of that profitably component, but I guess right now it's still not fully profitable. Okay, something to watch there. According to Elon Musk. According to Elon Musk, always according to Elon Musk. Elon Musk, thanks so much for that. We're continuing the never ending saga between Elon Musk and Twitter. Court documents and SEAL Thursday revealed that Elon Musk is under federal investigation for actions connected with his $44 billion dollar Twitter acquisition. Let's bring in Yahoo Finance is Alexis Keenan Alexis. What how many days ago were we talking about how well the deal is probably going to get closed and here we are talking about another investigation. What is this specifically? Well, that's a big part of the story of all the around. Okay, so it could be investigations plural because of the way that this filing is phrase. Now why are we learning about this? It's because Twitter is asking for the judge in the Delaware case, the dispute over the acquisition that's currently stayed, the trial is stayed, not the case going forward. And asking for the judges help saying we want must to turn over the communications that his attorneys had with federal authorities. The way they specifically phrase it is they want those communications concerning Twitter and the Twitter transaction. Twitter wrote to the judge saying that Musk, the way they phrase it is presently under investigation by federal authorities for his conduct concerning the acquisition. They want to say that they want those documents specifically because they bear upon key issues in the litigation. Now there's no further details about what exactly that conduct is. Twitter says Musk's attorneys, Quinn Immanuel, had turned over about 1700 documents that they said were privileged and therefore could not be read by the other side. But Twitter is saying no among those documents are these draft communications from his lawyers with these authorities. One being a May 13th email sent to the SEC, a draft to the SEC rather, they actually dispute why there's not the final communications with pertaining to these documents. The second one is a slide presentation for the FTC. So they want those documents. They want to dig a little bit further into those investigations. Now we do know though that Musk was suspected to be under investigation because of the way he handled the acquisition altogether. We know that back when he was acquiring the Twitter stock and when he passed that 5% threshold going to 9% stake in Twitter, we know that he filed late with the SEC. And we also know that he filed the wrong document which was for passive investors instead of active investors. So at a minimum we should expect that the SEC would want to look into this. Really quickly, what does this mean in terms of the timeline for a potential acquisition? Getting completed? How is this going to complicate the process? Yeah, you know, I don't think necessarily that this particular issue will push out if there is going to be a trial and you further. The parties have had contentious issues every step.",https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GRIayi6dbGM,22,2022-10-14 15:32:00
3316," early that this particular issue will push out if there is going to be a trial at any further. The parties have had contentious issues every step along the way. And certainly these discovery fights are to be expected. Absolutely, each party is going to fight hard to make sure that they don't have to turn over to the other side something that they don't want to see. Yeah, good point. There are no real surprises at this point after all the back and floor. Thanks so much for that. Well, coming up, setting the tone, JP Morgan beats the street. It's the higher rates. But Jamie Diamond wants to get points to economic headwinds. Who's in the eye of the storm? I'm going to look to some big reports on deck next. Well. In a group of men who have never published yet, you can never really say the truth. Earlier on Yaku Finance, San Francisco Fed President Mary Daly joined our very own Jennifer Schomburger to talk about the latest CPI print and the Fed's policy. Take a listen to what you have to say. We will have to be data dependent about what actual rate hikes we take because we have domestic conditions, but we're also working in a global economy. And there's a lot of uncertainty and risks out there. We have to think about those in the context of exactly what we do. But there's literally no doubt in my mind that we need to put more restrictive stance of policy in the economy to further get demand and supply imbalance so that consumers don't have to worry about such high inflation month after month. We're joining us now to talk about the impact of the Fed's policy. We've got Tom Hanlon, senior investment strategist at US Bank, wealth management. Tom gets to talk to you today. Let's pick up on that point that Mary Daly just made. She insists the Fed is still data dependent. The data suggests in her words that restrictive policy needs to continue. Is that how you see it? Oh, sure. And thanks for having us on. Yeah, the CPI print yesterday. So core inflation, excluding volatile food and energy at a 40-year high. And then today you have the consumer sentiment indicator from University of Michigan.",https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GRIayi6dbGM,23,2022-10-14 15:36:09
3317," CPI print yesterday, so core inflation, excluding volatile food and energy at a 40-year high. And then today, you have the consumer sentiment indicator from University of Michigan, where consumers are asked where they see inflation, and that actually ticked higher, which is not the direction the Fed wants to see. So I think that the member, Daley, is representing that the data continues to suggest that the Fed needs to continue to tighten to bring inflation back under control. The data may suggest that the Fed needs to continue tightening control. But, Daley also in that interview said that this concern about that tightening, and how aggressively they're moving leading to a recession, a hard landing, so to speak, doesn't necessarily jive with what she has heard personally. So she talks about going out on the road, speaking to business owners who aren't necessarily asking about a recession, saying, yeah, they're concerned about higher prices, but we're worried about hiring. We're worried about other issues. I mean, what do you make of this disconnect that we continue to hear between this fear of, you know, those like Jamie Dimon saying there was a big recession on the horizon, and then others were saying, well, that's not really the prime concern, though. Yeah, I think it's just a difference in where we are today, to where we may be in 2023. So certainly, if you look at employment, that doesn't suggest that we're in a recession right now. There's still 10 million job openings and unemployment remains low. And the consumer remains in pretty healthy shape, and we still have a lot of savings that accrue during the pandemic that they're able to drop on as we get toward the holiday season. I think that the question is, at what point do federal reserve rate hikes start to eat into both consumer spending and business sentiment in the form of lowering investment in future gains? So, I think the question is, what does this look like not necessarily today, but in 2023? And there is the potential that the Fed continues to tighten into this slowing economy, and potentially do end up in that type of recession. It's not necessarily our base case today. I think that's what you're seeing in terms of capital market volatility, which is how far will the Fed have to tighten to get inflation under control? What rate will that do to consumer spending and business investment? Let's talk more about the volatility. I mean, yesterday we saw what was an incredible turnaround, rally, a huge swing, and today we saw, by the way, yesterday coming on the back of what was a stronger than expected CPI print. Here we are today talking about a dip in the other direction again. What do you think is behind this choppin-as? Yeah, so the initial market reaction on the CPI print yesterday was down, and you reach levels that technicians or other market observers suggest that maybe reached this oversold condition where program buying started to kick in, and then as the stocks market started to recover, perhaps you started to get more people participating at upside. It was a pretty high volume day yesterday, so that suggests that there was a lot of participation in it. But again, when you go back to the fundamentals, when you go back to what's going on in the economy, and you go back to the fears about inflation and what the Fed needs to do, today was just one more data point that let you know that inflation isn't yet anywhere near the Fed's target rate, and the Fed's going to have to continue to tighten policy. Is this kind of chopping-as continuing? You think moving forward here as we look ahead to the next FOMC meeting? Yeah, I mean, we think it sets up as a pretty news heavy year as we call it here in the fourth quarter, so you've got two Federal Reserve meetings, one in November, one in December. You've got the midterm elections and setting up in the first couple of weeks in November, and then you have, you know, still has more CPI prints and other economic releases, and we're just getting started on third quarter earnings and the corporations. This will be a key focal area as well, is what is corporate America seeing in terms of the outlook? Is it as visible as they thought it was in previous quarters, or things starting to get cloudy in terms of the four looking outlook? So these are the things that are going to play into now until the rest of the year. We think that sets up for a fairly choppy capital market and equity market going forward. Tom Hanlon, US Bank wealth management senior investment strategist, appreciate your time today. And shift your attention to the labor market and UF employers appear to be thinking twice before laying off workers. At least that's what our chart of the day suggests. This data coming from Axio Siding Fred shows a historically low level of layoffs and unemployment in the economy as things stand. All this has to be a persistent fear that we are inching toward a sharp slowdown. The spike you see is",https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GRIayi6dbGM,24,2022-10-14 15:40:10
3318," of layoffs and unemployment in the economy as things stand, all this amid persistent fears that we are inching toward a sharp slowdown. The spike you see is, of course, down to the mass layoffs during the peak of COVID in 2020, which may serve as a warning not to pull the trigger too soon this time around. We're not saying it's down to so-called labor hoarding, but it's certainly one of those theories that have been making the rounds for some time. Coming up, attention turns to Beijing. China's National Congress begins on Sunday, a mammoth gathering that will solidify the leadership of President Xi Jinping. But will it trouble the economy and zero COVID policy overshadow the event? That's our next. Let's meet soon! It is time now for this week's bi-denomics. The last CPI report before the midterms was grim reading for Americans and the administration after another stubbornly high number, President responded by saying inflation would be worse under Republicans. Morning consults, latest polling track or tell. The story illustrating the president's popularity or lack of it among voters in 45 out of 50 states. Let's bring in Yahoo Finance's Rick Newman. Rick we're so close to the midterms here. How much are we to make of another data set that points to inflation remaining high, the impact of that on the elections? Well, it's a big data set in a really important one. There was some hope among Democrats toward the end of the summer. Gas prices were coming down by a lot. President Biden's approval rating was ticking up. Some surveys showed that voters were feeling better about Democratic control of Congress. There was some hope that maybe Democrats actually would be able to buck the usual trend of the midterm elections and hold on to both countries.",https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GRIayi6dbGM,25,2022-10-14 15:44:24
3319," better about Democratic control of Congress. And so there was some hope that maybe Democrats actually would be able to buck the usual trend of the midterm elections and hold on to both houses of Congress. But for that to happen, they needed basically everything to go their way during the last few weeks leading up to the midterm elections on November 8th. And everything is not going their way. I mean, what Democrats really needed was gas prices to continue going down, but also consistent improvements in inflation. And we just haven't had that. So inflation peaked at 9% over the summer. And there was some hope that by now we would be below 8%, and maybe even below 7%, but we're not. We're down to just 8.2%. So inflation is very stubborn. And so far, all the federal reserve interest rates heights, interest rate heights that have been going on since March, have not had any notable impact on inflation. Now, they will have an impact on inflation, but there's a lag. And this timing is just not going to help Democrats. So I'm seeing a lot of political analysts who are saying this latest inflation number from September, basically, ISIS it for Republicans, they seem very likely to regain at least one house of Congress in the midterms. And that means they'll be able to block Biden's legislative agenda. We'll find out just a few weeks out from that all important midterm election. Rick Newman, thanks so much for that. GM. We'll say with big political events, China is set to kick off a historic National Party Congress this weekend. The country's struggling economy should have be a key focus in the face of President Xi Jinping's ongoing zero-COVID policy. Data today shows consumer prices in September rose. At the fastest pace, they've gone since April of 2020. It's certainly hard to overstate the importance of the event. The National Congress happens only once every five years. It outlines the broad priorities for the nation. More importantly, there are suggestions. The overall mission statement will pivot from a long-held focus on economic growth to security. The future structure of the Rolling Party will also be determined. China watchers eagerly awaiting details on the next premiere. He's traditionally part of the all-important standing committee or a Politburo and the nation's second most powerful man the big takeaway president Xi is poised to win a third term, making him the most powerful leader of China since Mao Zedong. Let's dive deeper into this big kickoff with Nargiza Saljanova, she's a Rodeum Group China Practice Director. Nargiza, you have put out this very interesting annual report the China Pathfinder that really takes a closer look at where China's economy is right now. All eyes are going to be on that third term or at least the president securing that third term. What is that likely to mean for in terms of how the economic policy shifts for China? That's right, as you said. The 20th party Congress means everyone is trying to really define what is the future of China's economic policy. And what the China Pathfinder project which we have worked on in partnership with the Atlantic Council shows us is that China's capture of one has really stagnated. Not enough to undo some good progress that they've done since their WTO accession, but in areas from open-est investment to market competitiveness, we see a pause or in some cases a rollback. And as we know, the role of the state has been surging in many regards in every part of the economy and society we have seen parties intrusion, increasing which really sends a warning and a caution to foreign investors, to domestic companies, what to expect coming out of the party's Congress is on everyone's mind. So it's where it's sort of looking back to where we were a year ago. China was growing at an annualized rate of 8%. Now you've got the World Bank forecasting 2.8% growth, many major banks have come out and set 3% in 2022. Well, what is the pivot that's likely to come out of this party Congress, or is there one given that number one, the president has doubled down on the zero-COVID policy? But number two, I mean, we have really started to see a reckoning in the real estate sector. And the real estate sector is, I think, the core issue for us to focus on, right? Delivering up to 25% of China's economic growth. And there's no...",https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GRIayi6dbGM,26,2022-10-14 15:48:50
3320," And the real estate sector is, I think the core issue for us to focus on, right? Delivering, you know, up to 25% of China's economic growth. And there's no substitution for that. The government has not been really able to set up new drivers of growth, which will take China forward and able to deliver the same kind of growth that China and observers have been able to enjoy. There has not been a proper resetting, even with all the downgrades, and we've seen them coming down and down and down through the entire year. A couple of important things to watch out for, right? And this is going to be true for both China's domestic audience and external audiences. What happens with zero COVID? Nothing has disrupted China's economy as much to going to the core of China's society as zero COVID policy. And it's really unlikely that there's going to be a real kind of aggressive shift unveiled at the party congress. That's really the time to use a reset and retrench, but looking forward, what happens? It's going to be a much better situation for China if there is a stronger signal that the policy is going to be stopped, rather than kind of a fudging and slurring its way through a kind of gradually declining to that. Another really important consideration to watch out for is the new crop of leaders being appointed into key positions. Every appointment is going to give you the reliance of whether it points to further consolidation of power by Xi Jinping and a further retrenchment, or will technocrats be at the reins once again and be allowed to put in place more policies which stabilize China's growth, which put it on a more sustainable path and push reform forward. Another really important thing to pay attention to is what happens with a greater unveiling or a greater emphasis on what common prosperity actually means. As we know, that's an important policy that Xi Jinping has put his personal and premature on. And Chinese officials have been at teens to say that there is not going to be a massive redistribution, but it isn't really clear how common prosperity is going to play out. Norgisa, I'm thinking back to just how much the message from the top down has shifted over the last five years since this last party Congress. We were talking about President Xi talking about quality growth, not growth at all costs, also talking about raining in debt. It feels like he sort of put that aside. He's certainly a bigger focus, at least that's the expectation moving into this. You think President Xi is willing to put security front and center at the expense of a slowdown in the economy because that has sort of moved hand in hand in terms of foreign direct, foreign investments coming in. Company saying, rethinking their presence in China. Where's the priority here, you think, for the next five years? So we have to be careful here, not to over general rise. Every all governments and all politicians, Chinese officials are able to have multiple levers that they pull depending on the need and depending on their core priorities. But it is certainly true that political considerations and in any case of security considerations have been overriding a lot of the economic priorities in recent years. We've seen this manifest that in China's relationship with some of its external partners, for example, the way that the comprehensive agreement on investment with the EU was really undermined by the decisions of Chinese policy makers and their emphasis on policies which the EU officials just found intolerable. What does this ultimately mean for companies that are still doing business in China? Investors, I mean, you point out in your report itself, there's increasing questions about whether China is investible. Right. I think, regardless of what happens at the 20th Party Congress, China faces a prolonged period of week or a growth. And this is because even if Chinese officials really decide to sort of go all in on a new aggressive reform package, tangible structural changes will take years to be realized.

3323," sites. I just want to get your reaction to the headline figure and the fact that we've seen still some of the persistence in inflation nudging higher and showing up in prices. No doubt about it. So I think what really scared the markets here was the strength in the core inflation readings in particular. You mentioned we have rents going up pretty rapidly. This was the largest month over month rise in rental inflation since June 1990. And we know that the Fed is very focused on the slow moving stickier parts of the inflation process. A lot of things tied to the service economy which has been rebounding. And we have to keep in mind that a lot of these numbers tend to follow the business cycle with long and varied lags. So in particular sticky core inflation measures like rents will tend to follow the economy by five quarters. That means the strength here could simply be a reflection of how the economy was doing 15 months ago. And that's really what has these market prices in a bit of a squeeze. And that's that the Fed is reacting very aggressively to backward looking information. A lot of the forward looking measures of inflation have really come down sharply. But the Fed is overlooking that and they are hitching their policy moves to deeply lagging indicators. And the economy is caught in the cross crosshairs of that. So Mike, what are those forward looking indicators that you are taking your cues from when you're saying maybe we're seeing a little bit of positivity coming on the inflation front. And then what you're saying implies that the Fed is indeed making a mistake here. Yeah, I think they are on the cusp of going too far and way too fast. I think there was some justification for them moving aggressively when the rate hikes started. But to persist now with these 75 base point rate increases with an inverted yield curve and with residential real estate hitting the skids, I think is a mistaken strategy. But in particular, the sensitive forward looking price level indicators that are moving lower in a dramatic fashion commodity prices in a big bear market, they ran up dramatically for two years on the front edge of the inflation process and the Fed ignored it. The dollar has soared in a historic fashion. Bond market inflation expectations where investors are putting their money on the line have come down dramatically. And let's not forget how this whole inflation process started with the huge explosion of the Fed's balance sheet of big rise and broad money. A lot of expansionary fiscal policy. All of that is going into reverse gear now. And I mentioned residential real estate a moment ago. That's where the the V shaped boom really started in terms of the whole recovery process. So everything that has been on the front edge of the boom in the inflation process has rolled over very sharply. And yet the Fed is acting in an aggressive manner looking in their rear view mirror. Well, then the Michael, how do we get inflation down? And this is the Fed's gig. Their sole purpose is there is to among many other things full employment and get inflation under control. If they're not out there being aggressive, who does that fall to? Do we have to look at the bottom administration to finally do something? Yeah, it's this is the Fed's responsibility in terms of inflation. At least the portion of inflation that's due to strong demand and by our calculations that's most of it. But the Fed also needs to be forward looking. If they were forward looking, they wouldn't have put the monetary stimulus on as long as they did. They would have been sooner to tighten policy. And there would be less of a risk of overshooting on the other side, which is exactly where we are now. So I would seem to me that they could improve policy by looking forward, by incorporating some of those forward looking indicators into their process. So they should really be slowing down the pace of hikes now, not reacting in a belated panicky fashion to deeply lagging indicators. That is a prescription for an accident. At the same time, you know, you.",https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GRIayi6dbGM,30,2022-10-14 16:06:00
3324," laid-it panicky fashion to deeply lagging indicators. That is a prescription for an accident. At the same time, Mike, you know, you, one has to sympathize sort of, right? Like, you see this alarming number, right? And there is the perception that the Fed has to act on this. Of course, you're not the only one with this message. We are seeing now and hearing from an increasing number of economists who are saying something similar to what you are saying. What we convinced the Fed to listen? In the past, we have sometimes seen dramatic things happen in the market that have then convinced the Fed to act, perhaps belatedly. How would that kind of a scenario play out? Well, I mean, I think the setup here is we're going to need to see some softness in these lagging indicators, or at least some of the coincident information. Pay rolls were very strong in September. So that didn't do the trick. This core inflation data has been strong. And so we're really going to need to see the momentum there break to the downside. I think that is coming. I'll give you another forward indicator that was peaking six months ago. The ISM prices paid index. Typically, there's about a six month lag in terms of when that's showing up in the inflation meetings. And so if you go back to six months ago, we are basically at the high for 2022 there. And now we're off very sharply. So over the next three to six months, I think we're going to get some better news on inflation that may not be soon enough to save the economy from a recession with the Fed likely to keep going pretty aggressively here. And then in the near term, and then the discussion right before I came on was about, you know, these peak policy rate expectations now are pushing towards 5%. That's well above the rates across the whole treasury yield curve, which, you know, to me means if that happens, we will be going into a recession. Inflation will fall very sharply in a recession. And then the Fed will be backtracking and cutting rates in an embarrassing fashion. Mike, for consumers who wake up this morning and see the headline number and then also see the market reaction, there's also the reality of how they think about their own spending. Does this change any household spending even knowing just how much we're paying for everything from groceries to some of the other necessities and even some of the discretionary items that we still continue to buy? No doubt about it. I mean, the labor market has been very strong in resilience. So that's sort of been the saving grace. But these, you know, this inflationary backdrop has certainly been an irritant to households. And we can see that in a lot of weak confidence data. So far, that hasn't been enough to stop the economy in its tracks, but we have the Fed tightening very aggressively. And that will hit the economy with a lag. Over the last seven months, policy rates have gone up 300 basis points. And in real terms, if we use inflation expectations, which have been falling since March, a 400 basis point rise, that is the most rapid rise in short-term interest rates that we've seen since the early 1980s going into a very deep and very long recession. So I think households, unfortunately, here are also caught in the Fed's crosshairs because the tightening is likely to keep going until it kills the labor market. Though kill inflation, but they're going to end up killing the labor market with it. Oh, all right. So brewing here, Mike, thank you so much for being here with your analysis.

3325, you you it is Thursday October 13th here in New York City on Brad Smith with Julie Hyman and Brian Saasie an ugly day on Wall Street after another red hot inflation report CPI month of a month coming in at four tens of a percent in a move higher the economic data keeps on coming jewels over to you for some housing news as well right now 6.92 percent Brad that is now the average 30 year fixed rate mortgage that data just coming out to us from Freddie Mac 6.92 percent by the way is the highest going back to April of 2002 all of this of course goes back to the Fed raising interest rates and also has already had ripple effects throughout the housing market putting pressure on pricing putting pressure on demand and affordability we've been watching these mortgage numbers very very closely because obviously they have really ratchet it up the monthly cost for people who are taking out a 30 year mortgage in order to buy a house so we've got that number we've got that CPI number all of it pointing to continued inflation at least for now but now are joined by someone who has has her eyes on potential deflation that of course is Kathy Wood our our Invest Founder and CEO and you recently wrote an open letter to the Fed where you warned about deflation we talked to Michael Darda of MKM at the top of the show where he said the Fed is making the mistake of looking at backward looking indicators what should the Fed be looking at Kathy when it's trying to really assess what is happening with inflation sure hi Julie and Brian well if you look at what's happening in the pipeline what you're seeing in terms of commodity prices are some very serious declines both from their peaks and year over year now so that is sort of we would say that's upstream inflation that is heading towards the PPI and then ultimately the CPI so we've got gold prices and in fact I looked at them yesterday I had thought that the last two years gold had been trading within the 1700 to nearly 21 hundred dollar range and that's true it has and it has broken down this is a really good leading indicator of inflation what caught my surprise yesterday was looking at where gold was in 2011 it was roughly this level so you can say from since 2011 more than 10 years we haven't had a big burst in a big breakout in the gold price and and that is informing our decision here gold is a leading indicator of inflation and it has not broken out it is breaking down and then the second thing that we're looking at is the inventory glut around the world and especially in the United States it looks like some of the best supply chain managed companies in the world have over over ordered they ignored their automated enterprise resource planning systems so ERP systems and double ordered triple ordered so that Nike for example its sales were up only three and a half percent globally last quarter and yet it's inventory is up 44,https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GRIayi6dbGM,32,2022-10-14 16:14:22
3326," Nike, for example, its sales were up only 3.5% globally last quarter. Yet its inventories were up 44%. In the United States, they were up 68%. If you look at it in transit, they're up 85%. That's just one indication. We're seeing lots of inventory overhangs. Even online sales are suffering. Amazon just had its second prime day. And it showed no increase, which is really from a year over year, which is telling us that either units are down or prices are down. So I think the CPI that we got today is a lagging indicator. It always is a lagging indicator. And we're seeing a lot of prices in the pipeline that are falling. So, Kathy, let's talk about what this means for the Fed. And your open letter to the Fed, where you urge them to consider some of what you're talking about right now. The market after today's data is now more fully pricing and not just a 75 basis point increase at this upcoming meeting. But at the one after that as well, do you think the Fed should be done? Do you think they should even raise 75 basis points at this upcoming meeting? Or do you think they should stop here and give some time for their increases to make their way through the economy? Yes. As we're thinking about this question, we compare what Chairman Powell is doing to what Chairman Volcker did in the late 70s, early 80s, when he was fighting an inflation problem that had been building for 15 years, Vietnam War, Great Society, Closing the Gold Window. That was a real inflation problem that built up over 15 years. This inflation problem has been 12 to 15 months by the time the Fed started addressing it. And we think it's much more a function of supply chain imbalances, caused by COVID, and then again, by Russia's invasion of Ukraine. These are very, very different circumstances. So what the Fed has done this time around is it has increased interest rates. If they go another 75 basis points, which is very likely on November 2nd, they will have increased interest rates from 0.25 to 4%. And that's a 16 fold increase. What did Volcker, in the early 80s, he took interest rates from 10 to 20%. That's a two fold increase after consumers and businesses had gotten used to dealing with inflation and working around it over 15 years. This is a real shock to the system. And I do believe we will see the ramifications. In many ways, we're seeing housing shutting down. And I think we're going to see a lot of other activities shutting down as well. We believe we're in a recession. And we believe this recession now will be sustained. And if we see an increase in GDP, it's probably because either inventories are continuing to increase or imports are coming down as companies try to unwind their inventories. Kathy, so do you see a severe recession? And then how long do you think this bear market will continue? Well, what's interesting, I think many people are coming around to the idea that we're in a recession or we're going into a recession. The first two quarters with real GDP growth negative to us means we're in a recession. And now that many people are worried and are beginning to see recession for us far as the eye can see, we are looking at this recession a little bit differently. We think it's going to be a function of this massive inventory overhang and that it's going to be a serious inventory correction. But it's not going to be anything like we saw in 0809. That was a systemic financial problem caused by the mortgage and financial meltdown. We don't think this is the same thing. So now that many economists are starting to agree with us that we're in a recession or going into a recession, we feel that they might become a little bit too alarmist. If this is just an inventory.",https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GRIayi6dbGM,33,2022-10-14 16:19:01
3327," or in a recession or going into a recession, we feel that they might become a little bit to alarmist if this is just an inventory recession. And I think the Fed will have a lot to do with whether or not it is. This is a shock, though, to the system. And this idea that we have an inventory overhand, we think it's going to get bigger as consumers pull back, low saving rates, 3.5% versus 8% where it was before COVID. And so we'll see. We think this holiday season is going to be pretty tough. And so as you kind of read your shopping list for that holiday season, Kathy, when you think about some of the kind of ways that equity valuations are starting to price in that recession to the best of their ability, is there a big buy that you now kind of think through or evaluate going into the end of the year here? Well, you have to consider the source here. And our focus, our sole focus, is on disruptive innovation. And we also believe that innovation solves problems. We had a tough time going into COVID with our kind of strategy. And then we had a boom in our strategy during COVID, because guess what? We needed the genomic revolution to help sequence the coronavirus and figure out tests and vaccines. And our kinds of companies helped with that. We think with supply chain issues and with the food and energy prices caused by this shock, this Russia's invasion of Ukraine, that once again, innovation is going to help solve these problems. Electric vehicles, there's an accelerated consumer preffership towards electric vehicles, like Tesla, because of oil prices. And we think there's no stopping that trend now. And in terms of food prices, we do believe that gene editing is going to help us figure out how to produce crops in areas that are less fertile than the Ukraine, the bread basket of Europe, with less water, less fertilizer, less pesticide. So we're going to continue to see the miracles associated with the genomic revolution. But our other strategies as well, whether we're talking about robotics, solving the labor shortage, energy storage, I mentioned electric vehicles, pulling us away from oil consumption, artificial intelligence, which is going to help every company become more competitive if they use their data and combine it with other data in effective ways. And then blockchain technologies, which is going to take the middleman out of a lot of businesses, and take the cost out of a lot of businesses, helping us to solve this inflation problem. So again, consider the source. We think innovation solves problems. It certainly gave us an appreciation of that. During COVID, our strategy was high flying. And we think we have even more problems right now. So stay tuned.",https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GRIayi6dbGM,34,2022-10-14 16:23:15
3328," you Natalie Lec Shima. Kathy, this economic shock that you talk about in large part at the hands of the Fed, does that cause a shock to one of your long-term holdings in Tesla in terms of the stock price and also the company's financials? Well, certainly all stocks are experiencing difficulty in this environment as the market tries to understand how far the Fed is going to go and how deep this recession is going to be. So, Tesla, as I mentioned, is a solution to the problem. It's very interesting. If you look at gasoline demand this summer in the United States, it dropped below COVID levels, the worst of COVID, and it dropped to levels that we have not seen since 1997. That's real demand destruction, and it couldn't have happened. We do not believe without electric vehicles at the margin taking huge share from traditional automobiles. So, if we had to be concerned about an industry, it would be the traditional auto industry, we think that gas powered vehicles are going to be obsolete within the next five to ten years, and the traditional auto industry has to figure out a way to migrate into electric vehicles and into the next big phase, which we think Tesla is leading, the autonomous taxi platform phase. So, lots of changes here. Traditional industries are in harm's way as innovation pushes through accelerated by some of the turmoil out there. Cathy, when we last talked back in the spring, I believe it was just at the beginning of the Elon Musk Twitter saga. Now we are maybe getting to a little bit of closure in that case, but I would post you the same question that I asked you then, because a lot of time is elapsed in different events have happened. Are you at all concerned about Musk's attention wavering now that it looks like he is in fact going to be taking over and likely at least having a pretty heavy hand in running Twitter? Well, we are prolific users of Twitter. Our gives away its research. We give away our research not when it's finished, but as it's evolving. And our most prolific platform, social platform out there, is Twitter. I'm kind of excited to see what Elon will do. I actually think he'll work closely with Jack Dorsey and maybe open up the ecosystem, take away the censorship, make it much more transparent, and I think add more value to that ecosystem. You don't think it'll be a mess if that happens? It'll just be sort of a free-for-all where it's tougher to find commentary of value. You know what's interesting about Twitter and what we found this? We have a lot of debate around our own strategies. We can filter that debate ourselves so we can unfollow people if we think there's bad behavior, but that's our choice. And we can follow those people who we think are moving discussions, whether it's about innovation or the economy, moving discussions along. So I think there's a lot of wisdom out there.",https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GRIayi6dbGM,35,2022-10-14 16:27:53
3329," whether it's about innovation or the economy, moving discussions along. So I think there's a lot of wisdom out there. And we're kind of sick of the nonsense that we see on some of these social platforms. And Twitter, I think, is going to give us more tools to filter out the nonsense and get right down to business. I certainly would like to filter out a lot of the nonsense sometimes on Newark Addy. I want to ask you more broadly about our converse and your funds. I was looking at art K in particular and the fun flows that we have seen, which were seeing sort of bigger swings to the up end to the downside. Earlier in the year, they've gotten a little more muted as of late. You talk a lot about your three to five year time horizon, which I think makes sense. But I wonder how long, how patient investors are going to be, particularly in an environment where they are seeing losses, not just in our K, but in lots of other areas as well. Yes. And I think one thing that helps our clients is our research. And they see that it's first principles research. We have the long term time horizon. And we're seeing spectacular exponential growth opportunities. And not only one by one, the various platforms I just described, but the convergence of those platforms. So one ask her feeding another. And I think many of our clients understand that they're short innovation, truly disruptive innovation. If you own the NASDAQ or the NASDAQ 100 right now, and you look through that index, this is not the index that I grew up with. In the 80s and 90s, when we were looking for innovation, we'd go to the NASDAQ. But if you look through the NASDAQ now, and especially the NASDAQ 100, what you see are 25% of the names touching disruptive innovation, the rest of them are kind of me too. They look like other indexes, the fangs, Microsoft, Nvidia, Tesla would be our only overlap. And then you look further and more deeply into these indices. And you see names that you'd never expect to be there. Food and beverage, utilities, rails, brick and mortar retail. These are not innovation companies. And so what we've done at ARC is we are pure play innovation. And we'd like to think we are what the NASDAQ used to be in the 80s and 90s. And it used to be a very productive place to invest with a long term investment time horizon. So I think our sharing our research, and our pointing out to investors, look, what you think you own in innovation is not what it used to be. And what ARC is doing is really back to the future. We're all about investing in the future as opposed to indexes, which are more about past success. Those companies that have been extremely successful have risen to the top of these indexes. But if we're right in these five platforms that involve 14 different technologies are going to disrupt the traditional world order, then investors need to get to the right side of change. And one of the other things that we do, it's one of our missions and values, is to educate. That's why we give our research away. And we want to educate not only investors, but parents and grandparents about how the world is changing, and how radically it's changing, and how it's ever more important to get, especially students, on the right side of change, so that they can enjoy these incredible growth opportunities and not be disrupted by industries that will be sunsetting, shall I say? Kathy, a three to five year time horizon means not only kind of mid-term or recession-proofing your companies. You're not just recession-proofing your portfolio. You're also kind of mid-term-proofing your portfolio. You're a general election-proofing your portfolio. And so, you know, Eric, how do you go about identifying disruptive innovation that then doesn't get disrupted by public policy or political agenda? Well, we have a six-metrics scoring system.",https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GRIayi6dbGM,36,2022-10-14 16:32:01
3330," then doesn't get disrupted by public policy or political agenda. Well, one, we have a six metric scoring system, very much focused on innovation. One of the scores is thesis risk. Thesis risk has a lot to do with government policy. And so in the, in the early days of arc in 2014, 15, we were thinking, okay, government may be very concerned about the safety of autonomous vehicles. But as we've moved through these last eight years, what we've seen, thankfully, is the government and regulators in particular very focused on data. And what does the data say? The data says that most fatalities and accidents, 85, almost 90% of them are caused by a human error. If we take the human being out of the equation, then we're going to save up to 35, 40,000 lives in the United States, the fatalities per year, and up to 1.25 million around the world. So that is a noble goal. And we've been very gratified to see the regulators looking at the fatalities in Tesla's vehicles and informing us that for the most part, most of those fatalities were caused by human error. And for the second, that people who are driving Tesla vehicles are much safer thanks to the various automated driving capabilities now. Up to 40% safer than in most other cars. So we're very focused on what governments are studying in terms of the data. And if they stick to the data, innovation typically solves problems and makes the world a better place. Really, always a treat to get some time with you. Kathy Wood, ARC, Invest Founder, and see you. Always nice to see you. We'll talk to you soon. Appreciate the time. Thank you, Ryan. Julie as well. Thank you. America has long run on Duncan, but a change in the company's rewards program has some loyalists rethinking where they go for their a Java run. Let's talk more about all things Duncan and what's on the menu here with Duncan, President Scott Murphy. Scott, great to get some time with you coming to us from inside a Duncan location. Curious on what you're seeing in traffic? There's so much economic cross-currents coming at consumers right now. What does that breakfast day part look like? Yeah, and first of all, thanks for having me. I really appreciate it and can't wait.",https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GRIayi6dbGM,37,2022-10-14 16:36:08
3331," So much economic cross currents coming at consumers right now. What does that breakfast day part look like? Yeah, first of all, thanks for having me. I really appreciate it and can't wait to talk about our new loyalty program, Duncan Rewards. In terms of traffic, you know, been listening to your segment all morning on inflation and everything that's going on with the consumer. We feel really good about the breakfast segment. We feel really good about our brand and how we stand tall. People need their coffee and their breakfast sandwich to start their morning. So we've seen really strong results for our brand in the last couple of months. Scott, full stop. I was critical to changes in the Rewards program, but it's coming from a place of love. I have to dunk an app. I go to dunking all the time and a lot other people seemed to have caught my vibe. Have you looked at what you made here and are making any changes now to respond to consumers? Yeah, so and I know it comes from a place of love from you, Brian. Absolutely. Here's what I would say. We rolled out our Duncan Perks program in 2014 and we haven't made any changes in the last eight years. And we went out and we talked to our core users and we said, what do you want from a program? And they said they wanted three things. They wanted more variety because in the old program, you could just get a beverage. They wanted more flexibility. And we've now given them a chance to stack points so they can buy a drink for themselves. They can buy a sandwich for their family or a whole meal for the soccer team. And they said they wanted recognition. So big users like you want to be recognized and we now have a boosted status. And so we've put those three things in place. We're really excited about this new program. We gave out four billion free points in the last three days. And the response has been overwhelming with positive. Okay, fair enough. That's good to hear. But the birthday drink is the industry standard. Like I know I would like to get a free birthday coffee until I ultimately dropped dead and six feet on your, I mean, do you think you'll bring that back? So we're talking about that for sure, Brian. But one thing we did do is, well, we did take that piece away. What we added is come in either the day before your birthday, the day of your birthday or the day after, get three times points, points that won't expire as long as you come a couple times a year. And you can actually get something besides just a beverage. You could get a donut, you could get a sandwich, you can get avocado toast, a lot more flexibility, which is what our guests wanted. So you're really monitoring some of the taste profiles, the trends on what consumers are moving towards in their purchases for anything from lunchtime to starting off the day. So where are you still seeing the most traffic at what point in the day to really make some of the menu decisions and changeovers there? Yeah, we're certainly a morning day part business. So 70% of our business happens before 11 a.m. And honestly, when COVID happened and we had that shutdown, we were all very nervous when the commute was not happening. But people shifted their behaviors a little bit and they came to us a little later in the morning and they came for a couple beverages, maybe to share with their spouses while they're working at home. But really, the trend that's happening is all around ice beverages. And we invented ice coffee. We're a leader. Whether it's ice coffee, whether it's cold brew, our new refresher line, it's all about ice beverages and great attachment with snacking items to that. Hey, Scott, it's Julie here. I mean, I gotta say it's like, I guess I want to know a little bit more about the whole recession, spending patterns, et cetera, because you sound super positive. And I'm just wondering what signs if any you see a of trade down, for example, of a drop in traffic of any kind of sign that, you know, the anecdotal and data pain that we are talking about every day if you guys are seeing any evidence of that. Yeah, we do see some of it. And here's what I'd say anecdotally. What happens in our business is when things happen like fuel prices or you see other spikes in inflationary environments, people pull back a little bit and maybe they stop coming quite as frequently to a Duncan or some other restaurant. But especially with Duncan, I think after a couple days or a week, people realize they need their morning Joe to get started, right? They need their coffee to fuel their day and we've seen it come right back up. And I think uniquely positioned for us, Duncan, it is a value offering, right? So we've got great products, both beverage and food at a great price point at the speed of Duncan. I think that's an unmatched combination out there. Scott, I go to my local Duncan every Saturday. It's just a ritual I have. And every time I'm in line, why don't you...",https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GRIayi6dbGM,38,2022-10-14 16:40:57
3332," Duncan, I think that's an out there. Uh, Scott, I go Duncan every Saturday, I have and every time I'm in line, launch a huge in the morning, which is a good thing I'm sure, but everybody's buying coffee notably ice coffee. How big a percentage is donuts now on your business? And what does that menu look like? Yeah, donuts are about 20% of our product mix right now. You're right. Ice coffee is the future of the day. And I think that last year was the first year we sold more ice beverages than hot beverages. That's what the next generation of consumer wants. They want these ice cold beverages. They want highly colorful products that they can share on Instagram. But I will say our donuts. No one does donuts like we are. We are obviously a national and a global leader on donuts. You got to come try our spider donut, which we just rolled out for Halloween. We just rolled out. We just rolled out for Halloween. We just rolled out for Halloween. We just rolled out for Halloween. We just rolled out for Christmas. And when it comes to the first year, we have a number of donuts. I think we're going to have one more time that I don't have. As you've got more people returning either to office or to schools that breakfast was that's continuing to brew and and heat up. What's Duncan's positioning in that breakfast the digital value. So through our app, we're going to have the ability to have laser focused offers that go right to you and what you want and give you incredible value in our program. And then the last thing I'd say is we've got it through our app our ability to order ahead. So Brian, when you see those long lines, you download the app, order ahead, it'll be ready when you get there and the crew will hand it to you and you'll be off and running for your busy day. Scott, I just I need the birthday drink back. I'm going to dunk it anyway, lad. I'm going to get off of here. I'm going to dunk it on your birthday. I just need the birthday drink back. Please, please. Brian, I'm going to come deliver coffee to you personally on your birthday. I'll take that April 4th. There we go. Done deal. Duncan, President Scott Murphy. Thanks so much for joining us this morning. Appreciate it. you you you. We're going to talk to Wall Street plenty. Let's just speak to Main Street for a minute who's just confused because we get a we get a bad inflation print. We get a good reaction from the market. We get a great job report. And the market through the opposite. Tell Main Street what to make of today. Yeah. Well, first off, thanks for having me on a day where things are green. Yeah. Yeah. Yeah. Yeah. Yeah. Yeah. Yeah. Yeah. Yeah. Yeah.",https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GRIayi6dbGM,39,2022-10-14 16:45:37
3333," and the market through the opposite, tell Main Street what to make of today. Yeah, well, first off, thanks for having me on a day where things are green. Actually, something to talk about here. That's nice, nice change. But just today, we had the disappointing number, obviously markets were lower, but you look at what happened, we just corrected 50% of the overall bull market that we had off those 2020 lows, okay? 3,500. That's a normal type of retracement. So we found some buyers there, wasn't shocking. The VIX, the fear gauge. It didn't, surprisingly, didn't spike massively higher this morning. And then that would be a clue. The obvious market knew something and the rally came on. Last thing for Main Street, the people are really worried. Believe me, you're not the only ones confused. This year is very confusing for a lot of people. But think about this. In June 16th, we made those lows 200 approximately, 200 stocks in the S&P made a new low. Just yesterday, we made new lows less than 80 stocks, made 52 week lows. What does that mean? Price is making new lows, but less stocks are. That Main Street, everyone listening is an improvement. That's how major lows conform. There's less stocks going down, and that's a real positive sign. Well, Ryan, speaking of that positive sign, the Dow up over 3% S&P not too far behind, NASDAQ up over 2.5%. Do you think today's gains does this rally that we're seeing have legs? Yeah, we think it does. I mean, there's lots of ways we can look at this, right? I mean, I mentioned the VIX. You look at sentiment polls. We're near some of the most bearers we've seen, guys, since major lows, March 2009, March 2020. Expectations are so low. It's not like things are great. Believe me, we're going to see this earnings season how corporate America is looking. Roptimistic earnings are still going to justify this economy growing. But expectations have just simply gotten so low. And let's not forget this. Look at the last 17 bear markets, six of them bottom in October. Believe me, it could be random, maybe not. October is more of a bear market killer. The worst two-starth year ever, other than this year, this is the third-war start, 74 in 2002, all right? Bottom in the first two weeks, two weeks of October. Did we just do it again? Believe me, tune in and watch later. But we think we're optimistic that we can have another pretty good low in October. And in those regular fourth quarter strong seasonals that take place in a midterm year can take over. And we can have a pretty good size rally the rest of this year before the year is all set and done. And Ryan, how about the fact that it's a midterm election? Yeah, what are investors hoping for in this sort of environment? Yeah, great question. So let's put it this way. I think gridlock, right? You don't want too much power one way or the other. And you look at the way the election, how it might swing. You know, you know, the incumbent party that won the presidency, tends to lose some seats. But we don't think there's going to be too much power one way or the other. And that could be what matters. But for the average investor listening, just know this. We say do not invest in your politics, right? Just invest in the fundamentals. But think about this. If you looked at what the S&P did, the day of the midterm elections, go back to World War II, all right? One year later, the S&P was higher every single time, up 14.1%. So whatever happens, markets hate uncertainty. Get that election out of the way, the uncertainty out of the way. Then markets tend to do pretty darn well. Last point on this, the second year of a new president. So this year, historically, extremely weak. Believe me, this year's weaker than we expected. At the same time, this isn't abnormal to see weakness the second year of a new president. And things get a lot better that third year. And the economy can keep growing in our view. It should lead to pretty good size gains into this year and into next year. Don't get me wrong, man. We love to see the rally. We love your positivity. You know that. But if I said dinner on the S&P being higher in one month, then it is today, you'd say what? And that's an awful thing. Where are we going for dinner is what I would say. What I mean. OK. Some more expensive. Yeah, good steakhouse. No, I'm going to hire. I mean, believe me. So let's put it like this. October and November are the top two months in a midterm year. We talked about some of those things. I know we know inflation's high. But overall, this beach ball is really low, right? Really, really low. Once you let go, and that momentum go up, we think this time next month, you can buy me a steak. I'll come to New York. And we think the S&P is going to be a decent deal higher. I'd be happy to buy you dinner, man. If I lose this bet, and that is a bet, it's on tape. Is there anything that you see then that tells us inflation might be cooling? Yeah, I mean, believe me, this number is disappointing. Yesterday's number is disappointing. But yes, you look at some of the individual surveys, like rents. Rents are actually down month over month last year. The government data doesn't show that, because government data takes like...",https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GRIayi6dbGM,40,2022-10-14 16:49:56
3334," supporting yesterday's numbers Yes, you look at some of like rents rents are actually government data doesn't show like nine months for to get cars and really start government data doesn't show that is real time when it comes potential positive just look around commodity prices have come back significantly some shining potential bright spots in a really dark see when it comes to inflation but at the same time what's priced in and what's not the market is pricing in massive inflation massively higher rates the fed is not infallible this time 15 months ago the fed saw one rate hike this year all right I'm not calling them out I'm just saying that's what it was six months from now I doubt if the feds will be nearly as hawkish as they are right now. When you take a look I guess what we're going to see play out in the markets over the next several weeks a big earnings with some of the bigger banks we heard from Pepsi earlier this week they were actually able to weather the sensor in environment high inflation very well what are some areas or do you think do you spot any trends just in terms of companies that are best position to weather some of the downturn that we could see even though you you have a pretty optimistic outlook here yeah that's a great point so earnings coming up right energy is supposed to have massive earnings growth we know that but the number two is industrials industrials so see over 20% you over your earnings growth you don't usually have a recession when that happens and you look under the service at industrials on a relative strength basis versus yes and p500 industrials are breaking out to like one and a half of your highs on a relative strength so to see industrials that strong under the service with small calves with gin violated the June lows with health care hanging in there with regional banks actually making new highs in relative strength things are perfect we get it but these are some shining lights and some some positives that are under there and industrials to me is a really good looking group that could be a big one or this earnings season so Ryan then for investors watching this wondering what to make of this period between now and November how should they be viewing the market where are the opportunities yeah kind of hinted at some of them so we like value over growth still your industrials your energy you know those materials I mean those those some groups still look pretty good to us we haven't liked big cap tech for a while more neutral at best I just look at this multi-year running growth right in technology some of these names still look kind of top heavy honestly so we like kind of small caps look pretty good in value those are some areas we still like just big picture this big bear market that we've had we think you know this time six to twelve months or down it's cliche to say but there are some really good opportunities and honestly look at small caps small caps are historically cheap relative to large caps that's another positive we think there all right lots of great stuff a big thank you Ryan Dietrich for joining us this afternoon have a good one you all right well that CPI print is the big story of the day",https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GRIayi6dbGM,41,2022-10-14 16:53:48
3335," I'm going to be back. All right, well, that CPI print is the big story of the day coming in much hotter than expected inflation rising 8.2% in September and a year or year basis. We want to bring in Vince Reinhardt, Drifus and Melon, a chief economist. Vince, it's great to see you. So certainly it's interesting when you take a look at the market's reaction, but from an economist perspective, I guess the this change your outlook at all, just where we are in the economy right now and what we could expect in the coming months. No, it just seals the deal for what the Fed will be doing in the near term 75 basis points that it's upcoming meeting in November and other 50 in December. What it tells you is that inflation, once it gets high, gets entrenched. The worrisome thing about the Consumer Price Index report this morning was core inflation. Strip out food and energy. That's growing 6.6%. That's a 40-year high. It's getting into the prices of goods and services that are sticky and sticky lives up to its name. Hard to bud, but once they start going, they have momentum and that's the Fed's problem inflation is broader based now. We know that the Fed is playing catch up and at this point they want to do too much rather too little to really get inflation under control. When you pass through some of the minutes that we just recently gone, how does that factor into some of these data points that are going to continue to come out? I think that this is the last CPI print we're going to see before the midterms. You're exactly right. That was the headline they wanted out of the minutes that were published yesterday. FOMC participants basically said you could do too much, you could do too little. There's more danger if you don't do enough. While they fred it a little bit about what it means economic activity, they were much more concerned about inflation getting embedded and inflation expectations rising. Right now, monetary policy choice is pretty easy. It's unpleasant, but it's easy because when inflation is so far above your 2% goal, they all know what to do. What they need to do is raise rates and that's what they'll be doing. They'll be doing tighter longer and just about every CEO in the conference boards suggest a mild recession next year and just about every guest on this show says the same. But Vince, is that going to be enough to drive down inflation? We're seeing earnings at least early on that show people there's no demand destruction despite dramatically higher prices. What will bring down inflation to 2% of its just mild? We get anywhere near it. Ultimately it would be the Federal Reserve that returns inflation to its goal by being willing to keep the policy rate high for a long time. I actually don't think they'll get there next year and that is because inflation is stubborn and as you say, the economy slips into a recession when the unemployment rate starts rising as inflation gets nearer to their goal, not near enough to it. They're going to have much more difficult policy choices and chances are they'll blink. They won't keep rates high enough to get inflation back to 2. They'll satisfy themselves that inflation in the neighborhood of 2, even if it starts with a 3, is sufficient progress to ultimately get to their goal. And Vince, you've been in the room before you've been part of the very similar types of discussions. What do you tell us? What do you think the conversations are like now inside the Fed when we do get a print like today's? So I think it's a combination of what I alluded to earlier. A lot of unanimity when inflation is so high, the urge to tighten is across all FOMC participants. But you're beginning to see them put markers down about the next fight. And the next fight is next year when the unemployment rate is rising, when the economy is in recession, some of them are going to want to slow the process down. And so underneath all that good feeling, underneath them all saying the same thing about the need to raise rates a lot in front load policy accommodation is a beginning of this showing of the scenes. Where they're worried, where there'll be a difference of opinion, where's the show up, concerns about the right.",https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GRIayi6dbGM,42,2022-10-14 16:58:13
3336," of this showing of the scenes. Were there worried where there'll be a difference of opinion? Were it set show up? Concerns about arising on employment rate or recession and global economic recession. That's back on the board now, particularly this week when the IMF and the World Bank annual meetings are ongoing. They're all going to the same meetings. They're all here in the same thing. Yes, you need to tighten. You also need to be aware that everybody is tightening monetary policy and their significant risks of financial stability. And then obviously the IMF releasing their global outlook, seeing reduced growth. Also in some of the major economies expecting a slow down there, they talked about the EU, China, and the US. How do you see the fact that we're such an interconnected world now with our economies? How do you see that playing out in terms of the pressure it might put on the US economy? A lot. And it's not global monetary policy and carbon date. A coordination is actually emulation. When the Fed raises interest rates, it puts upward pressure on the exchange value of the dollar. It puts downward pressure on everybody else's exchange rate, which is a force for inflation in Europe, in Japan, in emerging markets. Most central banks don't like it, and they're forced to follow the Fed up. So part of the message this week is recognize Fedors or we're all following you. That means your footprint is bigger on the global economy than you may appreciate. And that problems in the global economy will blow back to the US economy. That's the concern about next year. And as I want to close with the housing market, now mortgage rates certainly don't rise and fall dramatically with rates for more than 10 years, but needless to say another 75 point hike is probably going to take us above 7%. What do you see in the housing market? What do you think the Fed sees? It appears to be the first breaking point. So look, the Fed's got to work the tools it has in terms of the monetary transmission mechanism. There's basically two reliable features. You raise rates, you choke off housing, you raise rates, you tend to put upward pressure on the exchange rate of the dollar. That's unpleasant for people looking for homes. And it's unpleasant for our trading partners facing downward pressure on their own exchange rates. I would think that housing is going to be troubled for a while. And the place to see that is actually abroad. In the UK, where more of mortgage activity is at variable rates, you see a much more sharper contraction activity. Indeed, you see an inability to get mortgages at some point over the last couple of weeks. That's the future for the US. It just takes longer because we rely so much more on fixed rate mortgages. But as you said, fixed rate 30-year mortgages has been more than doubled in a year. And it's going up probably into the sevens next year. Indeed it appears, Sue. All right, Vince Reinhart, appreciate your time here, sir. Thank you. I'm going to give you a big ball. To be a strong, vibrant, global power, meet a strong, vibrant, advancement-factoring industry in the United States of America. I really believe 20, 30 years from now, when we look back, or maybe even 10 years from now, when we look back at COVID, and we look at what are all the lasting negative impacts, the biggest one will be what happens to our kids. Hello, everyone, and welcome to influencers on.",https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GRIayi6dbGM,43,2022-10-14 17:02:25
3337," Hello everyone and welcome to Influencers I'm Andy Sirware and welcome to our guest U.S. Secretary of Commerce, Gina Romando here at the Department of Commerce Secretary Romando. Great to see you. Thanks so much for taking the time to speak with us. Thank you. Happy New Year. Happy New Year to you. I want to jump right in and ask you about chips and the semiconductor shortage. I know this is top of mind for you and understand where things are but also to sort of ask you about the connection between the shortages of chips and these reports of very high inflation that we've seen lately. Thank you. This is a direct correlation. I mean the inflation numbers came out yesterday and you know higher I think than anybody would want to see but if you did if you get under the covers of the numbers you realize that a third of the increase in inflation is due to car prices which is stunning you know a third is due to car prices. Why is that? Because last year auto production of cars was down by almost 8 million cars, 7.7 million cars. So supply is down, prices of cars are up 20% and the reason like the single reason or biggest reason that car production is down so much is because car companies can't get their hands on enough chips and they will tell you that. If you go to production facilities of cars and trucks by the way you will see many many cars fully assembled but for chips. So it's pretty simple supply and demand you know I'm thinking back to X10 which I took 30 years ago. It's like we need to increase the supply of cars so prices will come down and in order to do that we need to increase in semiconductor chips. So there's really a direct link between the two and we need Congress to act so they can fix the problem. And so there is the chips act out there and I'm wondering where that stands right now and then how that would address this problem. Yeah so it's kind of stalled in Congress to be very honest that the Senate worked hard, got the chips act passed and I think last summer and it's been a little bit stuck in the house. Speaker says she's for it I mean she does support it but we need to move it and so why does it matter? It is essentially it's it's incentives that the Commerce Department could provide to chips manufacturers so they will make chips in America. If you ever you know have time for kind of a really scary read you should learn more about how dependent the United States is on other countries especially Taiwan for our supply of semiconductors. Like right now in the United States we make zero none of the most sophisticated semiconductor chips none of them and we get the majority from Taiwan. So apart from the fact that we need to make chips in America so we can make more cars, we do some inflation, create jobs, it's a national security issue as well. We cannot be a secure nation economically or you know nationally secure if we get 60-70 percent of all of our chips from a single company in Taiwan. So in any event Congress needs to move they need to take action now it'll send money to the Commerce Department we'll set up a program here where we work in partnership with semiconductor companies asking them to set up shop in America making chips in America. And so would this bill then prospectively help Nvidia AMD Intel micron those US companies set up fabs here in the United States which you know cost a billion dollars they're very expensive. Yeah. And also would there be money for foreign companies as well say like Taiwan semiconductor to build facilities here. Yeah so yes and yes.",https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GRIayi6dbGM,44,2022-10-14 17:06:39
3338," And also, would there be money for foreign companies as well, say like Taiwan semiconductor to build facilities here? Yeah, so yes and yes. Yes and yes. We need, they cost many billions of dollars as you said. I'm dating myself. I don't remember when they cost a billion, that's a lot more than that. Yeah. It's multiple billions of dollars. And look, these companies could be building more fabs or fab is just a word for semiconductor facility where they make chips. They could build them now in Malaysia, Taiwan, lower cost settings. We want them and need them to build them in America, hiring Americans to make this stuff on our shores. And by the way, yes, we hope that one's Congress does its job and gets us the money. We hope, you know, Samsung, TSMC companies that are not American, but in allied countries, will be eligible if they put their facility in the United States of America. And just one more question about that. I mean, do you think companies really get it that the supply chain, which was optimized for cost, needs to be optimized for other factors as well, like security? Yeah, I think they get it now. I think they get it now. As you say, so well said by you. I mean, there's been an obsession for decades with just in time, you know, obsession with efficiency. And we're realizing that in a world of severe climate change events where storms can take out a manufacturing facility or pandemics or other kind of disruptions, you need redundancy. You need resilience. Frankly, you need stuff near you and near your customers, not all of it in Asia. So I think that absolutely, they've learned a very painful lesson. If you talk to folks who run auto companies or trucking companies, it's been a really brutal year. I mean, like I said, their production is down so significantly they've had to layoff workers. They have whole facilities filled with half-built cars and trucks. They can't finish them just because they can't get chips. So yeah, it's been a huge wake-up call for the private sector around how to build in resiliency, redundancy, just in case to their supply chain. Does all that speak to a decline in globalism? And you're the US Commerce Secretary. And I don't know what your thinking is on that. I mean, obviously you have China on your mind as well. And they're the political considerations that impact supply chain. So what is your thinking on that? Yeah. It does. I did listen. I think globalism isn't should be alive and well. In fact, you speak of China. I mean, the president is very clear on this. We have to work with our allies as we confront the threat and competition from China. And we have to actually do a better job of that, working with our allies in the Indo-Pacific, with our allies in Europe. That being said, look, we have, the United States, over decades, has just walked. We've watched our manufacturing base wither. I mean, quite literally, just wither. We've lost, I think, 30 percent of small and medium-sized manufacturers in America have gone out of business in the past few decades. So there is a balance. We need to work with our allies. These supply chains are enormously sophisticated and global. And they should be. That was in Malaysia at the end of last year, and I visited the semiconductor packaging facility of an American company. It's sophisticated. It's huge. Thousands of Malaysians work there. That is a good thing, but we can't make nothing in America. You know, it's just, we have to, it's the balance is out of whack. We've taken a right off the ball to be a strong, vibrant, global power. We need a strong, vibrant, advanced manufacturing industry in the United States of America with the workforce who can do those jobs. And that is a critical element.",https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GRIayi6dbGM,45,2022-10-14 17:11:05

3340," And the CDC reduced its quarantine guidance from 10 days to five days. Is that helping, do you think? I think so, yes, I think so. But still, folks got to get vaccinated. Right. I want to go back a little bit to inflation, Secretary Romando, and ask you, beyond chips, are there other factors and why is this difficult to address perhaps, or what is the best way to address it besides the chip situation? Yeah. So, obviously, the primary lever with respect to inflation is held by the Fed. So Chairman Powell and his colleagues have their work cut out for them, and I trust that they will do the right thing and use the tools in their toolbox to combat inflation. That being said, the President has been very clear with us, we have to use every tool in our toolbox to help the American people and reduce inflation. So some of that is getting all these supply chain disruptions behind us, the ports, congestion at the ports has been a huge issue. We've leaned into it. It is much better. You know, the shelves were full for Christmas. But, you know, we have to put that behind us. Anything that relates to supply, again, back to Econ 101. Supply of goods has to go up to meet demand, so prices can come down. So whether that is the actions the President took around meat processing to increase supply, you know, if meat, whether that's chips, ports, anything we're doing to increase the supply of goods will fundamentally help to dampen inflation. Also, look, there are provisions in the President's billback better package that will increase the labor supply, you asked about labor before. We have to get more folks into the workforce. Women will be able to get back to work if they have affordable childcare, if they have affordable care for their elderly loved ones. Now, that's longer term. Billback better is kind of investing now for the future. But the supply matters, supply side matters. You get more folks working. We got to increase the supply of goods, so prices come down. You sound like you're using a lot of your Econ knowledge from graduate days. Were you an Econ major? I was. I think that's right. I was an Econ major. Going back. And sometimes they ask you, does any of this stuff do you ever really use it in the real world? I do. I went on to study. I wanted to get a doctorate, so I come back to it frequently in this job. Right, absolutely. You talked about billback better. Are you optimistic about it? I am optimistic. I am realistic. I am optimistic. It's going to get done. It will get done. It'll look different. Whatever the President signs. This is a prediction I'm willing to make. The final bill, the President signs, he signs, will look different than what he proposed. Will look different than what came out of the house. But fundamentally, it will be transformative. It will make these investments in climate, in workforce, in bringing down health care costs that we need. And yes, I think it gets done. Can I ask you about broadband and expanding access to broadband? You've got two fronts there, people in urban populations who can't afford it, don't have access, and then the rural population is where it's an abomination, quite frankly. Where do you stand? That's part of your remit as well, right? It is. That's a huge piece of business here at the Department of Commerce. The bipartisan infrastructure law sent tens of billions of dollars to the Department of Commerce. Our job is to use that to make sure every American has broadband. The rural, tribal, urban. You're exactly right. The issues are different. In urban areas, it's less about access and more about affordability. I was the governor of Rhode Island. There's no rural Rhode Island. It's a very, it's urban. It's densely populated. It's fiber everywhere.",https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GRIayi6dbGM,47,2022-10-14 17:19:53
3341," And more about affordability. I was the governor of Rhode Island. There's no rural Rhode Island. It's a very, it's urban. It's densely populated. There's fiber everywhere, but it's not affordable everywhere. So in those places, we have to work harder on affordability. Also, I'm providing digital literacy to folks. In the rural areas and tribal areas, we have to lay fiber. And we have to use other technologies. Right now, it's so heartbreaking, Andy, to spend time as I've done in rural America. There is no broadband for hundreds of miles, which means you can't work from home. You can't visit the doctor with telemedicine. Your kids can't have virtual school. When tribal lands, at West, teachers would literally drive worksheets once a week to their students. So the kids could do the work on paper and then mail it back or drive it back to the school. So anyway, yeah, we have to do it. We will do it. We'll do it in partnership with the providers. At the end of this mission, every single American ought to have high speed, affordable broadband.",https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GRIayi6dbGM,48,2022-10-14 17:24:18
3342," I also want to ask you about tech companies, big US tech companies, and their struggles with the EU and my understanding and listing your help are asking for help from you. Google, Facebook, in particular, where does that stand? Yeah, so I think everybody recognizes that there is a need for changes in the way we regulate tech companies. That being said, some of the provisions being debated in the EU feel discriminatory. They are specifically designed to only affect three or four companies in the United States of America. That doesn't feel right. What I'm saying is, yes, of course, update regulations change regulations, be pro-competition, be pro-transparency, be pro-privacy, but don't just specifically take aim at four companies in the world and also just have an open ear to some of the legitimate concerns of American and American business. That must be a tricky balance to strike. They're not just four ordinary companies, right? They're pretty remarkable with huge amounts of power and then there's people like Lena Khan who have very perhaps different perspectives, perhaps, but certainly a mandate that would suggest that their power is maybe too large. And so how do you factor that in? Yeah, and by the way, that's true. The president has been very clear about this. We are pro-competition. We do believe there's legislation working its way through the House and the Senate in America right now dealing with that. That being said, some of the provisions of what the EU is considering is, as I said, there's not taking into account some of the very real concerns related to cybersecurity and privacy and security that American companies have and we're asking the EU to have an open ear to that. Right. What part of your portfolio are people not aware of Secretary Romando? It's a big portfolio. Maybe everything we have to do with oceans and climate. So 40 percent of the Commerce Department is related to the ocean and the atmosphere. 40 percent? Yeah, it's big. It's a big piece of business what we do here and that's all of course related to climate. So I spend a fair bit of my time. I was the governor of the Ocean State in Rhode Island. Ocean State, that's right. I really love it. So you know the license plates? Exactly. In the Ocean State, I grew up going to the beach, I grew up clamming, I feel we have to preserve the treasure of our coastal lands and our oceans. So in any event, I think people probably don't realize how much the Department of Commerce has to do with resiliency, climate, oceans, undersea efforts. You talk about being governor of Rhode Island. How is this job different from that job? Yeah, it's pretty different. You know, Rhode Island is a small place and you can make things happen quickly when you're the governor. So this is obviously, you know, just the building where we're sitting is gigantic and we have almost 60,000 employees just in the Commerce Department. So I'd say that is different. In many ways though, leadership is leadership. You know, you set a vision, you manage your team, you drive to results. So in that way, it's very familiar. Working with the legislatures.",https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GRIayi6dbGM,49,2022-10-14 17:28:17
3343," You know, you set a vision, you manage your team, you drive to results. So in that way, it's very familiar. Working with the legislature is also very familiar for me. I enjoy it, I like it, it's part of the job. I did that as governor, I'm doing that here. Right. When you were governor of Rhode Island, you were out front back then saying that schools should stay open. I know you're not education secretary, but what are your thoughts on what's going on with their schools right now with the pandemic? I still feel kids need to be in school. You know, these vaccines are safe. That's safety, obviously, we have to keep our teachers safe and our kids safe. No doubt about it. That means good protocols, more testing. Everyone has to be vaccinated. But with those precautions, kids ought to be in school. I really believe 20, 30 years from now, when we look back, or maybe even 10 years from now, when we look back at COVID, and we look at what are all the lasting negative impacts. The biggest one will be what happened to our kids. The mental health issues, how they have fallen behind in their education. And of course, this will just, this again will contribute to the lack of equity in America, because it'll be the children who didn't have broadband, whose parents couldn't stay home to teach them, who are already a little bit behind, who are just so much further behind. So, I have religion on this topic. I also have two teenagers, and I see it. We've got to get kids in school. There is a recent article out there talking about your future and being a bright light in the Democratic Party. I wonder what your ambitions are, Secretary Armando. To get through the week. I mean, like, I have a big, big, big, big job here. We just touched on it. So, this is what I'm focused on. All right. And finally, a sort of related question, but a little different, I hope, is, what do you see as your legacy here and maybe personally? Gosh. Wow. Here, I think this, the broadband that we talked about will be, if I do it right, my legacy. This is fundamental. You know, this is, this, this, done properly. It will be comparable to any of the biggest infrastructure implementations in our nation's history. And as I look towards, like, the economy and the divide, the digital divide, and how that plays into the economic and opportunity divide, there's a huge sense of urgency around getting broadband to everyone. So, I think in this job, that'll be a big portion of it. Focus on that. Yeah. All right. U.S. Commerce Secretary, Gina Armando, thank you so much for your time. Thank you. You've been watching influencers. I'm Andy Surwer. We'll see you next time. Welcome back. You're watching Yahoo Finance Live. We've struck this the top of the 10 a.m. hour here, Brad Smith here with Julie Heimann and you're seeing Brian Sazi on screen there as well. With 30 minutes into trade, let's take it swiftly on over to Julie Heimann, who's got some fresh news, breaking news and consumer sentiment as well. Yeah, consumer sentiment coming out better than estimated from the University of Michigan's October preliminary reading 59.8 is that reading 58.8 is what analysts have been. Economists had been estimating. It's also an increase from the prior month. Current conditions, whoo, lot better than estimated 65.3. That's, economists weren't even looking for a reading above 60. There are expectations, though, are lower. So, people that feel good now, but they don't expect that they're going to continue to feel good. 56.2 is that expectations number. The one year inflation number, expectations ticking up to 5.1%, and the five to 10 year inflation expectations ticking up to 2.9%. So, pretty fascinating here. And also kind of in line with what we have been hearing, right, from corporations as well. So, kind of a confirmation that just as Jamie Dimon said today, consumers are in good shape right now, right? They're feeling good right now. The consumer balance sheet is in decent shape. People...",https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GRIayi6dbGM,50,2022-10-14 17:32:50
3344," We're done and said today, consumers are in good shape right now, right? They're feeling good right now. The consumer balance sheet is in decent shape. People are spending. It's what's happening next that people are worried about. Yeah, exactly. Continue to uncertainty over future trajectory of prices, economies, financial markets around the world, indicating a bumpy road ahead for consumers that all kind of laid out within the commentary on this as well, Sauce. Yeah, just an interesting report. And I would say, just strange, shortened to the point better than expected. Doesn't really, I would say, job with the retail sales report, but nonetheless a good read on the consumer. Welcome, read for the consumer ahead of the start to the holiday. Shopping season. But let's get back under earning season, which is now officially in full swing. Results from the JP Morgan City Morgan Stanley and of course, Wells Fargo. David Allison runs point on the Hennessy Large Cap Financial Fund. David, market has seemed, at least initially, seemed to like some of these big bank earnings. Do you think that enthusiasm is justified? Well, I think the stocks have been down a lot. So the fact that they're up a little bit tells me that the world didn't come to an end again. So I think the stocks have been really bad. And so the fact that they're rebounding is sort of a sigh of relief. I think generally the fundamentals are good. I mean, obviously the margin is expanded because rates are moving up and there are primary beneficiary of that. But what you're not seeing is any real credit deterioration. So you've had a massive move in rates. You've had a massive move in the market that has gone down that's taken money away. Sentiment is not great on Wall Street. And yet you don't really see any movement in credit. So it's interesting to note how strong these banks are, even though we have this fear of recession in the end of the world that seems to be the talk every day. Yeah, I mean, the end of the world trade can at least from what I've been told only be right once. And you hope that we don't reach that point. But when you think about some of the activity even that we're seeing here on the day as well, David, as the markets have slipped back into negative territory there, we had a moment to go all three major averages in negative territory. After beginning the day, pretty strong, and what seemed like would be another add on to yesterday's momentum, even though it was a whipsaw day yesterday, as you kind of look into the rest of this quarter, what would you need to see in order to have some confidence that a bottom had been set in during this fourth quarter going into what economists are expecting in a recession at the midpoint sometime 2023? Well, my general broad thoughts are that we've had a pretty good move in rates. Two years ago, I think the two year was like 15 basis points, and now it's four plus percent. So I think we're through the bulk of the rate increases, meaning we're not going to go to eight or 10 percent on a three-month T-bill. At least that's my opinion. I think what we're heading into now is an earnings issue for all of the companies, not all of them, but enough of them. Obviously, the financials aren't seeing any earnings issues. There's concern that there will be that rates will go up, credit will kick in, loan demand will decline. And I think it would be interesting to see what happens the next couple of weeks as the non-financial start to report and tell you what's happening away from the financial economy. Even the banks came into this downturn very strong, very conservative. They haven't made, they don't want to make bad loans. They've got plenty of capital. They're benefiting from the rise in rates in the NIM. So this group is not really indicative of what's happening out there in the marketplace yet. Well, there are some hints of it, right? If you look at this, David, in JP Morgan, for example, yes, net interest income doing fantastically, but if you take out net interest income, revenue actually didn't do as well. They're raising their provisions for credit losses. They're seeing a decline in lending already. How much worse do you think some of those indicators, even if the banks are going to get worse? Well, I guess as an investor in these stocks to be...",https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GRIayi6dbGM,51,2022-10-14 17:37:08
3345," to get worse. Well, I don't, you know, it's, I guess, as an investor in these, in these stocks to be completely honest, I am looking forward to credit troubles. I am looking forward to higher rates. I am looking forward to the market getting very concerned about the health of the banking industry because that's going to generate the opportunities for me to buy the better names and outperform on the way up. So, you know, that's the, that's the raw truth of what I do is, you know, I don't want what we have now to continue because I can't really compete with the other companies in the marketplace that grow, they create new products. We need cycles for this industry to really make money for investors. And my hope, again, I'm, you know, I've been doing this for 40 years, you know, I'm hoping we have a downturn, I'm hoping we have a recession, I hope we have higher non performers that creates lower stock prices that I can buy as the economy recovers, the Fed if it's and all that stuff. Okay, so David, tell us what. So, what are the better names then? What are the ones that you're looking to get cheaper? What are the ones you're most excited about getting cheaper in this kind of tumultuous period? Well, the ones that, you know, are going to have credit problems. And I don't think the, you know, the bigger companies are going to have that. They've just been too conservative, they're too liquid. So the smaller banks, you know, the mid, the mid tier banks, maybe not the real small ones where they've made loans, loaned to deposits are higher, they don't have as much liquidity. If credit kicks in on a negative thing, then they'll hopefully go down a lot more and I'll be able to buy them. But right now, there's no problems in the industry. And this is the frustrating part for an asset manager. If there's no problems, there's nothing to get better. There's no reason for the stocks to go up. So we need things to go wrong for this group to get really attractive. And right now, you, the first eight, four or five companies that have reported everything's great. Non performers are okay. Lone growth is okay. Yeah, they're preserving, they're reserving here and there. But they're just being super conservative. And I would do the same thing. You know, so, you know, we'll see what happens. But I think you'll see more issues with, with the economy in the non financials for the next couple months. I think that the struggle, the real challenges in the, in the world is not the financial system. It's away from the financial system. David Wells Fargo is the top 10 holding in the fund. Does that company frustrate you? They had a couple I would argue two good comeback quarters to kick off this year. They come out here this morning. I would argue, expense are still high. They announced a charge. The home business under pressure, auto is under pressure. What do you make of that name? Well, it's a, again, it's a, it's a large, again, it's a, you know, this is a large cap fund. So I'm not going to own a $2 billion bank. So you have to own something big. But this is a, the valuation is reasonable. They've got a great historical franchise. They've had some management issues for the last four, five years, which have been very frustrating, not quite as bad as city court. But certainly, they've had some struggles. And the valuation is just too cheap to ignore. And the embedded franchise value of those deposits is just too large and too powerful. And you're seeing the benefit of those deposit franchises now in higher net interest income. Just while we have you here as well, David, there's an interesting tidbit within the consumer sentiment survey that come out just a moment ago. And particularly as we think about the consumer and the higher end, or higher net income consumer as well, if you see them start to be impacted to the same kind of detriment, or maybe not the same detriment. But as they're citing your negative influence on their personal finances, the highest in five months, what does that start to spell out more broadly about where consumer mindset in the economy is trending towards? Well, presumably, the Fed is doing, or is making things happen the way it wants to have them happen, meaning they're slowing the economy down. And that's showing up in certain things. Obviously stock prices are down, home prices have stopped going up 2% a day.",https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GRIayi6dbGM,52,2022-10-14 17:41:31

So I think the issue here is who's going to really feel it more? And I just don't believe that the financial, the large financial companies, the banks, are going to feel the real bite of this recession, at least not yet. It's going to be the other companies. It's going to be the companies that have reported, even you look at Nike and you look at, those companies are going to hurt a lot more than the banks are. The banks since 2008 have been in a box, they've been regulated, they've been forced to be liquid, forced to be conservative, forced to have tons of capital, and now that's paying dividends for them in a sense that they're not seeing the struggles. So you're not really seeing what's happening yet in the economy, and I think the financials are not a good example of that yet. And so I think the numbers you're seeing are going to impact the non-financial a lot more than the financial phone. David Ellison, who runs point at the Hennessey large cap financial fund.

Thank you.....",https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GRIayi6dbGM,53,2022-10-14 17:46:11
3347," Welcome back to Yahoo Finance. I'm Jennifer Sean Burger. Well, on the back of that hot CPI report that showed a core reading, rising to the highest level in 40 years, investors are wondering what this means for the Fed and if they'll get more aggressive. Here to weigh in is Mary Daley, president of the San Francisco Federal Reserve Bank. President Daley, welcome back to the program. So wonderful to have you. It's wonderful to be here. I look forward to it. So I want to kick off this conversation and get your reaction to that CPI report and whether it changes the course of policy for you. If we look at the reading on inflation, it appears to be actually moving in the wrong direction, right? We saw core inflation, which excludes those volatile energy and food prices rise 6.6% last month up from 6.3 in August and 5.9 in July. Do you still see the Fed funds rate rising somewhere on the order of 125 basis points this year or does the Fed need to get more aggressive on the back of this report? Sure. And you know, the CPI is one part of the dashboard of indicators we look for. It's an important one and it does show the data not cooperating. It was a very disappointing report, but I would offer it wasn't that surprising, right? We would hope that inflation would start to come down faster, but I was prepared for it to just be sluggish in its response. It's a lagging indicator. And so what I'm also looking at is what's going on in the inputs to inflation are demand and supply showing any signs of coming back in balance. And here I would offer two things that you see the labor market cooling. It's still very strong, but it's cooling. You also see housing demand cooling. So the housing market is softening. And then today's retail sales report, which had showed flat spending is really another sign that we're getting some cooling and that we will eventually feed through to inflation. So my own sense is that we went in, I went into this, uh, intermeeting period, if you will, thinking that we needed to continue to raise rates to further restrict the economy and we'll have to be data dependent about what actual rate hikes we take because we have domestic conditions, but we're also working in a global economy. And there's a lot of, you know, uncertainty and risks out there. And we have to think about those in the context of exactly what we do, but there's literally no doubt in my mind that we need to put more restrictive stance of policy in the economy to further get demand and supply and balance so that consumers don't have to worry about such high inflation month after month. So given that you think this is a bit of a lagging indicator and you do see some signs of cooling elsewhere in the economy, does this keep the fed basically on course for what's been set out for the next couple of meetings or what's your sense there? Well, let's go back to the summary of economic projections, lovingly called the SEP. And that, you know, often isn't, it is stale right after it's produced, but in this case, I think that's a really good guidepost from our last meeting about what the path of policy is likely to look like. And then it's all about how do you get there? What's the path? And, you know, the SEP, if you remember it, it came out in between four and a half and five percent rates as the best estimate of what rates would be at the end of next year. And it also said that we could get up, you know, into the into the fours, into restrictive territory by the end of this year. And I still think that's a reasonable, really reasonable way to think about it. And I'm quite certain that some judicial restriction is going to take place. And I do know that that's right for the economy. We are tightening into a strong economy. And so we need to bring it back down to something that looks a lot more sustainable in terms of the pace of growth. Okay. So then to be clear, 125 basis points higher on that, but, but, funds rate this year. And then looking at a peak of around four and a half to five percent next year, still seems to be the run of play in your mind. Is that correct? Well, what I would say, Jennifer, and I just want to be crystal clear. I know people would like us to write down the exact numbers for the rest of the period. But there's too much uncertainty for that to be prudent for us. We need to be data dependent.",https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GRIayi6dbGM,54,2022-10-14 17:50:13
3348," want to be crystal clear. I know people would like us to write down the exact numbers for the rest of the period, but there's too much uncertainty for that to be prudent for us. We need to be data dependent, extremely data dependent. So clearly the domestic data are pointing to further rate hikes. And I'm very supportive of continuing to put restrictions in place. I see the SCP is a good starting point guide post for people to say that's generally where the Federal Reserve will be heading. That's consistent with my own views. But I also want everyone to hear. I'm listening to recognize that we're not on a preset course. We are a data dependent fed. And if more is necessary, we'll take it if less is necessary. We'll adjust. But we're not talking about at this point in my mind, you know, pausing or stopping. Nor are we talking about, you know, changing our overall strategy because the data are coming in about like we would expect monetary policy acts with a lag. Inflation is a laggy indicator. It is a hardship that continues to print so high and I am very focused on that hardship. And I'm very mindful as my context tell me all the time that we want to make sure that price increases that inflation doesn't become embedded in psychology. And that's why you'll hear me say again and again, we are res live as an FOMC as a fed at restoring price stability. Even that you said monetary policy operates with a lag, you still think he would raise up to about 4 and a half 5% and then pause at that point in 2023. Well, I think that's exactly the question we have in mind and then why there's a big difference between what rate you get to and then holding it that you holding the economy in a restrictive stance of policy also continues to bridle it. So we'll end at a rate that we think is appropriate in in terms of where to stop and look around. But we still need to get the rates up before we ever do that and then we'll go to what I would think of as what I call oftentimes a raise and hold strategy where we raise it and then we let that sit for a while. But we are always even in that raise and hold piece adjusting to the economic conditions as they come in. We are not on some sort of course that can't correct if the economy needs more bridling or needs less bridling, but really that's how I think about it. Get you between 4 and a half and 5 is the most likely outcome and then raise to those levels and then hold at that point for some period of time. You said there is a narrow path to engineer a soft landing for this economy. There is a window for that. You think it is possible. That said this week we heard that the IMF downgraded its global outlook. It says the worst is yet to comment it warned about over tightening from global central banks and the possibility of precipitating an unnecessarily harsh global recession. At the same time we also heard from JP Morgan CEO Jamie Diamond who believes we could see a recession in the next nine months or sooner given the impact of inflation on the consumer. They also said in their earnings report that they're setting aside 800 million for loan loss reserve. My question is where do you pin the odds of a recession in the next six to 12 months. It is fascinating to me that we continue to be asked mostly by the media and others about recession. When I'm out in my context of nine western states that travel all over the United States, I'm not hearing signs of recession. I'm hearing signs that we would like to grow more but we can't find workers or consumers saying when is inflation going to go away. My life would be great if we didn't have such high inflation. People have plenty of jobs opportunities. We still have a strong labor market. We have good consumer spending even though it's flat. People are spending. People are doing things that they want. But inflation is the troubling thing. I also point to one more data point that you didn't mention yesterday. I believe the conference board came out with their CEO survey and those CEOs 98% expected some sort of a slowdown. But they all, you know, what I remember from the report that was really meaningful and it's consistent with what I hear when I talk to business contacts workers, community groups, is that people expect the slowdown to be there, but they expected to be short lived and not very deep. And that's a very different landing. That would I in my mind is the soft landing we're trying to achieve. We need to slow GDP.",https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GRIayi6dbGM,55,2022-10-14 17:54:34
3349," for lived and not very deep. And that's a very different landing. That would, in my mind, is the soft landing we're trying to achieve. We need to slow GDP growth substantially to get us back in demand supply balance. The labor market needs to cool further. We're adding over 200,000 jobs per month in the last report. And that's another 100,000 over what it takes to just keep things steady, to just absorb the new entrance that come into the labor market. So clearly we're running fast demand and sluggish supply. Those things have to come back into balance. The Fed's tool, while it's blunt, it does directly affect the strength of demand. And we're committed to bringing demand back in line with supply. You mentioned that business executives expected there is a recession. It would be a milder one. How deep of a recession is the Fed willing to tolerate as you try to quell inflation and bring it down? And frankly, as a recession, what's needed to really get inflation under control? You know, that's not how I think about my work. Actually, we have a dual mandate, full employment and price stability. My job, as I see it, is to treat those like they are. For most people, those things are related. They don't want only one or only the other. And so our job is to ensure that we can get a balance of both, get jobs. Everyone who wants a job can find one, even if it takes a little bit longer as the unemployment rate moves up. They're still going to find a job. And inflation comes back down to something closer to 2% in next year, something closer. And then gets to 2% in the course of the next two years. Those are critical things for us to achieve. And so I'm not thinking of it in terms of recession. I do think of it in terms of cooling the economies and the demand and supply come back into balance. And Americans can go to bed at night and get up in the morning, not worried about whether the prices they pay today are no longer going to be there tomorrow. And they're not going to be able to afford the basic things they need to have their lives and livelihoods. That's what I think. I do want to ask, I do want to ask you about one other economic scenario since inflation has proven pretty sticky. And if that does expect below trend growth this year and for the next couple of years, as your hiking rates to pool the demand side of the economy, what's the risk that a stagnationary environment could emerge and how would the committee approach that? Well, so again, I think of stagnation. That's a, it's frankly a big scary word. But look at the consumer sentiment that came out today. It's rose. And then the future expectation slowed, of course, for growth. But that's consistent with what the economy needs. I think of what we're doing now as bringing inflation down so that we can have a durable expansion. And we know that durable expansions are the ones that are best for the labor market, best for all the groups that we care a lot about. And that high inflation is a tax, a regressive tax. That's literally eating away at the lives and livelihoods of Americans least able to bear it. So when I think of that, I think of slower pace of growth, delivers lower inflation, puts us back in balance, gets us in the best position to grow once again at trend. And I don't have any data right now that suggests that that's not possible. President Daly, I want to thank you so much for your insight, so appreciate it, and hope to talk with you again soon. I look forward to it. Thank you so much. Thanks so much. That's Mary Daly, president of the San Francisco Federal Reserve Bank. We'll be right back.

3350," [""Singatures"". In哲 association with Welcome back to Yahoo Finance, everyone. The US retail spending came in flat in September, however, consumer sentiment coming in above estimates, even as Americans' expectations for inflation, they worsened. For more, on the state of the economy, we have Stephen Rashido, who is the Mizzouho America's Chief US Economist. Great to have you here with us this morning. First, just help us break down the market reaction that we've seen over these past two days to some of the economic data that really factors in everything from prices that consumers are paying to the sentiment from consumers right now. Well, I think when you're looking at the overall economy in this environment, you have to keep in mind, too, thanks. One thing is, if the economy is showing more resilience, then people had expected, given the pace of Fed rate hikes, that's number one. But we often forget that they've only been tightening since March of this year. So it's what, seven months into the process and the shortest possible lag between monetary policy and economic impacts of six months. That's the shortest possible lag. It's a long and durable lag, then need to be sometimes to the much longer lag. So the fact that we're continuing to see inflation remaining stubborn on the upside and we're continuing to see a more resilient underlying economy, always back into the fact that the labor market has not had any major significant change. And this is the critical issue. The labor market continues to be a critical piece of the equation to get inflation down and to slow the pace of underlying economic activity. And in an environment in which we're dealing with a real labor market shortage, it's really hard to do this. And therefore, there's going to be much more additional rate hikes coming down the pipeline from the Federal Reserve. Steve, I don't know if you were able to catch it, but we just had San Francisco Fed President Mary Daley on and she gave a range of potential rates where they would like to go potentially 4.5% to 5%. If we reached that 5% level, is the US economy still growing and by how much? Well, again, I actually have a higher terminal rate at this particular juncture than President Daley has. And that's not surprising. The SEP issue was quoting, did not take on board the latest inflation numbers or the latest retail sales numbers or for that matter, the latest weekly unemployment claims numbers. And the answer to your question is the economy could still be growing because we're going to be there by the end of this year and early next year. So it might not be into the real recessionary environment until we get into the second quarter.",https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GRIayi6dbGM,57,2022-10-14 18:03:21
3351," just we're going to be there by the end of this year in early next year. So it might not be into the real recessionary environment until we get into the second quarter of 2023, given the underlying resilience in the economy. So the answer is we're going to have to see higher rates than are currently discounted in the marketplace and higher rates than she's discussing in her commentary a few minutes ago. Steven, it's Julie here. We've had a lot of folks come on the show and say the Fed is not quite looking at the right indicators and that that means there is this big risk of overshooting. But it sounds like you think the Fed should be even more aggressive or will end up being more aggressive here. So what indicators are you watching right now is sort of giving us a good snapshot of what's going on? Look, and watch the weekly initial unemployment claims numbers. They are the best real-time measure that we're looking at in terms of labor market. And what we're seeing is, yes, people may be losing their jobs, but they're getting alternative jobs very quickly and not showing up either in the claims numbers or showing up in the continuing claims numbers. The labor market is the key here. And given the fact that we have a real labor shortage, this is the battle that the Federal Reserve is fighting against. And this is the battle that they have to win before they can get any declines of inflation that are going to be considered sustainable on an ongoing basis. And until we get there, we're not... Two of those things we're going to know it when we get there. We're not going to be able to forecast it ahead of time. So all this analysis that we're doing about what the terminal rate should be really... It has to be viewed against the live input of data coming in, which is why people at the Fed like President Daly are telling you, we're data dependent. And what we see so far is nothing has really changed that would change our view with regard to monetary policy. And I tend to agree with them as well. Steve, you said in your notes to us that the... By the dip strategy here is misguided. What is misguided about it? And is it still for those who are asking themselves, should I be buying this dip? Is the answer from your perspective still knowing? And the answer is yes, it's still knowing. And the reason for this markets don't really yet discount what's going to come. There are going to be corporate failures. There are going to be banks that have significant problems. There is going to be economic pain that comes about as a result of what the Fed is doing. But the Fed really has no alternative, which is the other thing. See, people seem to think the Fed has an alternative. There is no alternative to what they're doing. Allowing inflation to get embedded in the system is a long-term problem that is going to require even more pain down the road. So the Fed's prescription is take your medicine now, get it over with, and let's get it done with. And I think they're doing exactly what they're supposed to be doing. And I think people keep on wanting to look through to the other side of this story. The problem is this other side of this story could be further out in the calendar that investment horizons are set to. And that's the real reason why it's misguided.

He also reflected a bit on starting home depot during a period of high inflation. If you don't read history, you don't know history. We're right back where we started and we opened up during the Jimmy Carter days and inflation was 20%, interest rates was 20% to some percent. And people were struggling. Manufacturers were struggling. We opened up in the middle of this. And fortunately because of the capital market, we had cash. So we had to pay our vendors ahead of time. We paid vendors the day they delivered the product, which is uncalled for. I mean, it just doesn't happen. But we want to keep them in business. And I can tell you, there are hundreds of manufacturers who are major manufacturers today that we kept in business those days by paying our bills quickly so they could have the cash to buy product to keep their people working. And it was not an easy time. But here we are all over again. We don't learn less. Inflation is killing us. People struggling. You know, a gallon of gas versus putting food on the table is not a place you want to be. But our customers now have that. It's unfortunate. We just don't learn. Just don't learn. Do you feel as though the economy doesn't feel like the same economy that it did back in 1979? Well, it's it was easier. It was easier now to fix it than it was then. He caught her didn't have the tools. You know, he had all these people kept captive in an Iran. He had, he opact really against him. And if you remember oil and gas rationing was pretty horrible. You had numbers so you couldn't get gas if you didn't have a certain number. Well, we have a president that just doesn't believe in that. We're sitting on tons of oil and gas and he doesn't allow us to drill. This is the rocket device.

3353," Now, we have a president that just doesn't believe in that. We're sitting on tons of oil and gas, and he doesn't allow us to drill. It's basically stupid. I can't come up with another word. It's stupid. And we will continue to suffer this inflation, and our people will continue to struggle with high prices. As long as he maintains this facade of climate control versus allowing us to do the things that we should be doing, I don't know. I have people live on a different planet, I think. I feel one day I wake up in the morning and say, where the hell are they coming from? I don't understand it. Why are they defending, not drilling, when in fact climate change? We could put it off over a period of time and do it over the next 30 years, 40 years, and do it intelligently, but not slam down on it and kill everybody today. So it's hurting everybody today, not good. I know you're a big free market guy, Bernie. I mean, that's how you created or helped create Home Depot. Do you mention capitalism a couple minutes ago? Do you think capitalism is under attack in this country? Oh, yes. It's under attack in universities. You have professors who are socialists, who are teaching you to the young people. And we had a poll at one point that was very frightening because it showed that almost 50% of the young people would vote for socialism over capitalism. They just don't know. They get to their hearts, they don't get to their brains. And unfortunately, we have a whole group of people growing up today with a thinking in terms that socialism is good for America, whereas in fact capitalism is what puts food on the table. It's allowed people to grow, allow people to develop economics in independence. And they don't get it. When they get it, it's like so many friends of mine say, their kids were socialists. I put till they got their first job and they took all that money out of their paycheck to pay taxes. And all of a sudden, they became capitalist. So that may be the story. Always an entertaining, entertaining child with Home Depot, Co-founder Bernie Marcus, again, author of the new book, Kick Up Some Dust. All right.

3354," I do know that they were testing this also in the UK and in Asia and it wasn't very successful. I think that one of the big problems there is that a lot of people that are purchasing things from creators like the authenticity factor of it. They like feeling like it's just a creator going about their regular life, making videos about the things that they enjoy. And so I think if you kind of take away that natural element of it, there might be a problem. So I know they had issues getting creators on board in those other markets. So it would be curious to see how that happens here. I mean I always set up a ring light in a camera when I'm doing my plant dead duties in the house. Of course it's authentic, right? I mean but this is a big deal because TikTok reportedly they went through a round of layoffs in July. What does this new kind of e-commerce push really tell us about the future of the company here? Yeah like you said they went they you know they started off with about 1500 employees here in the US in 2020, which is pretty strong. They've been going you know at a pretty great clip ever since then but then as of July they did you know pull back and say that they were going to halt a little bit of their hiring. But I think that's just kind of following suit with what other tech companies are doing at this point. You know they're looking at the economy and they're not really sure what's going to happen. But I do think that you know a lot of their revenue right now is coming from add dollars. And so I think that they're trying to find a way to diversify the way that they're making their money. And they see so many people like millions of dollars at being spent through these affiliate networks like style link and reward style. And they just they want to get a little piece of that. Right it's all about making this advertising kind of element really attractive for the marketers out there, especially knowing that they're looking for conversions. That's why all these platforms are trying to make it more shoppable. We'll see what that looks like within TikTok. Would you buy anything on TikTok? I think so. I have you buy anything on TikTok. Yeah, okay. Oh, all right. Well, I'm behind the curve here. Thanks so much for joining us here in studio. Yeah, we'll find it in Celsipar Barbario.

3355," From red hot inflation data to volatile market swings, we've seen it all this week, and Julie's got some thoughts here. It's time for our winner and loser of the week. All right, so where should we begin, Julie? Let's start the winner. Let's start with positive, right? Because maybe because I have a little more to say about the loser of the week. The winner of the week, actually, if you look in the S&B 500, the best performer on the week is Moderna. And Moderna is down again today, and it's been down quite a bit this year, something like 47-48%, but it did have a positive week up about 12%. Because the big question surrounding Moderna has been what next? Now that it proved the viability of the mRNA platform, not just it, but of course the Pfizer Beyond tech vaccine for coronavirus as well, how then was that platform going to be used? And we got one sign of that. This week, when Moderna signed on with Merck, that the two are going to try to make an mRNA-based cancer vaccine. Now it's early stages, but this is one of the early sort of concrete signs of what we're going to then see from it. So that was one of the winners of the week after the stock has been a loser this year. Soz. And this was some losers, Julie. What do you got? Okay. I got one big loser for you, and that unfortunately for those in the UK is Quasit, Quarteng, who is the now resigned fire, depending on how you want to put it, a chancellor of the checker over there, who had been really closely allied with Liz Truss. And he came out with a letter today talking about his resignation. Of course, he was really the architect, along with Truss, of their big mini budget, which among other things was going to change the check structure that came out of fire for proposing a tax structure on high earners, for example, a reduced tax structure. He sent his letter today. The economic environment has changed rapidly since we set out the growth plan on 23rd September in response together with the Bank of England and excellent officials at the Treasury. We've responded to those events. And I commend my officials for their dedication, the economic environment changed because of this plan coming out. So it's just to come out with a statement like that. Yes, the conditions continue to deteriorate in the UK in terms of inflation going higher, just like it is here in the US. But it's a little disingenuous to say the economic environment has changed rapidly when you were one of the architects of that economic environment changing rapidly. In other words, seeing really a plunge in the British pound, for example, and a lot of pension funds in the UK becoming stressed, and then the Bank of England having to step in and help them with some easing to the system. So quasi-quartong, sorry for him, loser of the week. Loser of the week there. You mentioned depending upon who you asked, whether it's fired or resigned. If it's the BBC- Oh, it's a shit out. You can't put that out. Well, the bricks, they say, sacked according to the BBC. That's it. That's it. All right, everybody. Hope you have a great weekend.

Big banks kicking off earnings season this morning with JP Morgan, Morgan Stanley Wells Fargo and city leading the way. We're going to break down the numbers with speed capital management, CIO, Bill Sneed in just a few minutes. Oil prices down as global recession fears and waiting demand outweigh concerns over supply. The global head of energy at KPMG joined us this hour to discuss the repercussions of the recent OPEC plus decision. And China braces for a historic party congress, President Xi Jinping, expected to secure an unprecedented third term, but concerns about a slowing economy could rain on his parade. But first let's do a quick check of the market action on this Friday. Another choppy session on our hands here after the historic turnaround rally that we saw yesterday. You see all three majors right now in the red, the Dow down 42 points, the S&P 500 down 29 and the Nasdaq down 129. Result season kicking off with some big banks announcing their Q3 numbers this morning. And that is the focus of our show JP Morgan was the headliner topping estimates thanks to higher rates. Those CEO Jamie Diamond once again pointed to hurdles and headwinds on the horizon. That's bringing Bill Sneed, Sneed Capital Management, CIO, Bill, this is kind of the super bowl for you, right? We've got all the big banks reporting today. It certainly feels like if you look at somebody like JP Morgan, we're kind of back to the discussion we had a few years ago. Last year we were talking about low loss reserves being pulled back. Now we're seeing an increase there because of the concerns on the horizon around the economy. Yeah, it's so interesting that after all the work that's been done, these banks have way more capital than they need even during a sharp recession. It's all set up that way. So you've taken the worst of the downside out of the risk associated with these companies because they have a wide mode that they have the deposits of the largest adult population group, the millennials because they have the best mobile banking apps. And now over the next 10 years, those millennials are going to be outstanding customers on the lending side. And if the world does get much tan we want to look back on the accepted share basic building order all that you will see outside. So we let them think too much about what we're looked at.",https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GRIayi6dbGM,123,2022-10-14 18:36:31
3357," population group, the millennials, because they have the best mobile banking apps. And now over the next 10 years, those millennials are going to be outstanding customers on the lending side, what they call the liability side in the business. And then the second picture you got from these reports is Wall Street is stinking and Main Street is doing well. I'll elaborate on that one for me. Well, trading and IPOs and all that kind of stuff is disappearing as a profit center. And at the same time, the average person in the United States is seeing their wages go up quite a bit. So it looks like the have-nots are going to win for a while. And that could be true of the next entire next decade, which is the way that the 1970s were where we had inflation, that have-nots were getting better bargaining position from a labor standpoint. And capital for the most part was treated very poorly unless it was invested in something that benefited from inflation. Yeah, I mean, let's talk about that bit more, Bill. I mean, JPM, one of those names that you do own. Obviously, we look to these bank earnings for any kind of color on where the economy is headed. And yet, there still does seem to be a bit of a disconnect between where sentiment is and where actual spending is. And we kind of heard that from JPMorgan today, when they said they haven't necessarily seen a significant pullback in consumer spending. Yeah, that's a great point and a great question. So about 80% of what goes on in the United States economy goes on regardless. Just go back and look at 07 to 09 and you'll realize that 80% of what goes on always goes on. It's that 20% of variable GDP that the recession hits, right? So if the economy contracts 4%, it means 20% of the 20% that's variable got hit. And so we feel the pain, right? Because people live a lot in that variable part of their life, not in the fixed part of their life. So that's where the concern is, but from an investor standpoint, a company is worth the net present value of the future income stream and the future cash flows. And 4% less for a year in a 20 year time continuum doesn't really change the net present value of a business very much. And that's where people make all their mistakes. They sell their stocks because of recession. Because they're going to get less 4% less affection from the economy. They don't do that with their spouse. They certainly don't do that with their spouse. Bill, you know, another sector we've been watching really closely is housing. And we got some color on that front from some of these bank earnings in terms of where mortgage rates are right now. Home lending originations, at least with Wells Fargo, down nearly 60% in year over year at JPM. That was down 71%. How much worse do you think things are going to get on that front? Well, they've lost all the stupid stuff. You know, the people buying four houses and flipping, you know, all that stuff is going away, all the fluff. And I think Stuart Miller, the head of Lenard, said at best two weeks ago on his earnings call, he says, we're going to manage our way through this difficulty the next 12 months so that we come out on the other side with dramatically larger market share. We own the largest home builders because over the next 10 years, there's 92 million millennials. They were seven years slower than other age groups getting started buying houses and they will buy houses the next 10 years. And that happened in the 70s with high inflation rates. We had the biggest home building boom of the last 60 years in the 1970s with sky high mortgage rates. So that sounds like you're not so cynical moving forward. I mean, you're not, you're not a cynical some others who've said that, you know, these higher rates are really going to accelerate some of the losses we've seen on that side. No, you're talking to a guy whose first mortgage was 13.5% in 1983 on a state buydown. We were anxious to get it because we had one child one on the way. That's why we like you, Bill. Some context there, right? Historical context. Important. Let's talk a bit strategy right now. You sort of alluded to some of these names that you think would be good buys right now. Obviously, you know, sort of the traditional thinking has been that with these big banks, especially they could benefit on the back of higher rates. There's the macro story sort of weighing on that as well.",https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GRIayi6dbGM,124,2022-10-14 18:39:40
3358," Obviously, you know, sort of the traditional thinking has been that with these big banks, especially, they could benefit on the back of higher rates. There's the macro story sort of weighing on that as well. Which one of these names do you think is best positioned to write out some of the choppiness we're likely to see over the next several months? Well, we have owned Bank American JP Morgan since 2012. And if you think people are skeptical of them now, you should go back and relive 2012, right? I mean, people didn't know whether they were going to survive. Remember we had the C-car meetings and the Fed would give them a hard time and wouldn't let them buy back their stock when it was cheap and wouldn't let them pay dividends and so forth. So this tribulation compared to that tribulation is peanuts for these folks. They're way overcapitalized. They're super strong. So we like Bank American JP Morgan. They are the largest deposit banks to millennials because they have the best mobile banking. And now they're going to get to have them as people that borrow money for necessity purposes. And by the way, that's a powerfully positive influence in the economy. And then we love American Express because they're the favorite credit card of the millennials who, despite the fact they're getting married in record numbers this year and going to have kids in X-5 years, will still drag those little kids all over the place on exotic travel with the travel points they get on our American Express card. And I hear you're chuckling. You're probably a customer. Just laughing at the context here. Well, we love to have you on the show. We really appreciate your time today. Bill Smith, Speed Capital Management, CIO. Thank you. Well, retail sales remaining unchanged in September or missing. Economist forecast of a 0.2% rise to help break down the report. Let's bring in Yahoo finances. And that's for a big day to week for you this week. retail sales. What do we see? Yeah, that's right. And so keep in mind that retail sales also, they are not adjusted for inflation. And remember that retail sales include many categories like groceries, a like vehicles, furniture, etc. But two interesting points from this report. First of all, excluding gasoline and autos, retail sales grew by 0.3%. And also what's interesting is the weakness in some of these categories that we've seen. So electronics fell, furniture fell, also auto sales. Those came in weak. So these are some big ticket items. And you could say that, for example, with electronics, well, a lot of people during the pandemic were buying electronics. And now they're using services more and going out more so they don't need more of that. A furniture, you know, that this housing market is slowing down. So you would see a slowdown in furniture sales as well. And auto sales, well, auto prices have gone up too much. And so perhaps this means the consumer is really pulling back. Another big story we're watching and not in the US across the pond here. UK Chancellor, quasi-quarting, ousted by Prime Minister Liz Trost just 38 days after taking that role. Obviously, this on the back of that initial proposal on the tax cuts, which, you know, I think by all accounts was quite disastrous in the rollout. But what can you more can you tell us about the market reaction that we've seen on the back of this? Yeah. So we did see the pound falling. We saw a bond yields being volatile. The 30-year guilt of 11 basis points, the 10-year guilt of six basis points. Prime Minister Trost is saying that the U-turn for this corporate tax cut basically that this is going to reassure the markets. Because we know what the markets did when these tax cuts were announced. And she said parts of the mini budget just went too far. This is to reassure those markets that were going wild. I think it's also to state the bond market as well. Yeah. Put one too far kind of putting it mildly when you look at the market reaction on the back of that. That's certainly a story we'll continue to watch. And that's thanks for that. Thank you. Well, deal making in the grocery space, leading to some big stock moves, shares of Kroger and Albertsons. Both moving to the downside here. After the second largest grocery agreed to buy Albertsons, the deal's valued at $24.6 billion with Kroger buying shares of Albertsons at a 16% premium to its closing price Thursday. The boards of both firms unanimously signed off on the deal. It still needs approval from regulators. And you see both of those stocks taking a hit today. Kroger down about 3.5% Albertsons down nearly 7%. Coming up, bearing the lead, oil supply concerns dominate after OPEC plus.",https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GRIayi6dbGM,125,2022-10-14 18:44:06
3359," A hit today, Krugger, down about 3.5% Alpertzens down nearly 7%. Coming up, bearing the lead, oil supply concerns dominate after OPEC plus cuts, but isn't it demand we should be watching a signs point to recessionary cliff edge to talk energy on the other side? squaredHyun from 7.0S Or the follow-up from the OPEC Plus decision to slash supplies it can be used to present a Biden has suggested a review of the relationship with Saudi Arabia, which is of course a long time Washington ally. The move by the oil producing group stands in direct conflict with Biden's goal of ensuring lower prices for US consumers. And this coming just weeks before the all important midterms here. The US says the Saudis presented no market basis for the cuts. Let's get to Regina May or KPMG's global head of clients and markets. Regina gets a talk to you today. Let's start on that comment that we got from President Biden saying there's no market basis. And yet you look at where oil is trading right now. We're right back below the levels we were at when that OPEC Plus cuts decision was first made. So I mean what does that suggest in terms of where the real fears are at the end of the day? Is it about a potential global recession? And a significant pull back into demand? Well I think the market reacted to the headline of the figure of two million barrel per day cut when the reality is that OPEC is producing three and a half million barrels per day lower than their stated production photos. So I saw it more as just a realization and acknowledgement of what's actually happening on the ground. The one thing that was important was the Saudis are starting to signal that they don't have their capacity. But I think we understand more of the supply side constraints because that's what we've been living with for the last few months and some of the peak pricing that we saw in the summer. Now the price is coming back down.",https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GRIayi6dbGM,126,2022-10-14 18:48:59
3360," But I think we understand more of the supply side constraints because that's what we've been living with for the last few months and some of the peak pricing that we saw in the summer. Now the price is coming back down to earth because I think, as you mentioned before the break, the demand side pressures are where there's a lot of uncertainty. China still not come back fully online. There's lots of concerns now about what COVID could do over the winter. We're worried about a recession. I think that's brought the price back down. We saw a nearly 20% jump in WTI just in the last two weeks and I think it's coming back down to a more realistic price projection. Specifically on the supply side, we had so many oil analysts come out on the back of that OPEC plus decision saying essentially look despite this announcement of 2 million barrels caught a day. At the end of the day, most of these OPEC members do not meet their quotas. What's the realistic number we should be looking at in terms of how much comes offline as a result of this decision? I think the real number that I was looking at is about 800,000 barrels per day because I just looked at what the reductions were from Saudi, Kuwait and the UAE. Those are parts of the world that do have spirk capacity. When I visit the region, you hear different things from the different executives. That was what the real cut was. The EIA is forecasting that the US is going to exceed 2019 production into 2023. I think the world is starting to get a little more comfortable that we have the supply that we need, especially if we face into a reduced demand environment. If we see a really severe winter and we don't see the recession that folks are expecting and we see demand continue to spike, then we're going to see a lot of upward pressure on price. Let's talk about where those prices could move. You pointed to some demand concerns there, especially coming out of China. We're all watching to see what kind of messaging comes from this party congress over in China from President Xi specifically on the economy. You said we're still talking about a tight supply here. When you say upward pressure, how much more upside do you see going into the winter? I'm worried a lot about a potential big spike in the winter. If we have a really, really cold winter, that's where I think we could see prices back close to 100, maybe even in triple digits. But I'm hedging against that. I really think the prices are closer to where they should be. I've said WTI and Brent should be in the 80s. That was what OPEC plus was trying to do is shore the price back up because they saw the market potentially overreacting to some of the demand concerns and not paying enough attention to the supply. So I think that's in part what drove their 2 million barrel per day headline cut, which is just making transparent to the rest of the world what was actually going on. And Regina, I know you can't speak to specifically the political environment in all of this, but it does feel like there are increasing lines being drawn geopolitically when you think about what happened between Saudi Arabia, Slash, Russia, OPEC and the US. And you've got the Western European countries in pushing their sanctions as well against Russia. I mean, at the end of all of this, wherever that end may be, how is the oil market going to look? I mean, how fragmented do you think things could get? I think I keep the same that has always surprised me is there's four fundamentals of how countries and markets need to manage energy. And that first and foremost is energy security. Second is affordability. Third is reliability. Fourth is sustainability. No doubt the climate agenda is huge and we are facing a climate crisis, but the world was focusing more on number four. There's almost like a Maslow's hierarchy of needs. If you don't have the energy that you need and it's not affordable and it's not reliable, then governments and policymakers need to get very heavily involved. And so that's how I would characterize what we're seeing today is the realization your previous gifts talked about the 70s. I'm a child of the 70s. I remember long gas lines during oil embargoes. We're relearning the lessons from decades ago. And hopefully we do a better time this time around. Yeah, a lot of people kind of drawing parallels looking back in time and history right now with so much going on at KPMG's global head of clients and markets, Regina mayor. Good to have you on today.",https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GRIayi6dbGM,127,2022-10-14 18:52:29
3361," I'll be looking back in time in history right now with so much going on. KPMG's global head of clients and markets, Regina Mayer. Good to have you on today. Well coming up the final frontier, Elon Musk, Warren, SpaceX can't help Ukraine indefinitely. So the question here, could the crucial Starling terminals be pulled? And if they stay, who pays? We'll get into that on the other side. Well, SpaceX is saying it can no longer pay for critical satellite services in Ukraine. And it's asking the Pentagon to pick up the tab. That's according to reporting at a CNN. Musk appears to have confirmed the report in a tweet, writing in part. Strange that nothing was leaked about our competitors and space launch and communications, Lockheed and Boeing, who get over $60 billion. Now the same CNN report, reference SpaceX figure shared with the Pentagon. Take a look at this. 85% of the 20,000 Starling terminals in Ukraine were paid for or partially paid for by countries like the U.S. Poland or other entities, who also paid for about 30% of the internet connectivity. Now SpaceX says that costs about $4,500 each month per unit for the most advanced service. Musk has said there are around 25,000 terminals in Ukraine to break it all down. Let's bring in Prague, it's supermanian. And the reason we're talking about this, some context here, is that earlier this year, Elon Musk sort of seemed to apply that we're doing this good thing, where we're going to be donating Starling that this was all being paid for by SpaceX. It's not necessarily the case in this story at a CNN really does point to the cost of operating it, who's funding the bill, and what this means ultimately for the future, because Ukraine has really come to rely on this for connectivity. And what I understand is...",https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GRIayi6dbGM,128,2022-10-14 18:56:40
3362," to the cost of operating it, who's funding the bill, and what this means ultimately for the future because Ukraine has really come to rely on this for connectivity. From what I understand, it's a huge part of their operations against Russia. They need this connectivity. When we first heard about Musk donating the Starlink service, we thought this was free. They were actually out of their pocket, sending them the actual terminals and then paying for the service. But it turns out, it looks at 85% is inputted by the US and actually pulling paying a lot for those terminals. So a little surprise there. Also the odd timing, it's like Musk also kind of noting the fact that after he put out that supposed controversial peace plan and then the Ukrainians were... Queen Russia and Ukraine, which seemed to suggest that he was more in line with the Russian thinking. Exactly, not so much the Ukrainian side and then Ukrainians were upset about that and then all of a sudden, oh, by the way, you get to pay for this. According to the CNN obtained report letter that they sent to the defense department. So, I guess at odd timing here, it's sort of a strange sort of... I really don't understand why Musk would even put out this sort of image that he's actually donating this stuff in actual actuality was not. And it's not a cheap service. Like, SpaceX is not a charitable organization. It is a company that's trying to be profitable and it's cost a lot of money. So I understand that part. But guess what, SpaceX worth 120 billion valuation. Musk worth around 200 billion personally. So I think it's hard for people to sort of round out the, hey, you need to get paid for the service when the actually you guys are actually worth. I've got a lot of money. Neil and Musk obviously never want to stay silent especially on Twitter when he's been getting a lot of pushbacks since that report came out from CNN last night. What have we even hearing from him today? Well, we saw it today. I mentioned that tweet from late last night about how, hey, the LEO connectivity is a very expensive business. It's not cheap. We are digging out of our own pockets to do this. So don't expect us to pay for this going forward. We're talking about 120 million through the end of the year. And then I think 300 to 400 million through next year. So it is not cheap. SpaceX is trying to get their model off the ground. So I totally understand that. So that's what he's saying right now. But I think you sort of caught in the cross here. Is it do you support Russia or Ukraine? And why are you actually kind of debating this right now? In the grand scheme of things, now that we kind of know that the numbers in terms of, you know, what the connectivity, the service itself is going to cost, how significant is Starlink to the future of SpaceX? Because this is something that, you know, it's been getting a lot of attention because this is a real use case in Ukraine. They have to your point really come to rely on this service. But in the grand scheme of things for SpaceX, how big is Starlink? I believe it's, it was supposed to be a big component of their profitability. It's a service that they can offer. Not only is it 4,500 for that high in terminal service, but also it's 50 bucks a month for families and other people to use that in places like India, for instance, like they want to deploy that there. It is a big part of their sort of mission to kind of not only just, you know, send elevators into space with rockets, but also to sort of connect everyone through the world through global satellite internet. So it is a big part of that story and a big part of that profitably component, but I guess right now it's still not fully profitable. Okay, something to watch there. According to Elon Musk. According to Elon Musk, always according to Elon Musk. Pros, thanks so much for that. We're continuing the never ending saga between Elon Musk and Twitter. Core documents and SEAL Thursday reveal that Elon Musk is under federal investigation for actions connected with this $44 billion Twitter acquisition. That's bringing Yahoo Finance is Alexis Keenan, Alexis, what, how many days ago were we talking about? How well, the deal's probably gonna get closed. And here we are talking about another investigation. What is this specifically a lullaby round? Okay, so it could be investigations plural because of the way that this filing is phrased. Now, why are we learning about this? It's because Twitter is asking for the judge in the Delaware case, the dispute over the acquisition that's currently stayed, the trial is stayed, not the case going forward. Twitter is asking for the judge's help saying, we will.",https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GRIayi6dbGM,129,2022-10-14 19:02:30

You can see the Dow off just around 337 points Nasdaq moving to the downside off nearly two and a half percent S&P just below a 3600 off nearly 2% today in terms of some of the other broader movements that we're seeing Russell 2000 that small cap index off just over 2%. Let's take a look at the Philly semiconductor index. We know that has been under pressure and we're seeing that a lot of people are looking at the market action. We're seeing that a lot of people are looking at the market action. We're seeing that recently this semi is falling once again today with that index off just over 3%. 10 year yield moving to the upside back above a 4% you could see the 30 year up another 5 basis points. So you look at some sector action here. Let's start with let's start actually with the laggard in today's broader market action. You're looking at the Nasdaq 100 right now. Apple is looking at the market. We're seeing that with the 4% of the stock. We're seeing that with the 4% of the stock in the Nasdaq 100. Off just around 6% today. Taking look inside the Dow again pretty broad based selling only 5 of the Dow 30 stocks holding on to gains this afternoon and on a sector basis. We're seeing red across the board energy by far.

JP Morgan Wells Fargo, two of those names trading up just around 3% for Wells Fargo city holding on to gains as well up nearly 1%. Michelle. All right, getting you up to speed now on the shake up in the UK. The British pound falling again as Prime Minister Liz Truss replaces her finance Minister Quasi Quaritan with former health and foreign secretary Jeremy Hunt. Truss today also revered the US today also reversing course on another of those proposed cuts on corporations and insisting she will stay on as Prime Minister. The Bank of England has also wrapped up its bond buying program that was in response to settle markets after all the upheaval. Of course, you'll recall the tumultuous three weeks for markets, pensions and the Bank of England itself after Quasi unveiled his mini budget. And that included a raft of unfunded tax cuts that were highly criticised. What a rollercoaster ride it's been in the UK. Alright, let's get you up to speed now on a major acquisition. The second largest grocer for even shopping for even greater markets share. Croger agreed to buy Albertsons at 3410 a share. Deal worth 24.6 percent.",https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GRIayi6dbGM,130,2022-10-14 19:06:36
3364," Grocer for even shopping for even greater market share. Croger are green to buy Albertsons at 3410 a share. Deal worth 24.6 billion dollars. This merges the second and fourth biggest super market chains. Together now they employ more than 700,000 employees and more than 5,000 stores. Little context though, Walmart still has more than twice the number of US stores and employees. How are the stocks reacting? Croger shares down more than 5% Albertsons and buy the rumor sell the news reaction was way up yesterday. Down with some percent today. Both companies boards though. You dynamically approve this agreement, which will have some regulatory hurdles ahead. But again, let's take into context how much bigger Walmart is by comparison if that matters. And now for more on the markets we turn to Invesco. Global market strategist Brian levitt to break down a wild week in the markets. Brian, yesterday we get the bad inflation print. Market skyrocket today. They fall through the floor. What do you make of the last couple of days when you take it all in context? Yesterday was a bit surprising. I mean, you get a consumer price index report that's worse than expected. You would expect the usual risk off trade to move after that. And then it didn't happen. I mean, it happened briefly. Today makes more sense where you've got rates going up again. So we're pushing up short rates and equities coming under pressure. And in my opinion, that's the trade until we get the proverbial pause from the Fed. I think the market will start to sniff it out before the Fed even announces that pause. But CPI report this week suggested it's still. We're still waiting for it. And so I think today's market action makes more sense than what we saw yesterday. Hey, Brian, what do you think needs to happen in order for the Fed to pause? Well, the good news is we've got inflation expectations that are anchored. So that's good, long term. But you're going to need to see a headline CPI come down pretty consistently. And so it'll start to happen as the year progresses. I mean, yesterday's CPI report wasn't great. So if the market goes up 0.4 for the month, consumer price index. If you can 0.3 every month between now and next year, you're at 3.1% year over year. So that's the moderation. That's what the Fed's looking for. And as it happens, as the reports come in better than expectations, that's when the market is going to start to price in that recovery trade, it'll commence even before the Fed admits that they're going to pause. Hey, Brian, just in terms of that hot inflation that we did get yesterday. I think it did catch some at least on the street by surprise. Anything in that report change your view of the markets over the next month or two. Not really. I mean, we all been hopeful that inflation had been hit. It's had peaked and that's probably right. But it's, you know, it's coming down not as quickly as we would have hoped. It's pretty clear that the goods inflation story is behind us. We see the declining commodity prices. It's the thickness and shelters and rents and the bit wages. And so we know that that's going to be a little bit sickier that takes, you know, higher rates takes time to work through the residential market, but will ultimately do so. You know, so the challenge here is the feds data dependent. I wish they were using more forward looking models, because that is going to take some time. But I think it's pretty clear from all of us to all of us where it's ultimately going. So the messages in your term caution on markets were still in a contraction, were still tightening. But inflation is going to come down. And usually when inflation comes down, markets do very well. And Brian, you mentioned looking ahead, obviously, this is a midterm election. Yeah, I know you've been following some of the historical context between midterms and markets, especially with this last CPI print before the midterms. What is history telling us about what we can expect? Well, what you usually find is your two of a presidential cycle is the worst with regards to returns in year three. It ends up being significantly better. Now you could just say that that's a coincidence. But if you want to set a narrative around it or reason it, it would be that it's just one less uncertainty to weigh on the market. The most likely.",https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GRIayi6dbGM,131,2022-10-14 19:11:23
3365," You just say that that's a coincidence, but if you want to set a narrative around it or reason it, it would be that it's just one less uncertainty to weigh on the market. The most likely outcome here is a divided government. Now, it's above my pay grade to tell you which way the House or the Senate are going to go, but I can watch the polls. And it suggests a divided government, which suggests not a lot gets done. And so when you're fighting inflation, you saw this in the UK. I mean, in the UK's fighting inflation, and you get a budget deal that the market views as inflationary becomes problematic. Armit terms are going to likely lead to not all getting done. So not a lot of fiscal support, which I think the market will embrace. The biggest point I like to make to investors is that markets have gone up under all combinations of government. The economy has largely performed the same, whether it's single-party world Democrats, single-party world Republicans, divided government, politics elections don't matter nearly as much for markets as I think investors believe. Brian, you said you wish the Fed used more of a leading indicator rather than the lagging that they do generally look at. What would give, I think Kathy would, by the way, jumped up and said you got that right. But what are those indicators that you wish the Fed would look at that give them a better picture of the inflation story? Well, you've seen financial conditions tighten. We've seen the dollar strengthen pretty significantly. The yield curve is already inverted. So all of those are suggesting a pretty bad economic outcome, or at least a recession. The other thing is inflation expectations. So typically, when you're in a contraction, you start to ease economic policy. You're in a contraction and we're still tightening because we're afraid that inflation is becoming unhinged, but long-term inflation expectations are somewhere between two and a half and three percent. This is not 1974 where long-term inflation expectations were 10 percent. It's a very, very different environment. It's a unique, pandemic cycle. If I'm the Fed and I've got the bond market, 1, 3, 5, 10 inflation expectations telling me inflation's not a problem, it's going to come down rapidly. Why am I tightening so meaningfully into a contraction? This is the risk of an accident. Tighten a lot. What's the what it means for the economy before we keep doing more, but it doesn't matter what I think it's the Fed's going to do what they're going to do and we know rates are gone higher from here. So Brian, in terms of what you're seeing with the markets, what is it signaling about their expectations for recession? For those who don't believe we're already in one, what the expectations are for next year? Yeah, there's a likelihood that we'll have a recession. The major things point into a strong dollar inverted deal curve. We all get that. The question is, what does that mean for investors? We've already gone down 26, 27 percent peak to drop in the S&P 500. The average in recession times is 31, 32 percent. So we've maybe done a good amount of it, but most of the market downturn has largely been evaluation adjustment due to higher rates. The question is, what type of earnings hit you get in a recession? If you figure somewhere between 10 and 15 percent, that could take you to earnings somewhere around 180, 190. If you're willing to pay a 20 multiple on that, then markets are fair value. If in that recession, inflation stays too elevated, valuations are going to come down and we may need to see somewhat lower levels from here. For the most part, the market does a pretty good job of pricing these things in beforehand. Recession seems to be in the cards, but for longer term investors, if you focus on an peak in inflation and how that comes down over time and what that means for markets, usually a buying opportunity, even if there's near-term drawdowns and volatility to have to contend with. All right. So some vital opportunities to be had there on the cons. Invest go global markets, strategies, bright and levied. Thanks so much for joining us this afternoon. All right.

Retail sales following flat in September as inflation runs hot forcing Americans to adjust their spending habits in the face of rising costs. Here to discuss what this means for the economy and Fed policy moving forward, we want to bring in Austin Kool-Zi. We have Chicago professor and former chairman of President Obama's Council of Economic Advisors. Mr. Kool-Zi, it's great to see you. Certainly a lot of news happening this week. We got that hotter than expected inflation print 8.2 percent retail sales out this morning. They were flat in September. Just give us your sense of the economy given that new data that we've been getting over the last couple of weeks. Yeah, thanks for having me back. I mean, I think we're in this transition period and it's a transition on multiple dimensions. One, consumers are shifting back to spending on services from spending on physical goods. Two, inflation continues to be hot. You saw core inflation coming in higher than expected, higher than the Fed wanted. And in an environment like that where the real wage is going down, salaries are not rising as fast as prices. You're going to see some slowdown on the consumer spending front. And I wouldn't be surprised if where you really start to the rubber hit the road, see it on consumer spending on durables, automobiles, and housing, the most interest rate sensitive parts. That's a good issue.",https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GRIayi6dbGM,133,2022-10-14 19:18:17
3367," that the rubber hit the road, see it on consumers spending on durable, automobiles and housing, the most interest rate sensitive parts. Austin, good to see you. What do you think the likelihood of a recession is? And do you think the Fed will at some point call it a win if they get an inflation number around 3% rather than the ideal target of two? I say recessions absolutely a real possibility. As you know, the main cause of recessions, post-World War II, has been the Fed raising interest rates faster than the economy can handle. What we have to hope and for sure what the Fed is looking for are improvements on the supply side, that all the negative supply shocks that in my opinion drove a lot of the inflation in the US and around the world, that as we get out of the COVID times and maybe if the war doesn't deteriorate in Ukraine, we could start to get some positives on that side. That's how you would avoid recession and have a soft landing. But if not, I think that's absolutely on the table. And I don't think the Fed will, you would, from the public announcements, you don't see much wiggle room in the Fed saying, oh, well, if we get one month of beneficial reports, then we'll declare that our job is over here. I think they will need to see sustained slowing of inflation before they're going to think that it's time to pause. Also, what do you think of the Fed's job so far, just in terms of how much progress they have made up until this point? You know, the Fed's gets criticized from all dimensions and all sides. This has been an extremely difficult period for the Fed to navigate what to do. Not just because you have to figure out is the inflation coming from supply shocks, which raising interest rates doesn't fix or from excess stimulus and excess demand, which interest rates could, you also have this whole added bit that our recession was, look, nothing like a previous recession, the one in COVID, because it was concentrated in services. And this issue of pent up demand for services makes the normal Fed job of we apply the break to counteract how fast the economy's growing. It makes that based on no historical record. There's never been any business cycle that looked like this. So it's very hard to weigh off how many, is everybody going to go to Disneyland for two weeks this year and go out to restaurants every night of the week because they've been locked up in their houses for a year and a half? If so, then the economy might overheat on consumer spending grounds, but that's never happened before. So we really, the Fed doesn't know exactly what to do. When you see two different companies in two different sectors, I'm talking Pepsi here, who said we dramatically increase prices, we saw no demand destruction, Delta Airlines, same thing with airfare is up 43% year over year, no waning demand, record demand. What does it tell you the Fed is going to need to do in order to bring, get cost control as they call it? Well, this is back to the fundamental religious divide of, do you think the inflation and the price increases are coming from supply shocks and cost problems? Or do you think it's coming from excess demand? If you think it's mostly from excess demand, then what the Fed is going to need to do is keep raising rates to try to tamp down demand. But do you think it's supply? If you think that a lot of it's coming from supply, and the fact that you've got inflation rates of 10% in Germany, 9% in the UK, and high inflation all around the world, and there's not a single country on the planet that's below the 2% inflation target, those make you think, whoa, will the Fed be able to do anything other than generate a stagnation? So I think this is really the nugget of where we are and what we're trying to deal with. Awesome. Where does this leave jobs and all this? Because we know the Fed has said that we need to see job losses in order to get inflation under control. That, of course, has been up for debate. Where do you stand on that?",https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GRIayi6dbGM,134,2022-10-14 19:22:45
3368," Awesome. Where does this leave jobs and all this? Because we know the Fed has said that we need to see job losses in order to get inflation under control. That, of course, has been up for debate. Where do you stand on that? Well, be careful. The Fed said that they need to see a cooling of the job market. But I think what the Fed is hoping is that they could reduce the number of vacancies without driving up the unemployment rate or putting people out of work. And for a couple of months, at least, they have been able to do that. The job market remains remarkably strong. And if the unemployment rate went from three and a half to four and a half, four and a half unemployment rate is still a very low unemployment rate. There are periods not that long ago where people would be saying four and a half is full employment. So I'm hopeful that the Fed can navigate this with a little good fortune on the supply shark front that they could navigate it without having a dramatic increase in unemployment. If not, if we don't get improvements on the supply side, then we're in the kind of the old fashioned environment where there's just a direct tradeoff. And if you want to get inflation to come down, you've got to administer pain. I'm sure you're always looking at the labor force participation rate, which we can stubbornly be low where it was pre-pandemic. And maybe a million of those people retired and are gone for good. How can the Fed get that labor force participation rate back to where it was? Maybe the million, million and a half back to work? Well, again, be careful. You've seen a dramatic increase from the trough upward in labor force participation. It's trending down to over a 10, 15 year period, partly because you got the baby boom retiring, partly from demographics. And then you've got the two that you got the double whammy of long COVID and people taking care of people with COVID. That's half a million to one and a half million out of the labor force. And then you've had a massive drop in legal immigration into the country. Those two things are longer term, unfortunately, than what we wanted them to be. Hopefully we can get past the long COVID part. But without returning the flow of immigration, I think we're still going to be dealing with this labor shortage type issue for some years to come. Rough road ahead. Austin Gooseby, always great to have you here, sir. Appreciate your time. Great to see you again. All right, coming up, Tesla shares are sliding as we head into the close.

3369," Triple play, the three stocks that we're watching in the final 30 minutes of trading. We've got plug, eutannics and Tesla. So plug, my pick plug power, tick a PLUG at the stock in the hydrogen and fuel cell maker under pressure today. As you can see, they're down about 5.5%. Now that's after warning, full year 2022 revenue would be 5% to 10% lower than the expected 900 million to 925 million that they laid out in their August call with investors. That's now dropping to between 821 and 867 million. Now this is because of timing and broader supply chain problems. And this also means that completion of some of its larger projects is also being delayed from 2022 to 2023. Now the company did say demand for the fuel cell applications and electricalizer business does remain robust. They also expect an accelerated path to profitability and positive cash flows. The stock has had some wild swings though a year to date. It's down more than 30%, but big banks are still bullish on the long term future of hydrogen. We saw Goldman Sachs predicting that hydrogen generation will eventually become a $1 trillion per year market. City Group also bullish on hydrogen fuel cells. And that's despite some of these full starts for the industry. But they see more impetus from policymakers, especially as we consider the energy crisis in Europe really putting some of these alternatives into the forefront. Yeah, Michelle. I think we can sum up what's happening with this stock today, similar to what we've seen from other companies who have guided lower, didn't meet Wall Street expectations or simply is not any room for that in terms of the market today. We're seeing that reflected in the stock price day, which shares off just around 5.5%. Ahead of today's drop, the stock had actually been doing relatively okay for the past three months. It was up 8% over the past three months through yesterday's closing price. That of course, better than the S&P's, a 3% slip during that same time. So obviously a huge headwind here for club power at least in the immediate term as a company does work out some of those supply issues that you were just talking about. All right, my play today is Nutanix. Now the cloud computing company shares a surging. I'm reports that it's exploring a possible sale after getting some takeover interest now. Nutanix is expected to target a private equity and industry players. This is all according to report from the Wall Street Journal. But this deal is far from done. We know Nutanix's market value is currently just around 5 billion. The potential buyer would likely have to pay a very attractive premium. Dave, you're looking at shares surging here. So we could get some M&A news maybe pretty soon when it comes to this player. We don't get much though in this environment. In fact, Q3 saw the worst quarter in the prior five years. It just over $500 billion of M&A activity. And there was only one quarter that was even close to that. That was Q2 2020. What happened then? Of course, the pandemic just stopped the economy and it's track. So not a real good environment for such activity. We shall see. My play is Tesla shares of Elon, ZVMaker slumping to end this week. Though it's our Goldman Sachs reiterate.",https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GRIayi6dbGM,136,2022-10-14 19:31:56
3370," We shall see. My play is Tesla shares of Elon's EV maker slumping to end this week. A week though, that saw Goldman Sachs reiterate a buy rating with a $305 price target, implying 45 percent upside. We can which ARK Invest Kathy would told Yahoo Finance Tesla is a quote solution to the economy's problem. The bad news, well, it's probably the man more than the company. A Twitter filing saying, a court filing Thursday that Elon Musk is being invested by federal authorities over his conduct in the $44 billion takeover deal for the social media giant. And I'm searching for more bad news. I figured that couldn't be enough to justify 7 percent down. Analyst at Wells Fargo have lowered their price target from 280 to 230 citing waning demand for the EV. So that probably has a bigger factor on this 7 percent drop. Down 47 percent. It's been a rough year to date. That appears to be what is pushing a tough day for Tesla, Richelle. And we are seeing some other EVs falling as well. We heard from Morgan Stanley there concern that what they what they might hear from China at the Communist Party meeting might mean some of this trade rhetoric might make it a bit more difficult for the EV space. And China obviously the biggest auto market in the world. It's not really what you want to hear. If you're an EV maker and trying to either get your things manufactured there or sold there as well. Yeah. Yeah. One of the worst performers in the Nasdaq 100 today. Well, coming up next as a Biden administration, it was a chip crackdown on China. Former US Senator and Ambassador Max Bakas joins us to discuss how significant this measure will ultimately be next. Chase Steve Zhao lotta money.

3371," Chinese President Xi Jinping on the cusp of what some are calling his imperial moment. In a break from their prior two-term limit, Xi about to be given a third five-year term as Communist Party leader at the end of the major party Congress that opens Sunday. What does that mean for China? I want, and of course, for U.S.-China relations, Max Balkus, the former U.S. ambassador to China and was a Montana senator for more than 35 years. Mr. Ambassador, great to see you. Appreciate you coming on. Let's start with the latter. Headline of the Wall Street Journal reads, a China prepared for conflict with the United States. What does Xi's extended rule mean for the U.S.? I think he's going to consolidate power. We'll see that after the 20th Party Congress. Xi is very proud. He tends to be more of a Maoist than following a Deng Xiaoping who opened up China. He's very proud of China's tradition and, of course, China's rightful place in history, after all, China began thousands of years ago. He wants China to be a co-equal global power with the United States. I don't think he wants to control the United States. He wants to be a co-equal power. He wants to be respected. I think that's just been goal. So Ambassador, as we look at what's on the agenda for this conference, obviously, you have the zero-covid policy. A lot of people wondering if that's going to get lifted. And also what this is going to mean for economic growth and the strategy in China. Where are expectations for what we're going to hear? I don't think we'll see much change in zero-covid. It's hard for Xi Jinping to change. Xi's going to want to save face. It's a policy that's right thing to do, frankly, they're much bigger country than we population four times ours. Vaccines not nearly as good as ours. He doesn't have a lot of choice. Zero-covid is a, you know, the pursuit. But it's a big problem for the economy, clearly. It's disrupted supply change. It's caused the economy to suffer significantly, but he's not going to change it for a while, anyway. We're going to try to probably spend a little bit more money, showing up the basic industries in the country, instruct banks to loan a little bit more. He sees this as a major confrontation with the United States. That is when he looks at actions we take the United States, the Chip Reduction Act, and more recently, the restrictions on export controls, they're serious. They're very serious. And, frankly, if you look at the rhetoric both sides, they're pretty much similar. Each wants to compete the other, whatever competition means. We're really evolving into a Cold War, despite words to the country by the United States and China.<|zh|><|translate|><|zh|><|translate|><|zh|><|translate|><|zh|><|translate|> In fact, if you look at the rhetoric both sides, they're pretty much similar.

3372," the local economy, but exports, they're doing pretty well, but they know that they're going to prosper long when they have to focus much more on the domestic economy. They'll do what they can, in addition, they're going to really double down on chip production. I can't overefacise the importance of the recent Biden-Notspin on export controls. That's a big shot across China's, you know, Huawei's bad enough. This is much worse in their view. So the economy will suffer, but they're sure going to look and don't forget China thinks in the longer term. And I was serving in China over and over again. I was impressed with how much they think in the long term and also how proud they are and how working they are. I don't overstate it, but they are very proud working people. And we Americans, frankly, don't know enough about China. We don't spend much time over there. We don't know China. And probably that's due to quarantine restrictions that we can't go over. But if more Americans were able to spend more time in China, I think we have a little more realistic view of what's happening. Interesting. What do you think she's extended rule third term means for the likelihood of a confrontation with Taiwan? And how do you believe the United States would respond? Well, those are two different questions. Taiwan is the redest of red lines for China. It's existential. It's non-negotiable. It was once part of China. The Japanese took it over. Shanghai Shack took the nationalist over to Taiwan. It's part of China and their view. There's no question about it. They point out to our one China policy. Say, hey, you Americans, you'd agree there's one China policy. And I think she, Jim Bing, is to try to play the long game. It'd be a slimy slicing. That's very Chinese. And I was really sure learned that a little still a bit here. Step at a time. Maybe a little bit across the Taiwan straits, a little bit here. They're slowly, slowly, slowly. They wake up one day. It's like the frog in the pot of water. It's just all in macro. They're really in charge. Just like they did in the South China Sea, dumping sand on submerged reefs and pretty soon we get islands. They're slowly, slowly, slowly. That's their M.O. They needn't be able to afford to do that, but that's their M.O. They really feel, they don't believe the United States words. When the United States says, we support a one China policy. That's just words. You don't mean that. They look at Biden statements. Biden's four times. It said something that's much stronger than that. And US politicians, in the passage of the Taiwan policy act, really push more and more against that tripwire, which means that China is going to cite enough so enough. We're playing a very dangerous game in Taiwan, in my view. We should continue our policy of strategic ambiguity, but don't support Taiwan too much. We're going to get to the point where it's going to cause a huge problem with China. China is certainly playing a long game. It's got a hundred-year plan. It's certainly a very different game they're playing indeed. A big thank you to former United States ambassador to China Max Balcos. Thank you so much for joining us. Welcome.

3373,". this is the city's city. The quarter bank earnings are under way. JPMorgan city Wells Fargo all beating the streets expectations. Shares moving higher here. As you can see, Morgan Stanley on their other hand is the city's city. The city's city and Kenley on his CFRA research director of research. Ken is great to see you. Taking a look at these results JPMorgan revenue of 10% here. Morgan Stanley missing expectations. Profit of nearly 30% city profit dropping. 25% although better than what the street was looking for. It seems like Wall Street was looking for a lot of things that the US economy is resilient. The consumer is healthy. Business loans are going on. Of course, investment banking activity has really no-stied from last year. The stocks were a lot this morning, but they have really faded this afternoon because the real issue is that they have a lot of things that they have to back performance. Some further weakening of the consumer. It hasn't happened yet in terms of delinquencies or bad loans. But the banks are adding some reserves. Again, today's results is a good picture of what happened from July to September. The banks are going to be going down to 50 basis points and then 25. So, rates do matter. It will create some demand destruction. Unfortunately. So, Ken, within the banking industry, what do you credit JPMorgan doing so much better than some of these other banks? Well, Wall Street also did well. And the real thing is that when you have rising rates, it drives higher net interest income, widening spreads, you can just sit and sit and sit.",https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GRIayi6dbGM,141,2022-10-14 19:54:14
3374," The real edge of the beauty of banks is that when you have rising rates, it drives higher net interest income, widen spreads, you can just sit back and so long as there's a loan activity, you're going to show higher net revenue. Unfortunately, that probably will not be the picture in 2023 because loan activity is going to subside for both consumer and commercial and industrial loans. So that really is what was expected. We did get that fourth quarter probably will be a decent quarter, but again, every time you raise rates, it's really squeezing the U.S. economy more than before, and that's what the Fed has to do to get inflation under control. Can one thing that you mentioned in your note that stuck out to me was JP Morgan's head count, and actually went up 9%. We haven't really seen the reduction in head counts at the bank yet. As you talk about this uncertainty over the next several months, potentially a potential downturn here, what do you think that head count will likely look like? Do you think we're going to start seeing some reduction? Well, it's a great issue, and JP Morgan, 9% increase in global head count. A lot of that is investing in technology, software, taking on the disruptors of Fintech, maybe something from blockchain. But again, you get these senior management around the table in November. There's probably going to be some tactical cutbacks in investment banking, because the book's not going to be there in the fourth quarter, and the pipeline, even if you say it's there, it's not likely that we're going to see some V-shaped rebound in the first quarter of next year. I've been covering the capital markets for a long time, and this unfortunately is going to be a stretch, where it's just going to be tough. And Ken, as we're looking at shares of Morgan Stanley under pressure today, you still have a buy opinion on it, and you have a price target of $90. What is the base case there? Yeah, the base case. So we downgraded Goldman Sachs a month ago from strong by the whole. We kept Morgan Stanley as a buy, and our view was it was trading at a discount to names like BlackRock and Schwab. They're the leading and wealth management that got a high recurring revenue from wealth, but they still have an investment banking business. So it's not our best buy rating, but we're going to state the course. They also have the most dry powder for buybacks, and they had the most room from the Fed stress test last June. So I like what James Gorman and Morgan Stanley are doing, but I'm fighting uphill because the investment banking equity debt underwriting is not likely to be much better in the fourth quarter. MNA probably will take up a debt. Well, so let me be keeping in mind that thank you for joining us with your insights. Ken, Leon, CFI research director of research. Have a good weekend. Michelle, let's take a look at the strong dollar. You've heard it mentioned numerous times. It's a head one for the economy. It's a big challenge facing corporate America. And here is why the strong greenback, while it gives Americans more purchasing power overseas, it also means that US exports are more expensive for foreign citizens. Now the company's most at risk are those dependent on international sales that can take a chunk out of their bottom lines. Money made overseas when it was when it's translated back into dollars, lessons of value given at the current exchange rates. Now it gives foreign competitors an edge here making it more difficult for US companies to remain competitive with those local alternatives. Now Microsoft and Nike, IBM, Deer, AdV, Netflix, just some of the companies to recently warn of the risks that the strong dollar poses to their business. And we know that it's going to be a very common theme on earnings calls this quarter. Since roughly get this 40% of S&P company sales are actually generated abroad. Now to put this in perspective, let's take a look at the dollars jump. Here we were at the beginning of the year below 90. You can see the jump up of nearly 17 and a half percent. Now we're trading right above 113 just off the highest level that we were at in about 20 years. Now in the past year, let's take a look at the dollar versus the euro. And as we pull up this chart on a one year basis, you can see a 19% jump in terms of the strength of the dollar.",https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GRIayi6dbGM,141,2022-10-14 19:54:51
3375," Last year, let's take a look at the dollar versus the Euro. And as we pull up this chart on a one-year basis, you can see a 19% jump in terms of the strength that did the dollar versus the Euro. And taking a look at the British pound, you can see it up just around 22%. The dollars gained in the third quarter was actually the biggest quarterly jump that we've seen since 2016. Bank of America expects the dollar strength to shade 5% to 6% off earnings for S&P companies. In the third quarter, technology and materials, those are the two sectors that they say are most at risk.

And it's a set of the document requests that Holmes has made against Adam Rosendor for as a former laboratory director for Theronos and testified for the prosecution at her trial. She wants some documents because she's got another hearing coming up on Monday that's a big deal and that's her motion for a new trial. She wants to toss out that old conviction for counts of criminal fraud. She's facing 20 plus years in prison on each of the counts that she was convicted on.",https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GRIayi6dbGM,142,2022-10-14 19:58:15
3376," Well, and that's her motion for a new trial. She wants to toss out that old conviction for counts of criminal fraud. She's facing 20 plus years in prison on each of the counts that she was convicted on. So what she wants to do on Monday has everything to do with what's going to happen in a little bit here today. But big deal is Monday. She wants a new trial and she wants the judge to say, we're going to have a redo. And that basis that she's making for that redo, she says that Rose Endorf visited her partner, Billy Evans, unannounced after the trial and sort of wanted to apologize for his testimony. And according to Evans, according to Holmes, partner, that Rose Endorf said that the government made his testimony about conditions at Therno sound worse than they actually were. So what we're going to hear is there's judges going to ask, did you testify truthfully at him, Rose Endorf, or did you not? But look, he's facing perjury if he goes ahead and says, I testified untruthfully. Right. So you're leaning in which direction here? So this is a really big bar to reach for any criminal defendant who's already been convicted to get a new trial is a tough road. So it's not looking like chances are so good for Holmes. But look, we have to listen to what the evidence brings. We have to see if he somehow comes in and recants any of his testimony in any little sliver. I didn't want to put my finger on the scale, it had a feeling that's where he really was. Yeah, your feeling was right. Alexis Keenan, good to see you. Thank you. All right, coming up, we're just counting down to the closing bell on Wall Street. Stick with us here on Yahoo Finance Log. Here's a wedding showcase. We're just a few minutes away from the closing bell for the week for that. Let's bring in Yahoo! Finances and there's for it to break down the market action. Hey Anis. Hey Richel, and it looks like we're going to close near the lows of the session. This was a big week. We had the CPI print earlier this week. We had retail sales today, also bank earnings. The down right now down 1.3% the NASDAQ down more than 3% the biggest loser out of the major averages. And the S&P 500 down 2.4% for the last five days the S&P is going to end in negative territory. The NASDAQ also ending in negative territory. Looking at the sector's consumer discretionary is the biggest laggard today. It's also the biggest laggard for the week as I...",https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GRIayi6dbGM,143,2022-10-14 20:01:57
3377," Hasdak also ending in negative territory. Looking at the sector's consumer discretionary is the biggest laggard today. It's also the biggest laggard for the week as I pull up the five-day chart here followed by technology. And inside consumer discretionary is Amazon in Tesla. Take a look today at the charts for today. Amazon down 5%, Tesla down more than 7% set to close. About 50% below its November closing high. We've also got Apple that's down more than 3%. A lot of red is what we're seeing on the screen on the NASDAQ 100. And over on the Dow, we only have Verizon that's barely in the green, JP Morgan also in the green. In fact, I'm going to pull up the bank stocks here. And you can see a mixed picture. Here's a closing bell for today. And that wraps up a wild week here for the markets. Again, at least for the day, all three of the major averages ending in the red. You can see right there on your screen right around the lows of the day, Dow off 390, 2 points. S&P off just over 2% than NASDAQ. Look at that. The worst performer of the three off just over 3%, all 11 of the S&P sectors closing in the red today. Big of losses. Consumer discretionary, energy and material. All right. Well, let's bring in Melissa Brown, contigo managing director of applied research. And we also have Sylvia Jablonski, Defiance ETFs, CEO and CIOs. Sylvia, let me start with you just in terms of the wild action that we saw this week. It's back and forth. You want to look any further than yesterday's action. After we got that hot inflation print, initially we sold off and then the start and the markets actually spiked. What do you make of the action that we saw? I should agree to see you. I think that this is all sort of par for the course in terms of what we're seeing in the markets. So there's just too much uncertainty right now. So this range ground volatility, whether it's quick pullbacks that feel pretty meaningful and impactful or quick pops that feel pretty meaningful and impactful, I think that the market just doesn't have any kind of steady footing here. And really it's the same old story. We have all three indices in bear market territory. Inflation is sticking around a little bit longer than we would have liked it to. And that means that the Fed and us waiting to hear the news of every great hike is going to stick around longer than we wanted to. And I think that until we sort of get some confidence that the Fed is either going to pause for some period of time or that we see inflation trending downward for a series of reads. I think that we'll kind of see this range ground volatility for the next few months. Yeah, of course, to hold your breath for a pause at this moment. Melissa, you say investors are likely to react strongly to bad news, potentially ignore downplay good news. How in the world than to explain yesterday at S&P snaps a six day losing streak on the heels of a bad CPI print? It is a difficult move to explain. I think we were looking at not relatively low trading volume. And I think it's just that investors, they're getting sick of being negative. They're getting sick of being bearish. And so perhaps yesterday they just decided to say, okay, when market's down a lot already, let's come in. But then today they got punished for that. So tomorrow, Monday, will that happen again? It's hard to say, but with that negative sentiment, again, I would expect that bad news to lead to much bigger downturns. Then good news will lead to downturns. So in Sylvia, in terms of the outlook, that obviously the Fed is not going to be taking its foot off the pedal any time soon. When do you see the opportunities in this sort of environment knowing that volatility is going to persist until we get the Fed to pivot at some point? Yeah, I think it's important to think about which investor we're kind of talking to and what his or her strategy is. So if you're a longer term investor, and I'm going to say three years is sort of the bottom line there, and you plan to hold even beyond that, then a consistent strategy of dollar cost averaging into your favorite quality stocks that have gone from 22 to 15 multiples.",https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GRIayi6dbGM,144,2022-10-14 20:06:20
3378," into your favorite quality stocks that have gone from 22 to 15 multiples, but probably it's a wire span than that and are down to the tune of 20 to 50 percent. Maybe even a wider span of that. I mean, this is a great opportunity for that. Could the market move on you in reverse another 5 percent? It could, but over the long run, I don't think it's going to matter because we've all been talking about this for quite some time, but since the 1950s, kind of a year out after all of this mass, you tend to see those double digit returns. So long term dollar cost averaging, great opportunity for that. In a short term, though, I think you have to be positioned in a different way. I think it's, you know, if we're talking about getting through to year end, you're probably better off holding, you know, some of the biotech and healthcare names, some of the names that are holding up, you know, Merck is one of the few stocks that has double digit returns this year. They pay a nice dividend, United Healthcare, you know, some of these names are not really impacted by recession, the aging population is continuing to increase. So there's just a good story there in terms of just, you know, safety and overall diversification. And if you're like a super short term trader, I mean, there are bare funds out there, you know, you can kind of short the blockchain crypto ecosystem, you can kind of, you know, short some of the tech and some I conduct your names in a short term. But that's sort of, I would say for a buyer or an investor that's a little more on the professional side. So long term dollar cost average is your quality companies, you know, your Apple Amazon Google's semi conductors, you know, the 5G trade things like that that'll play out over time. And the short term may be sick to defensive names like, like the healthcare names or the alternative energy space too is a good one hydrogen solar things like that. Well, so what do you make of earnings season so far because we certainly have started to get the ball rolling here. We had a number of banks report this morning Pepsi earlier this week, actually much better than what the street had been anticipating. Is this a sign that maybe earnings season isn't going to be as bad as bad as we had initially feared? Well, I don't think you can use, you know, one or two good earnings reports as a sign for what's going to happen for the entire quarter. But it certainly is better to start off the quarter with better news than it is if, you know, we were already in the hole because of some really bad earnings reports. You know, the impact of inflation, you know, you were talking about the dollar before, but, you know, we also have the impact of inflation on both the top line and profit margins that I think we're going to get a lot more clarity on what that impact is over the next couple of weeks. But certainly it's hard to imagine we're going to see a positive impact from inflation across the board. And Sylvia, to touch on the same thing on earnings, anything you learn today from the earnings, the big banks, or that you expect to learn next week when we get a glimpse at Goldman and Bank of America. Yeah, I mean, I would agree with those previous comments, you know, a couple of good reports that does not make a good earnings season just yet. It's a great start. What I would say is that I took some solace in kind of, you know, digging into the conversations behind the earnings releases today and one saying that kind of feels good in terms of worrying about, you know, will we have a deep recession? You know, we may have a recession, we may have a light recession, but when you think about the banks, you know, it's clear that they are, you know, well capitalized that, that, you know, you're not in that 2008 financial crisis sort of state of the world and companies like Pepsi, you know, even CarMax and Micron, like some of the companies that have, you know, guided lower come out with, with poor forecast, they still have great balance sheet. They still have, you know, decent revenues. They're, they're falling, but they're decent. You know, so, so I think what I take from this is that, you know, perhaps the bottom of the market comes before the economy bottoms out, but I don't think that the economy is going to have, you know, kind of like that full on recession that a lot of people are worrying about just because the company's sort of the major corporations, bleach of companies are looking a little bit too good for that to happen. All right, great stuff. We'll have to leave it there. Melissa and Sylvie have a wonderful weekend. Appreciate the time. Coming up, President Biden says there will be consequences for Saudi Arabia following OPEC plus a decision to cut oil production. Find out why the Saudis probably don't care after the break.",https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GRIayi6dbGM,145,2022-10-14 20:10:58
3379," This Saudi's probably don't care after the break. The US and Saudi Arabia trading accusations over oil supply cuts, the US now claiming Saudi Arabia pushed other OPEC plus nations to vote to cut oil production last week. Look at the next-day epaulure, someone's gone to the US and the Iran Central Conference and said they've been outlining the dramatic parties of Standards on the transitions would much worse. United States of favor here and there being pretty overt around it about it. So let's recall President Biden did make a pilgrimage, if you will, to Saudi Arabia over this summer. This is after he called the Crown Prince Mohammed bin Salman a pariah for orchestrating the murder of Jamal Qashoggi four years ago. So Biden basically went over to make amends and we know he did that because he wanted Saudi Arabia to pump more oil to get prices down and help with the economic war against Russia. So Saudi clearly has been behind this agreement by the OPEC plus nations, which includes Russia, by the way, to actually cut production rather than increase production. So now Biden says there will be consequences for this. The Saudi foreign ministry, this was unusual. They actually released a statement a couple days ago saying we're pushing back against these allegations that were trying to help Russia out. These were purely for economic reasons that we want to cut production. And you've got a lot of members of Congress now, including some senators who run important committee saying we need to do something like her tail arm sales to Saudi Arabia or find other ways to basically punish them for this decision. So it's getting ugly. So then Rick, in terms of actual leverage, obviously there tends to be a lot of rhetoric when these things come up. In terms of what can actually be done, how much leverage does the US have?",https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GRIayi6dbGM,146,2022-10-14 20:16:35
3380," So then Rick, in terms of actual leverage, obviously there tends to be a lot of rhetoric when these things come up. But in terms of what can actually be done, how much leverage does the US have, either on its own or if it teams up with allies on this? The United States is a major arm supplier to Saudi Arabia and Saudi Arabia needs those weapons because they have a militant foe right across the Arabian Gulf in Iran. Saudi Arabia and Iran are long sworn enemies and there has been a kinetic military action between those two nations in the past. So they need American weaponry, including things like Patriot Air Defense, missile batteries. So the United States could remove some US weapons there to help defend Saudi Arabia. The United States could also decide not to sell Saudi Arabia weapons and say, well, why don't you go to your buddy, Russia, and get weapons from them. Of course, Russia is running out of weapons because they're firing all their own weapons at Ukraine. So that's one thing the United States could do, but it might backfire in terms of the oil markets because we are just going to be somewhat dependent on oil producing nations such as Saudi Arabia because in those nations, the government decides how much oil to produce. That is totally different from what happens here. The US government cannot go to Exxon or Chevron and say, you need to increase oil production by 10% or 20%. And here in the United States, energy firms, they do not want to invest in huge fossil fuel energy projects anymore because they don't think they're going to get their money back. They know this is a declining industry. The Saudi government, on the other hand, can keep making those types of investments. So in the future, I think governments like Saudi Arabia could be even more important to fossil fuel industries than they are now. So President Biden has to think about the long term consequences of anything he's likely to do. So, on the Adelaquat Balancing Act indeed, thanks for breaking that down for us, our very own Rick Newman, have a good weekend. Well, post spreading misinformation continued to mount as midterm elections near. A new report from advocacy group the Integrity Institute tracks which platforms are amplifying the spread of misinformation the most. We are who finances tech editor Dan Howley has the details. So down who made the list? Yes, so this is a list from a nonprofit basically looking at what the kind of companies that we see is social media, giants, Facebook, Twitter, TikTok, relatively new still are doing as far as spreading misinformation, not themselves but their platforms. And essentially what the result is is that Twitter is on top. And the reason for that is because of the fact that the ability to share, reach, we quickly, any kind of content that comes out is so easy. It's a click away, a tap away that it just allows this kind of information to spread this again through the Integrity Institute basically saying that, you know, that is the number one vector for misinformation to spread easily, easily, not necessarily among social platforms. TikTok also very easy to spread that because of its algorithm. And so, you know, just to give you a sense of the type of misinformation spread, it's because it gets more of a reaction from people. This is what we've heard in the past. It gets more of a reaction. People get angered by something that they see. You know, the cat litter in the classroom thing is one that's going on right now obviously. And so people see that. They think it's a wild idea and so they'll start treating it or re-tweeting it or sharing it along those lines. And so that's why Twitter is on their TikTok on the other hand because of that algorithm. Yeah, that's interesting. So I never thought about just the ease of re-sharing something on Twitter. Now, we're not going to get any reaction likely from TikTok. Is there any reaction from Twitter and anything they can do or have been discussing doing here, Dan, that might change this? Yeah, I think it really just comes down to the different companies and their stance on misinformation and disinformation. You know, there was in this report a kind of reference to what Mark Zuckerberg had put out where misinformation, the closer it gets to or the more of a red line the companies put in the sand, the more it'll start to kind of increase the spread of disinformation. Bye.",https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GRIayi6dbGM,147,2022-10-14 20:19:15
3381," or the more of a red line that companies put in the sand, the more it'll start to kind of increase the spread of this information. So when you kind of see stuff that's getting wildly out of hand, companies will put a red line there and stop allowing it to be spread. But you know, it's kind of a moving target at all times. So companies have a difficult time trying to figure out how they're going to set that up. And I think, you know, Facebook has talked about how they've worked on this, though they have pulled back as they're cutting spending. Twitter has talked about this, but Elon Musk doesn't want to have much moderation. And you know, it's looking increasing the lake. He's going to buy it, but hey, you know, it's a day of the week that ends in Y. So that could change. And you know, TikTok, as you said, we're probably not going to get much out of it, though they said they do try to tamp down on this information, disinformation. So, you know, as long as social media is out there, as long as there's stuff that's easy to spread, as long as people are easy to anger stuff that they see, we're still going to see misinformation disinformation. I mean, it's tough. It's 6,000 tweets per second. When you figure in retweets and everything else, it's like playing whack and we're trying to sort this out. A big thank you, Dan Howley there for us. All right. Well, could the iPhone be getting a new look? An analyst who thinks a foldable iPhone could be on the way joins us next. A new warning from the Centers for Disease Control about the spread of Omicron sub variants Angelic Amlani is here with the details for us. Hi, Anne. Hey, Shana. That's right. We've got some concerns about the growing spread of some of the Omicron sub variants really globally. Right now in the US, we know that's and get ready for the alphabet soup that everyone's been talking about. But the XBB is the one that, you know, oversees has been doing a lot of damage. BA for six. We saw in the US climbing a little bit. We also have another one.",https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GRIayi6dbGM,148,2022-10-14 20:23:36
3382," But the XBV is the one that overseas has been doing a lot of damage. B for six, we saw in the US climbing a little bit. We also have another one, the BQ one and 1.1. And so those were two separated joined. They were about 10% of all cases right now. And so that's where the CDC is really keeping an eye. And that's where some of the concern has been coming in recent months. You've been hearing a lot about experts looking at the winter and what the concern over flew as well as surging COVID cases might look like in the pressure that hospital systems might have to face. And that's really what's coming to a head right now. We're starting to see some of these slightly more transmissible variants come through. And that's where the CDC has their warning come in. It we're not quite sure which one might cause, you know, a specific concern for the US yet, but definitely keeping an eye on these and watching and tracking those cases. Especially as we head into the cold, the colder months we want to keep an eye on. Now, Angelie, another story that we're watching, the FDA warning of a shortage of Adderall, what's happening there? That's right. So Adderall, this actually is a couple months old of an issue that is now coming to a head, a Tava pharmaceuticals, which is the largest maker of Adderall in the US, was experiencing some labor shortages. And so that resulted in a shortage of the product as well. And then it puts stress on more generic makers to have to fill the gap. And even there now on back orders. So the FDA has issued now a warning about that notification that there is there is a shortage now. Tava has said that they expect to be able to get back into production and get back into normal production by the end of the month. But those generics might not get back on track until early next year. So it really is a concerning issue right now and just something that's, you know, nothing manufacturing based, but more of a labor issue. And the story that we will continue to watch right. Angelie Camelani, thanks so much. All right, with Apple earnings less than two weeks away, there are no shortage of headlines. Tim Cook, teaming up with Goldman Sachs on bank accounts, a new mixed reality headset on the way, even a report that Taylor Swift music will be featured in Apple Fitness workout programs. Jim Suva is the sitting managing director of equity research out with the new Apple note, essentially saying you can shake it off to those reports of waning iPhone 14 demand. Yeah, I said it. You didn't your price target is 185 that implies a 30% upside. Why Jim? Well, David, it's great to see you again. It's been a long time, but to catch up now as we head into Halloween, it's really not that spooky. The markets have pulled back mostly on the increasing interest rates by the Fed. That being said, consumers, certain pockets are very weak like personal computers. Other pockets like for Apple are quite strong. When you lose or break your iPhone or your AirPods, you replace them very quickly. You don't think about it. Yes, fuel, gas, food and inflation costs have gone higher, but mobile computing and smartphones are here to stay. We believe that Apple has upside and a lot of the press reports about order reductions aren't going to come to pass. Apple actually over orders because there's usually a bottle net or a supply chain hiccup. Those will be remedied. We simply think that pull back in here on Apple warrants a good look at it from investors with a $185 target price. Jim, in that bullet point in your most recent note about the iPhone 14, you also talked about a foldable phone next year. What can you tell us about this? I guess what do you think this will potentially do for Apple's business? Is it going to lure in people that maybe haven't converted to iPhone yet? Or do you think it's just going to help uping the average selling price? Definitely, it's going to up the average selling price. But bringing in more from the Android ecosystem. Right now, there are some Android phones out there. They're doing quite well, but the average price is very, very high. People ask me mostly, what is the business use for it? Hey, it'd be great to be able to walk down the street with maps open and still be getting emails at the same time. Or for those who play video games, have a bigger screen or a split screen, we think it will be...",https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GRIayi6dbGM,149,2022-10-14 20:28:05
3383," on the street with maps open and still beginning emails at the same time. Or for those who play video games have a bigger screen or a split screen. We think it will potentially bring an upgrade cycle, but we want Apple to be able to work out the crease or the fold in the phone. The last thing people want is to open a closet 300 times and start to be a hairline craft in the screen. That's why Apple is taking its time coming to market with a foldable phone. But once people start to catch on that this is what they're doing, the market will bring that forward and discount it and it will be a driver to the upside for people spending more money in the Apple ecosystem in totality. And especially for people who love the gadgets and have been looking for some innovation on the product side, not always on the service line for Apple, which they've been focusing on. That'll be a big selling point. I know you're also talking your note about what we've seen with the strong dollar offsetting some of these supply chain concerns, which is now started to ease. How much of a game changer is that going to be for Apple? You know, it's something definitely to keep an eye on foreign exchanges. Very important, but also note the COVID shutdown in the closures, whether it be in China or other parts of the world, China, India, all these other places that had to have big shutdown. That hurts Apple to front both on the product side and also on the services. The Apple stores are closed. You can't go in and get warranty. You can't get help. You can't get upgrades and you can't get additional peripherals. So simply put, we believe that internationally as COVID gets behind us, yes, FX is a headwind, but we believe that opening up a society of people getting out and going shopping more is going to be a positive for Apple. They've navigated through COVID remarkably well with the hard work of their suppliers, their supply chain and the employees themselves. Once people get back and do more, they start to break their phones, drop their phones and then look to replace them, but simply put, Apple has navigated this very well. FX is negatively impacting all the U.S. companies, but their supply chain has been remarkably impressive. Jim, want to talk some sports streaming here. Apple has the deal with major league soccer, still no deal between Apple and the NFL and this expected Sunday NFL ticket package. What is your expectation in terms of Apple making an entry into sports streaming beyond the MLS? And what do you make Eddie Q had a service to saying we were not interested in buying sports rights earlier this week on a panel in New York? And if I could just tack on one more, how significant is sports streaming for the investor story? Dave, that's a brilliant question and spot on that's important, but that's one of the pedestals they're looking at, but there's many, many, many more. Whether it be movies, whether it be artists and you started off the show by talking about some of that, there's just a lot of content that Apple wants to put on its platform. Yes, my family is on Apple TV, Apple TV, plus we watched up, we stream it. But the amount of content while it's wholesome for me and my family, the number of options is still fairly limited. Any way to increase that is a positive sports, music, artists, entertainment, lots of ways to do it. We viewed as a positive sports can be expensive. You got to do it right. You got to entertain it with people. You got to have the backgrounds, the foregrounds, the speakers, the commentators. It's live. You can't do a repeat. You can't do a retake of it. Other things like movies and contents, they're doing more and more with that. But we expect the Apple TV for it to be plus plus plus as we go down the road to be more and more. But right now it's lacking a lot. Sports is one of those things that it's lacking. And Jim, I want to ask you about this report from the information talking about Apple's mixed reality headset, perhaps offering some of this iris scanning to incorporate payments. Where do you see the Apple ecosystem going and growing? You know, that's a very forward looking question that is spot on and why people should own the stock. It's the ecosystem and the platform. Right now we've been talking about iPhones a lot. And the reality is going down the road. There's no reason why people in education or pilots or other people shouldn't be putting on AR VR goggles. And see what it's like in biology class looking inside the human body to learn. Bingo.",https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GRIayi6dbGM,150,2022-10-14 20:32:45
3384," people shouldn't be putting on AR VR goggles and see what it's like in biology class looking inside the human body to learn. Why developing countries can't get better education in medical sciences. Why to get your kitchen or your house renovated in architect, can't go in and take pictures and you put on headsets and see the different paint colors and where the appliances go. This is all eventually coming. People talk about gaming. Yeah, gaming is important for AR and VR but there's a lot of society that can really do better. You think about the home repair person coming to fix a water heater. They can put on the goggles and learn what's wrong instead of having to go out and be taught by an apprentice for two to three years. AR VR we think is going to be very big for Apple down the road. And this important platform of family of products will just add to the economics that are positive for Apple. I'm looking forward to those headsets. They may not be the first out in the market but they're typically tested and a very good experience. And that's where the magic meet. The hardware plus the software for our magical experience. And that's what Apple is all about. Jim Suga always great to have you come visit us again. Thanks so much for joining us. Have a good weekend. Thank you. Bye bye. Supermarket giant Kroger just acquired a competitor in Albert Sins. A new survey reveals how many companies are looking to make a similar move in the next 12 months. Also be sure to tune in to Yahoo! Finances all markets. Summit Monday starting at 9 a.m. Eastern Moderna CEO. Stephanie Bankel and Target CEO Brian Cornell just two of the many industry leaders joining the program. Get on one of this. Breaking news now. Nikola founder Trevor Milton has been found guilty of defrauding investors.",https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GRIayi6dbGM,151,2022-10-14 20:36:29
3385," Breaking news now, Nikola founder Trevor Milton has been found guilty of defrauding investors. Prosecutors alleged the former CEO lied to investors about his electric truck startup technology something Milton denied. Milton was charged with two counts of securities fraud and two counts of wire fraud. George found him guilty on one count of securities fraud and both of the wire fraud counts. Well two of the largest US supermarkets are merging. We talked about this before. Kroger has agreed to buy Albertsons for $24.6 billion. Now this comes as a majority of executives find themselves altering their investment plans. As we take a look, 93% of CEOs say they've made alterations to investment plans and made geopolitical turmoil and that's according to a new survey from EY. That over half still say they expect to pursue an acquisition in the next year. Mitch Berlin, EY America's strategy and transactions vice chair joins us now. Then you talked about this being that everywhere all at once, similar to the movie, a lot of things that some of these CEOs are having to contend with. How is this affecting the landscape? What were the biggest findings in your study? Well, I think not surprising, inflation is top of mind for all the CEOs that we spoke to. We interviewed over 760 CEOs around the world and 65% of them expect their earnings to be impacted by inflation. That's really due to the input prices, which include labor, raw materials, energy and freight. There's only so much of that cost they can pass back on to the end consumer. The CEOs that I work with on a daily basis actually are looking at ways to take out costs so they can still meet their bottom line and other ways so they can reimagine their business to be a leaner, more efficient version of what they are today. So I would expect it over the next six to nine months. You're going to see a lot of restructuring and reorganizations in corporate America. And Mitch Rochelle, let the intro there with the news today from Kroger and Albert Sins in the surveys at 52% of the CEOs are still pursuing M&A. Any idea just in terms of why and I guess why they would be a little bit more optimistic than I think we would have initially thought at this point. Yeah, well the interesting thing, Sean, is that when we look at the difference between the US results and the rest of world results, the US CEOs are more bold. They know that they need to transact to transform. And they're still very bold on what's going on. They're bold on growth and they know that in order to stay ahead of the competition, the fastest way to get there is to remanate. And you said it's more about prudent deal making. What are some of the conversations that they're having when trying to determine what should be an acquisition versus say a joint venture? I think they're really concerned around not overpaying. The multiples last year were off the charts. And so what we're seeing is particularly with corporates that they're doing much more diligence and making sure they're doing the right deal now for the right price. We haven't seen a lot of private equity in the market over the last couple months. We expect that they will come back as a cost of capital. Continuous to increase. We would expect that the corporates would retreat a little bit because the deals become more expensive for them. But the private equities are still sitting on a lot of dry powder. They'll re-enter the market and take advantage of the lower valuations and that's important for them because I think there was a lot of overpayment in the last year. Mitch, one big trend that we've been following very closely, obviously, is this tightly labor market has spent a huge challenge for companies to lure in some of that top talent? Did this come up in your conversations with CEOs? And I guess what are they doing in order to attract talent to their firms? Yeah, the input costs was a big issue for our CEOs in terms of inflation. And so talent is one of the major input costs. The survey really did not touch a lot on the different things that they're doing to attract talent. But we do know that clearly it's been a significant impact. I mean, unemployment is its lowest rate in what, 50 years now, at 3%. So it is a tightly labor market out there. And Mitch, obviously, we're in a very different place than we were two years ago when the pandemic was first kicking in. In terms of our CEOs and our thinking of the pandemic and the pandemic-related issues that they're focusing on when they're trying to come up with their strategies, what were their priorities? Well, it's interesting because the pandemic is still the number one concern. I think you're earlier segment around the-",https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GRIayi6dbGM,152,2022-10-14 20:41:09
3386," What were their strategies? What were their priorities? Well, it's interesting because the pandemic is still the number one concern. I was listening to your earlier segment around the CDC sort of concern around the rise in COVID. But when the CEOs are talking about the pandemic, they're really using it as a proxy for broader issues. So it's not just the health concerns that we had two years ago. It's the inflation. It's the increased input costs, labor and such. It is supply chain issues that factory shutdowns in China. Those are all top of mind for our CEO. So the pandemic was the number one concern for them. But following behind that, like eight points behind that, though, so a distant second was regulatory concerns followed by geopolitical concerns and then also climate change. Okay. Certainly lots for them to continue with a big thank you. Mitch Berlin for joining us from EY. Thanks so much. Thank you. All right. This week ended with a bang in terms of bank earnings. It continues next week. Here's what I'm watching for Monday. Bank of America reports before the open consent assessment show total revenue climbing by about 3% as rising interest income more than offsets, falling investment banking fees. Tuesday, Goldman Sachs reports before the bell. Estimates calling for net interest income to grow by 31% from a year ago. And while total revenue is expected to decline for a third consecutive quarter at the courting to Jeffries, Netflix also reports on Tuesday. The big question, will they add subscribers after two straight quarterly losses? This on the heels of Thursday's announcement that the ad tier will cost 699 per month. Wednesday, you got Tesla reporting earnings following a disappointing third quarter delivery. Volumes falling short of expectations. Thursday, snap the first of the big tech companies to report after the close and give us a glimpse of the softening digital ad market. We wrap up with Friday American Express reports before the bells to the downgraded MX to sell, warning that the possible deceleration and spending volume is not fully considered by investors. All right. Some breaking news now, the Wall Street Journal reporting that Rupert Murdock is looking to recombine newscorp and Fox corporations. Allie Canal is here with the details. Interesting this was broken, of course, by Wall Street Journal. Right. Which she technically owns. Which will be dramatically impacted by this. What are we learning? I mean, it's very interesting. It's an interesting move. A recombination, right? If you remember, in 2013, these two holdings were originally separated. The publishing side and then the TV and the film side. But at 91 years old, apparently reportedly he wants to re-emerge those entities. And if you think about the brands under all of this, obviously under Fox, you have the broadcast network along with some local television stations, 2B, which is a popular streaming service. And then newscorp is the parent company of Dow Jones. As you mentioned, the Wall Street Journal, HarperCollins, as well as some other news organizations in the UK and Australia. Now, currently, FoxCorp has a market cap of about 17 billion newscorp, roughly half of that at 9 billion. But according to the report, we're in the very early stages of these talks. It's possible. It won't happen. But maybe he's just looking at the media environment right now, because there is a lot of consolidation. We had the Amazon purchase of MGM, ViacomCBS merger, Warner Brothers discovering merger. Maybe he's reassessing what's going on in the landscape right now. It just seems. Trial balloon. Because there's going to be some major blowback, big personalities and big wigs in the media world learning they're going to be back in bed with Fox News. That's going to be... That is true. They're will be. And also just from a completely business standpoint, just taking a look at the performance, we had the one month chart up of both of the companies. But we take a look at the year-to-day chart of newscorp. It hasn't necessarily finished Trump performance for the company year-to-day. It's all 30% through a need of some help. Maybe this is something or what they see as a strategic opportunity here in order to boost the business going. Right, and that's true. And like I mentioned with the market cap too, newscorp, just $9 billion, Foxcorp, $17 billion, maybe they'll take some of that money and help newscorp out there. But that really, to me, is the only main, I guess, motivator for Rupert. Yeah. It's interesting. I was surprised to see...",https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GRIayi6dbGM,153,2022-10-14 20:45:27
3387," this court about there, but that really, to me, is the only main, I guess, motivator for Rupert. Yeah. It's interesting. I was surprised to see this report. I'm not going to lie. Well, it's something that we will, of course, closely follow here. Allie, while we have you, let's stick with the media space because Netflix. We're going to be hearing from the company next week. They report after the bill on Tuesday. The sauce gun, a bit of its momentum back over the last couple of months. But what do you think we're going to hear? Well, this earnings report is going to be very interesting because in the first time for a very long time, it's not going to be all about subscribers. It's going to be about profitability. New revenue streams. Obviously, a big one there is the advertising tear, which we got a lot of details on yesterday, after that announcement from Netflix. If you take a look at the number, so revenue expected to come in at $7.85 billion, adjusted earnings per share, $2.22. And then subscriber net additions, Netflix guided 1 million. That's roughly in line with consensus estimates. I do think we are going to see net additions this time around after the platform shed 1.2 million subscribers in the first half of the year. And I largely think that's going to be because of content, right? Like, DOMER, which we've talked about all together. That's just been crushing it week after week. And then, you know, overall, it's really all going to be about advertising. Analysts are very bullish on this. UBS raised its price target by $52 to $250 a share. Getting that ad tear could provide a 10% boost to total revenue. So that's going to be the main focus. Of course, we have those macro headwinds, potential pressure from foreign exchange. That could impact margins and revenue. But overall, I don't think really investors are going to care too much about that. They're going to want to hear about the ad. It's down the road. We're all waiting to see the impact of that ad tear. All right, Canal. Good stuff. Have a good weekend. Thanks. All right, coming up, if you're interested in buying a pre-owned Rolex, you might be able to get a deal. I'll tell you why next.",https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GRIayi6dbGM,155,2022-10-14 20:53:14
3388," All right, as we wrap up the trading week, let's take a look at some of the biggest stock Movers. First up, a mega deal in the grocery space. Croger reaching a deal to buy Albert Sense for 24.6 billion. The combined company is going to employ more than a 700,000 people across about 5,000 stores. Take a look at the movement that we saw in New yesterday that a deal was imminent sense shares of Albert Sense above $28 per share. Although it looks like it was a buy of the rumor, sell the news type of deal. Also questions about whether or not this is going to be approved from regulators. I think that's a big driver in the stock price today. You see Albert Sense closing the day off just around 8.5% on a two day basis. You're still looking at a gain of just around 2% Croger on an intraday basis closing the day off 7%. All right, let's take a look at Pepsi. Now the company kicking off third quarter earning season on a pretty upbeat no here in a five day chart. You can see that shares up just around 5% the company beating up both the top and bottom lines. Also raising its guidance to find any fears of a slowdown. Sending shares up about 4% on Wednesday. Taking a look at that five day chart, you can see the pop in shares shortly after Pepsi did report. Now third quarter revenue jumping 9% from a year ago while profit expanded more than 20% Pepsi. Now sees full year revenue growth of 12% the latest raise. Mark the third time that the company is actually up to its full year forecast this year. And again, that week to date performance here was shares closing up just over 5%. All right, let's round it out with Delta now the stock jumping a third quarter profit of 695 million as higher fairs. Health offset some of those rising jet fuel prices. Now the carrier offered up beat fourth quarter guidance to noting a resurgence in corporate travel and also signs of a strong holiday rush. A bullish note from Calence sending shares up once again today. You see the second a daily basis at least closing up just around 2% that five day gain there for Delta up nearly 6% and really setting the tone from what we could see from some of those larger carriers. All right, finishing the week strong there. Well market volatility though now impacting the luxury watch market according to a recent note from Morgan Stanley. Now the finance is price to Romanian and watch connoisseur is here with the latest so price what do we need to know? Yeah, you know, Rochelle, as you can't actually buy these watches and stores, you can't actually buy them online secondhand market and that's where they're sort of getting smoked right now from a price point of view, the big three Rolex, Patek Philippe and AP, they come from about 70% of the market. You've seen their prices down at least 8%. The Rolex they tone it down 21%. This has dealers and sort of people that are collect watches, have been flooding the market recently trying to get trying to sell these Rolexes and APs and things like that as their values had kind of shot up. Now we're seeing a weakening macro environment. People are trying to sell into that and that's going to see these prices come down a lot. I do want to say though that watches as an asset are up compared to the markets since January 2021 compared that that's a few top 100 and also compared to Bitcoin. So you still have some value there but right now into Q4 especially you're going to see these prices come down dramatically according to Morgan Stanley. Luxury shopping market has shown very little demand destruction. I assume the retail market is healthy and is there never had a Rolex watch? Is there like a stock X goat as there is for sneakers? Where do you buy these? There are sites like Bob's watches and others that do sell these watches secondhand. They verify their authenticity and things alike. I think Chrono 24 also. So these actually they've taken the stock, they verify and they sell it. And those guys are seeing their stock of watches sort of skyrocket right now. So that's why we've seen these prices like Rolex, down 8%, paddock down 8%, which is kind of dramatic in the last quarter or so. But you see a move like this. I mean lots of questions about what this market is going to look like a quarter maybe two quarters from now. When you see this drop today is this something that they see as a new normal do you think? I think it has to be. There was such a run up pushing the Bitcoin kind of craze. These watches got so much. I mean the draw state owners I think is like average.",https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GRIayi6dbGM,155,2022-10-14 20:54:56
3389," As a new normal, do you think? I think it has to be. There was such a run up, pushing the Bitcoin kind of craze. These watches got so much. I mean, the Drollist Daytona is the thing is like average price, 30,000. You could buy it if you could find a retail for like 13. So that's why we're seeing these corrections happening. Probably we'll come closer back to retail. I mean, why should the second AMR could be way more than retail? It's just out of control. Yeah. Resonate with used cars for a while, right? Like people returning their these cars, they were selling over the price. I do want to say one thing. I was at the vacation recently at the Rome airport. The Rolex are walking. Just to see what's going on. They had watches on display. Can't buy. You can try them on, but you can't buy them. They're just display watches. Wow. I don't get it. No supply. Where are you going in my one if you good? No, God. He's already gone. Prowl, thank you. Have a good weekend, my friend. Appreciate that. Coming up, workers at several California-based tech companies are among the happiest with their pay. According to new report, find out which firm is at the top of the list. And we come back. Music. I want to give you an update on a story we reported earlier in the show. A federal judge has denied a request for a battle-theranos founder, Elizabeth Holmes. Holmes sought documents from the company's former lab director who testified against Holmes at trial. The former lab director may have testified untruthfully at trial. The ruling is a setback for Holmes, hearing on Monday where she's asking for a new trial. We'll keep you posted on that. Well, high inflation, the possibility of a recession, there's no shortage of reasons for employees to be unsatisfied with their pay. But comparably.com compiled a list of companies where staff are the most happy with their pay. We are Adobe Ring Central and Meta, which is interesting because we...",https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GRIayi6dbGM,156,2022-10-14 20:58:40
3390," But comparably.com compiled a list of companies where staff are the most happy with their pay. The top three are Adobe Ring Central and Meta, which is interesting because we haven't heard too many positive headlines about Meta so I was surprised to see them up there. Any surprises for you in this list, Sean? You know, yeah, I would be very curious to exact date that this was taken because I don't think Meta would any longer wish I'll exactly write the in that top five, maybe not even top 20 list. I don't know. We'll see how everything plays out there. And I don't think it was any surprise here when you take a look at the top names in this list, majority of them are tech firms. And we've known that for a while just in terms of the incentives that they offer employees, the fact that they have so many benefits. One Adobe employee was cited in this survey saying that they really appreciate the child care costs. The coverage that Adobe pays for when it comes to their child care up until the age of six. So I think once you have incentives, pay equals what you think you should be making benefits, exceed sometimes what you necessarily expected. It's no surprise that these employees are very happy. I was a little taken aback by the prevalence of California firms on this list. Eight of the top 10 companies in terms of happiness were from the state of California where taxes are through the roof. So clearly they are being compensated for the high tax environment. But what you'll find underneath a lot of these companies is a satisfaction with pay transparency, which is really coming of age, we're going to hear more about that in California and New York. And when that happens, it tends to spread throughout the rest of the country. And I think that is something you're going to be hearing a lot more about in the years ahead. People need to know ballpark what the people next to them are making to be satisfied. Yeah, just clear standard. How you pay and the path to growth will show. Yes. And one thing that was interesting with the people's happiness with stock prices, and when you consider what's been happening with tech this year, the fact that that was one of the things that was considered, I thought I was very interesting. Yeah. It is very interesting. But a good group here, at least if you're in the market for a new job, you need to check out with this list.

The other way is if you're not building cloud native applications, I mean, just to put it in perspective, you know, if you are just doing application development like you did even three years ago, four years ago and are not using some of the things like the container technology or some of the stuff like our Cosmos DB, it's like 100x different, you know, in terms of efficiency. Or using tools like teams and Viva to drive hybrid work because after all, that's a reality we all face. So I think in each layer of this technology, you wanna make sure that you are on the right cost curve and you're using the best tools to drive productivity and your ability to do more with less. So that's what's exciting for us. We know that this is a great time, but frankly, to be having all of these conversations with customers and also making sure and that we're delivering for them. All right, Microsoft, CEO, Satin Adela, thank you for joining us. Thank you so much, Dan. Up next, how record executive Steve Stout is empowering artists and sending shockwaves through the music industry. E blurry news everywhere.",https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=z4hExsMyQNo,1,2022-10-17 14:02:37
3395," Do Steve Stout is the founder and CEO of United Masters and translation LLC. He's a music industry pioneer and advertising entrepreneur who has produced albums for Mariah Carey and Nas and let production for Gwen Stefani and Enrique Iglesias. Funding from Alphabet, Apple, Andrews and Horowitz, and Disney Stout's companies operate at the intersection of technology, culture, innovation, and storytelling. Steve thanks so much for joining us. You've been in the business back when they were trying to legislate hip-hop and back then. Yeah, if you didn't legislate it now as well. Still, yes. And if you didn't have a contract, you just couldn't break into the business. Once talked about being dependent, it didn't take on. Now we have artists talking about being independent. What happened? Well, I think when Prince said it, nobody really understood what he went. He was way ahead of his time. He's a visionary, he's a visionary musically and he was a visionary on understanding the music business. In fact, he changed his name to the artist formerly known as Prince to get out of his contract. But I think just in general, people thought it's Prince, it's eccentric, not that it was actually a fundamental business reason why. And over time, people really started to understand the value of ownership. They can own your name, they own your likeness. It's in the recording contracts. That's the fundamental understanding of a recording contract is that they own you. And as music has gone, digital distribution and TikTok and Instagram has become the new MTV and Apple Music and Spotify has become the new record store, per se, and radio. The value of a record company is absolutely diminished. And that's where United Masters come in because we connect the artists and the creator directly to the distribution platforms. Now I went to culture con and Lena Weith talked about the correlation between show business and the music industry. And in it, I was asking about generational wealth. And she talked about, she's like, you realize that even now, she's like, we give away our intellectual property. Yeah. But she's like, we don't even get money from residuals from streaming. No. So this so same thing, you have a lot of people who are talking about going independent and particularly now with the pandemic, we had so many, you know, what they call the gig economy. People going independent. How do you see this coming up, particularly with corporate, you know, you talk about the studio industry, we're talking about corporate America. This whole kind of like move and they're talking about the great resignation towards, no, I need to become the master of my own fate. Yeah, well, so there's a couple of things that I'd like to discuss. So Lena is correct. If you don't own, you can't create generational wealth. That's the hope, you have to have an asset to pass down. You have to have an asset that keeps putting off money and putting off value or creating value in order for you to pass it to your siblings and pass it to your next generation. So if you sign a record deal and you give away those rights, I mean, you have nothing to pass down. But if you do give your last one comment of over there with me or in the final Flexibility hilarious else. And we are talking about things that are really cheery.",https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=z4hExsMyQNo,2,2022-10-17 14:05:26
3396," to your siblings and past to your next generation. So if you sign a record deal and you give away those rights, I mean you have nothing to pass down. You have this short term financial gain of the money they gave you to purchase those rights. I think what you've seen is this generational, this sort of shift as generations have evolved where we've gone from the indented servant to slavery, to the employee, to ownership. And I think that's where we are. And just sort of to work in the cycle of value creation is like I don't want to be an employee, I just don't want to be employee anymore. I want to own. Even if you work at a company, you want equity. And if you are creative, you definitely want to retain the value of the intellectual property that you created. So that's just the evolution of the way things have evolved. And that's a good thing because those stories that we all grew up on watching, I don't know if it was the five-heart beats, but whatever tragic story of a creator who created something and then looked up and ended up, they didn't own anything. And their name and their likeness in their work was gone. Are not stories that people want to replicate anymore? These next generation of creators are entrepreneurs. And that's actually sighting for me to go from being in the record business and not understanding as the record executive, actually economics of the business. And I tell a lot of people who are friends of mine that work at record companies, they work there. They don't realize that what they're doing is empowering these companies to take these rights. But as I've evolved as a person, we're able to build this business to help provide these opportunities. You see, it opened up a lot of eyes. And that's why out of all the things that I've done in my career, I'm really most proud of United Masters because it's not about me. It's about helping the next generation of artists own themselves. Going to United Masters. So I just remember, you know, people growing up, if they grew up on NPV and making a ban, you look at that, there was a big thing about people weren't talking about ownership, it's like I want to chain. Yeah. How does United, but yeah, people had to chain, but... Jane and Jacket know anything. It's too short to say it. Some symbolism, some short-term symbolism. Nothing that you said that was an equity or asset. And I think too short-wrapped about, you know, it doesn't matter if you're at $80,000 a car, but you live in your mom's basement. Yeah. How is United Masters helping these independent artists come into their own and own their own stuff? What does it do? Well, the first thing that we're providing is a very simple interface so that you can distribute your music. And, you know, when you go through us, you don't have any issues about ownership. But yours, you retain the rights period, right? So we're first providing that. And that's just distribution. On top of that, we also provide brand services. So we have a company translation that works with some of the greatest brands, the NBA, State Farm, AT&T, and many others. And between the brand side of the business and having the artists, we actually make connections. And we've created a marketplace where the brands and the artists connect. Brands want to be on the front end of understanding culture. These artists are creating culture. So there's obviously a synergy there. And we put that together at scale, whether it be sync. So you're watching a commercial, you're watching an instant feed on social media. The music behind that feed, we're trying to provide all that through our independent artists network. So we're providing artists' distribution plus brand opportunities to underwrite a lot of their, a lot of the things they want to do on going their first tour, shoot their videos, whatever they want to do, we have brands that are helping underwrite that and putting money in their pocket. So it comes distribution plus opportunity, which no one else in the marketplace even comes close to providing those services. So you talked about distribution plus opportunity. You started off in the record industry. Why did you make the switch into brand-in advertising with translation? That's a long story, but it started with, oddly enough, but I worked on the film Men in Black, the soundtrack Men in Black. And it was one of these things where the glass is sold 14 million.",https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=z4hExsMyQNo,3,2022-10-17 14:09:56
3397," I worked in the film Men in Black, the soundtrack Men in Black. And it was one of these things where the glass is sold 14 million, and the album sold 10. And the glass is not only sold more, but we were a big reason why the glass was selling, but we got no credit for it at the record company. And I was like, I'd much rather, if we can create culture, and then somebody else monotizes it, I'd much rather be on the side that monotizes it. So it wasn't a coincidence. I knew that music actually creates cultural moments that then creates consumer behavior, contagious consumer behavior, where you got it, I want to buy it, like you got that haircut, I want that haircut, that kind of thing. And I went on the advertising side, the company that did the product placement to put the glasses in the music video and all that, is a company that I first went to, and I left the record business, and I wanted to learn the advertising business, and I learned it. And then in 2004, I left and I started translation. And I've owned the company since 2004. I can't believe it's been... That's... It's 18 years, 17, 18 years. So we talked about branding. One of the things that I want to bring up is, in 2020 after George Floyd, a bunch of companies, Black Square, we're involved in ESG environmental social governance. We care about social justice. Yeah. However, it is now 2022, and we've had more cases since George Floyd. Yeah. How does this whole branding ESG... That's in the DI, diversity offices and stuff. You know, it's sadly enough to say that every time something happens, you see industries. I could talk about the advertising industry for a second. They would say, oh, we got to do better. And then they'd just go right back to what they were doing before. And I wrote a lot about this, because unless the brand say, unless you have a certain amount of people that are diverse, or this is your employment requirements, then why would I be in business with you? I want... I hold you to a standard... Unless it affects your money, these agencies, specifically on a creative agency side, they're not going to police themselves. So then they go around and they go... On the brand side, they go, we're going to put a Black Square. That's not going to do anything. A Black Square means nothing. That's not commitment. That's commitment to somebody, a social media manager, just making a square black. What are you going to do about the infrastructure on your hiring process? What are you going to do about your board? What are you going to do about your marketing campaigns and how inclusive are they? Like, those are the infrastructure things that need to be checked. And unfortunately, what I've seen over and over again is that this stuff, when it's in the top right hand corner of the Washington Post, or the New York Times, everyone cares. Then as soon as it dissipates and something else comes up like the, you know, war in the Ukraine, all that stuff just goes to the side. So nothing really changes. I'm doing the best that we can. United Masters that my companies were hiring with fully diverse, like I'm committed to that. But I've always been committed to that. Like, it's not a new thing. The commitment is real. And now some brands that I will say that has done a really good job and have reached out and said, I want to do better. I'm trying my best to do better. Show me the way. And I'm proud of those partners. Google is one of those partners. Apple is one of those partners. There's some brands like the NBA that is absolutely Adam Silva believes that his core in diversity. So there's some, but then there's others that honestly didn't visit the subject right when the sun is shining on them. And then as soon as it goes away, then they go back to business as normal. Yeah, normal usual. That kind of thing. And it's sad because you really do want your board and your marketing to reflect society. You become actually a much better business when you have diverse thoughts at the table. You become. You make your much. It makes it better. It makes it better.

Thank you so much Steve for shining a light and coming to AMS and sharing these words with us. Hopefully our independent artists who are watching are listening and learning and also those creators out there who want to become their own employer. That's right. Well, thank you so much for having me. It's such a pleasure. And I love the fact that you asked me those questions because I cannot talk enough about helping our people. I can't talk enough about helping independent artists and providing them the tools and the education to own their future. Thank you. Thank you.

3399," the abgeser selections Welcome back to the Yahoo Finance All Market Summit. We're speaking here now with a long time healthcare executive who's running one of the world's largest clinical laboratory networks. It is at the forefront of the testing and diagnoses for various diseases and conditions, including COVID-19. Joining us now is LabCore's CEO, Adam Schechter, and Yahoo Finance's David Briggs. Welcome guys. This is going to be a fun conference. Nice to meet you here. Nice to see you in person. I know. I guess the pandemic's over, right? We just wrapped something up. I wish it were over. Well, speaking of, I think it's clear that the first thing we have to start off with you today, obviously, is just what's the market looking like right now? We know that PCR testing, those testing sites close down. That was a huge boon for you guys. But where do you go from here? Have you been able to return? Well, first of all, we learned a lot from the pandemic. We learned a lot about innovation, about science, about technology. We learned about scale. So at one point, we were able to do over 300,000 COVID tests a day. Since that time, we're doing less and less COVID tests. And as we sit here today, we're doing less COVID tests than what we did at the beginning of this year. But the real question is, what's going to happen as we go into the flu season? We've seen an increase in COVID cases in Europe. And that typically is an indicator of an increase coming to the United States. So a lab quip, we're prepared to run as many tests as we need to. We currently have more capacity than we need. But we're going to make sure we do everything to get people through the upcoming flu season. Are you anticipating a surge over the holidays in cases and ideally in testing? You know, I would assume, based upon what we're seeing in Europe, that there will be an increase in cases and testing required as we go into the end of this year. We'll be prepared for it. Let's hope we don't need it, but I want to make sure that we have the capacity just in case we do need it. So for that capacity, you're maintaining that. And you plan to maintain that, especially for COVID for some time? So we're maintaining about four times more capacity than the current number of tests that we're running. And we always want to stay at a significantly higher number that we can run versus what we are currently running. So we'll continue to watch the cases. If they go us, we're going to increase our capacity again. You know, what we've learned is we can scale quickly now. So we'll be prepared for whatever we need to do as the United States go through the winter and flu season. Good to be able to surge up and down. What about the at home testing part? That's something that at the very beginning, you weren't necessarily very big on. And of course, as you mentioned, innovation, that's something that now we see is a huge market and people are maybe more willing to take tests. Yeah, I think people, if they don't need to go to the doctor's office, they prefer to stay home. And if they don't have to be exposed to other people that are sick or may have COVID, they'd rather stay at home. So we launched Lab Corp on Demand and you can now run over 100 different types of tests from your home. Either you go online and you can order the tests that you want and then you can collect the samples at your house, send them to us or run the test. I can give you the results. Or in some cases, you can actually order the test. Go to one of our service centers. Our phlebotomists can take the blood for you and give you results. So we are seeing people more and more apt to do at home collections and we want to make sure of two things. One, that we continue to communicate with the physicians because we believe that the physicians are so important to the health care of the patient. But at the same time, if patients want to do some testing on their own, we want to make",https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=z4hExsMyQNo,6,2022-10-17 14:23:07
3400," indicate with the physicians, because we believe that the physicians are so important to the health care of the patient. But at the same time, a patient's want to do some testing on their own, we wanna make sure that we give them the results, not only in an accurate way, but in a way that they can understand the results. It was, for many reasons, a devastating pandemic, not just for the economy, but for families around the world, and still is. How significant is silver lining worthy advances, though, in diagnostic testing? And what do you think is the best application when we come out, officially out of this pandemic? Now, that's a great question. And I think the world has a better understanding and appreciation of diagnostic testing today than it did before COVID. And what we've learned is that people want to know more about their health, and not just the United States, but around the world. And we learned that the science and the innovation technology that we've brought to the US has applications around the world. So we're gonna be bringing more of our innovative test globally as we go into the future. But what we've learned from COVID is that you have to be aggressive, and you have to challenge the big scientific issues. Our scientists are remarkable, and the things that they did for COVID, I don't think anybody would have dreamed they'd be able to do. They were just met with these big challenges, and they found a way to be successful. We now need to do that in cancer, in Alzheimer's disease, and in other areas. So for example, for cancer. Right now, if you wanna see what type of cancer people have, sometimes you have to do surgery, take a piece of the tissue of the organ to understand that. Our hope is in the future, we'll be able to do that with the blood test, and those are the types of things that we're trying to... A biopsy. Instead of a biopsy, we're trying to find a way to do it through a blood test. Extraordinary, how close are we to that? We're still years away, and it's gonna take a lot of science and innovation, but there are some tests today that are called liquid biopsies, that are beginning to give us an understanding of how we can move forward and get better and better at doing it in the future. I wonder, we've talked about all the positive and the growth, but obviously, number one, you had to scale up and down with staff for COVID. And secondly, LabCorp really had a really big market when it came to business and employers. How has that shifted with work from home, with the difference in drug testing? We've seen a push for legalized marijuana as well. So how has that all come together in terms of shifting how the business functions? Yeah, that's a great question. And once again, I think COVID had many unintended consequences in the world, whether it be children that had to study from home for a period of time, whether it be parents that no longer wanted to go into the office, leaders had to change. I mean, hopefully I'd become a different leader and I hope a better leader than I was before COVID. But we've learned to have to be more empathetic and to understand that our customers are going through a hard time, that our employees are going through a hard time, that almost everybody around the world is having difficulties based on what's happening in the world today. So I think we've learned a lot about leadership and how to lead through these difficult times. What we've also learned is that you can't be stuck in the way your business ran in the past. You've got to be open to new ideas, to new ways of doing to business. Things that if you would have asked me four years ago, can you actually have these jobs done at home? I would have said no way, we've learned you can. And in certain instances, we've learned we can do things remotely that we weren't able to do before. When it comes to hiring and finding ways to get people employed quickly with our work that we do with employers, we found that a lot of employers are much more distributed now than they were before. So we have to find ways to interact with them as opposed to going on site, but do it through things like at home testing and so forth. Testing when it comes to you guys are heavily involved in drug testing. cannabis marijuana was mentioned there. There is a multi trillion dollar quest for a roadside cannabis tester. You guys looking at that? At this point, we've not pursued that, but we continue to look at every test where we think we can bring science, innovation, technology to make a difference. So in the future, there may be an opportunity for us, but not at this point. So explain to me this at home market opportunity because it seems like on one hand, there's this push for non-clinical spaces. And by that, I mean the retail pharmacies. And we're retail outlets for people to find your tests or the at home option. And one of the biggest conversations throughout this pandemic has been health equity. And this plays a huge role in that. Who has access? Because I know there's a statistic about, you know, every human, every American lives within, you know, Start会?",https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=z4hExsMyQNo,7,2022-10-17 14:27:46
3401," And this plays a huge role in that. Who has access? Because I know there's a statistic about every human, or every American lives within, or 90% of America lives within five miles of a pharmacy. Well, that's five miles. No one's walking five miles from, right? So put that in context of this prospect of an 8.5 billion market by 2030. And what's stake, you've been a leader in testing so far, what stake do you think you're going to have in this market? Yes. The first thing I say is health equity is important. And it's something we all have to pay attention to. And to be honest, there were things we thought we were doing great when it came to health equity. And through COVID, we learned a lot. So for example, we thought by sending kits to people's homes, if they have COVID, we can make a difference. But there's a lot of people in this country that don't have homes today. So there was no place to send the kits. So therefore, we had to find mobile ways to get kits available to people in other parts of communities. Like you said, people live within 10 miles of being able to get a sample to lab group. But 10 miles is a lot for a lot of people. So we continue to look for new innovative ways to ensure that we can bring our testing to everybody across the country in a fair, equitable way. There's still work to be done there. The at-home market's going to be interesting, actually, because I think COVID has changed things a bit. Typically, people said, I want a highly accurate test. But I can get the results in a day or two. But that is fully reimbursed by my managed care plan. For COVID, they said, give me the result as fast as you can. I'll pay whatever it takes in order to get what might not be the most accurate result quickly. I don't think that's going to be the dynamics as we move into the future. So we have to be careful with some of the learnings from COVID and how it may apply to other diseases in the future. So I still think the at-home market has yet to be defined and determined, and there's still a lot more work we have to do. Is the best practical application flew testing at home? So we have flew testing at home. We have a combination test of flew RSV and COVID, all in one test for an at-home test. I think that's a great application, because a doctor can ask their patient to be tested without having to come to the office. But for something like cholesterol or diabetes, the question is, is that a good use of at-home testing? And I'm not quite sure yet. We'll have to see that over time. What about broader costs for this? So on one hand, you have inflation, kind of a big issue. And then on the other hand, you have a lot of focus on health care costs broadly. With this pivot to at-home, you have individual testing shipped out. Is it as cost-effective? Are we looking at, you know, you're able to kind of shift things so it's not increased cost for the patient? So the first thing I'd say is, I think health care costs in this country, and almost every country around the world is a very significant issue that's getting worse by the day. Whether it be the United States or being parts of Europe, we are spending more in health care today than we were prior to COVID, and those costs are increasing. We have to find a way that what we do in health care, including diagnostics, helps reduce cost. The good news is, diagnostics is about 3% of health care spend, but over 90% of decisions are made with some type of diagnostic test. I think that we can show through prevention of disease, detection of disease earlier, things like liquid biopsies in the future of a cancer, that over time, we can help reduce health care costs. I think it's incumbent upon all of us in health care to find ways to help the United States and other parts of the world reduce cost. One thing to help in that capacity would be identifying Alzheimer's earlier, and you mentioned that earlier when we talked here. Where is the science on that finding an early biomarker? It doesn't get the attention. Certainly that COVID does. And really that it should. Where is the science on that? I don't know. So it's still evolving, and there's no doubt that Alzheimer's disease is one of the most significant issues in the world. Every one of us knows somebody that suffers from that devastating disease, and it costs trillions of dollars in cost around the world, not just for patients that have the disease, but for caretakers and other people that are caring for people with the disease. So we are dedicated. We are spending a significant amount of energy and resources in research and development to help find better biomarkers for Alzheimer's disease. Also, some of our pharmacologists are working on new potential drugs and treatments for Alzheimer's disease. I think you need both of those together, because it's not a...",https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=z4hExsMyQNo,8,2022-10-17 14:31:55
3402," Drugs and treatments for Alzheimer's disease, I think you need both of those together, because it's not enough to tell somebody that they could get Alzheimer's disease. You need to tell them they could get Alzheimer's disease and there may be a treatment or things that they can do about it in the future. You've seen the controversy of the FDA approval process when it comes to Alzheimer's drugs. What do you make of that? You know, I have a lot of faith in the FDA. I think the FDA is one of the best regulatory, if not the best in the world. And I think it's just a lot of complicated data that they work their way through. We saw some new data that looks promising and I have no doubt the FDA will do its due diligence to decide whether or not that deserves to make it to the market in the future. You mentioned just a moment ago the idea of costs increasing generally in healthcare. I know during the pandemic we also saw hospitals and other clinical settings where people weren't coming in to get those tests and so it was really squeezing those healthcare settings. Do you anticipate that you're going to feel a little bit of that squeeze with the reduction in people going to get care? Yeah, I mean the first thing I'd say is that our frontline healthcare workers are the true heroes through the pandemic. I mean the people in our hospitals that came in every day are, there are the heroes of the entire pandemic, our frontline workers. But there's no doubt that hospitals are suffering right now and it's very difficult you see in their quarterly earnings how difficult the environment is for them. I think as a country we have to do everything can to support what I believe is one of the best healthcare systems in the world. So I do believe it's going to be hard for them. I do think that we're going to have to find ways to support them. There may be some impact on our business but overall our business is very broad, it's very global and you know it's not just hospital-based, it's also physician and other healthcare professional-based. So I think we'll be okay. I do worry about our healthcare system in general. Those hospitals like just about every profession in this country are seeing an employment shortage. Dyer, are you seeing that across your business and the 100 countries, frankly the trend? Yeah, so we are seeing a shortage of workers across many aspects of our business and I think it's across many aspects of all businesses. So we're doing everything we can to attract, retain and develop the employees that we have. And there's no doubt that the hospitals and other parts of the health system are feeling that same pressure. You do see it in other parts of the world, frankly. And I think it's something we're going to all have to figure out how to deal with. Or acute here. I would say there's other countries that it's equally acute in but I think there's multiple reasons for it. There's some people that don't want to go into an office or into a hospital or into a service center any longer would rather try to find ways to work from home. I think there's a whole host of issues that we're trying to solve for there but it's something that has a healthcare system across all healthcare we have to solve together. Definitely. And when we're talking about the whole world, obviously that's something that we didn't touch on a lot right now but talking about the global trends, do they all kind of align with what you're seeing in the US when it comes to this at home testing as well? Or is it different, especially in remote areas or places that you don't necessarily get chance to get medicines too? Yeah, I think it's a bit different, frankly. I was in Japan a couple of weeks ago and I got into Japan for 25 years. They have a terrific healthcare system. They were interested to hear about at home testing. They don't typically have that. But the first time I've been there in years where they've actually were asking questions about what did we do for COVID, what did we learn, and when I would talk about the at-home collection, there was certainly some interest there. So we'll see. I imagine universal healthcare systems or government run health care systems would be a little bit easier to deal with when it comes to that kind of a market, maybe. I think they all have their new answers. Yeah, of course. Nothing's easier, right? All right, well, Adam Schuchter, CEO of LabCore, thank you so much for joining us, including David Briggs here today. Good to see you. It's such a pleasure to be here. Thank you.

3403, Allright. I'm going to put it on the top right corner of the head. I'm going to put it on the top right corner. I'm going to put it on the top right corner. I'm going to put it on the top right corner. I'm going to put it on the top right corner. I'm going to put it on the top right corner. Welcome back to the Yahoo Finance All Market Summit. Moderna has had a historic rise from a small biotech to a major vaccine player in the past two years. The company just in to a deal with Merck to license its cancer vaccine candidate and has a growing pipeline targeting other diseases. Joining me now to this.,https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=z4hExsMyQNo,10,2022-10-17 14:39:36
3404," in the past two years. The company just ended a deal with Merck to license its cancer vaccine candidate and has a growing pipeline targeting other diseases. Joining me now to discuss all this and more is CEO, Cephan Benzel. Cephan, thank you so much for joining us once again, absolute pleasure to have you with us at this summit. Thank you so much for your invitation. I wanna start off with the news. Obviously that deal with Merck really big game changer for you guys when it comes to just a trajectory of the company you're no longer on your own, you're no longer just a COVID company. Things are moving along, tell us about this deal. Yes, so we're very excited that Merck decided to exercise the option on our personal cancer vaccine. You might recall we've done a partnership in 2016. We are Merck funded the manufacturing infrastructure for cancer, the phase one and the phase two that is still ongoing, the phase two full without we can in 24 this year, so we're the TIP caper morphs now. But Merck decided recently to exercise the option so that we're gonna be 50-bit TIP properties as partners. As you know Merck is a leading company in immunology. The product is being tested in combination with the TIP. And it's really, I think, offering the data is positive when it comes to that in Q4, where we'll be very transformative for patients because that's a personalized product we make for every human being. Nothing would be sequencing about DNA so that could potentially be sort of a guaranteed joint cancer. Yeah, and this, I know you've been waiting for me to ask you about anything but COVID, right? At this point, you're just like, please ask me about more than the COVID vaccine. Well, now's your chance because I also wanna ask about all the other candidates you have in your pipeline. You do have an RSV candidate that you've been pursuing as well as a combo of flu and COVID candidate. So talk to me about that and where we're looking, especially for respiratory diseases that we know are still on the horizon for this winter. What are you looking at when it comes to the timeline for these other candidates? Sure, I mean, as you see, and as you know, modernize a platform company and, unfortunately, most people know us about COVID, we're very of a thankful and grateful for the ability to help that we have with the pandemic and still now we're being on booster. But modernize a platform company. So let's start with vaccines where indeed in addition to the unneuroblated booster, for COVID, we are gonna get in Q1 of 23 or phase three data for flu. And we have feedback from the regulators like BFDA that that's the dish to be enough to fight for the condition of a provoder of a product. So we do the product for flu on a market in the fall of 23 and in a few countries around the world. When as you see RSV goes so calm, around Q1 timeframe, this one's a bit more difficult to know because it's a case basis. So we need to be more physically contacting the disease that we have in the COVID-based pre-study. But that's becoming the Q1 timeframe according to current epidemiology analysis. And now of course, the combination. As you know, we are working with a COVID-19 that's through in a single dose. Also COVID-19 has flu plus R has been a single dose. So you see more than that, we're really pushing the vaccine portfolio for respiratory disease better so for late and viruses. Those viruses that once in a body, I know putting four out, we're working on HIV, working on CMV, EBV, the virus causing mononetrosis for which there is no vaccine on the market. So we are trying to build a very large franchise on vaccine. Then we spoke about cancer a minute ago. And then another big news that we shared at all annual on the day in September last month was some early indication, I think we need a couple more months, but this start to look good in regenerative disease where we inject a MAIN AID, going into your liver to basically give an instruction to the kids that have that regenerative disease for the protein that you and I have in your liver that makes us not sick. And so we think it's a very large opportunity as well. Those products should move very quickly to the market because you know your face went to directly to patients. You do not go in and people on sales. And if you have good signal in the clinic, you go very quickly into people's arms. The regulatory agency helps you to move fast because those kids are no more, they've snatched.",https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=z4hExsMyQNo,11,2022-10-17 14:44:46
3405," And if you have good signal in the clinic, you go very quickly into people's home, the regulatory agency help you to move fast because those kids are no more, there's no treatment to the market for those disease. So that's a third pillar of Moderna. And as we know, our partners at Gerdex have said that before the end of the year, they will fight to be a D&D to go into the clinic. We'll be yet again another fourth technology for Moderna to inhale M.I. in this case, against CCF roses. So you can see the company is very proud, expanding. And in each of those very proud because we're not for, we have a little scale very good. Absolutely. Talk to me about that because it seems like not only do you have the pipeline and the platform but also now you have a robust manufacturing network. So how does that play in with what you built up through the pandemic to what you can now do? And that's the next question. Indeed, COVID accelerated the company by around five years in terms of manufacturing infrastructure. As you know, we took to the Atlantic in no more massage resets, it switched around. But we're also beginning in Canada, we're beginning in the UK, we're beginning in Australia and in Kenya. So very strong network across the world. And so now we can scale this platform. As you know, the pharmaceutical industry is a world of analytical medicine. If you can any great company or bread bugs a company there is no correlation between two other assets because the chemical structure is very different. Well, in case of Moderna, all of our drugs are made into same technology we just changed the order of a nucleic acid, the code of life, the folate of life, like software is made with zeros and ones. And we go out together. If you look at it today, we have 26 vaccine in development. 26, that is almost as loud as the entire vaccine in clinical trial by the rest of industry combined. And you're going to see us doing the same in reactionative disease. If we have good data, we've got texts in the lab. We do the sales bringing many more drugs against lung disease. And again, the cancer vaccine is yet another example of what can be done in Germany that you could not even think about over technology, which is to make a drug for every human being that's different. You could not do that to the small money group. Yeah, absolutely. So tell me about that because obviously, COVID set up the company to do more. You had the validation with getting to the getting your first commercial product out there. And everyone's still, unfortunately, like you said, just knows you as the COVID company. But you are now with relationships with the FDA. You are able to get some of these candidates further ahead. But there also is some competition in some of these sectors, such as RSV, such as cancer. So do you feel like you've set up the company now that you're at a position where you can compete with some of these traditional players? Definitely. I mean, if you look at it in some of our, in this scale, we 46 program, we have more program than most biotech company and looking like it kind of midsize, large for our company. We have many dozens of drugs that are in the lab right, that I will expect in the next 12 to 24 months to move into development. So would I see a world in the next 12 to 24 months where we have 100 drugs in development? I think it's highly possible. And we have a capital for it. We should forget modernize around 17 billion dollar of capital, which is an incredible number for biotech company in only 10 years old. And so we are already accelerating. And I think that from a manufacturing standpoint as we discuss, we have a very broad commercial network. And then in the countries, we are today presenting 11 markets, the top 11 markets in terms of EBITM margin around the world. We're opening another 10 countries this year. And so we're going to be basically presenting most countries and we're not directly present. We're going to use distributors. And so I do think modernize is getting ready to compete with last players that we have done in the vaccine front. If you look at it, you know, G&J had a vaccine, you know, number of other vaccine, you know, AstraZeneca had a vaccine. And at the end of the day, the MRN technology showed the superiority of a product. And they have a need to update the product with a variant very quickly, which is why MRN is the factor of technology now for COVID. So talk to me about the COVID market now. You're still in it. But first of all the sensors information ability",https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=z4hExsMyQNo,12,2022-10-17 14:49:18
3406," the products we've learned very quickly. She's way emanated. The fact of technology now fought for it. So talk to me about the COVID market. Now you're still in it. It's still a significant portion of revenues, right? So you do have to still pay attention to that. Talk to me about the global market. You just mentioned all the countries you're in. I know there's also a lot of focus on the health equity aspect. And Moderna has a track record of slowing down clinical trials to ensure equity to opening up the doors for the mRNA hub in Africa. And also distributing low-tiered prices. So how do you see the company now with all these other candidates playing within that same realm? Do you see this continuation? And do you have the room to continue distributing to low- and middle-income countries as well? Sure. I mean, does that great question? So first, the commitment of Moderna has to fight COVID forever. Because as you know, the virus is not living the planet is unconditional. We believe we have a massive public health responsibility to always update the vaccine, to bring the best possible science to protect people. We believe people are going to need once a year of booster. As you know, this year, it's a virus. It has two mRNA in the doors. But if in the future, we need three mRNA, four mRNA to give the breadth of coverage, we would do so. That is the commitment. And then as we discuss, we're going to combine this with the global vaccine, which is through and over respiratory virus, to make it easier for people to get strong growth protection against many viruses. So to reduce healthcare costs, as we know, when you go to get different vaccination, the cost of administration is a big part. In some hospitals, it's actually higher than the cost of a vaccine. So I think there's a big role we can do there. And in terms of low-income countries, we actually, this morning, we have announced an extension of our partnership with COVAX, what one is running for it. COVAX is available at cost for low-income countries, as you know, the planet in Kenya, that Moderna is building. We've all kept it up, it's yet another proof of our commitments to low-income countries. And so we want the products to be available to people around the world, not only people in America. I'm glad you brought that up. I saw that announcement. And I wonder when it comes to the mRNA platform, let's let me get nerdy with you for a second here. The mRNA platform does have that quick, very strong efficacy that we saw, but also does win. As do most protection, we do see that with the antibody titers. But is this something that you are looking at? Is it something that needs to be changed or tweaked about the platform to give longer, maybe more stable protection? Or is this just how the technology works? So I think we should not forget with COVAX, which is the virus has changed a lot. And if you remember, when the virus was rotating very slowly, that Alpine Demtile 2021, you saw great performance of a vaccine. We should not forget that we've all made from the genetic drift was so gigantic in only one step that I think no vaccine, no technology would have been able to hold efficacy of infection strongly. Because it's thing to antibodies, and antibodies when we've time, that is not linked to mRNA, that is linked to all immune system as humans. The pitat is very important to see is that despite the lowering of efficacy against infection, the efficacy against hospitalization and deaths are still very, very important. And that's because, as we believe, there is very strong T cell immune memory components in terms of technology. So I think it's a bit like flu. You need to get a new flu shot, not because the protein technology is not good. I believe it is really good. But because it's a different virus, and so you need to radicate your immune system for these different virus, especially if you are high-risk. Again, a 25-year-old who doesn't get an annual flu shot, are they gonna die? If they have no common PT, highly unlikely. But a 60-year-old person that has a commodity factor needs their booster, because their antibody is a very important component of their protection. Right, so I'm so glad you brought up the annual flu shots, because we know that people's, the one question that everyone has is, is the code vaccine going to become that? Is it going to be an annual COVID booster for a very long time to come, or maybe for the rest of our lives? And how do you, you know, how do you merge that...",https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=z4hExsMyQNo,13,2022-10-17 14:53:24
3407," going to be an annual COVID booster for a very long time to come or maybe for the rest of our lives. And how do you, you know, how do you merge that with the fact that there's already low uptake of this new variant booster? So I think it's interesting. The uptake is actually stronger than a seasonal clue from the data I've seen recently. So we have to see to the end of a season what does it look like? It's a first time when the beam going in and then it's setting, then the pandemic setting. So I think we'll be smarter in a more fortu. But the correct data surely is a better uptake than the seasonal flu shot. And I think it's going to be a flu, which is, again, if you're 25 or you need an annual booster every year, if you're healthy, you might want it to protect over people, you might want it because you don't want to get sick and miss work or miss vacation or so. But I think it's going to be very similar to flu, where the kids are with people at high risk, people above 50 years of age, people with comorbidity, people with cancer and other conditions, you have transplant. And that's really important to think about. And if you look at it around the world, that is 1.5 billion people. So it's a lot of people that's going to need an annual booster and people that are younger, going to have to decide for themselves what they want to do. I mean, the example I always use is myself, you know, I've been taking a flu shot for the last 20 years, you know, I just found 50. So my first is in my fourth is I took an annual flu shot. Is it because I was worried or being hospitalized? Of course not. I just didn't want to be sick. I wanted to be able to work. And I believe that the best thing we can all do in medicine is prevention. And vaccine is one of most amazing. I've got to we were happy. So I took a vaccine against flu. So I didn't get sick. And so I could, you know, have a normal life and work and take my medication. Do you want my friends to tell me something we all want to be able to do, especially during the holidays? CEO of Moderna, Stefan Benzell. Thank you again for joining us today. Thank you for being in the vision. Coming up, he's finances Dr. Doom, famed economist, Noriel Rabini joins us next with his take on the state of the global economy.",https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=z4hExsMyQNo,14,2022-10-17 14:57:19
3408," Yyhh h claps H o H a e music. Nureel Rabini is a best selling author and economics professor at New York University's Stern School of Business. He doesn't consider himself a pessimist, that his warnings about global economies have earned him the nickname Dr. Doom. And Rubini's predictions have been spot on. Among other events, he foresaw the global financial crisis of 07 and 08. Because he's been so right, everyone from pundits to policymakers wants to hear what he has to say. As the New York Times put it, he's the seer who sees it coming. Rubini's new book, Megathrex, is sounding the alarm about the next great crisis, which he says could be bigger than anything we've seen before. Noriel, great to see you. Congratulations on the new book. I guess Megathrex, a little bit gloomy and doomy, but realistic as you like to say. You have 10 Megathrex that we're facing. And I want to get into all of them. But I was struck by the very last two sentences of the book, which says, fast in your seatbelts, it's going to be a bumpy ride through a very dark night. So just collectively, is the picture right now really that bad? Well, I just spent the last few days in Washington for the annual meetings of the International Monetary Fund and the World Bank. And there are people literally starting to talk about the risk of World War III, literally, because we are in a geopolitical depression. One of the many Megathrex in the book is one that we have now a confrontation between US and the West on one side. And a number of revisionist powers. It's not just Russia, it's China, it's Iran, North Korea, and even Pakistan and effect is an ally. They're essentially challenging the economic, social, and geopolitical order that the US and Europe and the West created after World War II. We have a Cold War, and there's a chapter of the book about the new Cold War. But there is right now that this Cold War eventually ends up into a hot war. There's already a hot war in Russia and Ukraine. This conflict can escalate and get NATO, the US, and allies involved. It's a risk. Russia is seriously threatening using tactical nuclear weapons. The negotiation between the US and Iran on the new pill.",https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=z4hExsMyQNo,16,2022-10-17 15:04:04
3409," NATO, the US, and allies involved its risk. Russia is a seriously threatening using tactical nuclear weapons. The negotiation between the US and Iran on the nuclear deal are not going anywhere, and Israel is saying if they're going to become nuclear and they're one step away from it, we're going to attack them. We'll have another major shock. And look at what's happening between US and China on the South and its China Sea and Taiwan and so on. We are also, unfortunately, in a collision course with China. So right now, as a Cold War, it's getting colder. And economic consequences are severe. De-globalization, decoupling, fragmentation of the global economy, decoubalization, vulcanization of global supply chains, trading goods, in services, in movement of labor, capital, technology, that information is going to be split. Where it divided world, and there will be a world in which it will be more inflation, less economic growth. Because instead of producing the most efficient parts of the world, we're now talking about French-oring, about secure trade rather than free trade. That is a fairly gloomy picture. And there are 10 megathrefts in your book. Let's talk about economics, so for a stagflation, which, of course, is inflation and a stagnant economy at the same time, which we saw in the 1970s. But you said that what we're going to be going into right now makes that look like a walk in the park. Why is that? Well, we are having, like in the 70s, a number of negative supply shocks. Three of them, currently. One was the COVID shock, the light to a shutdown of economic activity, bottlenecks in global supply chains, reduction in the labor supply, and so on. Second one was the Russian invasion of Ukraine. The light to a spike in energy prices, food, fertilizers, industrial metals. And third one, this year is the continuation of the zero tolerance COVID policy of China. Those have led to a reduction in growth and increase of cost of production. And we've lost monetary and fiscal policy of cause inflation, and now a sharp sludano growth, where it was a recession. However, in the book, what I point out is that the era of great moderation, where growth was OK, inflation low, 2%, is over. And now we're going towards an era of what I call great, stucfulationary, and that instability and crisis. On the supply side, there's not just the three negative supply shocks. In the book, I identify 11 other ones that are more medium-long term. They're going to reduce potential growth and increase cost of production, just to be brief. First of all, de-globalization and protectionism. Secondly, reshoring or manufacturing from locusts, China to high cost European US. French-shoring. Three, ageing of population, not only advanced economies, but also in major emerging markets like China, like Russia, like South Korean, so on. Young people produce and save and consume less. Older people don't produce and dissafe. That's inflationary. Four, we are having restriction to migration. In the past migration from South to North, from Puerto Ritch was keeping a lead on wage growth. Fifth, we have de-caplicated the US and China. Six, a broader geopolitical depression. Seven, we have now climate change. And in many ways, creates a reduction in growth and increases the cost of food, of water, of energy, and a few else and so on. Additionally, we have other shocks. We have cyber-warfare. We have pandemics going to be coming more frequent and more virulent because of climate change. Climate change causes more zonal diseases. And finally, we have a backlash against liberal democracy and populism of extreme right on the left because there is a rise in income and wealth inequality. Autoritarian, aggressive autocrats, populists of the right on the left are coming to power. They blame the rest of the world and they go to war like that in Russia. We're also weaponizing the US dollar as a tool of national security and foreign policy that all the system of the global international monetary system is breaking down and that's going to lead to more friction, more cost of production, less economic growth. So on the supply side, these are 11 factors that are medium-long term and on the demand side where under a mountain of debt, not just public debt, but also private debt. This is a debt trap. So central banks have no option by monetizing these fiscal deficits. And like in the 70s, we have negative supply shock. We monetize fiscal deficit, we end up with inflation, recession, stagnation. But we end up also with debt crisis. Why so? In the 70s, we had negative supply shocks, but debt ratios in advance economies were low. So we didn't have a debt crisis. After the global financial crisis, whether debt crisis, mortgage, rate value,",https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=z4hExsMyQNo,16,2022-10-17 15:07:01
3410," We had negative supply shocks, but that ratio in advanced economies were low. So we didn't have a debt crisis. After the global financial crisis, we had a debt crisis, mortgage debt, housing banks, but we had a negative demand shock and a credit crime. So we had deflation. So we could have massive monotony fiscal easing. Today, we have the worst of the 70s. We've negative supply shocks and the worst of the post-GFC period where we have right now that ratio that are higher than ever in history. Let me ask you a question. We have a staff stationary debt crisis. Right. Often recessions or downturns are caused by a lack of demand, but you're saying that this could be caused by supply constraints. Is that correct? How unusual is that? Well, in the 1970s, we had two negative supply shocks. One was the young people were between Israel and the Arab states that led to a spike in all prices. In 1973, the second one was the arena revolution that led to a spike in all prices. This time around, the spike is not just in all prices. Is in all prices, is in natural gas, is in food, is in fertilizer, is in industrial metals, is in the region. Samey conductors, global supply chains have bottled next, they've not been resolved. The zero tolerance policy of China is leading further to this supply bottle next. And as I pointed out, these are just in the short run, Russia Ukraine, COVID-China. There are 11 other forces, there are medium-long term that are all of them also negative supply shocks, reducing growth, increasing the cost of reduction. We've lost monetary and fiscal policy, they lead to inflation, recession, therefore stagnation. Now, another problem you see out there, also an opportunity, is artificial intelligence. A lot of people are pinning a lot of hope on AI, but you see potential downside there. Yes. The downsides are the dual AI machine learning, robotic automation, increases the economic pie potentially, it also leads to losses of jobs of labour income. And initially people thought will be only routine jobs that are mechanical, like some kind of low-value-out-and-look-color jobs. But increasing right now, even cognitive jobs that can be divided in a number of tasks are also being automated. And even creative jobs, that are now AI's we can create actually a script of a movie, or make a poem, or write art, or paint, or even a piece of music that soon enough is going to be top 10 in the Billboard magazine chart. We're getting to a point in which AI is going to disrupt massively also some jobs. This is giving one example. It's only a matter of time until we're going to have autonomous vehicles. It's great, because there are about 300,000 people who die every year of car accidents, two million web series injuries. If we can even reduce that by 99%, social is a great thing. But you have what, five million Uber and Lyft drivers, five million trackers and Timster, their jobs are going to be gone for good, which kind of jobs they're going to get. Initially people have in agriculture, then they move into industry, then they move into services. Now, most of the automation is occurring in services, including transportation. Let me ask you about de-globalization, because it seems to be a big theme. And obviously there's a lot of authoritarian regimes in the world, which are cutting off the WTO, all those agreements. Why is that? What is it in the human being's mindset that goes from democracy to authoritarian and back and forth that seems over time? What does that happen? First of all, there is a backlash against globalization, because globalization led to benefits, the economic pie grew. But like technology, it led to winners and losers. And we did not compensate or give new jobs to the losers. Also people in low-value-added industry, but now even services are losing their jobs in income. That's why there's a backlash. They're also environmental issues. Now there is geopolitics, like French-oring and security trade and so on and so on. I think that they rise of these authoritarian regimes of extreme right and left. And by the way, Putin in Russia is Erdogan in Turkey, is Kazin in Poland, is urban in Hungary, is melonian out in Italy, is this Swedish Democrats right now that just won in Sweden, is the Brexit decision. It was on the right, of course, the election of Trump. And there are also populists of the left. In Argentina, there used to be populists of the left in Venezuela. But in the last year in Peru, in Chile and Colombia.",https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=z4hExsMyQNo,17,2022-10-17 15:10:41
3411," The election of Trump, and there are also populists of the left. In Argentina, there used to be populists of the left. In Venezuela, but in the last year, in Peru, in Chile, in Colombia, and most likely in the elections in Brazil, populists of the extreme left are going to come to power. I think that it's driven mostly by economic malice. When there is a rise in income and wealth inequality, and we've seen it across the world, in advance, it's emerging markets, those who are left behind, and it doesn't matter whether they vote for the right or the left, those who vote for the right are usually socially and religiously conservative, those who vote for the left tend to be liberal. But on economic issues, they're nativists, they're nationalists, they're against migration, they're against free markets, they're against the forces of economic reform. Why? Because they're left behind, and they blame the elites, economic, financial, political, for leaving them behind. That's why there is a severe economic reason behind this backlash against liberal democracy, and extreme populists who are the right on the left. But as we know, populists who are the right on the left doesn't lead to economic opportunity. Eventually, it's to inflation, stagnation, and financial disaster and default. How were it should we be about the US-China relationship? It's a very serious issue. I believe that we are already for sure in a cold war, and we'll have a decoupling between US and China, trade in goods, in services, in the movement of labor, of capital, investments, but more importantly, right now, everything that's important is to do with technology, data, and information that is from a national security point of view, severe and important. So the decoupling is occurring. The cold war between US and China in terms of overall political and geopolitical relations is becoming worse. And the reason why Xi Jinping right now is seeking a third time and possibly a fourth is not because he wants to pass to a history as the man who reformed China, is because he wants to pass to a history as the man that united in England with Taiwan. So I believe the next five to 10 years is going to be the time where there's going to be a confrontation between US and China on the issue of Taiwan, and that could be a trigger of this cold war becoming a hot war. We don't know whether it's going to happen, how's it going to be resolved, but that's where we get to World War III, among other things. But in some sense, World War III has already started, it's started in Ukraine, because this conflict has broadening implications that are going well beyond Russian Ukraine. And it's the beginning of something else. You didn't mention climate change, so I'm assuming you're not worried about that. Well, there's a full chapter about an unhabitable planet, about climate change. And it's a long discussion, but there's a lot of talk about doing something about climate change. There's a lot of talk about ESG investment, environmental, social and governance and so on. But reality is a lot of it is greenwashing. A lot of it is green wishing. A lot of it is green fig leaves, or people would say we're going to do something, governments, firms, individual. They're doing nothing. Glass will and cop was a total failure. At the current level, we're headed towards an increase of temperature by the end of the century of three degrees. Even two will be a disaster. Three means that half of the world will be in places that are either underwater or too hot to live. And if you worry about a few hundred thousand migrants from Central America moving here, wait until they be. Not a few hundred thousand, but millions or billions of people who have to move from places that you cannot live to other parts of the world. That's going to be an economic and financial disaster. All these mega threats, scenario. Yes. What can we do about them? Well, in the book, after they 10 chapters, when I discussed them one by one, in each one of them there are solutions, there are two paths for the future. One is dystopian and the other one, what I call utopian or less dystopian. In the dystopian one, of course, all these things feed on each other and there's an interaction between each other and them. And then we end up into essentially disaster. We can destroy each other with a nuclear war, with geopolitical collapse, with climate change, with financial meltdowns, with collapse of liberal democracy, with pandemics and you name it. There is another path in which we have policies, the national level, and international levels slowly, slowly resolve this problem and therefore the future. Maybe it's not utopian, but we avoid the disaster. It's still a challenged future. It's one that has lots of trouble, but we manage it. However, in the epilogue of the book, after this 11-12 chapter, I say from my point of view, I believe that the dystopian one, as of now, is more likely than the utopian. So the utopian, of course, the bizarre...",https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=z4hExsMyQNo,18,2022-10-17 15:15:17
3412," After this 12, 11, 12 chapter, I say from my point of view, I believe that the dystopian one, as of now, is more likely than the utopian. So the utopian, of course, is the desirable one. The question is whether it's a political will, domestically, internationally, to cooperate, and collaborate, to avoid an incoming, meltdown, and disaster. I fear not. Quick, two-part last question. What do you think of the nickname, Dr. Doom, which is what people call you, number one? And number two, are you ever optimistic? First of all, I usually say that Dr. Realist, not Dr. Doom, but is more catchy than we call Dr. Doom. And I think that warning about the risk is very important. Because until now, we've been kicking the count down the road. We've been sticking our head under the sun like Austria. And right now, we're facing major, megatrade, economic, monetary, financial, social, political, geopolitical, environmental, health, trade, and technological. And unless we address them, we're headed towards disaster. So it's worth to have people like myself who warn you about the risk. And for every problem, there is a solution. But at this point, we cannot keep on kicking the hand down the road, reaching the point in which these things are going to materialize in a way in which not only in the next 10 years, each one of these megatrades that I discuss about the next decade is materializing today. If you look at one by one, that inflation, stagnation, environment, geopolitics, pandemics, and generalize things that happen today. So we have to worry about it today, not about the future. No, Yel Roubini. Thank you so much for joining us. Coming up, new challenges present new opportunities. How Yahoo CEO Jim Landzone plans to take this internet pioneer into the future?",https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=z4hExsMyQNo,19,2022-10-17 15:19:54
3413," vi Me you Jim Lenzone is the CEO of Yahoo. With more than 20 years of leadership experience in technology and media, he's built a track record of driving growth and innovation. In a world where internet companies come and go, Lenzone's big opportunities for Yahoo, which is still one of the most popular websites nearly 30 years after it was founded. Before coming to Yahoo, Lenzone served as CEO of Tinder, the highest-grossing non-gaming app in the world. He was also president and CEO of CBS Interactive and the first Chief Digital Officer in the history of CBS. And let's welcome Jim Lenzone into the Yahoo Finance. You're first time. First time? First time? I'm a rookie. I'm glad to finally be here. Downstairs from my office. Welcome. We work in the same building. Don't always get you down here. As we just pointed out, you have been at the helm of some major companies that I think a lot of viewers are familiar with. CBS Interactive Tinder-as-G's if we want to go back. But I want to start with a company that I think some viewers may not be as familiar with, which is E-Tour. And that is of course a startup that you founded back in the 90s. And it was right in the middle of the.com boom. And I want to start there because I get the sense in looking through a lot of your interviews that your experience in the.com boom, the Intu-In Crash, has really informed a lot of how you think about operating these companies. So my question to you is how do you think about that period of time? And knowing what you experienced then, how do you view what's happening today, especially in the Tech Landscape? Yeah, I mean it really is a great question. And again, I want to say I love being down here. It's great to finally be here. And hey, we follow Dr. Doom. So we can spin this. And we're positive. But you know, look, that definitely informed it. I was one of the co-founders. I wasn't even, I wasn't the CEO. I was like the product guy co-founder of E-Tour, which by the way was not a travel company. It was touring the web. It was like a search and navigation company that was founded in 1998. So a long time ago. And we went.",https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=z4hExsMyQNo,20,2022-10-17 15:23:57
3414, company was touring the web. It was like a search and navigation company that was founded in 1998. So a long time ago and we went way up and way down. Raised $50 million when that was a lot of money and almost went public and then the market crashed and we crashed and it's heartbreaking to put your in that company. We found out a business school. I mean I never really had had a real job before doing that. I'd just been an intern and so you know you put your heart and your soul and people trust you and believe in you and it's it sucks to go through that and that that crash which you know more movies should be made about that time period but certainly informs it because you know you first of all I learned a lot that I know about product management and how to manage internet companies that help me later on. A lot of hands-on experience and then yeah going through that which then happened again in 2008 happened again 2020 happened again this year and you know what I would say is every one of them is different you know if you kind of look at the causation of each one of these right you can't really equate the you know the dot com boom and crash to covid and what happened with the world shutting down or the global financial crisis or now which is kind of an instant combination of both they're all unique they're all different but certainly and we could talk about it some of the ways that that could inform both opportunities and challenges. Yeah I mean let's talk about that a bit more what do you see as the parallels that are there and how does what you experience in the 90s kind of inform what you're seeing today? Yeah and again I think you know I it's ironic but after that startup I wind up at Ask Jeaves which we then which was a public company we then sold at IEC in 2005 I became CEO right after that and was there for a long time when I left I then actually got funding to do another startup and the market crashed again two weeks after that so right in the heart of me getting funding and what I'd say in both situations and I think it's a parallel for today is first of all if you're an existing company you know one that has been through the boom and raised money during the boom evaluations that were pretty rosy and you know you went through hiring and perks for your company and probably you know easier on the revenue side because other companies weren't going through those challenges you have to really reevaluate quickly and get those costs of control kind of reevaluate you know how you view your market and your valuation you know in a lot of cases if you're a public company you know again it's it's easy to sit there and think about the way things were and and and operate that way that I think the companies that adapt the most quickly if you're an existing company are you know are the ones that are going to make it through I think Bill Gurley who was one of my investors at a clicker which was my second startup said it right a couple weeks ago he said you know this is this is the best time to get funded as a company and I agree you know if you look at every one of these crash periods those are when some of the best companies have been born or when early stage ones could make it through the gauntlet you know then the rewards and the other side of that are great I actually know that leads us to Yahoo but I think we're in a very similar situation here so let's talk about Yahoo obviously you're the CEO you're a big boss this is a brand that's gone through many iterations started in the early 90s co-founded by Jerry Yang it was a search engine since then it's grown many tentacles into content we've got Yahoo news obviously Yahoo finance Yahoo sports when you look at it today how do you define the Yahoo brand well coming in from the outside the great thing is that you're not tied to the past so and I always say this about about this opportunity and I just passed my one year anniversary here but if you didn't know what it was called and I think the brand has a lot of strength I had somebody pre-promote and tell me a couple weeks ago he thinks the brand is worth as much as Apollo paid for all of Yahoo so you know there's a lot we have to do to earn that but it is I think a great brand that has a lot of goodwill if we treat it right things can happen but the truth is if you were to come in today and just look at it objectively without the brand you would say,https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=z4hExsMyQNo,21,2022-10-17 15:27:44
3415," has a lot of goodwill if we treat it right, things can happen. But the truth is if you were to come in today and just look at it objectively without the brand, you would say hundreds of millions of users doing billions of revenue that's very profitable and is pretty entrenched in the various verticals in which it's strong, right? Top two in email, sports, news, finance, and these are amazing categories. We have a huge advertising business for one of the biggest ad sales forces on the internet. We have a real ad tech behind the scenes. There's a lot of other things we haven't even talked about, including AOL, which again in my past I've learned how things like that, which is even older than Yahoo, it's very, very profitable. If you were to take an objective look at those assets, you would say that's an amazing investment opportunity, given the fact that we've been spun out of Verizon, we're private again, and that allows you to do the things you need to do behind the scenes to improve it. And if I were to look at again objectively, I'd say it's not, I think one of the things people can mistake about Yahoo is thinking of it as one thing. You've said you hate the question whether it's a media company or a tech company, a concept company, but there are a lot of people who are saying what defines Yahoo, right? It's a product company. Email is a product. We still are in search and one of the top three players in search, that's a product. Yahoo Finance. Content is one of the products that we offer on Yahoo Finance, stock charts, information, these information sets that we provide to allow somebody to become a better investor. Those are all product features. I do think at the core we have media, technology enables literally all of it, but at the end of the day we are a product company, vertical by vertical. I look at the brand independently as well. Yahoo Finance is a very strong brand, one of the best, and one with some of the most traffic in the finance vertical. So does Bloomberg, so does Dow Jones, so does CNBC. That's very different than Yahoo Sports with the SPN, or it's very different than news or email versus Gmail. So as a brand I think about them pre-independently, will they get woven together at a larger level? Yes. Are the days gone when you think of it as a portal? Yes. So you mentioned some numbers here. I know you like to highlight this a lot, 900 million users, talking about Yahoo assets, billions of dollars in revenue, you talk about the profitability, and yet I know over the last year you have been asked over and over what the turnaround story looks like. Why do you think it's been defined as that if those numbers are there? Probably because it hasn't historically been successful at point that off. Again, I think the bar changes. I think what the team in the 2000s were dealing with was coming on the heels of a decision you could not reverse, which was giving search to Google, and literally paying them to do it, to do it. And then the aftermath of that, and trying to figure out what the business could be. Again, you were talking a much bigger company, which with much more to lose at that point. You had to turn around and attempt into 2010s again, and not just Yahoo, but the AOL properties as well. That all got solved in a way by being brought inside of a horizon for five years. And so our team comes in at a very different spot. What I do know is that this has all of the bones of a great turnaround opportunity. As I know it, as I've been through them before, a ton of traffic and very important monetizable categories with being number one or number two in those categories. Those are things I can work with. We can put great teams against that, reinvigorate these products, which certainly needed in a lot of these ways. There are reasons why these things are number one or number two. There's also reasons why it hasn't totally fulfilled its potential in each one of these. So that you can work with. And coming from where we're coming from now, coming out, is an incredible investment opportunity for those who have been behind it. And it's why, in this case, I ran towards the fire to want to do this. Because people have asked me, what is the thing that surprised you the most about about?",https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=z4hExsMyQNo,22,2022-10-17 15:32:08
3416, you know in this case i ran towards the fire uh... to want to do this because you know people ask me you know what is the uh... thing that surprised you the most about about yahu and they've asked me continually and it's been the same two things number one is how many people are rooting for us you know i think in this world people want for whatever reason they would love to see you have to be successful still this isn't a brand people are rooting against they may wonder whether we can do it that's a different story but i think they would love to see us do it and the others is that in a lot of ways it's not a turnaround you know turns are in trouble that this company isn't really good financial position uh... and has amazing assets so let's talk about the strategy that you have put in place uh... you've you've added maybe she's a shake shaken up the structure of it right individual assets now have their own general managers that's what have been the first thing we have seen the changes or inside baseball but you've also talked about seeing a spin-off in these individual brands that you think that they can stand alone and i can help but think that if you think about you know sort of that that the major you know tech companies and i know you don't want to define you as just a tech company but you'll get somebody like an alphabet or somebody you know like a meta they've got multiple brands that have sort of come together what why think about them separately and why that the idea of going towards that well let's work backwards first of all i think they think about them separately they weave them together again youtube is woven into google but those are two different teams to different brands instagram and facebook and now the the vr side these are all in the individual divisions run by general managers season is an amazing cio runs youtube uh... with neal uh... that's very different than the team running you know google kind of dot com uh... or the cloud business with with thomas so this so amazon is very much the same way and so if something about yahu are people want to think about it at that you know it's got to do with the history of it being a portal think of it as one thing certainly the brand is consistent in this case but i think and that story could take care of itself but the the first step is to work in them individually now if you do that and i'm not worried about it so the the notion of what we do with these things will they all go public together will they all live together will they spin off those are all things we have the option to do uh... but i don't think about them because i've still feel like i just got here and we want to our team wants to be the one to create this value uh... and create them across the board so i think these are all investment opportunities uh... the the end game for each of them is is something we don't think about yet one and on a uh... a personal question because in prepping for this looked at a lot of your interviews and correct me if i'm wrong but i get the sense that you like being the underdog you have a bit of a chip on your shoulder so my question to you is what whatever you want to define yahu as let's call it a turnaround story that's what people are saying what do you have to prove by building out yahu to where you want it to be it's interesting i'd say of the things that i was i could have done i would say in a way they may be would have been more in the realm of something i could have proven in this case this is something i've done a few times before we my teams have been so very successful doing them we have we have great people we've met great people here as well brought in new people that we didn't work before i'm loving the way the team here is shaping up i love being a part of that right the two things i love to come to work to do are to build great products and have a great team and of great people who love working together and if you can do those two things with an asset that has the ability to be invested in the right way and create upside-off opportunity i love doing that you know there's not a day when i don't love getting up and coming to do this uh... there's not a day when i've angst about whether we can do this i have anxiety sometimes about just the amount of things you have to do but that's different right there's no question to me that this is doable and so yeah look what i had a uh... another CEO as a compliment call me a journeyman the other time i've got to go because i've been to you know several different internet companies at this point and doing this twenty five years uh... but for me i know it when i'd i'd see that you know that uh... that opportunity and and so uh... you know that that passes all the right i'm not afraid of being the underdog and i do kind of you know like it that's,https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=z4hExsMyQNo,23,2022-10-17 15:36:43
3417, you know that that opportunity and and so you know that that past is always there and I'm not afraid of being the underdog and I do kind of you know like it it's easier than being or sorry it's harder than being just somebody on the rocket ship and you know it's going to go anyway whether you're there or not you know I'd like to make a difference the people I work with feel feel the same way so I think about it probably a little more like that Jim Lazone thank you so much for joining us today.

3418," This was my走了 by Whipink Dr Party Mari Welcome back to the Yahoo Finance All Market Summit presented by Northern Trust. They'll be at ranked cleaires to sell and hit higher�). Hai 이� съbig adjoent works for the Norway Global turnover and comparable draws on the momentum and still since the start of the year. S&P coming off its fourth down week in the past five trading weeks. We just got another hot inflation print for the month of September. Help us make sense of where things stand today. Well, Shana, first of all, thank you for having me. Today it's a pleasure to be here in the studio with you. Finally. Finally. So great to be here. And yes, it's been a really tough time for investors. But I think a little perspective is helpful during times like this. And you know, as you noted, we're in a bear market doubtless. But we've been here before. And if you look back at history, you know, over the last 100 years, we've had 26 bear markets. We've had 14 since World War II. We've had three since the year 2000. So in some ways, this is uncomfortable, but familiar territory. And we know bear markets end. The average bear market lasted about a year. We entered into this bear market in June. So, you know, perhaps we're hitting the mid-mark of the average. The backdrop certainly matters. And you know, more severe bear markets tend to take place with more systematic risks or deep recessions. We don't see either of those things. And so I do think that kind of history is important. And it also is important to look at returns. And as you noted, of course, we've had a very tough time for equities. Equities fall anywhere between sort of 20 and 40% in bear markets. We're just over 20% today. But we also know that during bear markets, there tends to be a lot of volatility. And there tends to be a lot of updates. And we, today's a good example. We had a couple of examples last week where we have these incredible rallies in the middle of a bear market. So I do think investors should have some historical perspective. And then perhaps take a deep breath because although it's really tempting to try to time investing over a bear market cycle, gosh, when you see those numbers ripping up and down, you feel like you should do something. Unfortunately, the best, but most uncomfortable thing to do is to do nothing because we have these great days in the market that are quickly followed by some tough days. And they all happen in the middle of a bear market. And you know, Shana, I was thinking this morning, over half of the best days of the market happen in a bear market. So again, I think it highlights the perils of trying to time markets and the risk that you're going to be out of the market on those best days. And they think real damage that can do to your return over even a 10-year period. It certainly is important not to time the market here. Before we get more into that, though, Katie, when you take a look at current valuations, S&P, like you mentioned, on more than 20% here to date, NASDAQ down more than 30%. Here to date, you mentioned the fact that you don't see a deep recession on the horizon. Do you think though we are at risk of a recession? And what does that potentially look like? Certainly, Shana. I mean, I think absolutely we can...",https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=z4hExsMyQNo,25,2022-10-17 15:45:23
3419," And what does that potentially look like? Certainly, Shana. I mean, I think absolutely we can anticipate a period of economic softness here. And I do think the definition of recession sort of ebbs and flows. But let's just say for the record, a period of economic softening is what we anticipate for 2023. But I think that you mentioned valuation. And that's really, really important. Because if you think about this particular bear market, it kind of is in two phases. The first phase is very much evaluation driven experience. And interestingly, you even mentioned like the NASDAQ and then the S&P. The NASDAQ is the growthiest index. The S&P is also a pretty growthy index. And they're very sensitive to changes in interest rates. We know the market is a discounting mechanism. And when you have a higher discount rate, you have a lower present value. So the growthiest NASDAQ was hit the hardest. The S&P's been hit pretty hard too. And valuation contraction has been more than 100% of the market downturn this year. Earnings have been up. So all of what we've seen this year has been a contraction in valuations. That's phase one. The second phase is related to your question about a recession. And that is what's going to happen to the E of the price to earnings, the earnings. And we think earnings are probably going to be soft in 2023. We have an estimate far below what Wall Street analysts have right now. We think they're just a little bit too optimistic on the go forward view given the fact that we are entering a soft period. And Katie, what is your estimate on earnings? And why do you think Wall Street is a little bit too optimistic at this point? So I mean, we've seen corporations, US large corporations, be incredibly resilient in the face of an incredible amount of headwinds. We've had higher rates, we've had pandemics, we've had problems in getting workers back to work. Despite that fact, we have had pretty good earnings and I think everyone was sort of waiting with baited breath for the shoot to drop in the second quarter. And it didn't. We had a good second quarter. Estimates have come down to the third quarter, but the third quarter might shape up to be pretty decent too. So I think Wall Street analysts are just building off those kinds of estimates. But for us, with the softer growth outlook in 2023 and the fact that the S&P 500 has about 40% of their revenues tied to overseas growth. We just think those headwinds are pretty strong and we come in sort of around $228 for S&P earnings for next year. And you mentioned that statistic there, 40% of revenue coming from overseas. That of course brings up the strong dollar, the risk of the challenge that that poses for companies here. How are you assessing that risk and I guess how long do you see that risk lasting here? Because it doesn't seem like anything is going to take some of that strength out of the dollar anytime soon. Well, you're right to bring up the dollar as they say our currency, your problem. And it has been a significant problem for US corporations overseas. And also for the translation of non-US investments back to US dollar terms for our investors and for our clients. Developed markets, XUS have outperformed the US on local currency terms. But when you translate it back to the dollar, it's been a huge headwind. So what could stop the dollar? Well, what propelled the dollar has been a very aggressive Fed coming out first and very aggressively with this rate hike path that has been extremely front-end loaded to face inflationary pressures. We think we're closer to the end of the policy tightening. We'll probably see the last rate hike in early 2023. And we also see inflation coming off the boil. Those two things should help to stabilize the dollar. So we don't anticipate we're going to see the kind of strength that has created these headwinds in 2023. You mentioned inflation coming off the boil to put it in your terms. Do you think we have seen inflation peak? So inflation has so many dimensions. And many of them, particularly the ones that were really pressured because of COVID, have been abating supply chain constraints have come off. We see prices coming down and use cars. I mean, we're all talking about use cars these days. It's a pretty important price barometer. So we see inventories that price is down. And some of the things that have been really impacted by COVID. So generally speaking, we do see inflation coming down. We saw an empire state manufacturing survey this morning that had some interesting insight on prices coming down where we are still concerned, though, is in wages. And also, frankly, in owners equivalent rent, these two pieces of inflation.",https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=z4hExsMyQNo,26,2022-10-17 15:49:49
3420," insight on prices coming down where we are still concerned though is in wages. And also frankly in owners equivalent rent, these two pieces of inflation are sticky. Owners equivalent rent we can all see that prices have stabilized and have come down, but it takes a while to get that through the inflation pipeline. So we're not going to see the benefits of that until well into 2023. And wages have stabilized but at a high level. So we do see lots of inflation elements coming down and we are watching really closely what happens to wages because that's going to really dictate what happens to CPI and core CPI and core PCE in 2023. Yeah, the last jobs print that we got inflation or excuse me, wages were moving to the upside. Unemployment rate actually went down. So even though we did see a little bit of cooling in that headline number, those two factors were really something that a hawkish Fed obviously would keep a very close eye on what your assessment just of the jobs market and how substantially we need to see maybe some of that growth begin to cool in order to get inflation under control. You're absolutely right. It's economics 101. We have more demand for labor than we have supply and it's really shocking actually to look at the numbers. When you look at the Joltz data at over 10 million job openings and then you look at the number of unemployed people in the US at around 7 and a half million, there's just a mismatch. So yes, the ultimate soft landing would be slowing demand enough that the brunt of that is felt on the opening side. So companies just freeze hiring versus actually increasing unemployment. That's a pretty tough needle to thread. It's, yeah, certainly is a very tough needle to thread. Kady, I want to go back to what you said earlier when you were just talking about you gathered some data I know on the cost of panicking pulling out, pulling your money out of the market in a volatile time like this. What can you tell us about that and why it's so important to stay invested through uncertain times? I know, it's so important always but more important during volatile times. If you missed just the best 10 days out of the last 10 years, so you're talking 2500 days, your return went down by 40%. If you missed 20 of the best days, it went down by 2 thirds. So there's a really high cost of missing out. And as I said before, we tend to see very strong days of the market during bear markets and the really tough time for investors. And again, it goes back to market time. It's always difficult. But it's really difficult during these times of high volatility and bear markets. The reason is the best days and the worst days tend to clump together. So you're never going to get it right because you're going to have a terrible day followed by a great day. So the best advice, the best guidance for investors, especially during times like this, is stay the course, stick with your strategy. Make sure that your equity risk, that your risk assets are aligned to your longer term goal. So you don't have to worry about short-term volatility, but you really need to stick to your strategy or your risk missing out. So you don't want to try and tie in the market. You don't want to panic and pull your money out. You mentioned strategy there. Where are you seeing the most opportunity today? So it's really interesting because I do think it's an opportunity right now for investors to rethink fixed income. We've been talking about the bear market and equities, but my goodness, we have had a steep reset in interest rates and a bear market in bonds. And right now, fixed income is actually paying income. So investors who had been forced to take risk in prior periods because there was no return can really think more deeply about their risk tolerance. And fixed income might be a good place to be right now. We're seeing 4% type yields in muni bonds. So you are seeing some pretty nice current returns out of fixed income. So that's a place I would say would be a great place for investors to reconsider. Those who have been sort of bearish on bonds because the rates were so low. Well, now we seem to have much better rates. The last thing I would say on that, though, is from an equity perspective, we still do see the best opportunities in U.S. equities, just the best visibility, the best transparency around what's going on. And we do see areas outside the U.S. as having some exogenous headwinds specifically related to energy that are just really hard to price into markets right here. When it comes to the growth versus value debate here in the U.S., obviously growth has under performed is now the time to put money to work in some of those undervalue names. We always preach diversification. And I will say that with an economy that's slowing and interest rates probably stabilizing, it's not about...",https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=z4hExsMyQNo,27,2022-10-17 15:54:09
3421," value names. You know, we always preach diversification and I will say that with an economy that's slowing and interest rates probably stabilizing. It's not a bad opportunity for growth stocks because in an environment where growth is dear, investors will pay more for growth. So we would say stick to our diversified strategy. You really want to have both because trying to time those factors is very very difficult. Katie Nixon always great to speak with you. Thanks so much for taking the time to stop by the studio. All right, let's get a market check with Julie Heinen. He Julie. Hey, Shana. Thank you so much. Well, we are seeing stocks show some real strength here once again today. The S&P 500 right now up 2.7% Around the highs of the session. If you look at the five day chart, you can see the big swings. Of course that we have been having here in the volatility that continues in this market. But really it does feel like a more risk on day today. For example, we've got yields moving lower below 4% here. We've got the dollar moving lower as well, which has tended to help stocks as of late. So that's something else that I'm watching. Take a look at some of the other elements here. Banks is something else that we're watching in today's session for a couple reasons. Bank of America, of course, was out with numbers that beat estimates. So I'll record net interest income. And that's as we have seen the Federal Reserve raised rates net income overall was down, but beat estimates, but net interest income. Up 24% in the shares are up 5% today. We also got news on Goldman Sachs, which according to Bloomberg and the Wall Street Journal is doing some restructuring, including continued sort of wind downs of its consumer banking business. Those shares up 2.5%. Just quickly here, if we look at the sectors, you see the strength and the broad strength that we're seeing within stocks. They with all of the groups up consumer discretionary real estate tech leading the pack, but really you're seeing a broad base gain here. And then NASDAQ also seeing broad base gains almost all green. One more mover that I wanted to point out to you because it's the top trending ticker on the finance platform. And that is shares of and I'll just wait for it to come up Roblox. Roblox shares of 21% today. And that's after the video gaming platform came out with its daily active users for September. Coming in at 57.8 million in the company is now forecasting for September bookings of 212 to 219 million dollars. Just the biggest one day jump that we've seen for shares of Roblox going on till May and since May. And again, sort of reflective of this risk on sentiment that we are seeing come back into the market. It's a marked contrast with what we've seen from all blocks this year with the shares down some 58%. So benefiting from risk coming back in broadly today in terms of commentary. We're hearing about the gains that we're seeing. Most are still calling it a sort of bear market bounce here, but Mike Wilson and Morgan Stanley says we could see maybe another climb up in the S&P 500 from here. Even as high as 41.50, he's still a bear over the longer term, but is looking perhaps for this bounce to continue for a little bit. Much more all market summit and Yahoo Finance coming your way next.

3423," Yeah, I mean, you've been in this position since 2019. So you're going on four years. You've built out a team of about 20,000 workers globally. Tech-specific. Earlier this year, the UN announced about 5,000 people you're adding to this team with hubs and places like Atlanta as well as Toronto. Where are you along in that journey? And what does that say about how Walmart sees tech driving its next chapter? Yeah, I am leading a global team of wonderful technologists across the world. And we are building the next generation of retail. The experiences for our customers. And we are building the tools and technologies that are completely transforming our business. As you know, Walmart's purpose is really about saving money and helping people lead better lives. Technology is such a critical part of delivering on this promise. And that's what we are setting out to do, whether it is enabling the customer to be able to buy right in the middle of their social feed when they get inspired or having their products delivered all the way into the refrigerator. We are building the technology that enables all of this to happen. And we are building tools and capabilities that are completely transforming our business. Retail is getting disrupted. And the role of technology really is to actually help Walmart be the retail leader in the disruption that's already starting to happen. And we can see that in customer experiences, we can see that in the way in which we use data to drive efficiencies, we can see that in the ways in which our associates are working in order to be able to serve our customers better, all of this is part of the transformation that is enabled by technology. And that's what me and the team are setting out to do. And we'll get into more of the specifics in just a bit. But I want to pull back because you've talked a lot about the transformations that have happened in retail. And you've said, look, they happen about every 20 years. I think a lot of our viewers are familiar with the most recent one, which I would argue is the push to e-commerce driven by your competitor, Amazon. But you say we are in the middle of another cycle. What does that look like? Yes. See, every industry goes through disruptive cycles. Typically, all of these things are actually driven by advances in technology. Like you mentioned, the last big disruption in retail was really the introduction of e-commerce that was enabled by the growth of internet. But since then, we have seen so many improvements in technology. We have got incredible computing power in the palm of our hands. We have mapped every single square inch of the planet. We have computers through deep learning that can recognize and understand natural language. And we have computers that can recognize objects. All of these things are coming together. And they are the fuel for the next round of disruption that we are already starting to see. We are starting to see that in the way in which customers are finding, discovering, and getting inspired for new products. We are seeing disruptions in terms of how people shop. We are seeing disruption in terms of how products get delivered to the customers. Walmart is in a unique position because the true disruptors are those who are going to really be able to look at the entire whole customer experience. It's not just about online. It's not just about the stores. It's about making sure that the customer experience is a delightful experience from the time that they get inspired all the way to when the product gets delivered. It's not just only about reducing friction. It's about creating a delightful experience. And that is actually going to continue to get disrupted. Walmart, like I said, is the company that can take care of the entire whole customer experience and the role of technology is to be...",https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=z4hExsMyQNo,30,2022-10-17 16:06:38
3424," Like I said, years of the company that can take care of the entire whole customer experience and the role of technology is to be able to enable that in a way that only Walmart will be able to deliver. And so when we look at that and changing the shopping experience number one, I mean, you've sort of taken a two track approach, number one developing technology in-house, but also partnering with those like Adobe. Let's talk about the in-house part of it. How are you determining where to put your investments? How much of this is about driving efficiencies to improve the experience? How much of it is about the shopping experience itself? Absolutely. So the way in which we look at our technology investments largely, there are three different things that we concentrate on. First like I said is really about the customer experience. We want to create absolutely delightful customer experiences no matter how they shop and when they shop and where they shop. Great example is what we just rolled out which is be your own model. Shopping for an outlet, we want to make it as fun as possible. When you're shopping for an outlet, you don't want to rely on some model that we have chosen to see what the output actually looks like. So this is the technology that we have used advanced machine learning so that we know how the outlet will actually drape on your particular body. So you can be a lot more comfortable about buying that particular outlet. It reduces friction, it makes it more delightful and it increases trust. So those are one area where we really are focused on. How to make shopping not just friction free but really delightful. The second area is really about enabling our 2.3 million associates to help serve our customers better, more efficiently so that they can focus on what they need to do best. Same types of advanced technology can be used for our associates as well. One good example is what we call as Wispic. This is where our associates can use AR to be able to be guided in the back room to figure out what products they need to pick and put it in from the back room, bring it from the back room and restock it on our store. Makes it very, very efficient for them. They don't need to print out a list. The system guides them. So they can focus a lot more on being efficient in what they do. The third area is really around transforming the business through automation by extracting insights out of the huge amount of scale and data that only Walmart has got to not just automate but to optimize every part of our decision making. Whether it is about how we choose our assortments that are local, that are customized for the market that we serve, all the way to how we price, how we mark down, how we optimize our supply chain in real time. All of these things are enabled by the scale, the data that we have and our ability to reason over that using machine learning, using advanced models. That really allows us to be able to reduce the cost and really go back to our purpose of saving people money. And Sir Asch, you just pointed on a keyword that I'm thinking about when you're talking about all these products you're rolling out, which is the collection of data. I mean, that itself is such a big commodity for so many companies. Number one, it tells you what chopper behavior is going to be like. It allows you to sell ads online against some of that. I mean, how are you thinking about the commercialization of that as you integrate technology more and more into the Walmart experience? Yes, so the great thing about Walmart is that we serve our customers in a whole, what we talk about is the whole customer experience, right? So whether it is online, whether it is inside the stores, we serve our customers the way they want, where they want and how they want. And this basically means that we can get a lot more insights about what.",https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=z4hExsMyQNo,31,2022-10-17 16:10:55

This comes from both the whole customer experience nature as well as obviously the scale at which we operate. What we are focused on is to take that data and turn it into insights that ultimately serve our customers better. When we talk about commercialization or when we talk about taking the data, ultimately we want to do two things. We want to be able to serve our customers in a much more personalized, much more, in a much deeper way. And we want to create an ecosystem where not just Walmart, but all of our partners and all of our suppliers and all of the ecosystem partners also benefit from that. That is what we are trying to build over here. So that it's an open system, it's not a world garden. We want everybody to be able to participate and ultimately benefit the customer. You are the global CTO. I can't let you go without asking you about crypto because Walmart did make some headlines. At the end of last year when you filed a number of key trademarks that appear to point to the company's intentions to sell as well as market virtual goods. You already got blockchain technology integrated into the system here. What's the role of crypto in Walmart's future? It's a great question. I think that there are three major areas of disruption. Crypto falls in sort of the middle of it. I have talked before about the way in which customers are getting inspired and discovering products. That is changing. Part of that is going to happen in the matter of it. Part of that is going to happen on live streams inside your social media app. So whether it is physical goods or virtual goods, they play a part in terms of what the customer wants. Crypto will become an important part of how customers transact. We want to make sure that we make it as friction free for customers to be able to transact and to be able to buy. How they are able to drive value out of it. That is where I think a lot of the disruption is going to start happening in terms of different payment methods, different payment options. The role of crypto is going to continue to play a very important role in that. Obviously, we want to be there where the customer really needs us to be. The last part of it is how products get delivered. A lot of disruption going on over there. When you specifically talk about crypto, it is going to be about discovery of products whether it is physical or virtual inside, either the metaphors or upfront and then how people transact. Okay, certainly a lot of people are going to be looking for an announcement potentially from Walmart. At least, short medium term. At Ceresh Kumar, global CTO for Walmart. Really appreciate your time today. Thank you. Straight ahead, our focus is crypto with GraceGale CEO Michael Sonnenshine.

3426, palabra Welcome back to Yahoo Finance's All Market Summer sponsored in part by GraceGale. It's been a volatile year for stocks and crypto is no exception. I'm here with GraceGale CEO Michael Son and Shine. Michael great to see you. Thanks for having me. Great to be here. I have a lot to talk about but why don't we start off with talking about your lawsuit that you filed against the Securities Exchange Commission and get us up to speed on the whole legal dispute there. Sure. So GraceGale operates today the largest Bitcoin fund in the world. GraceGale Bitcoin Trust ticker GBTC. It has been trading publicly since 2015 and we have long held conviction that this should be an ETF. We want to work towards having it become an ETF and work proactively with regulators. Thank you.,https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=z4hExsMyQNo,33,2022-10-17 16:20:30
3427," and we have long held conviction that this should be an ETF. We want to work towards having it become an ETF and work proactively with regulators. We had filed an application to convert it to an ETF and that was rejected by the SEC this summer. The same day the SEC rejected that application, we filed a lawsuit challenging that decision. And we really feel that this lawsuit is not, Andy, it's not just about Bitcoin. This is about putting forward, you know, straight forward common sense legal arguments that really ensure that investors are protected and that the SEC is acting within their mandate. And so since that time, our legal team has been behind the scenes working furiously on the case and just this last week, we filed the opening brief for the lawsuit. Some new arguments outlined in there and probably the most significant of them is this idea of a significant market test. The SEC created the significant market test really out of nowhere. We've never seen them do this before for any other product, any other commodity that we've ever seen. And it applied it very, very stringently to spot Bitcoin ETFs like GBTC, but very leniently to Bitcoin futures ETFs hence why we have several of them on the market. So the SEC is really acting outside of its authority under the Exchange Act and that's really one of the strongest arguments. But again, this is not just about Bitcoin, this is about straightforward common sense arguments when it comes to the SEC. Michael, can you put yourself in the shoes of the SEC though and understand their argument? And first of all, they're looking to protect investors. But why are they taking this position against your ETF, do you think? Andy, I can't understand why. As I said, this product is trading every single day, hundreds of millions of dollars, over 850,000 investors in the US own shares of GBTC, all 50 states represented. You have bills passing across the floor of Congress, both sides of the aisle supporting it. You have companies moving outside the US because our regulatory landscape isn't catching up fast enough with the innovation taking place here. Why our regulator would not take the opportunity to bring Bitcoin to bring investor protections closer into the regulatory perimeter? I just don't understand. It's exactly what they're here to do. I want to get back to that a little bit in a second. But first of all, maybe you can remind us or tell us a little bit more about grayscale. We have these ETFs. What else? So the grayscale family of products today has now 17 digital currency investment products. So really our mission has been about lowering the barrier to entry for investors to access crypto. So we have a whole family of publicly traded securities so that investors can buy and sell crypto exposure and their brokerage accounts, retirement accounts, you name it. We also launched an ETF earlier this year, the grayscale future of finance ETF, which was our first foray into an equity's offering. And I think as we kind of move through this crypto winter, we're starting to explore some really new offerings and new wrappers and new ways of giving investors access to the digital economy more broadly. Are you mentioning the crypto winter? I'm glad you brought it up because now I want to ask you more about that. I think Bitcoin is down what 70% year to date. Why is that? And is it really the case that it goes down and then goes back up to new heights every single time? Or maybe this time's different? So this is a crypto winter. And we call it a crypto winter because we're talking about sustained lower prices across the crypto ecosystem. We've been here before and unfortunately Andy, I'm going to tell you and anyone tuning in, we're probably going to be here again at some point, right? And that's the kind of cycles that the crypto asset class has. We see it go on to take out new all time highs, comes to some level of correction, starts to form a new base, and during these times it's really a time to build when you see this retraction. What we're hearing from investors is actually not that they're shying away from the asset class, quite the contrary. I think you and I now for years have been talking about diversification within this asset class. People have that core Bitcoin, core Ethereum position, but they're now looking at things like infrastructure, for example, right? How do they marry that crypto exposure? They have in tokens with the underlying infrastructure that powers these protocols. So we just recently launched a new offering, the GraceGale Digital Infrastructure Opportunities Fund. And that would be...",https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=z4hExsMyQNo,34,2022-10-17 16:24:29
3428," with the underlying infrastructure that powers these protocols. So we just recently launched a new offering the Grace Guild Digital Infrastructure Opportunities Fund. And that really gives investors the opportunity to invest in Bitcoin mining, for example, right? An industry that maybe took on too much leverage and we're really giving them a distressed opportunity. So this crypto winter too soon and too tough to predict how long it will last, but investors are not shying away from the industry. And if anything, looking for new opportunities. But there is all kinds of risk. I mean, hackers have stolen what, $3 billion of Bitcoin and crypto coins this year. How do we protect against that? It really is a question of who you're working with as you think about crypto exposure, right? If you think back to the early days of the internet, many companies were building products and services and the regulatory environment hadn't caught up with it yet. You didn't see the emergence yet of some of the, you know, web 2.0 applications that we today couldn't live without. Things like Amazon, things like, you know, AWS, Google, you name it. And I think we're in that kind of a phase when it comes to crypto, where we're learning lessons as an industry. There's certainly going to be missteps. But as an industry, we get stronger, we become more resilient. And we start to weed out bad apples over time. What is Bitcoin for? And maybe this gets to the SEC situation. Is it an investment? Is it a currency? And is it losing market share to Ethereum and things like NFTs? So great question. So Bitcoin depends on where in the world you fall, right? Over the past couple of months, if not over the last year, you've seen all kinds of volatility across a variety of asset classes, massive movements in fiat currencies all over the world, sometimes to unprecedented, you know, levels of volatility that just really never seen before. I think here in the US and in other developed economies, you're seeing Bitcoin being used more as a store of value or as an investment. I don't see necessarily yet how or why we're using Bitcoin day to day in our everyday, you know, transactions buying a cup of coffee, things like that. But if you wake up in other parts of the world today, and the currency that your government issues that you use to buy that cup of coffee, lost 20% of its value last night, well, something like Bitcoin, something that's non-government back, something that's non-government issued, actually become something really attractive. And so as you're seeing these different macro factors continue to change the landscape, I think depending where you are in the world, Bitcoin will mean different things to different folks. Is Ethereum getting more market share than Bitcoin? Well, it's expense. No, not necessarily. I think there are today last count over 17,000 different digital assets out there. And so something that we're certainly committed to, a great scale is continuing to make sense of that universe for investors. Where do you even start when there's so many options available to you? And you know, there is a world today and a future state where multiple digital currencies will coexist with one another or digital assets. They'll have different use cases, different addressable markets and different prices. And you know, Bitcoin is, you know, gonna coincide with things like Ethereum. And it's gonna coexist. And it's okay that they coexist and have different use cases and different markets. What about coexisting though with Fiat currency? I mean, what do you see, you know, 2030, 40 years down the road? Are we gonna have Fiat currency and cryptocurrency coexisting? Well, I think we're certainly seeing new use cases emerging out of this asset class every day. We are certainly moving towards the tokenization of a lot of new kind of ideas and a lot of things today that may have frictions or maybe not the most efficient types of settlements or oversight of ownership or perhaps authenticity. That's one of the things that NFTs as a technology are helping us to understand. So I think from an investor standpoint, we are certainly moving into that realm where a pie chart that investor has, which is diversified across equities and fixed income and commodities. Certainly is gonna have a slice that goes towards crypto or digital assets more broadly. How diversified that'll be depends on who the investor is. And how they actually start to think about crypto affecting the other things they invest in. I mean, is crypto really better than the US dollar? That is a loaded question, Andy. Well, I think that the US dollar has certainly.",https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=z4hExsMyQNo,35,2022-10-17 16:28:49
3429," I mean, is crypto really better than the US dollar? That is a loaded question, Andy. Well, I think that the US dollar has certainly maintained its dominance as the global reserve currency. No question about it. Arguably, Bitcoin is one of, if not the most incredible invention that we've seen over the last call it two decades. Or so it was literally invented out of thin air and has now been used by hundreds of millions of people around the world. And anytime anything challenges it, it somehow, you know, becomes even stronger and more resilient. So I think it's too early to say, and there's also not necessarily a winner between those two, right? The fiat world, the crypto world, these are two worlds that can and will likely coexist. Yeah, when you get ransomware attacks, they want to get paid in Bitcoin though, right? I mean, how do you get rid of that stigma? I mean, I kind of think that stigma is dying, Andy. It really is. You've got to understand that because the Bitcoin blockchain is immutable and traceable, unlike, you know, exchanging physical dollars for someone doing something nefarious, Bitcoin would be a really bad mechanism to use if you didn't want to get caught doing something. So I don't think that that is as nearly as prevalent as it once was. And for that very reason. And how do you look at some of the experiments that some of these countries have undertaken with crypto? I mean, like El Salvador, maybe a mixed picture there? I mean, it's one of those places in the world, right? Where a lot of these economies have been either dollar-based or they're not doing a terribly great job managing their own currency. A lot of people have moved into leveraging mobile technology. So they're living their lives on their phones. It doesn't have to be a brand new iPhone or a brand new Android. But they're moving into a state where the connectedness of cell technology is bringing them together. And their banking either hasn't caught up or isn't allowing them to have access to those types of services. And so Bitcoin and these types of technologies are actually allowing people to enter the conversation, create savings, pass money to the next generation. Things that just the traditional banking system may not be catching up to you in certain parts of the world. I mean, is it possible then that because we're in a place in the world where we rely on the dollar and fiat and legacy systems are so prevalent that we don't see the change coming in the rest of the world? I think that's one of the unique things about being a grayscale. You know, being at our parent, part of our parent company, Digital Currency Group, we have investments in over 40 countries around the world. And so we don't sit in a room all day and tell each other that Bitcoin is happening. We actually have companies that are building products and services in every corner of the globe and seeing how volumes are changing. See what customer adoption looks like, seeing how often people transact. And the numbers tell a really compelling story. And we've talked about this before, Michael. But what about the correlation between just plain vanilla equities and crypto? And let me have you answer that and we get to other correlations. So it's a great question because the narrative on this has flipped very recently. When you look at where and how crypto has historically been categorized, it actually has followed tech stocks and a lot of the momentum trades that we've historically seen in the equities market. Some of those assets are down 70, 80 plus percent year to date. And what's interesting is that even though crypto has fallen precipitously in Bitcoin in particular, it's actually now been trading very tightly in this band. And so the volatility that you're seeing in crypto has come down tremendously. So a lot of folks are now looking at that narrative and saying, well, is that going to hold up when crypto does wake up from this crypto winter? Is it going to continue to follow those types of trades and be that kind of momentum? Or is the macro environment really reshaping the way people might think about crypto's role in a portfolio? What about the economy then, Michael? I mean, a lot of talk of recession and there's a crypto winter correlated coincidence. What do you think? Probably more coincidental than not. I mean, it's early days, right? Because you do have some folks calling for recession and other folks not so much saying that this is just a relatively momentary blip in the grand scheme of things. Eventually, we might see things move to all time highs and in the not too distant future. I think crypto does this. It's done this multiple times and unfortunately, we'll probably do it again. We've seen drawdowns of 50, 60 plus percent before.",https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=z4hExsMyQNo,36,2022-10-17 16:33:00
3430," I think crypto does this. It's done this multiple times and unfortunately it'll probably do it again. We've seen drawdowns of 50, 60 plus percent before and again what hasn't killed crypto has made it stronger. How is your business as a CEO looking out and seeing growth, customer relationships? Are you seeing a slowdown? Maybe that would have to do with overall economic activity rather than adoption of crypto. Well certainly investors are continuing to average down on their positions. I think a lot of investors realize that anytime you see this type of pullback and your conviction on something has fundamentally changed, that's something you should be taking advantage of. So investors are not shying away from that perspective. So investors are now also, I'd say, as informed as they've ever been on the asset class itself and so they're always looking for new opportunities to either diversify their exposure. And we're starting to see that they're developing interesting narratives around different sub-themed or sub-categories of crypto, much the same way they do around the equity space. And final question Michael, talk about the demographics of people who are buying crypto and maybe how that's changing and some trends you've seen recently. The stigma that crypto is only for young males rose. It's over. It's over. What we've seen is that crypto has continued to pervade men and women. We've seen it actually creep up into older demographics. They realize the staying power of the asset class. And as a result of that, the momentum has been there and I think it'll continue to move into other demographics as well. Michael Sonichine, CEO of GraceGill, thank you so much for joining us.

3431," birdie Welcome back to Yahoo Finance's All-Markets Summit sponsored in part by Grayscale. As the crypto world faces volatility, it continues to flourish with institutional adoption and real-life use cases. Joining us now to discuss the crypto landscape beyond just where the market price of Bitcoin happens to be sitting. We've got crypto council for innovation CEO Sheila Warren and Apollo Head of Digital Investments and assets. Christine Moey along with Yahoo Finance's David Hollerith. Great to have you all here with us for this conversation. First and foremost, just to tee up where the conversation is going to go, we should acknowledge that we are in a crypto winter right now and David, I'll kick things over to you to really kind of set the scene, especially as we've seen kind of this deceleration or this decline in some of the crypto prices right now and where that kind of influences some of the investment decisions going forward to. Yeah, Brad, my first thought is sort of just to tee it up, you know, in the second quarter we saw crypto assets fall first under macro conditions and then a lot of sort of idiosyncratic sort of issues with the asset class, insolvencies, all that. And you know, that was obviously something unique since then, cryptocurrencies have mainly stayed fairly flat compared to other assets like equities. And so I think that's a good place just to start, just to turn it over to each of the panelists, Sheila and Christine and just sort of ask you what's different about sort of this crypto bear market compared to previous cycles. Sheila, we'll go to you first on that. Sure, thanks so much. You know, I think I think the last time in 2017 to 2018, there was still this question, is crypto as a class? It really was kind of the Bitcoin or blockchain days and is this just a flash in the pan, is it all going to vanish and just evaporate? And this time around, I think there is a sense of the stickiness, the inevitability of this, not just as an asset class, but as a technology, it's going to have tremendous impact, I think, across a broader variety of industry ecosystems and subsets than just financial services. Christine, same question to you. What's different between this crypto winter and past crypto winters that we've seen? Yeah, sure. I mean, as Sheila mentioned, in the last crypto winter, there was a lot in development, but there hadn't been any mass uptake or adoption. People had bought some Bitcoin and Ethereum through crypto exchanges, maybe a very small set of..",https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=z4hExsMyQNo,38,2022-10-17 16:42:28
3432," in development, but there hadn't been any mass uptake or adoption. Like people had bought some Bitcoin and Ethereum through like crypto exchanges. Maybe a very small set of people started participating in token sales or what we're called ICOs. But generally, even in the enterprises when we were using blockchain technology, it was still in pilot or prototype stage. Now, in the last bull cycle that we just saw going into today's crypto winter, we've seen mass adoption in a variety of different forms. So, you know, we saw, for example, a number of technological enthusiasts, financial enthusiasts participating in yield farming through the DeFi summer of 2021. We saw a long tail of creatives and non-technical consumers participate in the NFT markets in 2022. And then across this whole time, a broader adoption of stablecoins for payments and regular business use cases like just trying to pay like my employees globally. You know, now the result of this is that a broader audience has become more informed around this technology. A number of those use cases required being able to set up a self-costive wallet, a self-costive crypto wallet. And so, you know, basically what we're dealing with now is a more and like kind of invested audience and intellectually invested in terms of like having done the work to get set up with this ecosystem. The last crypto cycle was really brutal and long. And for those that managed to survive, they went on to become the biggest companies and protocols in our industry. And so, I would say that in this crypto cycle, or in the last bull cycle, you know, many of the investors and the companies raised, oh, what sounded like a regis amount of money at the time, but basically building a war chest to whether this particular winter. So, you know, basically, whilst we do see this winter being severe and long, because, you know, before we didn't even have the broader macroeconomic uncertainty around inflation and the potential recession, you know, I would say that the industry is a little bit better prepared. And additionally, institutions, enterprises are continuing to build in this space, you know, just recently announced Bank of New York, Mellon is now offering Bitcoin custody as just one example. Okay, so I want to take a brief step back, because there's a lot to unpack there, right? For better and for what we still need to work through too. But first, perhaps just defining for the sake of the conversation, Web 3, this is a more decentralized internet. This is an internet that's running on or a connection point that's running on blockchain technology. This is new for a lot of people. This is also new for the way that investors like yourself are also evaluating some of these companies, right, Christine? And so with that in mind, there's the traditional thought of what's the path to profitability for some of those companies? And is that perhaps that path to profitability hindered because you don't necessarily have the immediate return? And it's a much further looking out type of investment that you're really evaluating here. How does that really influence some of your investment thesis around Web 3? Sure. Just taking a step back, a lot of buzzwords in the space. It's got crypto, blockchain, digital assets, NFTs, DeFi, Web 3. And so for someone who's not following this space, it can be quite intimidating. However, I like to just explain what is happening right now as a multi-year technology shift that is accelerating financial innovation. It's driving new investor behaviors, and it's creating new financial markets infrastructure that has already begun to start impacting payments, capital formation, lending and borrowing, and asset management, and then a long tail of other things including culture. Now, we blockchain nerds that are in the industry like to think of what's being built as the internet of value. Now, the internet that most of all of you know and love, we think of as the internet of information, basically the set of technological protocols that made it possible to make 24, 7, 365 distribution and exchange of information around the globe, the democratization of content and information creation and distribution through platforms like social media, where individuals were empowered to become platforms empowered by this technology, and information gatekeepers or incumbents were challenged and forced to evolve.",https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=z4hExsMyQNo,39,2022-10-17 16:45:41
3433," where individuals were empowered to become platforms empowered by this technology, and information gatekeepers or incumbents were challenged and forced to evolve. Now, if you take that framework and you apply it to not information, but now technology impacting value and value transfer and value creation, you can see where we're going with this now, like in this new internet of value. Basically now that digital value transfer can be 24, 7, 365 and peer-to-peer. We're seeing that now with the advent of stablecoins, or how there's been a broader democratization of value creation and distribution. We've seen that with the fits and spurts of capital formation through token sales, as an example, or how financial services at large are being unbundled into financial primitives, more jargon, but basically turned into tech microservices, basically libraries of code to do things that typically banks and financial institutions would do. And NFTs broadly an experimentation in creating post-spoke digital assets with the new ability to ascribe value to something that previously would just have been just another copy of a JPEG, but now because we're able to track digital scarcity and provenance with this new Web3 technology set, we're able to ascribe cultural and historic value to digital things. And so with this large technology shift that's happening, institutions like Apollo, and by the way Apollo is a half a trillion dollar asset manager with over a 30-year track record investing and participating in public and private activities, fixed income, credit, retirement services, and insurance, we believe in a world where this technology shift will basically impact existing financial market infrastructure and business models as more real world assets and real world applications emerge with this technology. Now, to be clear, it's not going to be a lift and drop of existing markets onto blockchain technology. I think that has all been tried in the previous years of the last half decade. That didn't really necessarily work, nor is there really a business case to do that. And it won't be magic internet money that ignores the financial realities of appropriate risk and return. I think that the recent crypto markets unwind and market idiosyncrasies we've seen have proven that, but it's going to be a unique, never-before-seen intersection of crypto-native, new product and market development that has been grounded in the financial realities of risk and return relative to the broader tradeable markets. Powered by automation and composability, we've seen through smart contracts and digital ledgers. So, at least here at Apollo, we're focused on being real world practitioners of Web3 technology, rolling up our sleeves, actually testing out the blockchain protocols, building on smart contracts, helping to build new products to help support and shape this industry as this technology shift is happening. And then additionally, we've started investing across the technology stack, focused on identifying ambitious founders that can benefit from our markets expertise across those markets and our scale. And so, it's been an incredible entry point for us at Apollo, since we're just starting with a bunch of drive powder in this space in this winter cycle. Certainly. I mean, look, if you find any of those founders that can help me turn any of my old JPEGs that I created in paint into something valuable in the future too, I know this is just a small part of the broader NFT landscape and broader crypto and blockchain landscape, but I would certainly appreciate that as well. Working on it. Yeah, David, out there and over to you. Well, yeah, I mean, Christine, to your point, I mean, you've been working in the space for a long time and you're deeply in mesh and it sounds like looking at some of the cutting edge sides of the technology. But, you know, Sheila, if we turn to, you know, Washington, the story of regulation at least in the US, but I think you could say sort of more broadly is like very unclear. And, you know, we've seen President Biden release his executive order on cryptocurrency and we're starting to see agencies, federal agencies respond with reports coming out. And I was sort of curious, how was the conversation in Washington around cryptocurrencies changed everything?",https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=z4hExsMyQNo,40,2022-10-17 16:49:57
3434," Agencies, federal agencies respond with reports coming out. And I was sort of curious, how was the conversation in Washington around cryptocurrencies changed over the last six months? I mean, it's often sort of a topic of sort of what is holding back maybe the asset class from getting more adoption. Well, it's changed a lot. And I think to the point you're making, David, it's not just about Washington. We're seeing a lot of activity happening all around the world from the regulatory space. I think the thing to know is a technology is moving so fast. Christine did an acronym dump on us earlier, right? You've got Dify, you've got NFTs, you've got Dow, you've got so many of these concepts that are still being formed. The market hasn't yet weighed in on the direction of if these things should go or will go. At the same time, you've got regulators scrambling. I think that's the right word to keep up and provide some clarity around this, both to help the industry shape and build on more solid foundation, but also to help consumers make sense of what all this means. So we're seeing activity out of Europe, we're seeing activity in South Korea, Australia, the UK, India, Japan, I mean, really all over the world. In the States, in Washington, tremendous activity, both federal and the state level as well. And I think that the thing, right now we've gotten a two very active bills that are being discussed, one focusing on kind of which agency ought to have the stronger hand or a hand at all and regulating this space of the other unstable coins, specifically thinking about what should happen in that environment, how do all these things play together? Will there be a digital dollar in the US, like the digital euro that Christian Lagarde announced earlier this year? It's complicated. And so I think the next six months are going to be, have a different place. We're going into the midterms now. There'll be a potential shakeup and how the voices, that are the most prominent voices and positions that they hold on various committees. But all I can say for now is it's a space to watch. It's critically important to the entire ecosystem and the decisions made I think over the next six months, certainly over the next year are going to play an outsized role I would think in the development and the way that this technology ultimately lands with consumers. So Sheila, with that in mind, and perhaps it's trivial of me to ask to kind of apply the rule of threes to this, but if I were to ask, what are three big things that regulators need to get right when they're thinking about and working through what crypto legislation should look like, especially here in the US, what would those three things be? Oh, gosh, it's so hard to pick, right? So here's the three things I think that are important to keep in mind. And one is this is global. Nobody's waiting for the United States to act or not act as the case may be. And so while there is some influence the US still has significant influence over these markets, that's not going to last forever. We are seeing Mika, which is a big comprehensive legislation that's landed in Europe, start to be implemented. That's going to have huge implications potentially on how builders build, how consumers engage with this technology offerings. The second thing I would say it's really important to note is despite the attention on the price and this entire framing of this conversation is about how that's not the most important or only thing, this is about a lot more than just financial services products. This really is about building a new version of the internet, decentralized internet, Christine laid out what Web 3 with that concept means. So thinking about how this will work in spaces like data, spaces like creative, the creative economy, all of that is really, really important. So global frame, more than financial services and products. And the third thing I would say is that the details really, really matter. So I think a lot of folks tend to think of regulation as just kind of providing this very broad playbook, but actually there's a lot of nuance and detail and the competitions are happening live right now. And a lot of that is going to be critically important. So meeting with technologists, making sure there's understanding about what's actually happening in the trajectory, what's moving forward is also just a critical, it's just critical and crucial here, even more than it's ever been before I'd say in other industries. So Christine, hearing all that, what's the time table for Web 3 to be part of everyday person's life? I mean, if we're going to transact and get our coffee or whether we're going through a car transaction, what is the time table that we have to look out towards? Okay, that's a really good question. I mean, I guess the thing with technology evolution, it's one of these things where, when you're in it, it rolls out quite slowly and incrementally, but then in retrospect, it looks like it happened very fast. And so.",https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=z4hExsMyQNo,41,2022-10-17 16:55:06
3435," When you're in it, it rolls out like quite slowly and incrementally, but then in retrospect, it looks like it happened very fast. And so what I mean by that is, you know, you mentioned I've been in the industry for over six years. And in those six years, I've seen the building blocks of blockchain protocols like actually become like be created and get adopted. Or, you know, stable coins like get created or, you know, the primitives around like lending and borrowing via smart contracts, which later evolved into DeFi. Like all of these things started as like very big ideas against a backdrop of like, you know, a difficult reality. In fact, that it didn't exist. And also there was a lot of regulatory, you know, stuff to navigate. But in the past six years, all of that has actually come to fruition. Think like ideas have come to life. And they've been used and actually tested with real money. And actually have had multiple teams around the world with different, you know, levels of expertise around technology and financial markets and infrastructure all contributing in open source code. So, you know, it's moving fast with very moving fast and slow at the same time. In terms of, and so, you know, I feel like we're just kind of at the stage where, you know, the key building blocks of the infrastructure have been put in place. But now it's about the real world applications. And this is like where, you know, the real world assets that were hyper focused on from Apollo's point of view, you know, may start to emerge. But then additionally, a lot of work around user experience, you know, blockchain technology is actually back end technology. And, you know, if we do this right, Web 3 doesn't become a noticeable part of our lives. Like it just like sinks into the background. It's just stuff that like drives, you know, the applications and our use cases. And in fact, it becomes a little bit boring. And so, you know, basically it would say like in the next couple of years, we should see an acceleration once the foundation now that the foundational pieces are in and now it's more focused on what do people find compelling. I think NFTs were a glimpse of how a broader user base could be compelled with, you know, use cases that were broadly cultural, like maybe less financial. And so, you know, we're a small subset of us nerds that, you know, we're kind of building really interested in, you know, all of the hyper financialization overall. So I think the path to, you know, broader adoption is probably something more fun, funny than that. Absolutely. Well, that's a few years. We'll see the discovery. But it'll be slow and fast at the same time. Yeah. That's about all the time we have. So I think we'll cut it off there. I was going to leave it for closing remarks. You know, Sheila, what should we expect in the next quarter as far as regulation goes? We only have about 30 seconds, Sheila. Yeah, very, very active conversation, very active conversation in the US and Europe and all over the world. Hopefully there'll be some, I don't know symmetry at least compatibility in what comes out of these different places, but maybe not. So it's just a place to watch for sure. So I think we'll go ahead and do that. Up next, the new director of the National Crypto Enforcement Team, director Ewing Young Choi, on how the federal government is protecting investors while allowing innovation to flourish. In the right place.",https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=z4hExsMyQNo,42,2022-10-17 16:59:18
3436," Aaahhh... Welcome back to Yahoo Finance's All Market Summit sponsored in part by Grayscale. I'm David Hollerith. A year ago, the Justice Department stood up the National Cryptocurrency Enforcement Team to effectively lead enforcement of crypto-related cases. Since then, the team has prosecuted cases ranging from crypto-mixing services to scams, insider trading, and national security threats. Joining us now to discuss the team's role in shaping the market integrity of cryptocurrencies and how it balances that without forwarding innovation is Unyoung Choi, director of the National Cryptocurrency Enforcement Team. Unyoung, thanks for being here. Of course, thanks for having me, David. So to start off, can you just tell us what is this team?",https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=z4hExsMyQNo,43,2022-10-17 17:04:50
3437," The National Cryptocurrency Enforcement Team. Unyoung, thanks for being here. Of course, thanks for having me, David. So to start it off, can you just tell us, what is this team in set? What does it do? So the National Cryptocurrency Enforcement Team was set up by the Department of Justice to really be a one-stop shop of subject matter experts drawn from across the department. And the reason for that is because the department realized that there had been a situation in which we've seen digital asset criminal use evolve. Early days, it was darknet markets, and it was people buying and selling all sorts of contraband in our products on those darknet markets. And these days, we're seeing it pop up in every single type of criminal activity the department looks into. We really need to bring together those who had been working on this issue for some time in order to address the more cutting-edge issues that we're looking at. And so, as you mentioned, one of the focuses we have is to make sure that we are appropriately addressing the ecosystem, looking at mixers, tumblers, and exchanges, and other money laundering platforms that help facilitate that type of criminal activity. And we also want to basically up everyone's baseline game when it comes to digital asset prosecutions and investigations, because we're seeing it in ransomware, we're seeing it in frauds and thefts of all sorts. And we want to make sure that it's not just the specialists who have the tools necessary to fight and disrupt this type of criminal activity, but that prosecutors from throughout the department can have access to those tools, understand how best to use them, and know where the resources are throughout the department to help them and their fights and their cases. Yeah, and you're speaking obviously to this prosecutor network that was recently announced. And so, I'm curious there, what does success look like for that? I think, well, just to give you a little bit of background, digital asset coordinators network is a dedicated network of 150 plus prosecutors drawn from across the department. That's the 94 US attorney's offices as well as a different sections. It may just as they deal with things such as national security issues, antitrust, environmental and natural resources, crimes, and even in the civil division and the tax divisions as well. And the idea is to be able to have a network of prosecutors devoted to being the first line of fence in each of their offices. So, in any investigation in which digital asset or cryptocurrency issue comes up, people will know where in their office to find the help that they need to understand these technologies and to stay abreast of all the developments that we're seeing in the ways in which those technologies can be abused by bad actors. So, that's really what the network is about. And success for us is making sure that each prosecutor feels empowered and armed with the right tools, knows how to apply the authorities that we already have to combat these crimes, and realizes that each prosecutor realizes that for every investigation, there are going to be challenges, digital assets is one that you can address using the tools that we have in many instances and just understanding the new ways in which we're applying them to a new problem set. And how is prosecuting cases involving crypto different from other assets? So, I think there are a few technological aspects of cryptocurrency that make them pose certain challenges and also certain benefits along enforcement. So, I think the easiest thing to think about is public ledgers for the most part, most of the cryptocurrency crime that we see still rely on public ledger technologies, in which case you have a ledger that is available, you can see all the transactions that anyone's ever had. Now, that is very useful in terms of trying to chase down the flow of funds for any criminal activity, but we still need to understand how to get behind the addresses that are on that ledger. We'll know that the transaction may be criminal, but who is actually behind that particular, but that particular transaction, that particular address. And that's one of the tricky things about cryptocurrencies that it has built in this sort of anonymity, pseudonymity factor, because it does not necessarily put a one to one on the address and the actual real person that's behind those types of transactions. These are also very cross border in nature. So, you know, an example I like to give is, you might have someone who's a victim of a cryptocurrency crime in the United States. The bad actor might be in country number two. They may be using infrastructure such as a cryptocurrency platform, a mixer that may be incorporated in country number three or registered there even, but the data is in country number four, and the people who work for that platform may be in country number five, and trying to deal with bringing together all the different.",https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=z4hExsMyQNo,44,2022-10-17 17:07:48
3438," or registered there even, but the data is in country number four, and the people who work for that platform may be in country number five, and trying to deal with bringing together all the different sources of data that you really need to do, both off-chain and off-on-chain, in order to get to the bottom of whose behind criminal activity can be tricky. Like it is in all cyber cases across border investigations, generally. And also that it's, you know, these transactions are immutable and they're irreversible. That's one of the benefits to cryptocurrency in some instances, and that these transactions can oftentimes be relatively frictionless and quick, but it also means that if we identify a particular transaction as being criminal, we can't go to some centralized, you know, financial institution and ask for that money to come back. That's not how the blockchain works. And so finding ways to deal with that and still be able to chase funds to places where we may be able to capture those criminal proceeds back and provide them to the victims is one of the challenges that we face in this area. Right, and the decentralized area of crypto, which defies a broad term, it can mean a lot of different things. You know, it's one of the most promising areas, at least people working in the crypto industry, say, but it's obviously a place that, you know, has been fraught with what you call security exploits this year, or, you know, hacks to people sort of say they're the same thing, sometimes they're kind of slightly different. So I was sort of curious, given the amount of hacks we've seen, it seems like one every week. This year, you know, what's you, what is the responsibility of sort of the private sector versus the public sector, in sort of reducing the level of exploits in crypto? And added to that, what do you think the root problem is? You know, I think what is going on here is that the crypto industry and DeFi in particular has really exploded in market cap and size over the past few years, even. And so I think it's, you know, unprecedented in the amount that the industry has grown and the ways in which DeFi have evolved the technologies that have traditionally been used in a variety of different ways, but now are being used to create financial products that in sophisticated multi-chain, you know, means. And so I think especially in these cross-bridge hacks situations, which what you're alluding to. The bottom line is that the industry is still in our view in a maturation phase. A lot of respects we're looking at companies and hoping that they will understand that doing things such as basic risk reduction, having robust compliance programs, and ensuring that they are decreasing the opportunities for these type of exploits on their own platform, it's sort of the first best line of defense. And I think, you know, a lot of these exploits, as we see them, are situations in which the code is exploited in part because, you know, maybe there would have been if there had been more robust code audits, for instance. People might have caught these particular opportunities for exploitation before the code gets pushed out writ large. And so in those situations, we're hoping that people will now see every week we have multi, you know, million dollar exploits along those lines. People will start trying to think about ways in which they're making their code more robust before it's pushed out. I think that's the bottom line. Yeah. And I mean, how does what does a partnership look like between the private sector and public sector and sort of enabling more security auditing, I guess, before kids pushed out? Because obviously this is a, you know, this is a fast-moving industry. Yeah, I think it's just, I think it's a recognition that we have to work with the private sector and ensure that they understand the ways in which we've identified particular tactics that bad actors might be using in order to exploit these types of platforms. I think generally there is an understanding that every single week, if you see a new one of these, perhaps people within the industry are going to think twice before sent pushing out code or invest more in the front end auditing and basic sort of cyber security concerns that we see, you know, as a general matter that we have is an issue that occurs within the private sector. I mean, I think people are now in the mindset where they realize it's hyper security is a serious concern from a business risk perspective and it requires investments on the front end from those who are responsible, not just sort of rush.",https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=z4hExsMyQNo,45,2022-10-17 17:11:50
3439," In the mindset where they realize its cybersecurity is a serious concern from a business risk perspective and it requires investments on the front end from those who are responsible, not just sort of rushing to market with a particular product, but really making sure that you've kicked the tires on that product and so that you're eliminating opportunities for bad actors, especially in our perspective, or especially concerned with North Korean nation-state actors who seem to be behind a lot of these particular types of exploits and using them as a means to avoid sanctions regime design to limit their weapons of mass destruction program. For instance, I mean, these are serious national security concerns that really stretch beyond the fact that there are millions of dollars being stolen in single episodes that we see with DeFi hacks and exploits. Yeah, the national security topic is obviously one thing, but if we're just thinking about from for individual investors, what is the most concerning sort of digital crime trend or crypto crime trend that you've been following? So I think one of the things that we're particularly concerned about is that there's a lack of familiarity about the technology, but the average American consumer or investor might be looking at historically pretty significant returns on certain types of cryptocurrency investments. And so it's a combination of fear of missing out, FOMO plus a lack of familiarity in the technology that allows some investors to have sometimes be duped by fraudulent schemes that are out there that people who would abuse the name of crypto and the promise of innovation, and quite frankly participate in a series of old school Ponzi schemes or rug polls or other types of thefts and frauds that happen with the American public. And I think just sort of making sure that investors understand that they should be applying the same type of scrutiny that they apply to their normal investments and traditional finance to crypto would go a long way. So if someone something sounds like it's too good to be true, maybe it is in fact too good to be true, like guaranteed higher returns on investments without a real clear explanation as to what's going on. If you don't understand the technology and what exactly the product is doing, then perhaps try to do more research to figure out this is the type of thing that you want to be investing in. And generally using your good sense in trying to make these decisions and not trying to be swept up in the FOMO and the jargon that gets used in the crypto industry to make investment decisions that you might regret later on. I mean, there have been good returns in certain circumstances, but it's an incredibly volatile asset class. And so people need to be wary of that and think about that when they're actually investing in their overall portfolio. Absolutely. On your guide, thank you so much for coming to talk. Of course. Thanks for having me. Up next, the post-COVID travel boom, Hilton CEO, Chris Nassetta joins us right after the break.",https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=z4hExsMyQNo,46,2022-10-17 17:16:04

I'm here with Hilton Worldwide, CEO Chris Nassada and Brad Smith. Chris, welcome back to the Yowell Market summit.",https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=z4hExsMyQNo,47,2022-10-17 17:20:47
3441," And welcome back to Yowell Finance. It's all market summit presented by Northern Trust. I'm here with Hilton Worldwide, CEO Chris Nesetta and Brad Smith. Chris, welcome back to the all market summit. So let's get right into it here. If the 2020, 2021 period in the logic industry was a depression, what would you coin? What we're seeing right now? You know, first of all, thanks Brad and Brian for having me. I'm great to be back. I think it was on a couple of years ago. You know, it was interesting in our industry, right? 20 and 21 were terrible. I mean, in the beginning of the pandemic, we were down 90% in revenues and then sort of clawed our way back through the latter part of 2020 and into 2021. But as we had different variants between Delta and Omicron and other things going on, we sort of, you know, we're going back and forth. But, you know, as we started to get stability, you know, coming through the Omicron variant in the spring and throughout and into the fall, we've seen very, very steady recovery. So I would say we're at the beginning of what I think is going to be a new golden age of travel. I mean, what happened is a lot of people thought. In fact, you guys were asking me two years ago, was anybody going to want to travel again? And it turned, and I said at that time, of course, people need to travel for all sorts of reason. They want to travel because they want to see people in places they need to travel for, you know, for business purposes, they need to travel to congregate as part of meetings and events for all sorts of reasons, whether it's, you know, culture building, whether it's sales conferences, whatever, whatever it might be. And they're doing it. And so we've seen a very strong recovery in all segments of the business led by the leisure business, but very strong recovery and business travel, very strong recovery in meetings and events. And it continued throughout the summer, and it is continuing into the fall. So I'd say, you know, we're in the midst of a very strong rebound coming out of your words, not mine, a depression for hospitality businesses in 2021. Chris, take us further into that demand rebound that you're seeing right now. And especially as it relates to the corporate travel, this is a cohort of consumers that really accounts for so much of the profit margins for leisure and hospitality businesses. So when you're re-engaging with them, you know, what have you been able to track to say in your forecasts, going even into next year that this is going to continue to return, especially as they're looking across some of their own travel and expense policies. And that's tightening a little bit right now. Yeah, well, I mean, yeah, clearly that is, and we expect it to continue. Having said that, there's a huge amount of pent up demand, Brad, that is being released for all sorts of business travel. When you back up and look at the core of our business travel population, even pre-COVID, it was 80% small and medium-sized businesses, that's probably about 85, maybe even a little bit higher today. And what we found during COVID, certainly in recovery, is that there are a lot more resilient. And the reason is that they're running their businesses, they have to get out and travel. They have to meet their partners. Their salespeople have to get out. They have to go to their other offices. And so they don't have as much of the luxury of saying that they're not going to travel. And so what we've seen is the big corporate business transient has been, is recovered nicely, and is recovering in a very strong way now, but is still not back to historic levels where small and medium businesses are above 2019 historical high water marks. And I think it has a lot to do, as I said, with just people going for an extended period of time without doing the basic things that they needed to do to run their business. And I think it was a really neat idea to think that you could do everything virtually and everything on Zoom, and you could do all your culture building and all your innovation, and all your sales, and all the partner and relationship work in a very efficient format, but the real truth is you can't. And I think that was proven. And so I think what we're seeing is sort of the other side of that where people certainly are.",https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=z4hExsMyQNo,48,2022-10-17 17:25:02
3442," in format, but the real truth is you can't. And I think that was proven. And so I think what we're seeing is sort of the other side of that, where people certainly are going to use technology. I'm not going to be silly about it in different ways. And the technology as it advances will take certain tripocations and change them. But they're just being replaced with higher value tripocations because people realize they have to be out and meeting one-on-one or in groups with people. And so I feel very good about where things are going. And clearly the macro environment is more challenging. There's no question that here in the US and in much of the world with inflation where it is that central banks, including the Fed here at home, are going to do what they have to do to slow demand in order to get inflation under control. I think that's a given. I think it would be crazy to say that that's not happening and going to continue to happen. But what's happening in our business is, as you said, we were not a beneficiary of COVID. We got beaten up quite badly. And we're seeing sort of the unwinding of a lot of that that gives us quite a bit of wind in our sales. I think for a reasonably extended period of time, what are those things that are being released? Well, people are changing their spending patterns, right? They are spending, during COVID, they spend all their time online buying things, okay? Whatever that was, cars, washers, dryers, microwaves, things, phones, technology. Now they're shifting their spending patterns back to what they had been doing pre-COVID, which has been a multi-decade trend towards spending on experiences. Well, we're experiences. So we have this big secular shift back to experiences. The other thing we have going on is international travel. The world is almost all of the world is open up. There are parts that are still not, probably China being the most notable, certain parts of Asia, all of the Japan is opening up. And as that occurs, you're starting to get all of that international travel that occurred prior to 2019, sort of back in and going. We have a long way to go to get back where we were, but it is starting to happen. And then as I already mentioned, just pent up to man. Just people had two and a half years of not doing things they needed to do, whether that was for leisure or business or meetings and events. And that is being released. So in the face of some macro headwinds, we have some pretty nice tailwinds that are propelling our recovery forward still. And you can look at the industry data we haven't reported. So I'm not going to talk about our data, but you can look at all the industry data up through last week. And you're not seeing signs in any of the segments of our business that suggests that the consumer is that things are weakening. They continue to sort of power up and continue to recover in a positive way. Well, Chris, just some food for thought. I stated a Hilton recently and I did a Zoom call. So just to give you a little insight into how I'm the new face of... I love that. I'm the new face of business travel. Hey, Brian. Yeah. But here's the thing. Mobility is... You're making my case to a degree that I've... We didn't talk about today, but I've talked about many times. The world is getting more mobile. Technology is enabling that. You had a lot of other things that enabled it low-cost airlines and other things over the last 20 or 30 years. But technology is connecting the world, speeding the world up and making people more mobile. And the reality is COVID accelerated that process where the office environment is changing, how you work, how I work, how everybody works is changing. In a way that I think people are going to be on the road more. People being on the road more and being more mobile is very good for our business. Chris, my back at the envelope math right now has you being the CEO, a public company, for 22 years. Of course, first with host, now with Hilton. You've seen some economic cycles. Does it feel like what the Federal Reserve is doing is going to slow the economy down markedly? Does it feel like we're headed into recessions of recessions past? No, it's really...",https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=z4hExsMyQNo,49,2022-10-17 17:29:13
3443, is going to slow the economy down markedly does this feel like we're headed into recessions of recessions past well it's really hard to know and i'm not an economist all of all leave that to others you're gonna have on that are smarter than i am on those matters i do believe that what the fed is doing is going to slow uh... the economy down i mean they've stated it that is their intention uh... that is what they need to do and so i think that they will do it uh... i am certainly hopeful that as a result of the actions that they're taking along with some of the natural things that are that are going on that that have pushed inflation so high sort of working their way through the system some of the supply chain issues around the world is those loosen up some of the labor issues around the world particularly in the west as as some of those free up some of the commodities issues that have been so uh... difficult which already have started to sort of ease not not just oil but other other commodities i think as you the accommodation of sort of the natural print you know process of those things sort of working their way through the system along with what the fed is doing uh... will slow the economy will help bring inflation down and and the hope is allows the fed at some point over the next six or twelve months to sort of stabilize having done their job with inflation more in a control and allow the economy to get its footing again and start uh... process of re-acceleration that is my hope i you know what are the odds right uh... i don't know that you know my own view is that there's a reasonably good chance that we will get a you know reasonable landing you know which is sort of soft to bumpy-ish landing with the economy and as i said it'll be what it'll be in the in the case of our business in industry i think that the tailwinds that we have you know we're are gonna take us for a while just because there's some natural structural things i already described that are happening that are that are wind in our sales that are going to you know get us through a decent period of time depends how long and how deep any slowdown is to know what the impact will be and obviously macro impact is could have impact on us ultimately but you know our businesses in fabulous shape are balance sheets and incredible shape our margins or higher than they've ever been right one in five rooms under construction the world have helped and brands on them were opening more than a hotel a day let's talk about that construction we're performing at the highest levels broadly you know if you look through q two uh... from a margin and profitability point of view that we ever have Chris let's talk about that room development because as i look across the number of rooms that you have in development at least as of the end of the most recent quarter it's in surplus of four hundred thousand rooms that are in development right now and so we think through the development pipeline and when those come online how long does it typically take for the property to be a creative to the business and has some of the more short term home stays that the trends in the market are clearly pointing to from consumers has that change the type of developments that you bring online that really that really hasn't so the gestation period once it's under construction at about half of those four hundred plus thousand rooms are under construction depends on where in the world you are but i'd say it's twenty four to thirty months uh... sort of on average you know maybe eighteen thirty months that depending on where you are in the world but things have gotten a little bit longer given all the supply chain issue so twenty four to thirty months before uh... once it starts before it's open and it's generating fees what we have seen is um... you know certainly the extended state business that and of which we are you know a huge participant with home with sweets and home to sweets by hilton have been uh... the best performers throughout covid uh... and they continue to perform well and so given more mobility i think those sorts of products you know have been somewhat favored but not to the exclusion of the others all of our brands at this point you know all eighteen are growing at at a healthy pace or driving the highest levels of market share that we've ever seen and the reality is that the man patterns whether or not exactly what they were pre-COVID and i do think there'll be a bit of a shift uh... when we get fully to the other side and get stabilized it's a lot more like it was uh... pre-COVID,https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=z4hExsMyQNo,50,2022-10-17 17:33:34
3444, COVID and I do think there'll be a bit of a shift when we get fully to the other side and get stabilized. It's a lot more like it was pre-COVID than you would think and so people are going back to the you know back to their you know back to their normal sort of travel habits by and large. Again a little bit more leisure a little bit more bleezure sort of the blend of the business and the leisure sort of put together a little bit more you know extended stay so longer stay which favors some of the extended stay brands we have a little bit more but nothing you know nothing off the charts that suggests that any of the brands that we have in our family brands today isn't really appealing to customers. Now as we think about new brands and we are and I'm not going to I'm not going to get ahead of myself but yeah we're definitely thinking about you know on the margin some of the things that did shift during COVID do they suggest us that there may be opportunities in terms of serving a broader customer base and I you know I do think you know watch over the next you know watch over the next six or twelve months I think you may see some things from us that sort of address that. Chris real quick before I let you go I went back to my notes from 2019 when you're at the all market summit I didn't ask you this I'm going to ask you now what is the secret to longevity you've been the CEO of building for 15 years how do you get that done give us some secrets. I don't know you know what it's balanced steady hand on the wheel you know have have a great strategy build a great culture have a great team you can leverage off of make sure you have balance in life and you know while this is of course really important to me that they're you know friends and family and other other interests that are important and you know keep everything in perspective but but but in life and business I think my longevity has a lot to do with just having an approach of having steady hands on the wheel whether it's my business life my personal life have a plan work the plan don't jerk the wheel around just steady approach. You my friend are timeless you still look 32 Hilton CEO Chris to set it thanks for joining us again a few few great a few more great hairs than I did in 2019 but that you know it goes with the territory you said that not me Chris has said always good to see you thanks for spending some time as we appreciate it good to see you guys thank you Brad over to you the stock market is still open still open indeed and in fact it's about lunchtime or lunchtime is wrapping up at least then you can kind of see that in some of the intraday activity here we've taken at least a little bit of a tick higher here most recently over about the past 30 minutes here in this 1 p.m. hour so taking a look at the Dow Jones industrial average you're seeing that up right now on the day intraday by about 2% 592 points added on today's session let's check in on the NASDAQ composite as well you're seeing that up by 3% more than 3% at this point in time catching a bid to the tune of about 343 points and the S&P 500 you're also seeing that in the green by about 2.7% want to dive into some of the sectors that we're tracking very quickly here we'll take you on over to a heat map view and taking a look at some of the 11 S&P 500 sectors well yeah they're all in positive territory right now with this rip your face off type of rally at least here today that we're seeing at this moment we've got more broadly the S&P 500 up by about 2.7% but outpacing some of the move higher yeah you've got consumer discretionary keep a close eye on excel y as we move on throughout the rest of today's session that's up 4% also want to take a look at tech here you've got that up by about 2.9% and here's why let's get on to another heat map we heard you like maps so we've got some more maps for your heat maps out there the apple stock apple shares you're seeing that up by about 2.9% here on the day some other mega cap tech also ripping to the upside here amazon that's up by about 5 and 3 quarters percent Microsoft MST up 3 and a half percent google alphabet alpha google whatever you're calling them at home call them up right now they're up by about 4% there you've got some lingering red here in the screen here of course you've got applied materials that looks like it's in negative territory right now by about a quarter of a percent but then even more so as we get into some of the Dow components as well you're not going to find too many laggards there in fact none all 30 Dow components are in positive territory right now being led largely by some of those tech names jp morgan also up by about 4.9% we've got more earnings that are coming forward over the course of this week and so keep a close eye still on some of the,https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=z4hExsMyQNo,51,2022-10-17 17:38:01

And so keep a close eye still on some of the banks that have yet to report. We'll get into the regionals as well. But even more so as we get some more of these Dow industrials that start to report, that's exactly where the markets could latch on to what they have to say about their future forecasts. We've got more right after the break. Coming up, believe it or not, the holidays are right around the corner. We'll take a look at what's ahead for the retail sector with Target CEO Brian Cornell.

3446," sessions. Brian Cornell is the chairman and CEO of Target. He leads a team of more than 4,000 people working in almost 2,000 stores throughout the United States. Cornell is tackling some big issues head on, inflation, a slowing economy, and those pesky supply chain issues. But in a year of retail train wrecks, yeah, that's you bet bet them beyond. Target has outpaced the competition. And the fight to stay ahead, Cornell has made some very tough decisions, embracing the athletes mantra, no pain, no gain. And so far, it seems to be working. Target, chairman and CEO Brian Cornell joins us now. Brian, good to see you. In person, yeah, we'll finance HQ. It's great to be back together. So I have been, I've been making a list. I've been going to Target. I go there every weekend. You know this. And I'm like, I have to ask Brian these things when he's in person. First, the retail inventory glut. Is it over? When does it end? Yeah. Well, Brian, one, I appreciate the fact that you're always in our stores. And you do send me notes, and I appreciate that. And you know back in June, we made a pretty bold and decisive decision. We said, all right, inventory is the built up. Consumer shopping habits have changed. They moved into different categories. And we said we're going to get out in front of us. So for Target, we put in that inventory problem behind us. And now we can focus on great execution, delighting our guests, getting ready for the big holiday season. So we were pretty decisive and said, we're not going to just let this roll into the next quarter. We'll deal with it upfront. And now we're excited that we're ready to play for the holiday season. I followed your entire time as CEO as Target. You've made a bunch of bold decisions. You exited Canada. First thing you did, I remember writing on that story as soon as it out. You 2017 investor conference. We're investing billions of dollars. Markets didn't like it. Now you're clearing out inventory. How hard is it to make these decisions as a leader? Well, if I think about each one of those decisions, there was probably a very similar model that we followed. Said, all right, what's the right thing for the target brand? What's the right thing for the target guest? What's the right thing for our team? And when we think about it through that lens, it's always the right thing for our shareholder long term. So whether it was leaving Canada and putting all of our focus on the US business or making that decision back in 2017, when others were closing stores, we said, we're going to double down on stores and put stores at the center of our strategy. We did the same approach as summer and said, all right, across all of retail, inventory is a reason. We're going to get out in front of this and make sure that we have the right assortment. We deliver great value. We protect that guest experience in our stores. And we also did the right thing for our team. I think you mentioned this is your ninth holiday season as CEO of target. How do you think this season will shape up compared to those other eight or nine? Well, Brian, you know we spent a lot of time talking to consumers, talking to our guests and the one thing we've heard throughout this year is they want to enjoy and celebrate seasonal moments. So the guests just told us they're excited about Halloween. Still a few days away. They're looking forward to Thanksgiving and celebrating with family and friends and they are looking forward to the Christmas holidays. So we know the consumer in America, the guest at Chocks Target, they are excited about seasonal holidays and we're going to be ready to make sure we delight them. Or session, anything, any indications you see, store traffic, what they're buying, anything that would suggest this could be a gloomy holiday season. Well, everyone's talking about recession and sitting here.",https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=z4hExsMyQNo,53,2022-10-17 17:47:14
3447," Asians, you see store traffic, what they're buying, anything that would suggest this could be a gloomy holiday season. Well, everyone's talking about recession and, you know, sitting here today, there's different points of view. You talk to bank CEOs, some gloom and doom, others are saying really healthy consumer. What we've seen all year long is really healthy traffic. And a guess that's shopping in our stores and shopping online so that strength and traffic has been driving our business. We've delivered solid comps throughout this year. We expect that to continue over the balance of the holiday season. All right, that is good to hear. So back to my shopping list here, if you can, you can just indulge in. Let me do it. 42 count of tide pods online, $13. Now, I'm a dumb millennial. I don't keep track of things that I buy in terms of price. But to me, that seems like a lot. Our shoppers to your stores trading down. That seems like a lot of money for basic essential. Yeah. Well, Brian, you know core to our proposition is making sure we deliver great value and affordability. Every time you shop. So we measure pricing really carefully, burst our competition. And we want to make sure we're priced right daily. We deliver great value and affordability. So on those items that you're looking at, we've got to make sure we have the right price every time you shop. And the guess is expect that from Target. How is your private label business doing in this situation? It's a very good one. So we now have a $30 billion own brand business. $30 billion. And it's performed incredibly well throughout the pandemic and continues to grow. So whether you're shopping, good and gather, or getting something for yourself, you know, good fellow that you can wear on set, or shopping any of our great brands, we now have $11 billion own brands in our portfolio. So that business just continues to perform. And we'll perform over the holiday season. It's huge, Brian. So yesterday I was actually in Bayshore Target. All right. We can Bayshore Target, Shoutout Bayshore Target. 15 registers open. Two of them were self checkout, but 15 registers total. 11 of them were closed. Is that the worker shortage? Brian, we've been staffed throughout the pandemic. We have 400,000 team members across the country. And going back to 2017, you remember we made a big commitment back then to invest in our team. We said in 2017, we were going to get to a starting minimum wage of $15. Now sitting here today, we made another big investment just a few months ago to say, all right, depending on the market, we're going to start at either 15, but it could be as much as $24 an hour to make sure that we have the team in place. We're going to hire another 100,000 seasonal team members for this holiday season. So because of our investment in wages, in benefits, in training, you know that we launched a debt-free educational assistance program last year. We made that over 70,000 team members raise their hands. I want to take advantage of that. So those investments have allowed us to retain and attract great talent. And we'll continue to make sure our team is our most valuable asset. 100,000 workers, that's a lot. Are you confident you can get that number? We are. We're off to a great start. Interesting. So you spent some time in the grocery industry. Of course, Target is big in selling groceries. And I know you watched a competition. What do you think about this Coralger and Albranson's merger? Does this change the game for the grocery industry and doesn't make you change how you think about your grocery offerings? Well, we'll watch it carefully. Obviously, it's a new announcement. It's going to take some time to close. But we're going to continue to focus on our food and beverage business. I mean, we've seen really strong growth and market share gains for over 20 consecutive quarters. So the strength of that business has really connected with the guests during the pandemic and has come out of the pandemic is really a strong driver of growth. So we're all in on the food and beverage business. We'll continue to invest. We've had a couple of great, own brands there. The Good and Gather is a $2 billion brand for us now in Food and Beverage. The guest has really responded all to a brand called Favorite Day. So we feel really good about food and beverage driving traffic and complementing our multi-category portfolio. I think I've seen wine at a Target too. These are big departments. They are. They're really important. And it's important for our guests. So we always listen to the guest and they've told us Food and Beverage is an important category for them. It drives traffic, but I also know when they're there. They're shopping beauty. They're shopping in a peril. They're getting something for their home. So it compliments our business really nicely. They're new shops, the new cosmetic shops and inside of the...",https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=z4hExsMyQNo,54,2022-10-17 17:51:20
3448," Also, when they're there, they're shopping beauty, they're shopping in a peril, they're getting something for their home, so it compliments our business really nicely. The new shops, the new cosmetic shops inside a target, how are they starting? Oh, the ultra beauty inside a target, it's been great. Bayshore just got one again. Yeah, Bayshore target. It's a big part of the store, and the interesting thing is, Brian, and you know this, obviously, walk into the stores right there. It's the first thing you see when you walk into these stores. Well, beauty's been an important category for years now, and ultra just compliments our beauty offering. And it was one of the things that our guests told us. We said, all right, what brand would you like to see here? On the top of their list, they said, we love Starbucks. We love the fact you've got Disney stores. I'll take away my Apple stores. But they love the fact that we've added ultra beauty. So those partnerships, whether it's CBS and pharmacy and Starbucks in almost every store, more Apple shops, more Disney shops, and now, Ulta, it just compliments the great offering we have of national brands and home brands. You just signed on for another, I think the press release said about three years. So let's just say three years. What does the next three years in Brian Cornell's look like, life look like in terms of charm and sea of tardiness? I think it's gonna be another chapter of growth for our company and continuing to invest in remodeling stores and building new stores and great locations like Bayshore, developing our own brands, accelerating our national brand partnerships, and making sure that we continue to invest in our team. And there's lots of things I'm proud of. And the fact that we added $30 billion of growth since the start of the pandemic is something that our team feels really good about. What I feel to me, what really fires me up is the investments that we've made in our team. And seeing the diversity in our organization, seeing the growth opportunities, seeing our culture come to life. When I talk about culture, we always talk about a culture of care and growth and winning together. That's something that I'm gonna continue to focus on for years to come. Brian, I've only known you to be a fired up guy. You're fired up right now talking about the target's business in its future. Where does that come from on a personal level? Well, for me, this is an amazing brand. And I've gotta tell you, I wake up every day feeling the responsibility of leading the target brand. Those 400,000 team members that work for us, those families that depend on us across the country. So I wake up with a huge sense of responsibility. And the pride I have in the team, in that brand, in the role we play in America is something that gets me up each and every day, feeling great about the role that I sit in today. Growing up, did you see yourself as a CEO? Yeah. Well, Brian, I think you know my story. And I grew up right down the road here in Queens, as a poor kid who kind of has worked for everything I've had. And I never even imagined I'd be sitting in a chair like this, but I embraced the moment. And I just feel proud to work for a great company. I was just having a moment there. I very much identify with that, Brian, that much is for sure. How do you, how have you balanced it all? This has been a very challenging three years for executives, not just CEOs, CFOs, COOs. How do you balance this time? And how do you just stay grounded? Yeah. Well, I'll go back to. I work with a great leadership team. The best leadership team I've ever been part of. I have an amazing wife who's been married to me for 40 years now, a great family that supports me. And as you know, I take care of myself. I make sure that I get to the gym every day and I go, yeah, I told you out of that. Yes, I shouted that out. Full disclosure, when Brian, that news hit the wire that you were staying for three years. I said, look, Brian's a fit guy. He can stay on for another 15 years. How do you think about succession? At some point, you will not be the CEO of Target. Shareholder, I'm sure, won't like it, but is that one of your most important jobs right now outside of planning for holidays? I think for any CEO, succession has to be something you focus on every day. Not just for my role, but for my leadership team and the officers and those key roles throughout the company. So we spend a tremendous amount of time. I have a fabulous HR partner, Melissa Kramer. And we spend time every week talking about talent. Last week I was traveling, I was in Washington, DC. I had a group of 28 black target officers that were with us in DC. We visited stores together, we spent time with outside speakers. And I'm always investing in talent. And making sure I get.",https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=z4hExsMyQNo,55,2022-10-17 17:55:43
3449," that were with us in DC. We visited stores together. We spent time with outside speakers. And I'm always investing in talent. And making sure I get to know the team. I spend time with them. We travel together. But as a CEO of a company like ours, $106 billion growth company, you've constantly be focusing on talent development. And thinking about who are the future leaders? They're going to guide this company. Whenever that day comes, and I'm not here, fair enough. Well, let's just, before we let you go, we're running short on time here. Let's just go back to the economy real quick. Because we are up against the holiday shopping season. So you see nowhere session. You think consumers will spend this season like they spent last season? I think it's just a very unusual time from an economic standpoint. And we're coming out of a pandemic. There were lots of stimulus checks that have been written, lots of childcare support. We're starting to see a consumer get back to normal life. They want to travel again. They're out in restaurants. So sitting here today, on one side, we've got inflation that's at a 40-year high. But unemployment incredibly low. And I think those two things are balancing out right now. So we continue to see a healthy guest shopping in our stores and shopping online. We'll see how they react throughout the holiday season. But when we talk to them, they continue to say they want to celebrate the holidays. And we know they're out on the streets of New York. They're in restaurants. They're in our stores. So right now, we're seeing a stable environment. Do you worry about, and I'm sure in the green we heard, Hilton CEO, Chris Nacetta just talked to us about what the Fed may do to the economy. Do you fear the Fed and what they're doing? Well, we've got to watch it carefully. But in our business, Brian, we've got to be agile. We've got to prepare for any environment. It's part of the strength of our multi-category portfolio. We sell food and beverage products and household essentials. We have all your beauty needs. We have toys for kids and apparel and home items. So we'll balance our portfolio to make sure we're meeting the needs of the consumer no matter what the environment looks like. All right, let's leave it there. Brian Cornell, always good to see you. Great to see you. It's been a pleasure following your time as you have targeted. I'm looking forward to continuing to follow it indeed. All right, we'll be right back. Coming up, Farma forging ahead. Pfizer CEO Albert Borla lays out the company's plans for growth in a post-COVID world.",https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=z4hExsMyQNo,56,2022-10-17 18:00:20
3450," Too quicküyorsunary translation is tired of male nostra The world is trying to move past COVID-19. Many people in the U.S. are there already with large, maskless gatherings, pretty much the norm at this point. Pfizer, of course, one of the companies that helped us get here. It is still relying on COVID for a lot of its revenue, but it's CEO has his eye on what will drive the next phase of growth. And that's CEO, of course, his Albert Borla. He is joining me now. It's great to see you again. Thank you so much for being here. Thank you for having me here. You know, as I said, we are trying to move, of course, past COVID, but it's not quite done with us yet. You yourself had COVID a couple of times, I believe, in the August timeframe. And I wonder if we're ever going to get to the point where vaccines can actually prevent COVID and its variance entirely. Is that the end goal? Is it a realistic goal? First of all, I had COVID once in August and the one in October. And the second time was in the UK. I think that the goal is to bring vaccines that they can last a year. I think that would simplify things, because I believe that people will not be that diligent to do the vaccinations as they are tired of making too many vaccines, and they want stability. But if we have a yearly vaccine, which is something that people are used like flu, for example, this is something that will take a significant amount of people to be able to get it. And yes, I think with the right vaccines, we can prevent from infections, to hospitalizations, to deaths and severe diseases. But of course, the vaccine has shown that death and hospitalization, the prevention is very high. And it comes to infections, so the virus is a bit lower. So it's more comparable to a flu than say, a polio, for example, something that you're just trying to eradicate. Oh, unfortunately, this virus is very nasty and makes a lot of variations and insists. So I think, although nobody knows, most scientists are in agreement that for the years to come, the virus will be around us. But we are lucky because we have a vaccine that can adapt. As much as the virus stops, the new technologies allow us the vaccine.",https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=z4hExsMyQNo,57,2022-10-17 18:04:22
3451," The virus will be around us. But we are lucky because we have a vaccine that can adapt. As much as the virus stops, the new technologies allow us the vaccines to very quickly follow and have a vaccine that is very effective against the current virus. And indeed, you all have just introduced a booster that is targeted at one variant of that virus, Omokhan, specifically. Do you envision it where everyone ideally will get a booster every year or will it just be recommended for certain portions of the population? I think the health authorities will make those recommendations while they see what is the severity of the strains that are available. But in many cases, I do not expect that people will comply with these recommendations as they did may be in the first months of the pandemic that people were really scared. So, complications will be getting the way. So, I see that the volumes of people that they will be getting the vaccine will be less. And that's what we've seen already, right? Uptake of boosters has been pretty low. I saw one figure recently. One in 10 eligible people are getting them. You all have sold a number of boosters already to the U.S. government. So, that demand taking care of. You're forecasting $32 billion in vaccine sales for this year, $22 billion for Paxlovid, which is to treat it. What kind of visibility do you have beyond this year in terms of those sales? I have kind of visibility. They know orders that already have been signed and I can calculate the demand. But 23 is going to be a year that likely will transition to many markets from governmental purchases to a competition in the marketplace, which means that vaccines and treatments going through the normal challenge and dissipate that will happen in the U.S. in 23. Now, as with all our products, we will provide guidance to the best of our knowledge about how much we expect next year to make when we give guidance for 2023. Now, I saw an estimate today, the prices are going to go up as it goes towards a normal type of marketplace. I saw an estimate from a company called Airfinity that the average price for doses is going to go to $37 next year from $18 last year. Does that seem in line with what you all are planning? I don't want to speak about price, but right now, in our contact with the U.S., the average price was 30 and that was divided between some that they are less, some doses, multivials. And then all the way to 50 in the single vials and likely in the loans you will have all the way to 50. The vaccines will be priced based on their cost effectiveness. And the cost effectiveness is multiple of what it is right now. The price when we give to the governments in the pandemic. You, of course, came out with the vaccine in partnership with Biontech, which is the German company. And you split the revenue with them. How long has that partnership last? Will it last even as we get to different stages of the pandemic? Is it an indefinite partnership? Absolutely. It's an indefinite partnership in COVID. And we are both focusing and bringing new science into building new, most effective vaccines. Apparently, the one most important element is what we discussed before. The vaccine that will last a year. And, of course, combination with flu is another very important. Right. I wanted to ask you about that. You just started phase three trials, right? Of the combination COVID flu vaccine. I think that was in mid-September that that's right. But we started, it is a combination study of a flu. Right. RNA vaccine. Right. And we are about to start a combo as well. And what kind of timeline then do you look for for that? I think the flu vaccine likely based on events, because an event during study, if there's a lot of flu, will come in for a sometime next year. We don't do immunobridzing for that one. And we are very confident that the vaccine will have very ill-efficacy. So we went directly to study the efficacy of the vaccine. For regulatory purposes, you're required only to do immunostaties. So that would take their time. And then the combination, if you have already and approved COVID-19, and you have already submitted about to be approved flu, the combination is very easy. Now, you mentioned more international expansion as well. And different ways of marketing the vaccine. You have a partnership in South Africa with the semi-national company there, which is starting production of the vaccine now. But it sounds like that they may not actually bring it to market until next year.",https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=z4hExsMyQNo,58,2022-10-17 18:08:24
3452," I'm national company there, which is starting production of the vaccine now. But it sounds like that they may not actually bring it to market until next year. What can you tell us about where they are with that and whether that is sort of a model for other partnerships we might see around the globe with Pfizer? First of all, this partner is a very trusted partner of us in South Africa. And we did this project because there was a lot of requests to feel good, better, the African countries that were in their continent, production. But unfortunately, a few months after the first months, we had enough vaccines for all that were produced. But those countries did very small number of vaccinations. It was not the availability of the vaccine, but it was many other reasons, infrastructure of them to be able to administer it, a hesitancy from people. And I think this is the issue that we need all to address to make sure that those people will believe and they have a system that it's easily can vaccinate. Yes, that's been an issue, obviously everywhere, not just there, of course. What can we look for next from the messenger RNA platform? Because there's been a lot of talk about that this is just the beginning. It's been worked on for years. COVID was sort of the big breakthrough event for better and for worse, mostly for worse for the globe. But what now there's talk about cancer vaccines? It used for other applications. So where is Pfizer on that? I would say there are two horizons. One is these applications and the other is the technology itself. There's a lot of work that's happening to improve the technology. Now it's modified RNA, could be self-apprifying RNA, could be circular RNA. There are a lot of work happening right now that can have a way better even RNA vaccines. The other thing it is what applications. And I think the easiest hanging fruit, the lowest hanging fruit, will be other vaccines. So there is a lot of work right now that is happening. And we will know, I think, this year, next year, if those work. A second horizon will be in cancer. There is a lot of work that is happening right now. And then the third horizon, I think it is in zine editing. Zine editing is a very exciting technology that for people that they have a mistake from birth on their DNA and that causes a significant disease to them, you can go and correct this mistake and for those people is really salvation. So I think we will see very exciting things from this technology. And are you planning to do much of that work internally at Pfizer? There have been some questions on the part of analysts about whether you, how much progress you could make without a partner as in beyond tech in the case of the COVID vaccine. So talk to me about how that's working within Pfizer. No, there are issues with intellectual property who has the technologies and the platform and there are issues with the combined work of two companies producing more. I think with BioNTech we have a lot of collaborations. For example, we are about to enter in a zoster vaccine that again is happening with them. And we are working to expand even further. So there will be a lot of things that we are doing together with BioNTech. But they are doing a lot of things alone and we are doing a lot of things alone. We are not shy from collaborations. Actually we believe collaborations is a better way to bring science to the world today. For example, in zine editing we are partnering with another biotech company that they have appropriate technology and to have all the expertise and scale to be able to produce solutions faster. Now, we are going into the pandemic. Before the pandemic even began, there were a lot of questions about Pfizer facing patent cliff, etc., etc. Then the pandemic happened. You had recently come into the company and we are trying to change it culturally and the way that Pfizer did business. The pandemic sort of did that and you did that in concert. So where are you now in terms of that question of what is next for Pfizer? What is going to be the next source of revenue as you are going to see patents roll off for various products? I think the pandemic from that aspect, you know, the bad things that brought to the world, brought something very important that gave us to the Pfizer organization a belief that nothing is impossible.

3454," old, for free. So just from a financial barrier, there are not substantial. Now, let me be very clear, there's still other challenges. These things are widely available vaccines in 70,000 spots. Basically, almost everybody lives within five miles of a place where you can get a vaccine or a treatment. So then the question is, what are the barriers? For some people, it's still hard to take time off. We've been working with employers encouraging them to take time off. For other people, you know, if you're a mom, a single mom with three, you know, doing two or three jobs, it's going to be difficult. So we have been, we've done a lot of work to try to make child care more accessible. There are still those challenges, but I do think for a vast majority of Americans, access and financial barriers are not what's slowing people. What about indoor air quality? I know there was a recent summit to discuss that, and there's been a lot of attention from some advocates about how to go about addressing that and the role that it plays in the spread of COVID. When you talk about not needing to bring back mitigation measures, I think about indoors and what we really need to think about for this winter. Yeah. Now that's a great question. So let's take a minute to talk about that. You know, I have been a practicing clinician for 20 years. I usually am in the hospital taking care of patients in December, January. The hospitals are always full, pre-pandemic, largely because of the flu. Throw in COVID on top of that. Throw in potentially a significant RSV season. It's going to be very hard to manage our healthcare system if we don't make important changes. And one of the things that we can do is to bring the burden of respiratory viruses way down for everybody and for all viruses and improving indoor air quality, better ventilation, better filtration. Many of these things, by the way, are really cheap to do. So you don't need to spend billions upgrading massive things. These are relatively cheap and easy interventions. They can make a substantial difference. I actually am convinced if people get their vaccines, if we make these improvements in indoor air quality, that the government's been pushing and trying to help people do, we really can get through a good fall in winter season this year and make it safer in the years ahead. I should have a very, very serious follow-up question for you. Looking at your job prospects. We know that you came on board to help lead this response, but are you surprised that you're still in this role now? And do you see yourself returning to academia anytime soon? Well, am I surprised that I'm still in this role? No. Like, when I think about the work that we have to do every day, I get up early in the morning, I come into the office, we have long days, what are we trying to do? We're trying to help make sure that we have vaccines available for Americans and treatments and tests. We have to work tracking sub variants and making sure that Americans are protected against that. There is plenty for me and my team to do that no one has been thinking about, boy, we're bored, we're running out of stuff, we got to close up shop. That's not been part of our conversation. We are focused on doing the work ahead of us and none of us are thinking about kind of what happens after that. Well, I want to follow up on that. I remember, you know, back in April 2021, back when you were in your previous role, it was the day I was getting a vaccine and you were talking about the reports that have been coming about about the difference between who is opting for a vaccine and how it went along party lines and how that wasn't helpful. Now that you're in the hot scene, now that you're in the middle of all the politics, do you still stand by that? Do you, or has the job changed how you perceive or how you see how politicized everything is? Yeah, I still don't see this as a deeply political thing. I understand other people do that in political commentators, see a political lens on almost everything. The way I look at it is a majority of people who voted for Donald Trump have gotten vaccinated, the majority of people who voted for Joe Biden have gotten vaccinated. Majority of Democrats, majority of Republicans, people are getting vaccinated. More people need to go out and get vaccinated as we think about this fall and winter campaign. It is not helpful to look at how you manage a respiratory virus. It's killed a million Americans. It is not helpful to look at that through a political lens. It is helpful to look at it through a medical and public health lens. And in that context, whether you're a Democrat or a Republican, you're going to benefit from these vaccines. You're going to get, but you're going to benefit from treatments. And that's my message and that's what we try to do every day. And lastly, do you think that there are age limits or age parameters around who's really more in need of a vaccine than others? We've had some people say the older individuals or more vulnerable individuals really should get the vaccine and younger healthy ones maybe, maybe able to pass. Yeah, I don't, the way I look at this. I don't look at it.",https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=z4hExsMyQNo,61,2022-10-17 18:42:19
3455," or individuals or more vulnerable individuals really should get the vaccine and younger healthy ones maybe able to pass. Yeah, the way I look at this, I don't look at it that way. The way I look at it is we know older people are at high risk. By the way, older people are at high risk for almost every condition. So that's not a new idea. A lot of people seem to have discovered that for COVID that's also true for the flu, by the way. What we know is that older people are gonna, they're at the highest risk, they're gonna benefit the most. Younger people are at lower risk, they're benefits still outweighs their risk of getting vaccinated, which is why I've encouraged all my family to get vaccinated, all my friends to get vaccinated, my nieces and nephews and kids have all gotten vaccinated because for them to benefit outweighs the risk, but no question about it, the biggest benefits are in older Americans. And if you're over 50, certainly if you're over 65, you've got to go get these vaccines because it's actually literally could save your life. It's a difference between life and death. Dr. Ashish, to your point, I think a lot of people learned a lot of things about health care throughout this pandemic, but Dr. Ashish, Joe Whitehouse COVID-19 Coordinator, thank you so much for doing us today. Thank you. Coming up, it revolutionized fast casual dining. Now Chipotle has some new tricks up its sleeve. CEO Brian Nicholl joins us next.

3456," Rattling Rattling Tr Express Brian Nichol is the chairman and CEO of Chipotle. He runs 2700 restaurants in North America and Europe. Nichol isn't still to culture at Chipotle of serving food that is both fresh and raised responsibly. Under his leadership, Chipotle has posted record sales and profits despite increased food and labor costs. Nichol plans to keep the growth story going by opening more restaurants and using new technology to drive sales. Oh yeah, and to keep that guacamole flowing. I'm here at Chipotle, CEO Brian Nichol and Yau finds his Brook Dupalma Brian. Good to see you here. Thanks for joining us. Look, we've been talking all day long about how the economy isn't isn't doing great. You have stocks in the tank. You have guys like me spending up to buy double meat bowls from a Chipotle. How do you explain all this? Well, you know, look, I think what we've really focused on is making sure that in challenging times and in good times, we ensure we've got great culinary. We've got our teams trained and ready to get people exactly what they want at the speed of which they want it and hopefully that's why guys like you keep coming back to the double meat. So I'm glad to hear that. Brian, is it just that your consumer is better off financially? You just focus on a higher income consumer and right now, buying large, they're okay. They have the money to go out there and shop and shop at Chipotle. Look, our brand is positioned in a really great spot. Obviously, as you mentioned, we have some higher household income on average in our customers. We also skew younger, but you know, we serve pretty much all income groups and I don't love to see some of the lower income groups being impacted the way they have, but we're fortunate that we're positioned the way we are with our commitment to food with integrity. And frankly, I think the job that the brand has done to position itself in this space of being, you know, an elevated food experience. So we get people trading down and I think we also get people trading up and just in a really unique position. So, you know, we're pretty fortunate. No doubt about it. Speaking of that younger consumer and Piper Sandler's fall 2022 team survey Chipotle was voted number three. It's also the most preferred Hispanic cuisine level for across upper income and average income teens there. You're also making headway on B real on TikTok. You have two million followers. How exactly are you viewing these social media apps as an asset to Chipotle and really engaging with that Gen Z community? Yeah, look, you know, we talk about this all the time here. We want to be a brand that's visible. We want to be a brand that's leading culture and then also in culture and you know, social media, you know, applications like B real are part of that. That's something that is just really taken off lately. My understanding is we've maxed out all our followers. We have to continue to figure out how we evolve that platform. But, you know, it's really important for us to show up in the places where people want to experience our brand and then do it in a way where it makes sense for us to show up. And, you know, we're very fortunate to have I think one of the best.",https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=z4hExsMyQNo,63,2022-10-17 18:50:48
3457," important for us to show up in the places where people want to experience our brand and then do it in a way where it makes sense for us to show up and you know we're very fortunate to have I think one of the best groups of leaders running our social media efforts or digital efforts and just really researching where young people are headed so that hopefully sometimes we're ahead of them and then other times they lead us to where we need to be. Another place that people can experience your Chipotle experience is on roll blocks. That's another interesting foray for fast food we see the others get into the game as well. So my question here is what exactly is the opportunity that you're seeing in the overall metaverse there? You know it's hard to like put it into dollars and actual sales it's much more to do with brand relevance and I think being visible and then playing a role in people's everyday. You know people make their meal decisions or their food decisions every day multiple times a day and I think it's important for them to understand what our brand stands for which is this idea of food with integrity, great culinary. You know we're going to do the right things for our people, our food and then our customers and if they're able to pick that up through programs like roll blocks to you know be real that's hugely important to us and then look we're going to always experiment and that's partly what we're doing with roll blocks. This is more about experimenting so that we can understand where potentially future sales may come from and at a minimum right now it's definitely the right place to be to communicate with young people. Brian, before you came on I talked to Target CEO Brian Carnell. He told me he is confident that they will be able to find 100,000 workers for this holiday season. I was just blown away given the labor shortage. Talk to us about your hiring plans right now. Are you able to find the workers you need to support not only the restaurants you do have open but also the hundreds of locations you plan to open this year? They looked at that's a great question Brian and I fully believe our you know opportunity to join our company and grow with our company and what we stand for will attract the right employees. You know we will open well over 200 restaurants this year and I've actually got to staff that with new people and then we also get to promote people into these roles and you know I think as people understand 90% of our promotions come from within we have industry leading benefits, both wages and those benefits that surround you whether it's healthcare, mental health, you know debt free degrees. We find that we're able to attract a huge amount of people and then the key piece for us is developing them, training them so that they become future leaders as we grow this company. But you know look I'm 100% confident we will get these restaurants staffed. Also 100% confident that our leaders in our restaurant will take the time to develop our crew so that they ultimately become general managers, our general managers become field leaders and you know you can see how this cascades into just bigger jobs so people have a growth their career with your poll A as well as move forward our purpose of cultivating a better world. So we'll get it done. And Brian on the employee front it seems like this is the year of unionization for restaurants not only at Chipotle but of course others in the fast food industry. This past late August one location in Michigan did choose to unionize I'm just curious if you could provide an update on the stance of Chipotle on unionization. Look I was disappointed to see that happen. You know I really don't think we need a third party to get between our restaurant teams and our company. We do a better job of communicating directly with our employees on what it takes to be successful at our company. What it takes have a great work environment and what it takes to provide a great customer experience. So it was just pointed to see it obviously we'll go through the process that we need to but you know I really don't see a need for it and hopefully going forward you know we'll continue to be able to communicate directly with our employees and grow our employees with that direct communication. Brian staying on employees if I'm correct 15% of your locations are in California. There might be law changes there coming up now that push up that minimum wage to $21 from $15 or so how would that impact Chipotle? Well you know look we already pay well beyond $15 an hour in California so the fact that national financial system goes through, you can have a hard career.",https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=z4hExsMyQNo,64,2022-10-17 18:55:16
3458," dollars or so, how would that impact it, Chipotle? Well, you know, look, we already pay well beyond $15 an hour in California. So the fact that, you know, there is legislation out there that has the potential to take the hourly to, I believe it's $21, $22 an hour. You know, that's going to put organizations like ours in a place where we'll probably have to raise prices. And, you know, it's unfortunate because it also impacts the economic model that could impact how many restaurants we even open in the future in a state like California, which is a real shame because our brand is loved in California, our employees love working at Chipotle in California. And I know the customers love getting our food. So, you know, hopefully the legislation doesn't get in the way of, you know, great economics that results in great opportunities for employees and customers. But if it does, you know, we'll deal with it accordingly, but it'd be a real shame. And in California, eight restaurants, you're also a test thing, new kitchen management system software that will help to monitor cooking times and ultimately tell employees or crew members, rather when exactly something is ready. I'm curious about how exactly these robots like this kitchen management system, but also a robot, especially like Chippy, really comes together with your crew members and how you ultimately see that spreading to other locations, rather. Yeah, look, this is something that we started down the path a couple of years ago because we asked our employees, they look, what are the tasks that either trip you up or, you know, you find very hard to get done? Or frankly, when people join our company, they say, look, I don't really love doing that work. And they're kind of figuring out how they can just be done with doing that work. So, some of the things we got feedback on were, hey, it's really tricky to know how much chicken to cook throughout the day because we get rushes, we get slow spots, then we get fast spots again. So, this is really taking, you know, artificial intelligence and understanding real time, how fast are you going through the chicken? How fast are you going through the guacamole? How many, you know, pieces of chicken do you need to go put on the grill now? Because based on what we expect happening at dinner time, this is what you need to cook. And so, it takes a lot of the guesswork out of it for the employee, and then it does it real time. So, that they can be, well, you know, our crew doesn't want to be out of anything, right? Because it's a disappointing situation for the customer, and then the crew doesn't feel like they're doing a great job. So, this is really a tool that will help them be more ready for the rush. And then if the rush exceeds what their expectations were, it informs them so that then they're prepared for the rest of their day so they continue to have a great day. You know, products like our chips, our customers always want us to be in on the menu with our chips. And so, what Chippy does is it helps us fry chips all day, right? Versus, right now we fry them at some points in the day, and then we sell through, and then it's like, oh, we're running out, now we got to go fry chips again. And, you know, look, that's a tough job, too, to be working on the fryer. And so, we got the feedback that, hey, look, if you could automate this for me, that would be a huge win. And so, there's other areas that we're working on as well. You know, we want to automate our digital make line. We're partnering with a company called Huythin, and we're really optimistic that we're going to be able to automate a lot more of that. So that our team members and crew are able to just focus more on the front line with the in-store hospitality. And then hopefully, the combination of robotics, artificial intelligence can take care of those digital orders so that they're accurate on time, and we just get people great experiences, whether it's online or in-line restaurants. Brian, two fun ones before you let you go here. Help the elephant's community know who Brian Nichol is. First, how'd you go from, from, I think I'm got this, some are in turn at PNG working on the scope, mouthwash account to being the CEO of Chipotle. Well, you know, look, it's one of those things that you never really know where your journey's going to go, but I was very fortunate to get my first job at Procter & Gamble. I got to work with a lot of great people. They took the time to invest in me so that I became, I think, much better at marketing and general management skills. And I've taken that with me down the road, and you know, here I am at Chipotle. One thing I did discover while I was at PNG at the opportunity to work on Pringles is I loved working in the space of food. And, you know, it just resonates.",https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=z4hExsMyQNo,65,2022-10-17 18:59:34
3459," And here I am at Chipotle. One thing I did discover while is FPG, at the opportunity to work on Pringles, is I loved working in the space of food. And it just resonated with me. And so fast forward here we are today. I still strongly encourage you to scope mouthwash, but obviously I'm a much bigger fan of blocker Mollie and Burrito's these days. I also know where to go with that, but let's end on this too. Because I also tell the Y'all finds, community, you were the guy when you were a talk about, you created the live moss campaign, when you came up with that, did you know that that would be the home run that has become? They still use this, Brian. Hope you're getting royalty checks. Well, look, that was another example having the opportunity to work on a great brand with great people. And we came up with what I believe was a very timeless concept around the idea of live moss. And it's great to see they continue to use it. And I continue to see that there have been success. So it's always fun to see places where you've been continue to have success with programs that you have the opportunity to work on. So very true. Well, we keep up the successful days over at Chipotle, Chipotle, CEO Brian Nickel, good to see you. And thanks for joining us as well. Y'all find this brook, Dupama. And we'll be right back.

3460," you you Welcome back to the 2022 Yahoo finance all market summit I'm Julie Heimen 2021 was a blockbuster year for IPOs more than a thousand new issues issues, plus direct listings, a surge in spack deals, it was a busy year. This year, market debuts have slowed to a trickle, and the companies that started trading last year, the class of 2021, as I like to call them, they've taken a steeper hit than the overall market, as measured by the Renaissance IPO ETF. I'm joined now by CEOs of two of those companies that came public last year, New Bank, CEO, David Vela's, and Billion Earth CEO, Beth Gerstein. Also, by the way, are co-founders of their respective companies. I talk about the same a lot, that there were so many companies that came public in 2021, and there aren't too many of them who stock prices at least have gained. Whether they're fundamental businesses have done well is a very different matter. I wanted to tease that out a little bit, but I do want to start in the beginning with both of you. David, you co-founded New Bank in 2013, Beth, you co-founded Billion Earth in 2005. How did you each decide to make the decision to go public last year? What made you decide to pull the trigger, Beth? I'll start with you. For us, it was a natural evolution. We've been operating for 17 years. We were growing. We were profitable. We had, I think, a lot of discipline originally being bootstrapped. We thought it was a good time for us to be able to raise a little bit of money, for us to allow our team members to participate in owning part of the company, which I'm really proud of, and I think we were right. It was a good time for us to go public. David, what about you? About 2019, we started thinking about going public and getting into a process of about two years' preparation. We obviously started seeing a lot of private funding available, but we are a business that needs requires a lot of capital, and at some point it was very clear that we were going to go public to really access that liquidity. We had also been building New Bank already for about eight years. So we put a stake on the ground in 2019 that by December 2021, we were going to do it as the market went in that direction in 2021. We decided that it was the right time, and we were very happy that we were able to sneak in right at the end. Yeah, you made that deadline just. And I was looking at how the stocks had performed. That your shares were 42% in the first day. Your shares went up around 32% over the first couple of days. They have trended lower with the rest of the market. You've seen, like I mentioned earlier, most of the companies that came public last year, that's their trajectory. And I ask a lot of CEOs about their stock prices, whether they're new issues or whether they've been on the market a long time. Most of them say, well, I try not to pay too much attention to the stock price, which you got to pay some attention to the stock price, right? So David, how do you think about the stock price action and how you interact with investors when you see the price going down? Yeah, so it took us out, say, we would price the IPO in December and then we went into this market and it took us a few months to try to figure out what was happening. What was the market telling us with the sudden movement in price? And after about two or three months, I've tried to understand what was going on. We kind of think the conclusion that, or thesis, that the largest provider of...",https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=z4hExsMyQNo,67,2022-10-17 19:07:57
3461," price. And after about two, three months, I've tried to understand what was going on. We kind of came to the conclusion that, over thesis, that the largest provider of financial services in the world, especially in emerging markets, will continue to be technology companies. And that the thesis fundamentally had not changed. And in fact, there were some trends in a market like this one that makes our business much way much more interesting than a year ago, although the market is a little bit more painful and the price is really not being able to price that effectively. And so what's happening is that effectively companies, everybody in tech, has been traded the same thing, has been punished the same thing. But there's some whose fundamentals are an alternative, whose thesis is an alternative. That's our case. We're profitable. Brazil and Latin America, macro seems more concerning in this environment, but we've actually have a very positive view since the very beginning. And Brazil will actually grow 3% this year, more than China, with an inflation lower than the US. Colombia will grow 8%. So you're starting a bit of a decoupling, at least to this year, I think next year will be a little bit harder. But in reality, what's happening is that everybody's sort of putting the same box without really understanding the differences between the different tech models or the geographies or profitability core or any specific details about the company. Well, and it's not even just tech, right? It's sort of like everything has been thrown into that. That's going to mean you guys, early in earth, are sort of tech first, if you will. But you're a retailer, right? You sell diamonds and different kinds of jewelry. So it's interesting that you two are two different companies, different types and categories. But yet, you know, you get this whole tard with the same brush thing when everybody's looking at these new companies. You mentioned a moment ago, you don't forget the timing. You think it was good timing still for the company. So how do you think about the stock price and the reaction that we've seen? I hear David, the direct to consumer has been a more challenging sector as a whole. And I think you end up getting lumped in with all of the companies that ended up going public at the same time period. We're very different. We've been operating for 17 years. We've been growing and profitable. I continue to be growing and profitable. So I think it differentiates us, but investors are still learning. And, you know, frankly, I think there's right now they're not really taking the time to look at each company. They're overwhelmed, based on just some of the volatility. So for us, it's really about how do we, you know, not pay too much attention to what the stock is doing on a day to day basis. You know, makes sure obviously the team is motivated and that we're focused on the long term while making sure that we have the discipline in the current environment. And it seems to me that both of you are probably in modes where it's not as though you would use your stock to go out and acquire that you're sort of organically growing. Would the plans have been different if the stock price had done something different? I think that, you know, at this point, we have a really strong balance sheet. So we have a lot of strategic options that are available to us, whether it's cash, whether it's, you know, how we want to think about organic growth is actually traditionally how we've been growing for the past 17 years. So I feel like we're really well positioned. We don't, you know, it would be nice to have that lever, but we have a lot of other opportunities as well. Yeah, we, we, organic growth is definitely the preferred growth stage at this time. We have already over 35% of the Brazilian adult population is a customer, but we have less of that market share across all the different financial services products. So we have significant opportunity to grow with the cross-cell to that very large base, almost 70 million customers in Mexico and in Colombia or new markets. We've already the largest credit card issuer. So a lot of opportunity to grow organically and we're seeing less competition in the environment. However, we raised more money than we needed last year and we are seeing some potential emanate targets that we were discussing with 12 months ago back on the table at evaluation, this kind of 50, 60%. So both organic and inorganic opportunities actually seem more interesting in a market like this one for somebody like us that is fully capitalized than competing 12 months ago. I agree. Like, we have a real opportunity to take share in a volatile environment and I think that, yeah, that is a unique thing in this market to really feel confident to do that. Right? If you have a good balance sheet as you were talking about. And a good position. Right. That's the key. Good brand. Let's also talk about the bigger environment, right? And recession talk, which of course has been everywhere. You were mentioning the%.",https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=z4hExsMyQNo,68,2022-10-17 19:12:28
3462," on sheet as you were talking about. And a good position. Right. That's the key. Good for hand. Let's also talk about the bigger environment, right? And recession talk, which of course has been everywhere. You were mentioning that Brazil is still predicted to grow this year. The US is expected to still grow, even if it's not growing very much at this point. But what are you seeing from consumers right now? What are you expecting for the holiday season, for example? Talk to us about the tea leaves that you're reading. Well, as a public company, we are in our quiet period. So I'll just start off that way. What can you tell me sort of high level about what you're seeing? From a high level, I think what we are really proud of is the positioning we have in our market. We have a really strong brand for Gen Z and Millennial audience. Love persists in all different types of ups and downs where people continue to get engaged and people to continue to celebrate with jewelry as a source of value. And we're well positioned because we're very asset light. So I think a lot of other companies have big inventories that they need to be able to discount for us, where very inventory light, we're able to scale up to meet the consumer demand. That puts us in a really powerful position so we can really navigate no matter what the current environment is. And it has been a volatile market. I've said that in the past and we're expecting for this holiday to be able to meet the customer where they are. And that's all I can really do at this point. When you say your inventory light and asset light, how does that work for you? Like if someone's ordering ring or whatever they're ordering, do you then do sort of on demand ordering? How does it work? Yeah, so the way we operate, we work with a virtual diamond inventory model. So the diamonds that we have, which is over 200,000, are actually on our supplier balance sheet. And then a customer will order a ring and we will make that to order. So it really depends on having very strong supplier relationships. And those suppliers are ready for us to scale up as we see the demand actually happen. So those typically take around one to two weeks. So the customer gets a highly personalized, really beautiful, unique product and we don't have the inventory risk. Which I think in this environment specifically is going to serve us really well. Yes, we've heard a lot of inventory build news from all kinds of different retailers. Let's get back to economic activity for you, which is a very different picture because we are talking about emerging markets here. You mentioned the Brazilian growth picture for this year. Next year, a survey of economists by warriors found that they're looking for growth from about 8 tens of 1%. So it's still expanding, but at a much slower pace. Again, what are you sort of seeing through your customer base and what are the indications? Do you feel like a recession is coming down the pike at some point? Yes, interesting about us is we grew since we started a business in 2013. We've effectively only grown through recessions and it's interesting to talk to other US companies when they see it's been talked about inflation and low economic growth as something that nobody has really ever seen. For us, it has been Brazil 101. We've only seen recession. We've only seen high inflation. We saw a 7% GDP contraction in one year as we grew. We saw the worst recession in 100 years. So as we look at 2023, yes, it's going to be more moderate growth, but relatively to what we have already experienced, it's actually much more positive. And a lot of the trends that we're banking behind are almost uncorrelated with the market. Regardless of where the market grows 1% or 3% or 5%, more people will go to digital banking because it's a better experience. It's lower fees. It's lower interest rates. Regardless of the growth, you have 250 million Latin America that has no access to banking that are migrating into the digital banking. And so a lot of the technology trends underlying the growth of the business tends to be a bit uncorrelated. We definitely have credit risk and that is the part of our business that has linked to the economy. So we have to have increased resilience in an environment like this one. We've been increasing resilience through the year. And in general, what we've seen so far is a bit of normalization from abnormally low credit the linkages through the pandemic. So much more going to normal basis where you still kind of parade with very healthy margins. So circling kind of back to the beginning here. So we're going on a little more than a year since you became a public company, almost a year for you to be a public company. What's the biggest change for you in sort of whether it's biggest lesson learned, biggest discovery, big SD.",https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=z4hExsMyQNo,69,2022-10-17 19:16:49
3463," many years since you became a public company, almost a year for you to be a public company. What's the biggest change for you in sort of, whether it's biggest lesson learned, biggest discovery, biggest lifestyle change or you're running around more? What's the biggest difference? Yeah, I'd say transitioning from private company CEO to public company CEO, it's a big change. It's humbling, I think, being able to balance the long-term strategy, articulate the long-term strategy, and also be able to deliver on expectations is, for me, I think, a good lesson to learn. I think it's made us stronger as a company. We've been more transparent with our team, with outside investors, and I think that also helps to clarify internally. We are really going after being the number one destination as a fine jeweler for this younger consumer. We have this really strong OmniChannel strategy. We're really expanding and fine jewelry. So all of that, I feel like we're able to deliver as that long-term guidepost, while still making sure that we are, are we meeting guidance? Are we able to talk about what's happening in the quarter? So holding ourselves to that standard, I think, is what the challenge is, but I think it's driven a lot of internal accountability. Interesting. David, what about for you? I would agree with that. I think first, always in communication, it's probably the biggest challenge. You need to be actively communicating with a number of different constituencies, especially when there is so much volatility in a market like this, when things are changing so much. And beyond that, obviously, we don't want to change or view of optimizing the company's value for the long term, with things that that still the right way to run the company. But we need to be able to also show investors that in the short term, we have very high rigor in terms of decisions that we're making, and that there has to be really strong economic fundamentals in the business. So it's balancing the rigor and the communication that we're doing the right things in the short term, with continuing to double down on the long term opportunity that the business has. And I think because we're both profitable, it makes it a lot easier. We're coming from a position of strength. And that's a differentiator too, among those public debut, really quick question for you. Most popular cut among engagement rings right now. One of our young producers wanted to know. Oh, ball. Oh, ball. Interesting. Okay. Long-haired advances are really hot. Change a lot over. You know, it changes over time. Yellow gold's really popular now. Mm. Couples are making decisions together. They're definitely changing trends in the industry. We'll have you back to talk much more about all of that. And we'll have you back to David. Great to be with both of you. Thank you so much for being here. David Vellis of New Bank at Beskerstein, of Brilliant Earth, much more AMS coming your way. You're watching the 2022 Yahoo Finance All Market Summit. We'll be right back after this.",https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=z4hExsMyQNo,70,2022-10-17 19:21:26
3464," That's going forward.field Breakdown Welcome back to Yahoo Finance's All Market Summit. The progress of Fed policy has put the markets on edge fueling fears at the economy's headed towards a recession as the Fed remains committed to getting inflation under control here to discuss this and much much more. We want to bring in well-known business and economic policy leader Gary Coney's a vice chairman of IBM former director of the National Economic Council under President Trump. Gary, it's great to have you. Thanks so much for joining us here in studio. Thank you so much for having me. So let's just start a big picture. We have high inflation, Fed saying that it remains committed to getting inflation under control. And the markets are bracing for what's next, what's your assessment of where we stand today? I think you sort of summarized that, you know, everyone's talking about the last CPI report. Obviously we're 8.2% inflation in the United States here. A totally unacceptable number, a number that really hurts consuming Americans and really hurts, it's really regressive inflation. So you understand from the Fed's standpoint, they have to tackle inflation. They have a blunt instrument. They have a blunt instrument which is interest rate policy at this point. They're trying to increase rates. They're trying to increase rates to slow demand down, just take demand out of the economy. They really cannot affect the supply side of the equation. The problem that we have or the issue that people are debating now is the Fed started raising rates earlier this year. We've gone through quite a few interest rate rises already. And the economy has not slowed down from an inflationary standpoint. That said, we all know that this monetary policy takes time to feed itself through the economy. Unfortunately, it hits consumers almost immediately. So if you've got an adjustable rate mortgage, it adjusts the next day. If you've got credit card debt that adjusts it adjusts the next day. But the real policy affects on slowing down demand, that takes months, almost a year to a year and a half, to feed through the economy. So there's this discussion going on. Has the Fed done enough in interest rates to slow down the economy? And we don't know because the effects are still being felt of the first rate increases. Or they not done enough because we continue to see inflation move higher and higher. So I think the Fed is in a very difficult position. They were late to the game. They started raising rates late, which means they're now playing catch up. I think we all believe that they will raise rates two more times this year at the two more meetings. Probably at least 75 basis points in the November meeting. And probably another 50 to 75 basis points at the end of the year. So we will have gone from basically zero Fed fund rates in the United States to well over 4% rates in the course of a year. That's a fairly dramatic move. And we need to understand what impacts that's going to have longer term to the economy. And what impacts do you think it could potentially have longer term? And are we going to be able to do this without going into a recession? Well, the question is what are the impacts? And as I said, the Fed can try and affect demand, the demand side of the equation. They can make borrowing money more expensive. They can make homes more expensive. They can try and slow consumers down because things are harder to buy because they don't want to finance them. They can't affect the supply side of the equation. And right now when you look at the data and you look at what's going on in the inflationary front, a lot of the inflation comes from commodities and commodity inputs. So by raising interest rates, we don't create more oil. We don't create more food. So we're trying to create a balance of oil. We're trying to create a balance of food. We're trying to create a balance of workers back into the labor force. I think one of the big underlying components of inflation is wage price inflation. We keep seeing 5% plus wage inflation.",https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=z4hExsMyQNo,71,2022-10-17 19:25:25
3465," into the labor force. I think one of the big underlying components of inflation is wage price inflation. We keep seeing, you know, 5% plus wage inflation. Wages filter through everything we do. As the economy has shifted during COVID to where we're buying lots of goods because we really couldn't leave our houses. So we're buying things, we're having them sent to our houses, and we were consuming goods. We're now back into a more normalized economic cycle. In a normalized economic cycle, we as Americans, we're good consumers of services. We like to go out, we like to be entertained, we like to travel, we like to go to events. The service economy is all labor. When you go out to a service event, you're really buying mostly labor. So when you go to a concert or you go to a restaurant or you go to a bar, you're buying some inputs, some commodities, but you're buying an awful lot of labor. That labor cost has not come down. And it's another area where the Fed is trying to get some response. They're trying to get businesses to not grow as fast. They're trying to get people, the businesses did not hire as many people. But we saw, even in the last month's unemployment report, we saw 3.5% unemployment. We still see non-farm payrolls growing. So the interest rate impact has not fed through to the business cycle yet. We're going to have to see job destruction if we're really going to see inflation be curtailed. And I think that's hard because we've gone through a lot of fundamental changes in this country. Prior to COVID, we were all talking about the aging American workforce. Guess what? We're still an aging American workforce. We didn't stop aging during COVID. Unfortunately, during COVID, we lost about 2 million people from the labor force, either through long COVID or unfortunately, they passed away, which is a horrible event. But we've got to recognize we've lost people from the labor force. And then we had a bunch of people sort of late in their work cycle who decided to leave the labor force. So we've now have a smaller labor force population in the United States. So businesses to attract workers into the labor force are having to pay more to get workers in the cycle, which is inflationary. Wages go up. They pass those increased wages onto the consumers. And we're in this inflationary cycle. So the feds are going to continue to keep raising rates to try and break this cycle. They won't know they have broken it until long after it's broken. So what does this mean then for the equity markets? Because here we stand today, the S&P off more than 20% and you're to date. And Nasdaq down more than 30% and you're to date. And you try to gauge that downside risk here for equities. What does that look like? So again, the famous ad is, don't fight the fed. It's been true for this cycle. It was true for last cycle. When we had a zero interest rate policy, you wanted to own risky assets. When you've got the fed increasing interest rates and the alternative, the risk-free rate, the rate of return it now is sort of 4% for short duration treasury bills. That's an attractive rate of return for short-term treasury bills. And really what's happening more than anything is the equity markets trying to figure out, what are the future earnings of a company? So remember the value of S&P is the present value of future earnings. So if a company has higher input costs and it has higher labor costs, and hopefully if the fed is successful, lower demand for their goods or services, what is the forward earnings of a company look like? Then I could put a multiple on that. And right now, the market is trying to determine what forward earnings are going to look like and what multiple that should trade at. And as long as the fed is continuously raising rates, trying to slow down the economy, trying to make things more expensive, trying to make labor more expensive, the market is going to continue to try and find a clearing price for that. We again, it's like everything else in this world. We won't know we've met that clearing price till long after the bottom is here. We may have met it already. A lot of people think we have not got to that clearing price, but the market right now is trying to figure out what future earnings look like and what multiple we should put on that. Gary, I'm curious to get your perspective on this. The job that Fed Chair, J. Powell has done so far, are you satisfied with that? I think they relate to the game. I don't like to criticize the fed. I don't think any of us like to criticize the fed, but they've got a tough job, but they've got enormous amount of resources at their disposal. They stuck to this transitory inflationary argument way past where I think many of us, myself included, and I'll put myself, I'll make this personal.",https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=z4hExsMyQNo,72,2022-10-17 19:29:57
3466," at their disposal. They stuck to this transitory inflationary argument way past where I think many of us, myself included, I'll put myself, I'll make this personal, way past where I thought it was transitory. Maybe in the beginning, as we're bringing production back online, we're bringing supply chains back to normalize level, there was some transitory natures to it, but the Fed stuck to their transitory argument way deeper into the cycle. And it was clearly not transitory. We clearly had real inflation in the system. We had shortages, we had food shortages, we had energy shortage, we had tough time getting people back into the labor market. So as I said, the Fed was late. And when you're late, you're playing catch up and I could think they continue to play catch up. How much of it, because we know when we look ahead to the midterms or 22 days away from midterms right now, Republicans largely running on the fact that high inflation, slowing economy, that's the fault of the Biden administration and Democrats from your assessment. I guess how much of it is a result of White House policy versus factors that are just simply out of their control? You know, it's never, ever one factor. The one thing we learn is when we study the history, we'll know that it wasn't one factor. You know, a lot of people will point to the huge increase in money supply. So as the Biden administration was sending out stimulus checks and they're putting money in the hands of consumers, we were increasing the money supply. As you increase the money supply, you've got dollars chasing goods, those dollars are willing to chase the price of goods higher and higher. So we clearly saw some inflationary pressure from the consumer being in a very good position, having very, very good balance sheets unlevered. And by the way, we still see that today. If you see the bank earnings that we saw reported today, the banks were talking about the fact that they still have fairly high deposit rates. The consumers are still in relatively good shape, the linkancy levels are low. So we still see the US consumer. This far into the COVID relief, we still see the US consumer with a very good balance sheet, still have the ability to spend. And that clearly is part of the cause of the inflation. We also had a situation where you could talk about the supply side. We had a change in energy policy, a fairly dramatic change in energy policy, energy policy, drove a lot of this. We've clearly had some unforeseen weather events around the world in the food. We clearly have a war in Europe where we're having food disruption. So again, it's hard for me to put my finger on a single event. But all of these definitely have some blame and some huge contribution to why we're having this inflation. Gary, one of the priorities of the Biden administration has been the chip sector, the passage of the $52 billion chip sector. I knew you, along with some of your colleagues from IBM, me the trip down to DC to help that get over the finish line from your sources so far, how is the rollout going of this? I think the rollout is going fine. I mean, I can't tell you it's going poorly or great. It's a slower rollout, but we knew that. The Commerce Department right now has been empowered to go out and spend the money that was given to them by the government. But really, the opportunity there was not just giving the Commerce Department money to spend. But if this is going to be successful, it was going to be a huge public-private partnership. And I think we've seen the private sector get together. We've seen the private sector announce massive investment in chips in the United States. You've seen it in upstate New York. You've seen it in Columbus, Ohio. And these are not small investments. We've seen multiple billion dollars, tens, 20, 30, 40, 50, 60 billion dollars investments by companies, IBM, last week when the president was there announced a $20 billion commitment. You've seen Intel announced investments. We've seen multiple companies announce investments. So the government has done what they needed to do. They got leverage in the system. They talked about the importance of chips in the United States. They talked about being supportive of chips. We've got to get the permitting process sped up. But the private sector is bringing the money to the situation because ultimately the money that the government's putting in is just a little tiny down payment on a big huge issue of being chip independent in this country. And Gary, I want to switch gears here just a little bit and talk about a story that's been in the headlines recently, every recently. So that's a comment from Kanye West and what he has made public on his social media platforms, his large media presence out there, the anti-Semitic remarks that he has made multiple times. And I bring this up because it's been five years since.",https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=z4hExsMyQNo,73,2022-10-17 19:34:13
3467," by Semitic remarks that he has made multiple times that I bring this up because it's been five years since Charlottesville. And here we are today with a similar type of rhetoric, hateful rhetoric that's being said on a platform that has millions and millions of followers. What's your reaction to the remarks that we've heard from Kanye West? You know, look, they're just unacceptable. You know, I'll say the same thing about Kanye West remarks, as I said to the President of the United States at the time. It's just unacceptable in this day and age in the world that we live in for people in a leadership position with that big of a platform, with that big of a microphone, to make those type of comments. And Gary, real quick, we tried to ask you this two years ago when you were at AMS, whether or not you were planning to vote for President Trump in the 2020 election. So when asked this to you, but put it in a slightly different way. Did I answer back then? You didn't answer back then. So I'm going to give it another shot here. What would you say to people that might be inclined to support a second term for President Trump? Look, it's America. Everyone's entitled to vote for whom they want. That's the greatest part of our democracy is that we allow people to run for public office and the citizens of the country get to decide who sits in those public offices. We're in the middle of a midterm election right now and we'll see who takes control of the House and the Senate. Certainly. Well, 22 days away from those midterm scary cone, always great to have you here at Yahoo Finance. Thanks so much for joining us. Thanks for having me. Let's get over to Jared Blackree with a closer look at the market movers here in the final 30 minutes, hey, Jared. That's right, China. After a market route Friday, we are looking at the Nasdaq up three and a half percent the best day and weeks. Here you can see it on the intraday basis. Here's a look at the trailing week. You can see all the volatility. It is net up 1.3 percent over that time period. I want to take a look over a longer period of time. This is going to be the S&P 500 over the last three months. We are coming off of the lows of the year and this is that volatile CPI print that we got now. We do want to check on the bond market, five year TNO yield that is coming off of a four and basically a quarter percent that is down three basis points. But you move down the curve to the 13 week T bill, T bill yield that is up six basis points to the highest level since 2007, the 30 year at the highest level that is up four basis points since 2011 and the US dollar index easing slightly. That's probably one of the things that's giving a bid or at least allowing a bid to equities right now. We're seeing consumer discretionary that is XLY. That is in the forefront up over four percent followed by real estate tech communication services, the mega caps plus real estate really feeling the love today. And here you can see Tesla up 7 percent Amazon close behind up six and a half percent and video up 6 percent. And we take a look at some of the leaders here. You can see ARC. That is up 7 percent. IPOs, internet stocks, memes, Chinese stocks, cannabis stocks, software stocks and gambling stocks, all feeling some love, all of those are on the top row here. And we got to check in on the banking sector, banking bank of America reported earnings. Actually, I believe net interest, net interest margin was up 24 percent on the year. That stock up 6 percent. We're going to have Goldman Sachs earnings tomorrow morning along with Netflix after the bell. In the meantime, much more AMS for you. We're going to be right back. Breaking the glass ceiling, WNBA Commissioner Kathy Engelbert tells us how the league plans to capitalize on a historic season.",https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=z4hExsMyQNo,74,2022-10-17 19:38:37
3468,"agers You Welcome back to Yahoo Finance's All-Markets Summit. The WMBA just wrapped up its most-watch season in 14 years of the viewership jumping 16% from just a year ago in the league's shattering fan engagement and on-court records. Here for more on that, we want to bring in Kathy Engelberg, WMBA Commissioner, also former CEO of Deloitte Kathy. It's great to have you. Thanks so much for stopping by here at Yahoo Finance. Great to be here, Shana. So let's talk about that record-setting season that you just wrapped up here. Obviously, the sport is getting more and more popular. How would you sum up this most recent season? Yeah, you just named some of the viewership gains we had, but across social media, even in our partners like ESPN, they had 1.1 billion impressions on W related content. So it's important our partners see the value of the WN Women's Sports. And there's a huge changing of the guard going on right now with Sue Bird in her last year just retired. Sylvia Faust, two icons in the game, but great players like Asia Wilson, who was MVP of the WMBA finals. And just like an amazing, and just won the gold medal at the FIBA World Cup for the Las Vegas aces now, winning their first ever franchise championship. So he's changing the guard to the younger players and really great with our veterans too. That's 16% jump and viewership there that I just mentioned in the intro. What do you attribute this to? Part of it is when, if you build it, they will come. So one of the things we've done, more marketing, more digital, meet our fan where they are. Our fans use more diverse, our fans use younger, more women. And so finding that fan, bringing them in, retaining them in the game, getting them to games, getting fans and seats. We come off to tough COVID years for the WN Women's Sports. One in front of no fans in the 2021 season. So we expanded the number of games up to 36. We had an amazing, all-star game and amazing draft. Most viewed draft since 2004 when Diana Terraci was drafted. So again, we raised capital back in February. We're deploying that capital against things like digital and marketing and telling player stories and the players. The on-the-court records, triple doubles, double doubles. A sightment of the game is really driving it as well. I want to talk a little bit more about that capital raise in just a few minutes. But first, let's talk about when we talk about getting more eyeballs on the game. A lot of the focus when it comes to sports, at least over the last several months, has been the shift to streaming. I guess how important are streaming deals when you're looking to grow the sport? Because a lot of times we talk about Amazon when it comes with Thursday night football. We talk about the MLB's recent streaming deals. But WNBA, you have a deal with Amazon. You've also aired some games as a stream, then, I should say, on Twitter. Yeah, the whole marketplace in media is being disrupted, as we know. Not just linear and traditional, but also streamers are now being disrupted. And actually, you're trying to get into live sports. It's something that's still getting a lot of eyes on the game, both in linear and in streaming. So as we see the NFL roll, there's out. We were a little before them, but we didn't have the marketing quite behind us. So it's always going to be now a part of the package. And when your fan base skews younger like our fan base does, and you're trying to bring",https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=z4hExsMyQNo,75,2022-10-17 19:43:34
3469," a little before them, but we didn't have the marketing quite behind us. So it's always going to be now a part of the package. And when your fan base skews younger like our fan base does, and you're trying to bring in that digital native that Gen Zer, who has probably cut the core, and you've got to have Roku enable man, Apple TV enable man. You have to have all of that. And that's why you have to know who your fan is and look at the data and then drive it from a digital perspective. And Kathy speaking of that, I know you are your current broadcasting deal with ESPN ends in 2025. When you're looking for that next media agreement, what are you hoping or what do you want that agreement to include? Again, I think we're going to look at all different forms of how to bring the game to our fan base who does skew younger. And really, if you think about how it's being disrupted, it's also around marketing so people know where to find you and making the friction out of viewing a game for the fan. They have to know where to go on the spot, or they're going to lose interest. And they also the content around it, not just the game itself. And we're 120 minutes and you're done. So it's not our games are quite fast. But it's the content around it and the storytelling around it and the medium and short form content that's going to drive, I think, viewers in to determine how we think about media going forward. You mentioned that 75 million capital raise. You reached that in February since then. I believe that you've announced some plans to use some of that money for players to market the league in the off season. What can you tell us about that? And I guess if it is already underway, how that's progressing. Yeah, so it's just underway. We just finished our season. Just handed out that trophy to Las Vegas. And we have 10 players under contract to market the league in the off season. And it's going to be great. We've already had a couple of the players at the league office to talk to them about what this all means, how to build their brands, and drive them into the next generation of household names in the sport. So, and there's such great role models for young boys and girls. It's not just young girls, it's young boys too. And a lot of people I meet say, the first basketball game I want to take my kid to is a WMBA game, the pure form of the sport. So these players are great role models. Obviously, they're very strong social justice stances. And people view them as these kind of multi-dimensional role models. And we have moms in the league. And they're really great role models. So that's why we want to market the players more and spend a lot more of that capital on the players themselves. Kathy, when you speak about growing the league, I know expansion. It's been a major topic now for a few years. You currently have 12 teams in the league. Any insight that you can share with us, just in terms of what you're thinking for expansion or when you think that WMBA is going to expand? Well, one of the ways to grow the league is to have more eyes for more cities. And when I joined the league, quite frankly, I said we're only in 12 cities. This is the longest tenured women's professional sports league in America. Double any other will be in our 27th season this year. And we should drive off that strength. So we're looking at a variety of markets. We're using data, psychographics, demographics, NCAA viewership, current W, merch buying. You can get a lot of data by city to determine which cities would be the best. We have to find committed ownership groups with a greater rena situation. So there's a lot to think about. But that's certainly one of the areas now that the hard work starts in the off season around strategizing around those cities. But for instance, I'll just throw one out when technology's driving so much of your economy. And you don't have a team in the Bay area. That doesn't seem right. So that's on the list among, among another nine or 10 cities. Kathy, you mentioned efforts that the WMBA has in helping builders really, or players, excuse me, really build their brand. And it brings me to pay because pay conversations long been a topic. When you take a look at the WMBA, no salaries are increasing. 234,000, I believe is a super max salary for this upcoming season. The max just over 200,000. Even with these raises, though, players do still tend to make more when they play overseas. I guess how has this impacted your league? And what are you doing to address that? Yeah, so we're starting to chip away at an economic model. When I came into the league, I was hired by Adam Silver to look at the economic model and how to drive it. And we're actually, you're seeing a transformation before our eyes. But we're not there yet. And it's all around the ecosystem of how we get valued by corporate sponsors and how we get valued through media deals. And when less than 5% of all media coverage is women's sportship, 40% of the athletes in America are women. And when less than 1% of all corporate sponsorship dollars go to women's sports, that denominator is huge in men's sports. So we're chipping away. And there are just a couple hundred basis points is moving the numerator. And we really have our WNBH change makers.",https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=z4hExsMyQNo,76,2022-10-17 19:47:33
3470," So ship dollars go to women's sports. That denominator is huge in men's sports. So we're chipping away. And there are just a couple hundred basis points as moving the numerator. And we really have our WNBA change makers companies really stepping up. So we're getting there. We now tripled the top players pay. We've got a huge this marketing dollars. We doubled the playoff bonus this year, up 53%. We have a commissioners cup now price pool of over half a million. So we're just chipping away at all the ways to pay players. But you also you can't do it without being financially savvy about growing an economic model to not just support it for today's players, but support it for the next 25 years. And speaking of support here for players and also just growing your brand, I guess. How do you also increase the international component of this, which I think would be very important here when we're just talking about growing the value of the WNBA? Yeah, another reason I wanted to raise that capital is to globalize the game. I've seen I've really admired what the NBA has done through their global games platform and how they turn these players into global stars. So players go overseas and they're well known and their household names beyond the United States. So we've announced a preseason game in Canada as first step and coming off the pandemic now. And then I hope to get to like an EMEA games and Africa is very interesting and certainly Asia. So this year we had, I think it was 23 players from 13 different countries. That was our highest. And so we're kind of chipping away at globalizing our own players as well as then taking our US players and making them more global household names. But it's not easy because the women's game isn't followed as much. But for instance, 3x3 basketball. So 3 on 3 is a number one most popular urban sport globally in both men and women. So we can kind of capitalize off of that and bring our game outside the US. Well, Kathy speaking of international playing overseas. I want to turn to an issue that I know is very front of mind for you. And that of course is Brittany Griner. The seven time all started detained in Russia since February. I guess first is what can you tell us about her condition and how she's doing? Well, first of all, wrongfully detained, important to use that word, wrongfully detained in Russia. And Brittany is amazing. She wrote me a letter recently. She can only handwrite letters that go through the government. I'm sure there are two lawyers that gets to me. And we've been writing her periodically throughout the year. And this is just an unimaginable situation. I'm sure mentally it's very, very taxing. The longer she's there, she's got an appeal coming up on October 25th, which we're pretty sure we know that the legal process there isn't not going to yield anything favorable to Brittany. So we've been talking with the State Department, the special presidential envoy for hostage affairs and everybody in the administration. And they're all Brittany all the time. They're trying to find every different way to get her home safely first and as soon as possible seconds. So her 32nd birthday is tomorrow. And so we'll be making sure she knows we're remembering her as part of a social campaign around we are BG and bringing Brittany home safely. So it's geopolitically complex. So you never, when you take these jobs, you never know how complex it'll be in situations. And this one's certainly one of the more complex situations I've dealt with. Well, speaking of that, when President Biden recently saying that he would only meet with Vladimir Putin at the upcoming G20 meetings, if quote, he came to me at the G20 and said, I want to talk about the release of Griner, I'd meet with him. I guess what's your reaction to that and whether or not the president should be more forceful in pressing this issue? Yeah, I think from our discussions with the administration, they're trying everything they can do to get a deal done. Obviously the legal process we knew was not going to yield a favorable answer to Brittany when it should have, but that's why she's deemed wrongfully detained by the State Department and the administration. And I think the government has been doing everything they can, but there's not a willing party on the other side. And the Russians need to step up, get a deal done for both Brittany and Paul Whalen, who's another wrongfully detained American there. So again, our hope is first number one, get her home safely and as quickly as possible. But as I mentioned, if you think of diplomatically, geopolitically, even if you had a neutral party step in, there's no easy answer here. And I think the administration is full court press to use a basketball analogy to try to get Brittany home. And I think you need the other side to come forward and with a reasonable deal. And, Kathy, while we have you, I also want to get your thoughts on a massive story that really walked not only this sports world, but also had ripple effects through every single industry. And that was what we just heard about the National Women's Soccer League, that year long investigation, finding systemic abuse of players as commissioner of the WMBA. And what steps are you taking?",https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=z4hExsMyQNo,77,2022-10-17 19:51:48
3471," And that was what we just heard about the National Women's Soccer League, that year-long investigation finding systemic abuse of players as commissioner of the WMBA. What steps are you taking to protect your players? Yeah, this is really, really important. It's really important not to have a misstep in this area. It's unacceptable. It's disappointing. I know they've had leadership changes over the years. And as a commissioner of the WMBA, we want to be leading with a player first agenda, respect in the workplace, all of that making sure that our policies, which have been in effect for years, are solid. And that players feel comfortable coming forward when there's an uncomfortable situation, whether it's with a coach and owner or whatever. So it's important to create a culture where players, well, it's great to have a hotline just in the corporate world where I worked for 33 over three decades. It was great to have an anonymous hotline, but if nobody's using it, then it's like, okay, they don't feel comfortable because the culture's not there. So culture always important in the workplace. And sports is an interesting place because people don't think of culture in the workplace in sports, but it's just like, you know, you and I working in the corporate world. You mentioned your three decades experience in the corporate world. Your CEO most recently, of Du Bois, how do you think that prepared you for the job you have today as commissioner of WMBA? Because two very, very different roles. If you look at them, I guess, from a 55-year-old. Yes, I always say you went from 100,000 person workforce to 144 players, so it sounds very different, but sports is big business, big business about relationships. So I was so blessed to have the career I had at Deloitte that prepared me for things like collective bargaining four days into the job when I came in building relationships with players and the whole ecosystem and the stakeholder group like 12 different owners, 30 MBA owners who also own a share of the WMBA. And then lastly, really George Floyd, Jacob Blake, a league of 80 percent women of color and dealing with a workforce, you know, call it that was really rattled and rocked. And I learned a lot by listening to the players and trying to put myself in their shoes. And that's all stuff when you're leading a big company like Deloitte Comeinhandee when you're leading something like the WMBA. Kathy Engelberg, great to have you. Thanks so much for taking the time to join us today. Thanks so much, Donna. Straight ahead. It's a new era in Hollywood. And I'm sure that this address, Fran Drescher, is here to explain the big changes coming to the box office.",https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=z4hExsMyQNo,78,2022-10-17 19:55:54

3473," less important even if they are for whatever reason, more of a minority opinion. And with regards to Scarlett Johansson, I was shortly thereafter negotiating a movie deal. And we handled the negotiations completely different in the event that the movie would go straight to streaming. And they kept responding the theater release because of COVID. And ultimately, they decided to just go straight to streaming on Amazon. And so, you know, I recently got a nice big chunky check by you. And you know, I want to pick up on that point because, you know, streaming has really appended the industry. And how are you talking about those contracts? Like you were saying, redoing all those contracts to account for streaming? Yeah, you know, we just have a very successful negotiation with Netflix. And then the AMPTP wanted to work on a fragment of the theatrical negotiations that we're about to go into with them in 2023. I'm organizing my negotiating committee right now for all of the other aspects of that negotiation. We began discussing the Netflix negotiation. The union was talking about, for me, what sounded like incremental alterations to an existing contract. And I saw a convergence of opportunities that would probably not come along for a very long time that needed to be leveraged with a great deal of strengths and conviction right now, or forever, be chasing after a different kind of a contract that's always just outside of our grasp. We really used our legislation that we had in the state of California during the negotiations. We had a lot of high profile people meeting with our California representatives who were instrumental in pushing forward the particular bill called the law act, let actors work. And I myself went on one of the hottest days out to Glendale to meet as well. And we were very lucky that they heard us. They understood that we were the undead dogs in this equation. They felt the truth of the matter is that when an entire industry changes and the rules of the game change on behalf of the employer, changes are going to have to trickle down to the employee as well. You can't have it both ways. I want to pick up on that point too because you know, we know about all the big players in Hollywood, right? Like we were just talking about scholar Joe Hanson. They're already making millions, but the reality is that most of your members, they're not a list. They don't get the big pagEx from Disney, they're part-time, they're stand-ins. Can you give us some perspective? Well, and also, yes, of course. It's all about the journeyman actor, all of these negotiations because people like Tom Hanks, you know, they're not really impacted by this stuff. They make their own deals. And even people like Skorla, Joe Hanson are given allowances to do other jobs if they want her. You'll see a lot of very famous actors that appear on multiple shows. And they're given that allowance because they're promotable and they get an audience and the producers give them that privilege. So it's always kind of the journeyman actor, the middle class that always-",https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=z4hExsMyQNo,80,2022-10-17 20:04:08
3474," and the producers give them that privilege. So it's always kind of the journeyman actor, the middle class that always is getting squeezed. And that's really why unions exist to protect and defend their rights because employers understand that they desperately want to work. We need to always honor and respect them with a very fair and equitable arrangement. The nanny, film reboot, yes or no, you winner you out. It's in the talking stage, I would definitely be in. And we'll see what happens. There's a Broadway musical in the pipeline. And so it's the gift that keeps on giving. And for that, I'm very grateful we have an artist for the nanny book at Cancer Shmansa for all the fans. A hundred percent of the proceeds goes to Cancer Shmansa. And we have new fans now from HBO Max that are children, Twin Centines who weren't even alive when we were shooting it. That's amazing. Definitely a new generation enjoying that show. Fran Drescher, thank you so much for being here. My pleasure, be well. All right, now a check of House Talks ended the day here on this Monday afternoon, Dow is up 1.86%. That is good for, let me get the grand total here. That is good for 550 points, S&P 500 up a little bit more about 2.5%. Nasdaq up nearly 3.5%. And you can see just barely clawing back those losses that we had from Friday, but still up 25 basis points or 1 quarter of 1% over that time period. Now, here's our sector action for today. Retail stocks, especially those discretionary ones, really getting a boost today. That is up that sector up 4% in the S&P 500 followed by real estate tech and communication services. A lot of those mega caps present in these sectors here plus real estate to the downside. Staples still above 1%, although it is the least favorable sector today followed by energy, health care, utilities, industrials, and then materials. And I do want to get a check on our meme stocks because as a sentiment indicator, we are seeing a lot of risk, not a version, kind of the opposite here today. But as we've seen over the prior few weeks, in fact, much of the year, it's been risk on one day or two days and then risk off the next. So Tuesday going to be very critical this week and we got a bunch of earnings tomorrow from Goldman Sachs in the morning to Netflix in the afternoon. All right, we want to get a check on the EV market. Tesla, that is up 7% today. Coming off some pretty heavy declines. Here's a one year look. Now you can see making new lows for the year, taking out those May, June, July lows very recently. And we can see coming off of $219, we're going to see if anything comes of this. But a giant pennant formation there in Tesla over several years. So we've seen these before and we'll probably see them again before I go. I do want to get a check of the travel sector today. We're seeing some big outsized gains from Airbnb that it's up 6.5% today. Expedia of over 5%. So some of the travel booking names doing well. Now the airlines, they're doing well. United is up over 1.5% American up about half a percent. And it looks like Hilton. That stock is up about 3%. Guys, we're going to be right back. Up ahead, the Hollywood blockbuster is alive and well. We'll speak with legendary film producer, Jerry Brookheimer, about the wild success of Top Gun Maverick and the next big thing to hit the box office.

3475," music Jerry Brockheimer is one of the most successful film and television producers of all time. A consummate risk taker, Brockheimer has redefined the Hollywood blockbuster and television entertainment. From Beverly Hills Cop to Pirates of the Caribbean, his films have grossed an estimated 15 billion at the box office. And after more than four decades on top, Brockheimer is still smashing records. His latest blockbuster Top Gun Maverick is his biggest movie yet. It's also Tom Cruise's highest-grossing movie ever. Brockheimer's productions for the small screen are no less impressive. His scripted and reality shows have been among the most popular on television for decades. Jerry, thank you so much for joining us. Thanks, Ali. Thanks for having me. It's a pleasure. Yes, so first of all, I want to start with Top Gun Maverick. Really? I wonder why we would start with that. I never think it would be such a smash. I always hope for the best, expect the worst. So it worked out really well for all of us. Why do you think it was so big? It really created a moment when I think people needed it the most. And people hadn't been theaters in a long time, too. No, it's a big entertaining movie with great cast, great people behind the camera, Joe Kazinsky, Tom Cruise is a force. Chris McCory, who worked with us as a producer and a writer and other rest of our writers. It was just a great experience across the board. Tom is the hardest working person you'll ever meet. He cares. He loves to be on a set, first of all. He cares about every single moment, about every single performance, not only his, he's all over everything. And he's a much better producer than I'll ever be. Really? And your relationship with Tom goes back a really long time, Q. He was like 20 years old when we first started with him. I remember hearing a story about how he was actually one of the only people in the original top gun who could deliver lines from the cockpit. Well, that's how he learned to make Top Gun fabric a lot better because he decided that we have to train all the actors for three or four months prior to filming to get him used to the G-forces. So we started him in a prop plane, very easy, then an aerobatic prop and we put him in a jet. And finally in the F-18. So they were accustomed to taking seven A-J's, which when you see the movie, you see the look on their faces, that's all they're not acting. But the hardest thing for these actors, including Tom, you only see a third of their face. So all their acting comes from their eyes. So it's fascinating, they got such great performances and it was so difficult for all of them because we'd shoot them for, they'd stay up for about two hours. We couldn't see what they were doing. They'd come down, we'd look at the footage and then we had to send them right back up again if it didn't work. And they had to turn the camera on themselves. They had to know where the sun was because they had to match other aerial stuff that we did. So it was really an exhilarating and scary proposition and they were beat up. They tell you, dealing with those two forces.",https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=z4hExsMyQNo,82,2022-10-17 20:13:38
3476," What were the sun was because they had to match other aerial stuff that we did. So it was really an exhilarating and scary proposition and they were beat up. Let me tell you, dealing with those due forces, it's really, really difficult. Well, and kind of to that end, you know, those in a theater really plays particularly well, right? Like the intimacy of those shots, right? Are you really see their eyes? Do you think that's part of why people were so excited to see it in theaters? Absolutely. I think the fact that we did it for real obviously, the explosions and other things we couldn't do for real. But what's really the reason that people have gone back multiple times is the emotion. It's about the emotion and following these characters and watching Tom's arc through the movie. When I was starting, so I very lonely at the end of the movie, he finds a family that he can be with. So that is the emotional core. And then you have Iceman and their Val Kilmer. And Tom said, I'm not doing this movie unless Val is in it. So one of the most moving scenes in the movie was that logistically complicated and a logistically complicated shoot? Logistics weren't hard just to get the performances. And what journalists and everybody don't really understand is how good Tom's performance is and Val's performance. But Tom through the whole movie is understated performance. It's just absolutely brilliant. And the fact that we had the best technicians in the business from the cinematographers, the production designers, the editor. I mean Eddie Hamilton who edited the movie, he had 814 hours of aerial footage to go through. He had 26 hours of just carrier footage. And all he cared about was finding the very best shot. And all the footage, you just imagine when those days come in, how much time he had to put into editing the movie. But again, it comes down to writing, performances, and the emotion. It's all about the emotion. A lot of people can shoot great action, but if you don't have the emotion, you don't have a great movie. You are somebody who has made movies people love for decades. You've stayed on top for so long. What is the secret to understanding an audience? I don't understand them at all. I really don't. I just know what I like and make movies that I want to go see. Some day that will change, but fortunately it hasn't. And in terms of sequels, have you and Tom talked about Top Gun 3? No. No, not yet. No, not a word. And as you're thinking about the movie theater model, did Top Gun Maverick prove that it's alive and well or was it an exception? No, it's alive and well. I just got to make movies that embrace an audience. And unfortunately the pandemic we weren't making a lot of movies that really could play in theaters. Streaming has its place, theaters have its place. I always use the analogy. You have a kitchen, right? But you like to go out to eat. So it's not always you want to stay home and watch something on television. It's a group experience. It's exhilarating when you go to opening weekend and people are cheering and applauding for the right type of movie. And that's what happened with Top Gun. I went all weekend, the first weekend, and stood behind the seats at the Chinese theater and watching the movie at IMAX and watch how exhilarated the fans were at watching that movie. And when you talk to people, most people haven't just seen it once. They've seen it twice or three times. One person wrote us and he wrote us and he's seen it a hundred times. So it's that kind of an experience you want to give to audiences every time you make a movie. Obviously we can't do it. But every once in a while we get really lucky. And we had the right people involved at the right time for the right audience. And the fact that we held it for two years was the best thing we could ever do. And the audience was ready to come out. I think this is the first movie where an older audience felt safe going into theaters. A lot of people saw the movie said this is the first time we've been in a theater in two years. So it got them out because the people who saw it and back in 86, 87 wanted to go back and see what we did. But you know what? They had their arms crossed. That was such a good movie. I know they're going to screw it up. So we had to overcome that first. So I think when you first hear that gong and you see those jets taking off, they relaxed a little bit. This movie made a killing without China, without Russia. Does that prove that there could be a future for Hollywood without China and Russia? Well, we'd love to have them. Unfortunately, the world politics, we can't get there right now. I hope we've had all changed. Look, we'd love the whole world to see our movies. We make it for the whole world. The fact that Top Gun Maverick has made more...",https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=z4hExsMyQNo,83,2022-10-17 20:17:37
3477," There right now, I hope we've got all changed. Look, we love the whole world to see our movies. We make it for the whole world. The fact that Top Gun Maverick has made more foreign than domestic, you can just see how there's a worldwide audience for what Hollywood does. And even on a very American subject with American flyers, they love the movie because it was a great experience. It was something that you felt great when you walked out. It took you away from your problems for two hours, and that's exactly why I make entertainment. Do you feel audiences evolved over time? And as you think about your audience now today, is that different than it was 20 years ago? They just want to be entertained. That's all. That's all. Get them in the seat, entertain them, make them feel something. It doesn't always have to make them feel good, but give them a completion at the end. Well, and give them a motion. Always a motion. It's always about a motion. The reason bad boys with such a big success was the biggest picture of what 21 are 20, because it was an emotional story. After working on Beverly Hills Cop 4 right now with Netflix, is there a difference between producing for a studio or a streamer? It's all for an audience. And that's what we key on. We want to make the audience enjoy what we do. And there's an audience at home, and there's an audience that leaves home and goes to the theater. But top gun is a movie. You really have to go see it in a theater. I mean, it's done phenomenal and streaming so far. It's been just great. I think it's the number two of all time already. And it's something that when you'll watch it, you want to see it again, because it felt so good. And for you, sequels are where it's at right now. A lot would say you have Beverly Hills Cop 4. We haven't talked about top gun 3 yet. Bad boys 4 is reportedly in the works. For you, are there any other sequels you're thinking about right now? Well, we hope to do another pirates. Really? Yes. That would be awesome. Kind of to that end, you are a risk taker. Pirates wasn't obvious initially, right? Do you feel what's your relationship to risk taking? And do you feel like Hollywood to stop taking risks? Well, that's the financial people. I love making movies that I think that I want to go see. And hopefully an audience will agree with me. And it certainly happened. But pirates was another movie you can talk about that people had their arms crossed when they walked into it. First of all, it's about a theme park ride. Two other movies about theme parks ride just recently failed. So us coming out there, they say, oh, we're looking for this one from Inter-Sood Arrow's at. But when you get a great performance from Johnny Depp, and it was just took people by surprise because of the humor and the wonderful character that Johnny created. The soundtrack to Pirates, right, is became completely iconic, right? Actually, a lot of the soundtracks of your movies have become completely iconic. Do you think about soundtrack a lot as you're working on a project? It's important, it really is. To get something that works for the movie and is also something that creatively is unique and different. And the way to Gaga's song, we have all the different ones that we put in our movies and working with Hans Zimmer and Lauren Balfe and a lot of the other composers that we've worked with, Harold Faltemire. They're all great artists. Look, I think our company, what our secret sauce is, is we know talent. We understand talent, and we seek out new talent. And we look at it from a wholly different perspective. We see things differently. That's why our movies are a little different. Talk about that different perspective a little bit. I wish I could tell you. I'd sell it and give it to somebody else and go to Hawaii and not even worry about it. But it's something that the way we work so hard at everything we do, we find these new directors, we're doing a picture right now for Disney Plus with Daisy Ridley called Young Woman The Sea. It's a fantastic story about a swimmer back in 1926. But the story is that a fairy went out in the early, I think, 1919 or 1920, 3200 women and children were killed drowned. So the mother, this German immigrant mother, said my two girls are going to learn how to swim. The father was totally against. It goes uncouth for women to swim. And the one daughter took to the water. She was amazing. She went to the Olympics. She didn't win. But she decided to swim the English Channel. She tried to swim at once. She was poisoned because the coach tried it 21 times.",https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=z4hExsMyQNo,84,2022-10-17 20:22:04
3478," Amazing, she went to the Olympics, she didn't win, but she decided to swim the English Channel. She tried to swim at once, she was poisoned because the coach had tried it 21 times and failed, it was embarrassing, a woman could beat him. And then she swam it again and not only did she swim the English Channel, first woman to do it, she beat the male's record by two hours. She had the biggest parade down fifth to have in her her and athlete ever, including today. So when you see the footage, we have the real footage in the in the film that you won't believe how spectacular it is. When you looked at that story, how did you know it was something you wanted to do? I like to tell stories about people that were forgotten in time and made a difference. We did it with remembered the Titans, and Gloria Rowe and Black Hawk Down. So this is another movie that fits into that category. The same thing happened with the first top gun. There was a TV series that was on there that failed about aviators and the conventional wisdom was that no movie about flying could ever be a success. Same thing with pirate movies, so many pirate movies that failed. But you look at it a different way. And top gun, we looked at it a different way. We gave you the real experience. We tried to on the first one we didn't succeed, but the story was so good that you got away with being on a gimbal a lot. Where in this one, they're flying, they're up there, those actors are really in those planes. So CSI Vegas season two just kicked off. You are as big on television as you are in the movies. What's the future of TV look like for you to approach TV any differently? Yeah, it's about entertaining audiences. That's it. It's about getting people to enjoy what you do. And I like to do shows that give you an inside look into a Roger Nebri be a part of. CSI is part of that. We have a new show called Fire Country, which is the highest rated new show. It just came out two weeks ago. And the ratings actually went up in the second weekend. So it's a new show. And again, it's giving you an inside look into what firefighters do. And CSI gives you a good look at what CSI's do. And Top Gun gave me a great look at what Aviators do. But it's I guess it's what we call process. I love giving people process. I have to ask, is there an area that you've been curious about that you haven't explored yet on film? I think an all-out comedy would be fun to do. We haven't done one of those yet, but maybe someday. I do want to talk a little bit about your part ownership of the Seattle Kraken. Tell me a little bit how you approach that, how you knew you wanted to own an NHL team. And what do you, it means to be a good owner of a sports team? Higher good people. That's what a good owner does. And we have a fantastic group of people running the team. And David Bonderman who, if I ask, who is a big lead investor on it, he's just a great gentleman and really supports what the management wants to do with the team. And surround yourself with good people. You're never going to fail. That's the secret to Jerry Brockheimer. You've been on top for so long in an industry that's famously fickle. How have you done it? Hard work. It's it. It's a Sunday. I'm here with you. I'm Saturday. And I'm here with you. I even let him strack a time. I wasn't London yesterday. I just got off a plane at midnight last night. And here I am doing an interview. So, and then I'm jumping out of plane to go see a Kraken game tonight. But do what you love. That's it. I love what I do. I love going to movies. I love sports. I love hockey. I love being involved with great people and being supportive and trying to do as best we can do. Again, entertainer. Listen, hockey is no different than making movies. It's entertainment. And how did you know when you were good at producing movies? I think I started when I was a little kid. I was like 10 years old, 11 years old. I put together a hockey team. I put together a baseball team. So, I was always good at organizing things. And I didn't have winners, but what was fun doing it. Do anyone out there who admires your career? Do you have any advice you give? The harder you work to look at, here you get. But what it is is you have to find something that you love doing A and B that you're good at. A lot of things I love to be a professional hockey player. I'm just no good. Or a lot of things I'd like to do, but I'm not good at it. Find something you love doing that you're good at and pursue that. Rather than dream about being something that you might not be good at. Thank you so much. Thank you. You're watching the 2022 Yahoo Finance All Market Summit. Up next, we're joined by one of the biggest names in media, Paramount Global CEO Bob Beckish.",https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=z4hExsMyQNo,85,2022-10-17 20:26:21
3479," In the 2022 Yahoo Finance All Market Summit, up next, we're joined by one of the biggest names in media. Paramount Global CEO Bob Beckish. Paramount CEO Bob Beckish leads one of the world's top media and entertainment companies with a powerful collection of brands from CBS, Showtime, Nickelodeon, MTV, BET, and Comedy Central. And not to mention one of the most storied Hollywood studios, Paramount. The media and entertainment industry is going through a complete rewrite with quote-unquote new normals triggered by COVID-19 and shifting consumer demands. Bob Beckish joins us now to discuss that and so much more. Bob, thank you so much for being here. Great to be here. Alright, I want to start first with streaming and Paramount Plus. You've seen this roller coaster focus on profitability, the subscriber slowdowns, but Paramount Plus, they've been killing it, 43.3 million total subscribers. In your view, what is Paramount Plus done right and what do you think it still needs to work on to be in that top, top of the streaming wars? Yeah, so we're thrilled with the performance Paramount Plus and when we launched the product a year and a half ago and it was a rebranded version of CBS All Access that we built on expanded, people said, you're too late to the party, you're too small and we looked at it and we said, well, wait a minute, we think there's an opportunity in the marketplace for a broad service and we think that really leverages our unique portfolio of assets. So we came to be news, sports and a mountain of entertainment and we put really the way to the whole company behind that. And since then, through a strong content, through marketing which leverages our platforms, through a really a tightly integrated distribution strategy, we went on to become much bigger than anyone thought. And in fact, if you look at 2022, we've led the industry in the US in subscriber additions every month this year, except February. And in February, one of our competitors had the Super Bowl and the Olympics and okay, we were number two that month. But other than that, we've been number one. So we're growing very quickly and we're extremely happy and we see a great road ahead for this service. And you confirmed earlier reports that there are talks to potentially combo paramount with show.",https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=z4hExsMyQNo,86,2022-10-17 20:30:22
3480," We're extremely happy and we see a great road ahead for this service. And you confirmed earlier reports that there are talks to potentially combo Paramount with Showtime. Have those talks advanced in any way, especially with the departure of David Nevens? So we're focused on developing a compelling consumer proposition and by extension of that, a compelling distributor proposition. And when we launched Paramount Plus at the core, we said our advantage is broad. So and when you look at that, every month we prove that right. The combination of news and sports, having the NFL back is awesome, having UEFA is awesome, mixing that with Paramount films, which by the way, we've had six number one films. So let me talk to you about that. Adding the fall, it's a slate with CBS, which we won five of seven days last week and we have the top one, two and three new show. And then of course adding a robust library and ongoing production from our cable networks. It really is a compelling combination. With these of these Showtime, we use Showtime in a number of ways. Internationally, it's integrated into Paramount Plus. We felt that was the right way. We didn't have a standalone Showtime if you will, linear service. So the brand wasn't quite as developed. We thought that's compelling proposition. In the US, you can buy Showtime separately, OTT versus Paramount Plus. It obviously has a linear service. It has a well-developed brand. And we're happy with how it's doing on a standalone basis. A while ago, we introduced a price bundle, which was you can have Showtime and Paramount Plus together at Modest Discount. And we're pleased with that. Last month, we introduced an app with Paramount Plus with Showtime inside as an option. So instead of a price bundle, you now have one app and you get the benefit of the Showtime content should you choose. We've been very happy with the take rate there. And I can tell you, I use that version of the Paramount Plus app and it is yet again, another proof of broader is better. As seeing those Showtime, whether it's the originals or some of the movies in the carousels mixed in with the other Paramount Plus stuff really works. So again, what are we focused on now? We're focused on how do we make a more compelling consumer proposition and how does that aid in getting distributors even more behind our product. So we look at it optionality. And I don't know exactly where it's going to go, but I can tell you our product will continue to get stronger. It will continue to evolve and that will bring down churn and it will continue to grow the sub base. Are you using those bundled offerings that you were just talking about as a sort of test to see what a combination service could bring in the market? Well, absolutely. We're getting more data every day on Paramount Plus on the standalone, what works under the covers, how does sports content interact with films, etc. We're seeing how the bundle performs on a price basis. We can look at variability in pricing. So yeah, we learn more about streaming every day and that informs our going forward plan. You mentioned pricing. I want to pick up on that. Pricing has gone up for a lot of these streaming competitors. We got the news recently that the Netflix ad here that's going to be $6.99 in the US. Where's that sweet spot for you when we think about pricing relative to competitors, but also wanting to make sure that you're not leading to increased churn? Yeah, sure. So a couple points on pricing. One is streaming represents an extraordinary value in general for the consumer. Point two is within that Paramount Plus is not the price leader. We are very much a value offering. We tuck in under, say Netflix, under HBO Max, etc. Point three is in general, and you've already seen the start to happen, streaming pricing is going to go up. One of our competitors just announced a 30% price increase. Netflix has raised price multiple times. So the price umbrella on streaming will go up and we'll tuck in under that and we will raise price as well. Can't tell exactly when that'll happen, but directly it's going to happen for sure. So do you say you're watching competitors pretty closely when it comes to their pricing? Does that factor into your decisions? We look at a lot of things. We look at the performance of our product, with our consumers, we look what competitors are doing, the obviously look at what's going on outside of streaming. All that gets factored into our decision making on our course of action for streaming and the business at large. And when we think about content, you were mentioning sports content, obviously Paramount Plus has a ton of kids content, but there still seems to be a need for this buildable franchise type of content across the sector. So what do you think will be key for your content strategy moving forward? Well, you just hit on something, the word franchise. One of the things.",https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=z4hExsMyQNo,87,2022-10-17 20:34:57
3481," franchise type of content across the sector. So what do you think will be key for your content strategy moving forward? Well, you just hit on something, the word franchise. One of the things that Paramount Global brings to consumers is a deep collection of franchises. And it's certainly core to our strategy in general and with respect to streaming to leverage that. Look at our Paramount film slate. There are more and more tilted towards franchises. Why? Because they have built in fan bases and you can involve the storylines. Same thing in linear television, franchises. Look at CBS, this season FBI night crushed it, multiple FBI's. NCIS crushes it, multiple NCIS's. So franchise is our key in the kid space, Paw Patrol. We did our first Paw Patrol movie last year, killed it. We're doing another one next year. SpongeBob, we've done derivative product from that, camp, coral, etc. And then of course Yellowstone, the biggest show on television, we brought the world 1883 last year, we're bringing it 1923 this year. And actually we're doing some more stuff with Taylor Sheridan, who's the writer of it, including Tulsi King with Sylvester Sloan. Franchises work and we have an incredible collection of franchises in our company. So yeah, they're part of our streaming play for sure. And besides streaming, you guys have also heavily invested in some unique partnerships. The Walmart Plus being one that immediately comes to my mind. So what's the benefit of a partnership with Walmart? And what other types of partnerships are you actively exploring? So we've been in bed business with Walmart for a long time. You know, we sell consumer products with them. We distribute home entertainment with them. You know, Doug went mill on the CEO well. And there was a point, I guess it was last year, where they started thinking about the evolution of Walmart Plus and having a video service. And we were naturally interested in expanding that partnership. And it really is a partnership. We're not investing in Walmart Plus per se, but we are the video offering in it. So if you're a Walmart Plus customer consumer and you decide to opt into a video service, you get Paramount Plus. And we think it's a great model. It's early days. It launched in September. But we're already through what we thought would be our year end forecast number. And that it is a tremendously powerful retail. They have 140, 150 million people going through their stores in the US every week. And then they got about a million for employees. All of them can opt into Paramount Plus. So we're thrilled with the partnership and it's off to a great start. And let's talk box office. You mentioned your successful film, Slate several times in this environment. How do you determine which film can go direct to the theater or which film you might want to go direct to streaming on Paramount Plus? Well, we had a different point of view on films and streaming, going back to COVID and going back to Paramount Plus. When COVID hit, a lot of people said you should put all your films on streaming or at least day in day on streaming. We said no. We believe in the theatrical window. And we believe in it both to give the audience the chance to have that big screen experience and participate in those economics. And then we can move to streaming. So we adopted what's known as a theatrical and 45 day fast followed streaming strategy. That's our default strategy. And because it was in COVID, that resulted in us holding certain films. As a result, Top Gun Maverick, we moved that date five times. Because we said this is a big screen movie and it should be in the theaters. And I'm glad we did, because that turned out to be a good call. I think the theatrical with 45 day fast follow, which by the way, on Top Gun, we're going a little bit longer than that by the nature of the film. 20 weeks later, it's still in theaters today and it was the only film in history. We number one on Memorial Day and number one on Labor Day. So at having a longer theatrical run makes sense. But in general, we like that strategy. I think that's the sweet spot of ROI, particularly with respect to films. And that is very much our going forward strategy with Paramount. So with Top Gun, you know, you guys demonstrated your ability to pivot. I want to talk about the Wall Street sentiment of it all. There seems to be a lot of doom and gloom right now. You're a bit more optimistic. But when we take a look at Paramount Stock price, it's down more than 40% year to date. You have some downgrades on the street. How do you convince analysts and investors that these macro economic headwinds, the decline of cable television, the uncertainties surrounding streaming margins, are not concerning to your fundamentals? Look, I don't think there's a lot of people walking around that's happy with the state of the markets. I mean, that's...",https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=z4hExsMyQNo,88,2022-10-17 20:39:24
3482," and the uncertainties surrounding streaming margins are not concerning to your fundamentals. Look, I don't think there's a lot of people walking around that's happy with the state of the markets. I mean, they're up today, but in general, it's been a rough half year with respect to equity valuations, and certainly our company stock. Worth noting on a relative basis, relative to some other media companies, we've actually done better, i.e. less worse. But nonetheless, there are concerns on the street, there's concerns relative to topics. My view is you have to decide what you believe in and play through. As I said, in theatrical, people said, release it direct to streaming. We said, no, we want to do theatrical and then streaming. When we did Pluto in 20, we closed in early 19, we showed up and talked about it, people said, what's that? That's a joke. By the way, it had 12 million M.A.Us and 70 million revenue. Three years later, it had 70 million M.A.Us and over a billion dollars in revenue. And now everybody's like, whoa, this fast category is really cool. But if you listen to the street, and you know, let's know there's you would never have done it. So you have to decide what you believe. The two concerns in the street right now are advertising and streaming profitability. Advertising is a great business, and we have a fundamentally strong position in it. Our combination of linear reach, particularly with the broadcast network, plus the number one fast service in the country, in Pluto TV, gives us a great reach expression for advertisers. Add to that. It's all wrapped around great creative content that people love to be associated with. NFL, survivor, FBI, Paw Patrol, what have you. Add to that. Advanced ad capabilities. And an ability to do all that business on a turnkey basis. It's a fundamentally compelling proposition. And we will demonstrate it again. Second question people are worried about is streaming profitability. We've always had a plan to build a robust streaming business, but a profitable streaming business. Our business is only a year and a half old, takes a little while. We always said peak investment year is 2023. It still is. But we are building a business that we see as over time having TV media like margins. And we are tracking according to our plan. So are there concerns on the street that have negatively impacted valuations? Yes. Do we have to play through and deliver and continue to have the momentum we're showing? Yes. And ultimately, that represents a great value opportunity for people. All right, well, you heard it here. Thank you so much, Bob, for covering all those topics with us, Bob Backage, a Paramount CEO. Thank you. Coming up, investing in a high interest rate environment, billionaire private equity CEO Robert Smith joins us next. Coming up, source of security and bank analysis is today's opening. Now, Happy New Year. Start sure on this Thursday. For our gas driven wastestate, we want to show this phenomenon that",https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=z4hExsMyQNo,89,2022-10-17 20:43:41
3483," music music It is one of the biggest enterprise software conglomerates in the world and it's in private hands. Vista Equity Partners has more than $94 billion in assets under management with a current portfolio of 85 companies and it's still growing. Recently striking a deal to buy cybersecurity firm know before for $4.6 billion. Joining us now is the founder, Chairman and CEO of Vista Equity Partners, Robert Smith. Thank you so much for being here. It's great to see you. Yeah, you too in person. So obviously you have a big reach of your portfolio companies, all of those companies that I mentioned. So you have a lot of insight into corporate spending on technology right now because they are business to business largely. What are you seeing right now? What are you hearing from your companies, from your clients and does it feel like from where you sit that we are on the cusp of a recession? Yeah, great, great set of questions. I think importantly, you know, enterprise software still is viewed as the most productive tool introduced in the business economy last 50 years like it will be for the next 50. So, you know, in an environment where there's wage inflation, a lack of developer talent, wages related to cyber attacks, companies are actually increasing in many cases their spending and enterprise software. Now overall, again, we're about $24 billion in revenues across our entire platform which, you know, think about as maybe four fifth largest enterprise software company in the world. And we have over I think 350 million users of our software. When we're looking at what the spending dynamics have been over the last year, over 25% kind of bookings growth, we're seeing kind of 20 to 25 now. So we're seeing some slow down in certain sectors and frankly, acceleration in others. Things like low code, no code, environments, things for productivity, you know, things for anything around, you know, cyber security to protect the enterprise. Those are sorts of dynamics that we're seeing. So am I seeing a broad slow down across our platform? No. Are we seeing some pockets where we actually see it? Yes. Typically, those will be in any of the B to B to see, any of those consumer oriented businesses you'll see a little more slow down. You're not seeing people buying as much in the future as they used to, which you saw in some of the Apple and some of their numbers, et cetera. Where some of the companies that we focus on really, you know, this mission critical, you know, a business critical enterprise software continues to be in demand and robust demand for the most part. Is there a point you see in the future? Is there a point typically in these kinds of cycles where you do start to see that pullback? I mean, to be fair, when we were in the financial crisis in that recession, the enterprise software industry was not as developed as it is now. So I'm not sure we have a perfect analog. But what are you expecting to see? Great, great analysis. So if you look at 2014, 2018 coming out of that, you know, great financial crisis, you actually, there's about 10, 12 percent of the companies were in what we call a native cloud environment. Today it's closer to 35 percent. As a result of that, these companies grow faster. The productivity tools that they're delivering can be delivered more effectively, more efficiently. And so the utilization rates of them has actually been enhanced. The other thing that's actually quite interesting is the productivity dynamic. As you know, in the U.S. today, we've actually decided to effectively close our borders. And I like to say, you know, the most scarce commodity on the planet, planet isn't oil or lithium or cobalt. It's actually software programmers. There's seven and a half billion people on the planet. It's only 29 million of us who write code for a living. And these are the people who are actually providing and building these productivity tools that have to continue to, you know, enable and digitize not only companies, but entire economies and countries, you know, in education and cybersecurity. Those are the areas that we're actually seeing that increase demand. Now, all that said, I still think that you're going to see the downturn.",https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=z4hExsMyQNo,90,2022-10-17 20:47:56
3484," countries, you know, in education and cybersecurity. Those are the areas that we're actually seeing that increase demand. Now, all that said, I still think that you're gonna see the downturn in some of the consumer, you know, interest rates go up. People are buying fewer and fewer phones and cars and no sooner consumer devices, probably making decisions between do I fill my gas tank with fuel or do I buy another consumable advice. But in the business segments, you know, businesses have to continue to think about how do I can do more with less and software is one of the ways that they're gonna continue to embrace it. So, is it gonna be slow down in certain segments? I will argue in Europe in particular, I think we're gonna see a more advanced slowdown in many other economies. We're not seeing as much in the US as we sit here today. Are your portfolio companies doing any kind of preemptive batting down the hatches, so to speak, any kind of cutting and spending or hiring freezes, et cetera? Yeah, not at this point. I mean, there's a few that actually, you know, who have a little more consumer, like I call a little more consumer facing orientation who have to think about, okay, you know, are we overbuilding in our sales capacity or development capacity? But for the most part, the company is we bi, typically, you know, have a massive ROI. I think I told you, we talked about this before. Our average company, the products they sell to their customers is a 640% return on investment, right? So, if you think about that, almost anything else a corporation can do doesn't come anywhere near the kind of ROI. If you're doing any sort of, you know, six-sigma or a chis-in or, you know, energy efficiency dynamics in your company, their order is a magnitude below, and your multiples below that 640%. So, corporations are continuing to advance and they're spending now. And our companies, in cases we're thinking, you know, we may not be, they may not expand as much. Sure, you've got to think about, you know, the higher fewer people. But for the most part, the vast majority of our companies are still, you know, meeting their annual operating plan, which includes, you know, hiring. Our average company increases its organic employee growth by about 20% from time when we buy it to the time in which we go to a monetization. So, that really hasn't changed at this point. I want to turn to sort of your acquisition strategy. I mentioned no before. That's a leverage buyout. Right. So, was the Citrix deal, which was earlier this year for $16.5 billion, big deal that you did with Elliot. The lenders behind the Citrix deal were portedly then when they turned around and sold the debt, so it had discounted. I guess we've seen some big changes in the funding environment. So, how was the funding environment changed? Sure. And was it tough to get the no before deal financed as a result of those changes? Sure. I mean, you've got two markets in essence that we think about. There is a syndicated debt market, and we call it a private debt market. And the syndicated debt market that Citrix was part of, I think there were 30 banks involved. So, you know, the exposure of in the end, one of them was actually, you know, modest relatively speaking. But, you know, it was a fully underwritten deal, fully priced from our perspective, and they go through distribution. Most of them ended up keeping it on their balance sheets, because they know the work that we do in the value creation dynamics that will actually bring those bond bonds back to par. And, you know, in essence, they'll be, you know, get tightly up at the end of the day. If you think about the private market, that private market has emerged over the last six, seven years as being quite robust. But it went from, you know, 10 or so lenders to now about 30 or 40 in that space. And so, you may have to go to a few more, but we still see the ability to get deals like no before done, Avallara done in these private markets, as opposed to relying on syndicated debt markets. So, that's a dynamic that we're seeing in a marketplace. And what about on the other side? You mentioned exits. Great. Are any of your investors getting a little antsy here? Because it's tough to have exits right now, right? We were talking before we came here on set about the so-called class of 2021, the companies that came public last year, by and large have not done so well. It's a tough environment. Right. It is. And, you know, part of what we do is we focus on a couple of things we do really well. A, valuation going in. So, you know, we maintain a very strict price discipline in the way we invest. And just to give you some, some, some round numbers. You know, we focus on what we call growth-adjusted revenue multiple. 2014, 2018, growth-adjusted revenue multiple in the market place is about 0.43. When we went through this massive capital expansion in 2020, where, you know, I call it every central government on the planet, decided to really flood the market with liquidity to make sure that their economies didn't go into a recession during the beginning of the pandemic. I call it created, you know, a lot of capital and a lot of ambition, right? A lot of funds put a lot of capital to work above what I call that normal-",https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=z4hExsMyQNo,91,2022-10-17 20:52:34
3485," It didn't go into a recession during the beginning of the pandemic. Call it a creative, you know, a lot of capital and a lot of ambition, right? A lot of funds put a lot of capital to work above what I call that normalized level. We were very disciplined and actually didn't have any that we did in above that level. We're still able to deploy mass amounts of capital over $18 billion invested in that period of time. Now, all that said, we were still in a down economy that we're seeing today. We've just now completed, we announced yesterday a company called Apption that we sold. In that sort of an environment, if you build high quality companies, we have the ability in that point, at that point to actually sell these companies in these down markets. So in the last 12 months, you know, everything from media ocean to data to ICEMS. I mean, these are businesses, I think we've done a great job in building the capacity of those companies to do really well. And of course, Apption is one we just recently announced. And of course, the sale of paying, which we completed, which I think closes the next week and a half or so. So you guys have still been busy. I'm curious which advice to retail investors would be when it comes to tech stocks, right? You obviously see some good valuations still out there. Do you think that retail investors should be looking at tech stocks, right? Well, I like to say, you know, not all tech stocks, of course, are created equal. You know, enterprise software, you know, if you look at the earnings of a lot of the enterprise software companies, they actually are holding up pretty well. Now, there's stocks continue to get hammered for a couple of, you know, call it, you know, technical reasons. And then there's a lot of part of which is they get pulled down by the consumer and the internet stocks. And you have, you know, people who are, you know, institutional investors, crossover investors who are creating public books. And those public books, they had, you know, consumer internet and enterprise. And if the consumer and internet books are down 50, 60%, and they, you know, levered that book up, they've got to meet those margin calls. Well, how do you do that? You sell them to strength. So you're selling it into the enterprise businesses that have the flow, have the capacity, et cetera. You know, our market is really interesting one because we're still, you know, 70%, or sorry, 97% private companies. But in these markets for us, as you've seen us, you know, anytime we see downturns of the market, that's when we look at old companies. We really would like to buy and now have become what I'll call more affordable for the type of underwriting that we do. Where we can bring our value creation metrics to it. Let's switch gears a little bit. I want to talk about more House. Yeah, sure. We talked about 2019 when you paid off the student debt of the graduating classroom. Right, yeah, sure. And then you ended up starting the student freedom initiative, which helps to continue those sorts of efforts. Yep. But I'm curious to take a step back. Obviously, the Biden administration has done some student debt relief. Do you think we need a bigger overhaul of the student debt system in the US? I do. I think we need to rethink what it is that we want in our economy. We want productive students. We want them to be able to increase their quality and standard of life, and relative to their parents. Everyone wants to see that level of improvement. And look, not all kids need to go to college in order to create a very productive standard of living. So I think we have to be thoughtful about that. I think the universities have to be, think about being responsible delivers of high value education that can be used in work environments or entrepreneurial settings as part of what their relationship is with the customer there being the student. The student freedom initiative, which we set up as basically a fund, that, in essence, these students, they borrow money from so they can hopefully offset what I call the acute pain of parent plus loans, which I saw was pretty acute to the students in more house. But when they pay it back, they actually pay it back into the fund that gets re-lent to the next generation of students. We focus on STEM students, STEM students, or HPCUs, and MSIs, or minority serving institutions. Because we have to activate more of our citizenry here in America to be part of this digital revolution. So, we have probably the highest product possibility of participating in this digital revolution. So we want to ensure that we educate as many as we can and provide them with the opportunities to, on another side of that, of course, is internships and full-time jobs to participate in our economy. Again, that's scarcity of developers, that's scarcity of technical talent. We need to address that since we pretty much closed our borders at this point in time to immigration, which was one of the fueling dynamics in America to fuel our productivity. So we've got to turn to our internal resources, being our citizenry, to get them to enable them to participate in the economy much more effectively.

3486," Turn to our internal resources being our citizenry to get them to enable them to participate in the economy much more effectively. We're unfortunately running short on time so I have one more question I want to ask you and it sort of speaks to the last thing Initially we were talking about you're frequently referred to as the richest black man in America right and I'm just Does that feel like a heavy mantle to wear right and and what do you want your legacy to be with that sort of big moniker? Yeah, that's a really interesting question you know I I think about it in the context of how I grew up you know I grew up in a family Where my mother and my father were very responsible citizens in the community and that meant you know providing fabric of opportunity They were both school teachers, but they also were civically enabled you know my father started you know a North City Park Civic Association was the chairman of the local YMCA and you know my mother and he worked on in developing head start Programs and so they were very vested in the education in a segregated neighborhood of the kids and giving them opportunities to improve their quality of education Quality of nutrition quality of care that I think really made a big difference in for me and my family So I think about it through that lens and you know they had certain limited resources very limited resources I have a few more resources so I'm delighted to you know bring organizational capacity capital and Wherewithal to you know initiatives that I think going to improve the standards of of people on this planet and in people in the communities that I come from What's that thanks so much for being here. Yeah, good to see you. Yeah, thank you so much. Coming up a turning point in the war in Ukraine former US ambassador William Taylor joins us right after this You You You You You",https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=z4hExsMyQNo,93,2022-10-17 21:00:14
3487," I think this is a startup system. Since I started using YouTube for bulletin intelligence, I actually thought this was gonna be a short video, I'm not coming through and this is really annoying. Yeah. It seems I'm gonna continue with the institutions. We're gonna first holy and theirs as well as books, frankly. I have multiple institutes of Portland, Ambassador William Taylor is an American diplomat, government official and former military officer. He was US ambassador to Ukraine from 2006 to 2009 under President Bush and Obama and acting ambassador under President Trump. During the hour of spring he oversaw US support to Egypt, Tunisia, Libya and Syria. Taylor also served in various key diplomatic roles in Iraq and Afghanistan and led US assistance to the former Soviet Union and Eastern Europe. With that long and respected career, few American officials have more experience, or a greater understanding of Ukraine and the threat Vladimir Putin and Russia now pose to the world. Welcome, Ambassador. The Russian president is calling up reserves. He is conducting these referenda in parts of Ukraine. He says he's annexing parts of Ukraine. He's reminding us that he's got nuclear weapons. His problem, of course, for Shell, is that he's losing on the battlefield. His soldiers are dropping their weapons in the northern part of Ukraine where they're fighting. They are abandoning their tanks. They are running away from the oncoming Ukrainian military, the soldiers. And so President Putin has a real problem on the battlefield. So he's trying to change it up so far, unsuccessfully. His attempt to recruit more soldiers is failing. His attempt to placate the people on his right in Russian politics is failing. He sees the people in Russia fleeing the country. So President Putin has a real problem, Shell, in all of these attempts to regain the momentum. He's failing in that. And you mentioned an interesting word, which is desperation, which can push people into a lot of different directions. So as we talk red lines, the nuclear threat. How seriously is Putin considering a nuclear strike against Ukraine? And what would he be weighing in really making that choice? So let me just...",https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=z4hExsMyQNo,94,2022-10-17 21:05:12
3488," lines, the nuclear threat. How seriously is Putin considering a nuclear strike against Ukraine? And what would he be weighing in really making that choice? So, let me just say that I think the chances of the Russians using nuclear weapons is small, is very low. That said, when you have the president, the dictator, of a big nation that has nuclear weapons saying that he might use them in Ukraine, you have to take it seriously. And of course, the West does take it seriously. There's no higher priority for our intelligence agencies than to be sure that they have a careful watch over any indications in Russia that there's any preparation or any steps toward the use of nuclear weapons. So far, none. So far, there's no indication that they are taking these steps. We have to watch, we have to be careful. And we have to send the message to President Putin and the Russian military and the Russian people that there will be devastating consequences, catastrophic consequences if they made a bad mistake, a bad decision and used nuclear weapons in Ukraine. It would cost them dearly for all kinds of ways, which to be clear, our government has made clear to the Russians. So that's an important part of deterrence. We don't want to see these weapons used. The Chinese and the Indians don't want to see these weapons used. The Russian people don't want to see these weapons used, weapons used. And so that's the message it has to get through to President Putin. I think he must be hearing that. So then you talk about what he might be hearing, then what sort of conversations are likely happening within the Kremlin? You mentioned the oligarchs and the role that they play. What do you think is actually happening? Who's actually having Putin's here at the moment? You know, I don't think the oligarchs have his ear on military things. The oligarchs are probably telling President Putin that they're having great difficulty. Most of the big oligarchs that have anything to do with this war are sanctioned. They can't travel. Their assets are frozen. Their families can't travel. Their children can't go to school in England or in Great Britain or in the United States or wherever they think. So the oligarchs are under sanctions and they're probably expressing concern, expressing the fact that they're not happy about this. However, they're probably not the key voices in Mr. Putin's ear when he's thinking about his problems that I talked about earlier on the battlefield in Ukraine. Those voices are probably well informed. That is his interior, his intelligence services, his military, his defense officials. They're telling him probably what he wants to hear. So he may not be getting the best advice from them. He's a powerful man. They don't want to tell him things that he's not going to be happy about. So it's not entirely clear, Mr. Rosalind, in answer to your question, what he is actually hearing? What he can be sure of is that he's losing on the battlefield. And we know he understands that because he's calling up reserves. He knows his military is not doing well enough to stop the Ukrainians. Indeed, the Ukrainians are pushing his military back out of their country. The Ukrainians are pushing the Russians back out of Ukraine. And so President Putin has to call up reserved. In order to do that, he has to be talking to his military and his recruitment services. So that message is clearly getting through. And in terms of red line for NATO, what is the tipping point that perhaps have them escalate as they're seeing this escalation now with the drones, especially killing so many civilians at the moment? So it's very, very clear to NATO what would happen. If the Russians were to attack any NATO member, there's no doubt in the NATO members' mind. There's no doubt in the Russian mind, and President Putin's mind, that if the Russians were to again make this bad decision, this blunder, to attack a NATO member, that would...",https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=z4hExsMyQNo,95,2022-10-17 21:09:22
3489," They, if the Russians were to again make this bad decision, this blunder to attack a NATO member, that would ensure their defeat. That would ensure, that would be like committing suicide. I don't think the Russians are totally irrational. I don't think they're suicidal. So I think again, the chances of the Russians attacking NATO members is low. Can't discount it, have to be ready. NATO is clearly ready. NATO is building up its capabilities on its eastern front. NATO is providing weapons to the Ukrainians because that's the first line of defense. The Ukrainians are fighting the first line of defense. They are defending the rest of NATO, the rest of Europe, from the Russians. And so that's why the United States, as a leading NATO member, that's why other NATO nations are providing the weapons to Ukraine to defend Ukraine so that the Russians can't go further. Can't go into Europe. Now let's talk sanctions another way that the West is trying to squeeze Russia. Now we know that you have also pushed hard for these sanctions as well, but by all accounts, yes, it's affecting the economy, but it's not deterring Putin at the moment. What if anything would dampen his resolve at this point? What would dampen his resolve your right is not going to be sanctions. What sanctions are going to do is what you mentioned earlier, squeezing the economy, sanctions make it more difficult for the Russian economy to continue to support this war. So that's the purpose of sanctions to this point. Make it hard for the Russians to be able to replace all these weapons, all these missiles, all these cruise missiles, and guided missiles and airstrikes, all of those things cost money and all of those things need to be replaced. And the sanctions make it harder to replace. However, you're exactly right. They have not deterred President Putin from this attack. You ask what's going to deter him, what's going to change his mind, losing, continuing to lose on the battlefield. And in order for him to continue to lose on the battlefield, we need to continue to provide more and heavier and stronger and longer range weapons to the Russia, and so to the Ukraine so they can push the Russians back out. Now, in terms of assistance, I know you mentioned China, but you also saw OPEC-plus deciding to cut production of oil, which, in turn, benefits Russia, which benefits from that. But what are decisions like this, whether it's on energy or perhaps these purchases from China and India? What does that do, not just to the effectiveness of sanctions, but really the dynamics with the rest of the world? So you're right to ask about the dynamics of the rest of the world. One place where those dynamics play out is in the UN. Now, we know that in the Security Council, UN Security Council, the Russians have a veto, and they used it. So they can stop action there, but they can't stop action in the general assembly, in the United Nations General Assembly, where there have been a series of votes to indicate this dynamic that you're asking about, the dynamic in the rest of the world about where nations stand. The Russians have lost every one of those votes. The most recent one, which I'll, is was last week, and 143 nations voted to condemn Russia. 143. There were five nations that supported Russia. Four nations plus Russia that supported the Russian attack on your great. So 143 to five. Now, there were so many abstentions, some 38 nations abstained, but it's very interesting. The Chinese did not support the Russians. The Chinese did not vote with the Russians. The Chinese abstained. The Indians did not vote with the Russians. The Indians abstained. So the Russians couldn't even get these nations, and they've got this partnership with the Chinese, and they can't even get the Chinese to vote with them in the UN, and the Indians buy a lot of weapons from the Russians. So they want to try to stay on the good side of the Russians, and they didn't support the Russians in the UN. Mastings そっす句話達 Move",https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=z4hExsMyQNo,96,2022-10-17 21:13:53
3490," by a lot of weapons from the Russians. So they want to try to stay on the good side of the Russians, and they didn't support the Russians in the UN. Maybe they realize that the Russian weapons aren't so good after all. Maybe that's one of the reasons that the Indians, but when you look at where the international community is, in terms of UN votes or in other things, you see that people are not even Russia, even the Belarusians. So President Putin is trying to lean on the President of Belarus, President Lukashenko, to support him, to support Putin in this battle, in this fight. And President Lukashenko really doesn't want to do it because the Belarusian people don't support the war against Ukraine. They're supporting Ukraine against Russia. So even this close ally is hesitant to support Putin. This is all to say that the dynamics, the international dynamics, are against the Russians and support the Ukrainians. And, Roselle, if there is, if there were, going back to our earlier conversation about nuclear use, if the Russians were to decide to use nuclear weapons, they would lose all support, all support. There would be even more of a pariah than they are right now. So when you look at what is going to happen in terms of any sort of pathway to peace, and what the world looks like at the end of this war, and the relationships between Russia and the rest of the world, how do you see any sort of path to peace going from here? The path to peace, that's the right question. The path of peace runs through Russian defeat on the battlefield. The Russians have to recognize that they are losing on the battlefield when they try to fight the Ukrainians. The Ukrainians are pushing the Russians back out of their country. When the Ukrainians have pushed the Russians back out of their country, back beyond where the Russians were on February 23rd of this year, with just before they started the invasion, when they're back toward the international boundaries, that the Ukrainians want to reestablish, then President Putin probably looks for a way out and probably tries to come negotiate something. That's the way out. Eventually negotiations when the Russians have been pushed way back into Russia way back out of Ukraine, and then President Putin tries to salvage something from this horrible decision, this blunder. That's likely to be the path to peace. Well, we'll see if that's a decision that Putin will take lightly. Obviously, a lot of it stayed here, a lot of death, and a lot of people wondering what's going to happen next. We do appreciate you breaking down these dynamics for us and bastard William Taylor. Thank you so much. It's all good to be here. That's our show today. We want to thank our great guests, our sponsors, Northern Trust and Grayscale, and especially you for watching.

3514," I'd maybe seven years if you're lucky. So the chances that we're going to see a huge burst of activity there is really not in the cards. We do have the holiday season coming up. Microsoft just announced a handful of new products. We should see new products coming from some of its OEM partners. So we'll just have to wait and see what the results come from them. But this really does kind of just speak to the larger issues that we're seeing in the market as well as, as I said, that's low down. Yes. Most definitely. And we'll see if all of this starts showing up in the jobs of work numbers, for example, particularly for tech hiring. Thanks, Dan. Appreciate it. Coming up, which you probably had to say about California's minimum wage fight speaking about worker dynamic sizes got the details next. Yeah, California Governor Gavin Newsom has proposed raising the minimum wage in the state to over $20 per hour. Some businesses have come out and protested the proposal, arguing that the higher cost would cause them to increase prices for customers. The CEO of Chipotle, Brian Nichol spoke to Brian Sasi about this issue yesterday as well as our Brook to Balma. And Sasi, that's where we're finding to take today. A lot of bees in there. Well done there. There are a lot of Brian's yesterday. Well done Julie. Yes, this really focuses on the Fast Recovery Act signed by Newsom. I believe it was on Labor Day to establish a standards for the stakes, $550,000 fast food workers. Now if this goes into fact, you could see the minimum wage in the state for fast food workers. Eventually reach $22 an hour. Now Chipotle has 15% of its restaurants in California. It's one of their biggest and most important markets. I asked CEO Brian Nichol about this and what that wage at $22 an hour would mean to the company. We'll probably have to raise prices. And you know, it's unfortunate because it also impacts the economic model that could impact.",https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1iVTbuGfqnQ,1,2022-10-18 13:58:09
3515," $1.00 an hour would mean to the company. We'll probably have to raise prices. And it's unfortunate because it also impacts the economic model that could impact how many restaurants we even open in the future in a state like California, which is a real shame because our brand is loved in California, our employees love working at Chipotle in California, and I know the customers love getting our food. So hopefully the legislation doesn't get in the way of great economics that results in great opportunities for employees and customers. But if it does, we'll deal with it accordingly, but it'd be a real shame. And I think Brian really is plugged into all things California outside of Chipotle. He recently, I believe, was over a year ago, actually moved their headquarters to Newport Beach. So he's plugged in there. He spent a lot of time working in fast food throughout his career, of course, at young brands, but also very specifically in that California market. But here's my take. At least as it comes to our, as it pertains to Chipotle stock for right now, it's still going to be driven by their sales growth trends. And by all accounts, they continue to be best in class stacked up to its peers. That's why you see Chipotle stock having done so well over the past two plus years undernickel. But again, this is a longer term. Well, it could be a major profit headwind to a Chipotle if this does reach $22 an hour. Because to his point, they will probably have to raise prices pretty significantly. How much do people in California get paid now? $15 an hour is the minimum wage. At Chipotle? He said they pay over $15 an hour at Chipotle in California. Yeah, correct. Got it. OK, so I mean, for the sales growth side of that equation, too, it's how they're continuing to engage with the digital customer. But in California, specifically, that customer would then have to pay even more and then have more frequent visits on top of whatever wages that Chipotle would be able to move. I guess we're looking at what a $15 burrito in California. We know that your salad bowls are a lot more. Burrito's already $15. But that's by the same token. What do they think people can live on? People cannot live on $15. Full stop. You can't live on $15. $26,000 a year. I think that's what it comes out to. You can't live on that. It's stressful to not engage on. It's shameful how low minimum wages in this country. Yeah. Oh, you look at McDonald's. I mean, Chipotle is not alone here. I mean, McDonald's is one of the worst culprits. Sure, you see signs up in your local neighborhood. They're offering $15 an hour. But most locations are still paying the federal minimum wage, which is just, it's absolutely mind bogging. Which is crazy that it's actually the businesses that have had to actually take the precautionary or a preemptive step to say, yeah, well, we're our minimum wage. And of course, that causes competition among some of the largest ones that actually can pay. But again, it's them doing this because the government hasn't done it so far. We'll continue to track that. Great breakdown is always guys coming up. We're going to speak with Black Rocks. Your creator on what's the latest inflation data means for the Fed?

3517," debate now about whether it's going to be sustained, whether this is another head fake. What do you think? So I don't think you can count on the market, continue to have, by the way, it's nice being here on a green day. We don't get any of those these days. But I think it's hard to count on sustained this being sustained. You've got to Fed the still tightening financial conditions. You've got inflation that's still running too hot, and they've got to keep moving. I think that the markets are priced in about as far as the Fed is going to go, but you don't know the answer to that yet. Until we get more data, you've got, you know, we just came off a strong CPI report. We came off a strong payroll report. You know, now all eyes turn to the employment costs index, PCE data. And you know, we need to see it start to trend down for the Fed to come off this. And then it's hard to take a lot of risk until that happens. Has it been encouraging to you though, Rick, that we've seen the market rally in response to earnings that aren't necessarily great Goldman Bank of America. They were okay. You know, they weren't as bad as feared, but even go back to last week. You saw some hot reads on inflation. The market bounced on that number, those numbers as well. Those, to me, seem like positives. They definitely do. And by the way, the bank earnings are pretty good. I mean, when you break it down, those are pretty good. You also had a big relief off of this dynamic that was happening in the UK. I mean, this unwind of the leverage in the pension system was incredibly dislocating. The impact it was having on rates in the UK and then infecting the US and Europe. That was a big deal. Listen, I think you've got the equity market has some pretty sizable short positions in it today. And I think people underestimate how much the market has gotten repositioned around equities. And you're seeing some pretty big put option trading, very big and positions. And short interest, that's pretty sizable. And so the technicals in the equity market are pretty darn good today. So you get these bounces. And my sense is you'll keep getting them. But, you know, can you count on us to stay in rally? I think it's still early to think that. I want to pick up on the point about the UK for just a second. There was more news out this morning. The financial time said they were going to delay their quantitative tightening. Then the bank of England says, no, we're not necessarily going to delay it. But I've been sort of struggling to some extent to understand the interplay between what's going on in the UK and here. So can you sort of lay that out for us and why it is so important what's happening? 100%. So you've got you've got a dynamic in the UK, which is extraordinary in that you had what appeared to be at the time in aggressive fiscal easing at the same time you were seeing central bank tightening. That is not nobody in the in histories ever seen that work out. So that was creating this volatility in the markets. But then you have a dynamic that you had this leverage on one. So you have these pension funds had to sell huge amounts of assets, including long-term interest rates, interest rate products generally. And so what happens is the development of market interest rates, markets tend to work together. And so that was putting pressure on the markets here. And then just the general dislocation, you know, London is the second epicenter of finance. And as you're getting this extraordinary volatility there, and it was permeating all the markets generally. So by the way, you know, when the central banks raised rates as much in tight liquidity, you see the leverage, you know, I would say every day, but periodically you see, wow, I didn't realize that risk was on. I didn't realize this leverage is on. And we're going to keep getting reminders of that for the coming weeks and months. I say, I hope that, you know, the Fed is going to reach a point where they could pause at these elevated rates, whether that's 4.5, 4.5, 4.5, 4.5, you know, once they pause, then you could start to get comfortable. And I just want to take some more risks in my portfolio. But I'd like to see some better data to allow us to think that. Well, you know, upon something that you just mentioned a moment ago, where are you seeing the largest volume of kind of outsized short positions right now? I mean, the overall market, I mean, the size, I was looking at the size of put options trading for a week straight, you're talking about about a trillion dollars worth of of notional puts. So by the way, put that number in perspective, the high yield markets, the US high yield markets are trillion and a quarter, a trillion a day, a put options are trading. Now, they're, they're, that's full notional size. So they obviously trade on a delta basis lower than that. But that's, that is big. And then I look at exposures across a lot of the what is faster money, hedge fund type, and that's really low in terms of exposure. And I think money managers have brought down their exposure pretty significantly. So, you know, that is significant. And that's where I think you've got a market that once it jumps, you get some short covering that comes in. Or so people, people worry that they're going to miss it. I guess I don't think.",https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1iVTbuGfqnQ,4,2022-10-18 14:10:57

So you know, there's something really different than 15 20 years ago when you had the big subprime crisis and you had leverage in the financial system corporates households You actually don't have that today the banks are in good shape from leverage perspective corporates are households are in good shape Relatively what they've been in history You know the one place you got to keep your eye on is the real estate market commercial real estate residential real estate You know, that's where you have financing not just leverage But you've got to roll over your financing and so the way commercial real estate projects work obviously resi Is you've got to roll over your financing and that that's that's where you can get some tricky things and you by the way You've seen it you know, we've been buying triple a Commercial mortgages and getting close to six and a half and you know with this one piece we bought cost of seven percent triple a You know, so you think about subordinated done underneath that so when that happens you start to think about gosh If I get my triple I ask that that's sort of yield. Why would I take much risk otherwise? Well the other the other difference between now and then though is that you have a lot more private credit companies You that are not the banks are they a source of risk at all in this environment? I would say generally not because their liabilities they're usually locked up money Usually they've got that money for a longer period of time So I don't generally don't think that they are significant risk to unwind You know, there are structures that take place in the market that are You know in and around you know some the C low markets or otherwise that you got to keep your eye on but I would say generally the private financing generally Is pretty well termed out in terms of in terms of where that capital has been raised so I don't think that's a stress point today But like I say guaranteed whenever you get this sort of shock to the system Something's gonna pop up that you didn't expect and you know similar to what happened in UK. I mean who would have thought the UK? You know an issue in the pension system and that's but that is a Lust sort of what happens in these situations. Let's say on financial stability a competitor puts out a survey this morning Lots of charts in there is noting worsening risks to financial stability now weighing on equities But you don't see it you don't see that this is not great recession stuff. We're seeing right now in the markets It's great recession in terms of in terms of the economy slowing or it is I mean not we don't see the same things in housing. I mean it's not a situation. We just see stop prices going down right I so Listen, I mean it's it's been historic in 50 years probably longer than that you've never seen rates and risk Co-down at the same time and that is I mean that is an Illustration of the fastest tightening we've ever seen by the central banks in history By the way, not just not just the US but the emerging markets the ECB The Bank of England. So that is just what happens on the backside of it and you're and it's just not clear How much the economy is going to slow on the backside of it what we are seeing that I think is encouraging is you're starting to see the Goods part of the economy come down a bit and that that is healthy You're seeing that inflation. You're seeing that in Jenshier demand for goods What you're not seeing yet is a service sector service actors in great shape education leisure health care solid both in terms of inflation as well as demand so you've got an economy that's it That's actually in pretty good shape. I think people underestimate while the economy is going to slow the good sector is going to slow You see in that embodied income out of prices home builders, etc But the service economy you know use economies two thirds consumption is two thirds service It's hard to bring that down. That's exactly what I wanted to ask you about with regard to where we sit right now within this shift Because what we've heard so far from the banks that have reported in from the airlines that reported we spoke with Delta CEO And they're talking about this shift in goods to services really really benefiting the experience Economy as well. Is that something that if you look out into early 2023 even further into midway Through 2023 that that remains that demand remains strong and solid enough As consumers are still looking across their own balance sheets where we've seen that go from",https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1iVTbuGfqnQ,5,2022-10-18 14:15:12
3519, In 2023 that remains strong and solid enough as consumers are still looking across their own balance sheets where we've seen that go from as the banks would describe it as strong to now just healthy if you will. I mean listen there is you know when you lift fuel costs and food costs as much as they have it definitely has an effect on consumption generally. But gosh if you side you know will a service sector continue to hold up you still got to look at where wage levels are relative to anything we've ever seen in history you look at where you know the amount of savings that's built up my senses the service economy will continue to continue to do well. By the way it's an aging demographic the demand for health care services is not is not going anywhere other than up from here. So I still think you've got a solid service economy you know people lament where the economy has slowed to but keep in mind we had double digit nominal GDP last year we're slowing from that and you're still going to have nominal GDP this year. It's going to post an impressive number that could be closer to five so still pretty good are we slowing is a good sector slowing yes but by the way it's very different in commodity or antideconomies it's very different in parts of China today although we think next year will be better the emerging markets are tougher but by the way we go to Europe and this is what's creating a lot of the fall you know in Europe when you when you lift fuel costs as much as you have historic and then you look at the UK you look at mortgage rates spiking higher you know consumer 70 percent of the consumption basket gets now eaten up by just their utility bill and their mortgage so you think about how difficult that paradigm presents itself but US relative to the rest of the world is in reasonable shape. Let's leave it there on that hopeful note good to see when person their black rocks chief investment officer of global fixed income recreater we'll talk to you soon. Thanks for stopping our way. Thank you guys.

3520," style? Welcome back here. So look at some of the other headlines we're watching right now. The labor battle across the world continues today roughly 150 Apple employees in Australia began to strike after negotiations over pay and working conditions installed. The three stores involved in negotiations are demanding a minimum hourly wage of $31.00. That's in line with what US employees receive. The account for currency translation. This comes as Apple stores all throughout the United States continue to express interest in unionizing. Another step back for Boeing 737 MAX jets as the Federal Aviation Administration has requested the company review the safety paperwork for the jet. According to the Wall Street Journal, the FAA is unable to review the company's submissions through to missing and incomplete information. Boeing now runs the risk of not being certified by the December deadline as they continue to await regulatory approval for caring passengers. Boeing has said safety remains the driving factor in its effort to meet all regulatory requirements in certifying the 737 MAX-7. And US Air Taxi startup Jobi has applied to Japan's transport ministry for aircraft certification as it prepares to launch its urban transportation services. Jobi is backed by Japanese automaker Toyota. It's already received certification from the US Federal Aviation Administration, allowing it to begin commercial air taxi operations with conventional aircraft. Our brand Tazzy, yesterday asked LinkedIn, co-founder and Jobi investor Reid Hoffman to give his thoughts on that company. I'm looking forward to being able to ride in one. We're still in a place where it's only test pilots, but they're super quiet and they're super safe. So the goal is to create an uber for the skies. Yes, exactly. It's still early days. As he said, he hasn't even ridden in one yet. We should mention the company still has to face the series of legal hurdles as well before being able to fly passengers on those. What do they call it again? A-B-T-O-T-T-F-A-S-E-V-T-L. Yes, EVT-T-L. EVT-T-L. EVT-T-L. Electric. No, vertical. Take off and landing. And most importantly, I learned from Oscar Munoz, they're not helicopters. All right, hard turn here. American security experts expect Russian hackers to attack voting systems and stir up trouble in the final days before the midterm elections on November 8th. Y'all find it seem calm. This Rick Newman is here for more Rick. Interesting story you're working here. Yeah, and my point is that Vladimir Putin, the president of Russia, he is already interfering in the U.S. election, and it's not in the familiar ways as much that we saw in 2016 and 2020 with this information on social media. It's through inflation. What is the biggest issue for voters right now? It is the economy in its inflation. Now, in the beginning of the year, shortly after Russian invaded Ukraine, Biden, President Biden used this phrase, the Putin price hike to explain away rising oil and gasoline prices. And that wasn't really the case at the time. But we have now have a different kind of inflation. It is not oil and gasoline prices anymore. I'm going to isolate two things here. It's food and it's natural gas. People do not see the price of natural gas the way they see the price of gasoline. But we've got soaring natural gas prices all around the world. That is because of the Russian war in Ukraine, in the energy war that goes along with that. That is raising prices here, not by as much as it is in Europe, but they are going up. We're going to feel that. That passes through to food prices because natural gas produces electricity. You need electricity to process food. There are other factors pushing up food prices that go back to the Russian war in Ukraine and sanctioned.",https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1iVTbuGfqnQ,7,2022-10-18 14:23:39
3521," Natural gas produces electricity, you need electricity to process food. There are other factors pushing up food prices that go back to the Russian war in Ukraine and sanctions related to that. So all of this, these are all major factors that are keeping inflation high in the United States, still 8.2 percent. And this is President Biden's principal problem right now. And so for the oil reserves that are slated to be released, how does that kind of play and factor into the Biden administration's strategy at least at this point? So let's talk about oil for a second. So oil prices right now, last I looked US oil, $8, around $84 a barrel. That is lower than the price before Russia invaded Ukraine on February 24th. So oil markets have normalized. Gas prices have not come down all the way to where they were before February 24th, but they're getting pretty close. And that market has stabilized. And President Biden did release oil from the strategic reserve. That's a small part of it. The biggest reason the oil market has stabilized is we have a global slowdown, especially in China. So demand for oil has just come down in a way we should be happy about that. The inflation story has since shifted. And it's over to these other things. I mean, food inflation latest numbers are 13 percent year over year. That is a big ask for a lot of people, food is 12 percent of the typical households budget, gasoline only 3 percent. So it's harder to absorb food inflation. And that food inflation looks pretty persistent at this point. It's going to be hard to get that down. So bring it back around to politics for us for a second, because the proxy for President Biden's polling, for example, and tied in with the midterms as well, has been the gasoline price. Because it's that one sticker price. It's easy to see food while everybody feels it. You don't have that one sort of thing that's symbolic of it. So how is this going to play as gasoline comes down and food continues to go up? So you're right. So there has been a fairly direct correlation between gas prices and President Biden's approval rating. So gas prices go up. Biden's approval goes down and vice versa. So that was all improving for Biden. The Democrats had momentum as gas prices were coming down sharply. But food inflation started to go up. And I think most people don't look at the CPI numbers in a spreadsheet the way I do every time the numbers come out. But people know when stuff gets more expensive. And they know that their paycheck is not going up by the same amount as expenses. And there's going to be another shot coming. People are just starting to see this in utility bills this summer because natural gas, which is the main way we generate electricity. That is going, that is higher than it was this time last year. And that is going to mean higher heating and electricity prices over the summer. So people know they know something's wrong and they're right about that. So the midterm elections are a referendum on the president and his party. And normally the president's party does lose seats in Congress and does look like that's what's going to happen here. Yeah, I'll finance his own Rick Newman. Thanks for tracking this source. Appreciate it. Guys coming up target. Coming up great from Jeff Fries, we're going to speak with the analyst behind the call.

3522," All right. All right. Right We're watching shares of TGT, Target or Tarsie. Today, after the company got an upgrade to buy from Hold from Jeffrey Sainte, headwinds for the retailer are mostly near-term problems. Jeffrey's Senior Research Analyst, Cory Tarlo, joins us now. Cory, help us break this down. The thesis around this being a near-term issue for Target, we walk in there right now. There's so much inventory that has flooded the store ahead of the holiday season. How are they going to be able to work through that? Sure. There are three key pillars to our upgrade today. The first one is inventory, as you mentioned. The second one is margins and the third one is valuation. I'll start with inventory because that seems to be the most topical subject today. Then inventory, our proprietary work, illustrates that the headwinds, the target and other retailers face, might not be as bad as what people think. Why do I say this? We've done some really differentiated work on this topic. We looked at inventory cycles over the last two decades. What did we find out that when analyzing inventory growth and sales growth and profit growth throughout the last two decades, when inventory growth peaks, you tend to see a trough or a bottoming in sales and growth profit growth, about five quarters after inventory growth peaks. What are we seeing right now? Most of the retail coverage that I focus on is continuing to go like this. But for Target in the last quarter, we saw an inflection where we saw a peaking in inventory growth. What does that mean? You're going to see a bottoming in sales and growth profit growth and inflection in the stock. After talking with the company, Target only has a couple hundred million dollars of excess warm weather appell in inventory. You see this in our note today. We published pictures of this in our store checks and this is already in the guide that's already been reduced. Earningers of visions are now down. I believe close to 40% in the last nine months. The balance of the inventory should improve meaningfully from here and skew much more towards consumables, which is still 45% of Target's business. That helps to add a substantial layer of defensibility for this business. What are, frankly, as the CEO called it yesterday, unusual economic times, and he even cited that he's seeing some healthy spending trends despite the atypical environment in which we're in. I'm glad you mentioned Brian Crenel, because he made those comments here on Yahoo Finance at an all market summit. And I really enjoy talking to him. But Corey, take a listen to this because I asked Brian about the inventory challenges they are having. Here's what he told us. You know, back in June, we made a pretty bold and dis...",https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1iVTbuGfqnQ,9,2022-10-18 14:32:38
3523," Corey, take a listen to this because I asked Brian about the inventory challenges they are having. Here's what he told us. You know, back in June, we made a pretty bold and decisive decision. We said, all right, inventory is the built up. Consumer shopping habits have changed. They moved into different categories and we said we're going to get out in front of this. So for Target, we put in that inventory problem behind us. And now we can focus on great execution, the lighting, our guests, getting ready for the big holiday season. So we were pretty decisive and said, we're not going to just let this roll into the next quarter. We'll deal with it up front. And now we're excited that we're ready to play for the holiday season. So Corey, it's not just Target. I hear what you're saying on Target. It sounds like just my vibe talking to Brian that they are working through this inventory. Maybe an issue that is going in the rear view mirror for them. But what about the broader industry? I mean, Walmart exited that second quarter with a lot of other inventory. Department stores, high levels of inventory. I mean, how big a problem is this going to be for the retail universe at large this holiday season? It's likely going to be pretty significant in categories that are more discretionary in nature. And that's part of the reason that we are a little bit hesitant on certain discretionary retailers. But Target, frankly, is one where we see a lot of opportunity. And why? Well, let's take a look at the margin. For example, in that clip that you just showed, Brian Cornell talked about how they had cleared a lot of inventory in the second quarter. The business drove close to a 1% EBIT margin in the second quarter, which is rather uncharacteristic for a business that drives typically an EBIT margin over the last decade, close to 7%. So clearly the last quarter was an aberration. And a lot of these self-inflicted or COVID-induced wounds are likely to lead to probably a subdued margin this year from an EBIT perspective. So probably around 4% to 5%. But as we look to next year, we think that a 6% or more margin would probably be reasonable. And I don't think that the street is quite get focused on that, particularly given the near-term hurdles that exist as a result of elevated inventory in the environment that you point out. And holiday, but on holiday, what I would say is that we've heard from several retailers now that consumers are, while they're being more intentional, are still spending on holiday. So I was at a conference a few weeks ago, the CEO of Walmart, US, had cited a strong tailgate season, a strong back-to-school season. And then just a few weeks ago, the CEO of Costco had even, or CFO, excuse me, had mentioned that he seemed sort of strong momentum in Christmas and Halloween inventory that has already hit the stores. So I think that that does, despite the elevated inventory environment that we're in, owed quite well for the holiday season ahead. Hey, Corey, it wasn't just a target that you are looking at here. You upgraded target, but you still like Walmart also. And so it sounds like you don't think there's going to be a zero-sum situation here. Do you think Walmart is also going to be okay on the inventory front and also sounds like you think they'll benefit from people maybe trading down and trying to save money a little bit? Absolutely. So part of the reason that we do like Walmart is that it's a value leader and it benefits from a trade down. But beyond that, we took this a step further. And we said, okay, if it's going to benefit from a trade down, how much do we see it benefiting over the next 12 to 24 months? And the reality is that we think that when we went through a really highly differentiated and unique analysis that we think Walmart can drive over 100 basis points to its same store sales as a result of trade down in grocery. And that could drive upside to consensus comp numbers, not only this year, but next year too. And our estimates are above consensus this year and next year by over 3%. There's upside devaluation. This business is trading at 19 times to your forward earnings versus historical average of 22 times. So it's trading at a three-turn discounted historical average. And that range is typically about 17 to 27 times. So it's actually trading even toward the lower end of that range, which means that there's plenty of upside from not only a number's perspective, but evaluation's perspective as well. Corey, thanks for joining us. Good to talk to you. Corey Tarlow is Jeffrey Senior Research Analyst. Talking to us about the retailers today. Appreciate it. Thanks so much. Have a great day. How up",https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1iVTbuGfqnQ,10,2022-10-18 14:36:58
3524," The retailers today appreciate it. Thanks so much. Have a great day. You too. All right, let's talk about some other move-ers that we're watching. Today, one of them is Colgate-Pomala of CBC reporting that Dan Loeb's third point has built a stake in the company. And we should mention, we're not, Yagyu Finance did reach out to third point for comment. We've not yet heard back at this point. The shares are trading higher by 3.4%. And the reporting over there talks about that maybe there should be a break-up of Colgate, or at least it's been offered some of the businesses. The pet nutrition, Hills Pet Nutrition, is one of their divisions there. You're looking at me skeptically. I can see you processing. Processing. I dig this potential call by Dan Loeb. Why are they selling pet nutrition next to my toothpaste in the same way? Why does it have to be together? Does that make any sense anymore? Do you use the same ingredients in toothpaste as you do in making pet products? I'm guessing no. But don't they keep the operation separate in how they're producing those products, too? So hopefully there's not the usual fact. The ingredients that are going into your toothpaste versus the pet food. But we know that you would be willing to try. As you said, comment. I just wanted to get you a comment. All right. Done deal. So it's time to say these good things. All right, switching gears from pet food to cars. We're also watching shares of Tesla after city. Reiterated, it's celebrating on the EV maker, saying the update in Q3 has not completely addressed macro concerns. This calls a little bit all over the map, because the analyst here at Tei, McCally, we often cite his work, celebrating, but he's saying the stock could rise coming out of this quarter if Tesla reports any upside related to EPS or auto delivery. So kind of talking out of both sides here. Yeah. I mean, even if we think about what Tesla has put out thus far and how they're going to continue to run into in China, especially a region where there is more of the appetite from the consumer to actually go towards some of the homegrown brands. And I think that's something not just across automobiles and vehicles. It's actually something that we've seen already referenced from a company in Nike as well, an analyst that cover some of the ATHLEASURE space. Of course, largely different purchase, but still the consumer sentiment, or at least that propensity, that still remains. And so with that type of trend that we're seeing right now, what does that spell out for? Not just the Tesla Shanghai production, but also where they see future demand continuing to come into. Yeah. After the close of trading tomorrow, analysts looking for a bucko too, in terms of earnings per share, we're going to be paying attention to the outlook, of course, as well, and see, we tend to get some pretty big swings in Tesla shares after the numbers. So we'll be watching that closely. Absolutely. Also watching closely here today shares of Carvana. They are moving on the day up by about 2% around that off to after Wedbush downgraded the stock to neutral from outperform and slash their price target from $50 to $15 here. Now in the use car landscape, of course, there is this massive shift of, and the inventory concerns particularly, because even at the prices that use cars had skyrocketed up to, it's a larger question of where consumers are starting to push back on some of those prices, and where Carvana, CarMax, where they'll actually be able to move some of that inventory off the lots that they've paid so much to be able to bring on as well. That $50 price target, that's not gonna come way down. From a consumer standpoint, I bought two cars off Carvana. I think the consumer experience is very, very impressive. But of course, you have to separate the consumer experience from the financials, and I understand this downgrad makes a lot of sense. We've seen used car prices start to roll over, consumer spending under pressure here a little bit, so I get it. Yeah, that's sense. All right, Roblox shares have been on fire to kick off this week, but is it time to go long and strong?

3525," again.. Shares of Roblox are still seeing a lot of interest on Yahoo Finance. After the gaming company got a boost yesterday from its September metrics report showing daily active users grew 23% year-over-year. Cowen, senior analyst Doug Croix joins us now to discuss Doug. Good to see you here. Is that move over done in your view? Yeah, it was a bit aggressive. The September numbers were fine. We now know that their bookings for Q3 are going to come in slightly ahead of cell-site consensus and basically align where our numbers were. But which is good. They've now returned to your year-over-year growth after a few quarters where that wasn't the case. They had tough comps. I think there were two things going on yesterday. One is that there had been chatter we've been hearing that mobile gaming spending overall might have slowed down in September. That certainly didn't seem to be the case in their numbers, so that may have surprised people a bit. Also, I don't think it was widely understood that the KPIs were actually going to be reported yesterday. People who were short the stock may not have realized that data was coming out on the Monday morning and got caught a little bit by surprise. That's why you saw the kind of the size of the move. Interesting here. So, particularly what you mentioned around the spending in Roblox that strikes me because there are all of these different experiences that are trying to move into that Roblox metaverse, if you will. Does that kind of spell out that even despite at Chipotle or Walmart saying that they want to be in the Roblox metaverse, that as of right now, that's not necessarily going to do enough to woo the consumer to have them spend more money in a reality that is purely virtual, not being able to get some of that return on those dollars? Yeah, well, their spending is still very heavily driven by children age, let's say, eight to 12. They've been trying to age up their population. They have had some success in that, but it's still largely a youth driven experience. And I don't know that kids are really that excited about going to a virtual Chipotle there or a virtual Walmart, they'd rather play games. Their ability to age up their platform is still very much in question. And that's a big part of our longer-term skepticism on the current share valuation. Well, and that kind of brings me to the next. I have kids who are in the demo for Roblox. I mean, isn't that sort of the problem here is how we're framing it, right? You call it metaverse, and there's all these implications. It's a video game company. Is it, I mean, isn't it just a video game company, right? It's a bit different, right? I mean, you think about video game company like, let's say electronic arts, right? They make games. They make FIFA. They make Madden.",https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1iVTbuGfqnQ,12,2022-10-18 14:45:39
3526," Right. It's, it's a bit different, right? I mean, you think about video game company like, let's say electronic artists, right? They make games. They make FIFA. They make Madden. They make Battlefield. Roblox doesn't actually make games, right? They own a platform. So in that sense, it's a little bit more like Facebook or, or, or snap or something like that. And their platform is host to instead of videos, it's host to interactive entertainment experiences. If they were able to get really high quality gaming content, right? For adults, then they could probably bring adults to the platform. The trick is, how do you get that content, right? Here, you know, if you're competing for kids' attention, you know, you're competing with one set of interactive entertainment, maybe Minecraft. But if you're competing with it for adults' attention, you're competing with Call of Duty and Grand Theft Auto and FIFA and some of the other games I just mentioned, that's a very, very high bar for a platform where, you know, the content by large is being created by amateurs. So it sounds like Roblox needs entertainment to somehow come to and beyond gaming, entertainment to come into the Roblox metaverse, if you will, to attract an older demographic that perhaps more has the propensity to spend or at least the dollars to expend within that metaverse, maybe a Disney in all of the entertainment and the titles and the content that that could look like within a metaverse. Yeah, and if there's one thesis that underlies sort of my entire approach to covering stocks, it's that content is game. And if you want to be a great platform, you're going to need great content. I think right now they have, you know, some great content for kids, but not for adults. And ultimately solving that problem is probably going to be very difficult. That is why my kids are on it and I am not. Cowling Senior Headler Doug Gray, thanks so much, appreciate it. Thank you. Well, coming up, Walmart is stepping into the content creator space. We have the details on that. Good luck. I will beンj Walmart.

Y'all can find this is Brooke DiPalma here with the details. And hey Brooke, it seems like Walmart's a little bit late to this, right? This is something other shopping sites have tried to. And I'm just still trying to wrap my head around like Walmart being a fashion leader here. So tell us about this program. Well, Julie, you might be surprised that a lot of influencers are currently sharing Walmart Creative, one of the most popular fashion brands, including Scoop, Guilty as Charge. I actually own one of their sweaters. But this new Walmart Creator platform is actually currently a beta version. It's going to launch fully in 2023 now, curators or creators, rather. Can sign up for the platform, share these product links onto their social media pages like Instagram, Facebook, TikTok, of course, potentially be real here, or a group of their choice. And the platform will also curate recommendations based upon these creators' interests. And they'll then be able to track how these recommendations do, how they perform, how their followers click the links and then buy the products from Walmart. And of course, when they're, that's when the creators will earn commission. But they can also apply to be part of their upcoming brand campaigns out of Walmart. And now some of the influencers that they're getting on board here to start include Devon on Dak. He has 3.8 million followers on TikTok. He's a fashion influencer. And also a more older crowd here. Cooking with Darrell is a dad that rose to fame during the pandemic for his quick family style recipes. He has 2.7 million followers. But Julie, the catchier, they're really looking to let everyone monetize not just influencers that you think of who have millions and millions of followers. Brooke, break this down further for me for an old person such as myself. So if I go on to the platform, I see Joey the Body Builder. And I'm like, wow, that person has an amazing physique. I want to buy a 40 pound tub of weight protein. Does it extend to food or is this just a peril? Well, according to cooking with Darrell, he just posted a video on TikTok. And he seems like he's going to be posting different products. Of course, Brian, this is currently in a beta version. So I think Walmart really experimenting here. What people will be interested. It seems like it's going to be a whole fray of different offerings. One thing to know here is that Walmart is saying that there's no cap on just how much money creators can earn here. Walmart, spokesperson confirming an assignment. That we don't share commission percentages for our creative partners. But also here, one of their biggest competitors, Amazon. Of course, doing that, you can buy anything that Amazon influencers program creators recommend from that protein powder or iron potentially. But one thing to note is that according to Amazon, these influencers can earn 2%, 10% up to 20% for their recommendation that 20% being for Amazon games. So there is a fixed commission income for Amazon there. Of course, Amazon came in earlier to the game here back in 2017. They also recently launched Amazon Live. They also recently launched that in India as well. We also saw others like like to know it, get into the space, will work style those, some of their early comers. But lots of opportunity to grow. This is expected to reach $145.2 billion by 2028. But to answer your question, Brian, for the entire influencer space, they're really recommending all different products. So I think Walmart really looking to get a slice of that here as well. All right, time for me to start serving more loops on the ground. Here on the weekends. I can do better than my goosebumps t-shirts. Coming up, everyone. Thanks so much, Brooke. Appreciate it. Coming up, meta is being forced to sell. Giffy, giffy, giffy, giffy. We're going to break down the details next.",https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1iVTbuGfqnQ,14,2022-10-18 14:54:18
3528," Music Let's go. Improved. It is time for Cretortime, two stories today. One minute each, we start with this, Meta Platforms is unwinding its 2020 purchase of the animated image platform, Giffy. After British regulators blocked the deal on concerns that Meta could deny or limit competitors' access to Giffy's Gifts or Giffy's Gifts, whichever way you're pronouncing it at all. I say Giffy and I say Gifts. I've never posted a Giffy on Facebook. Have you guys? On Facebook? No. Mostly on Twitter. Or are we even on Facebook? On Slack. They took the Gifts away from Slack. Yes. That would be a profound decrease in my well-being at work. That's true. We have great ones in our lives during Christmas. I don't know. I didn't know it ran that deep. So if Meta did take it over and then blocked it from Slack or charged too much in Slack, I'd just stop using them. I'm thankful that the British authorities have done this if that would be the outcome. This was a really early pandemic deal. I remember what, March of 2020, we had heard some of the deal making really start to bubble up. And this really kicked off. Where tech companies would look at these opportunities, go after some of these smaller, privately held companies and just seeing kind of good valuations that they could ultimately be able to capitalize on. All right. We didn't have a chance to discuss this one yesterday. Yay. Kanye. That is, as he's purchasing the controversial social media platform, Parlor. It has a reputation for being favored by right-wing extremists. Yay, in a release by Parlor, said, conservatives have to make sure they have the right to freely express themselves. Of course, Kanye over the weekend was expressing quite a bit of anti-semitism. And that's something that's on that platform. So I don't even know what to say about this. I mean, a lot of different businesses are cutting their ties with him. And he's allowing himself more closely with extremism, it seems. No pun here. And the next sure drop is really Adidas severed ties with him. Right. They're reviewing that relationship, right? But it would be a big blow, of course, to Adidas. Big blow to him financially. I'm surprised that it has taken Adidas this long to step up and do something. I think in what we've seen from Yay and the activity and what has clearly been extremely shortsighted, Tarnas says reputation from what hasn't been Tarnas to this point, he's going to quickly discover that freedom of expression is not the same as extremism. That takes place and emanates and continues to boil over on platforms like Parlor. Yeah. Well, I don't know if you will get that message. We'll see what happens. All right.

3530," Still trading above that. Actually, it's now right below that 4% level. All this is earnings continue to roll on. We've already heard from several of the major banks. Goldman Sachs, the latest reported quarterly results coming out with the beat. But how do these big banks compare to one another in the latest quarter? Let's bring in Yahoo! Finances Alexander Seminova here with me at the desk. We got all the big banks out of the way. In general, a pretty positive outlook. I don't know if you should say positive outlook, but a beat. The expectations were fairly low. Yeah, absolutely. Kiko, I have to start out by saying it's really been a mixed bag for financials as they've been reporting their results. On one hand, the banking industry is still doing just fine compared to what analysts are expecting to see from some other sectors that are set to report in the coming weeks. It's really just the year over year comparisons that have been really tough after an incredibly lucrative 2021. And they're still meeting analyst expectations for the most part. But on the other hand, we are seeing bank profits taking a huge hit driven primarily by two things. Lower deal-making activity that is really putting a dent in investment, banking revenues. And them setting a sign funds for potential loan losses, which is also weighing on their profits as they expect the possibility of an economic recession. But there are a few, of course, that have held up better than others. Goldman Sachs yet again was a standout today beating on all fronts coming in far better than Wall Street had expected. Profit was down 43%, but that was partially offset by an 11% jump in trading activity led by fixed income trading specifically. So again, the expectations were low and this was very much a better than feared situation with the big banks. Bank of America also posted a drop in profits year over year. However, it did see an earnings per share beat compared to what Wall Street was expecting, also benefiting from better than expected trading revenues. So those are the winners as you put it, the biggest loser? Well, one more winner. We have JP Morgan actually saw a drop in quarterly net income. But Openheimer analysts said it was a blowout quarter saying that blowout would be an understatement because analysts were really preparing for the worst when it came to this. But then you look at city group profit fell 25% revenue. However, rose 6% again at beat Wall Street estimates. Morgan Stanley was the only bank that really disappointed Wall Street missing expectations and reporting profit that fell 29%. So that was one of the banks that saw much more challenging quarter compared to its peers. Okay, Alexander Seminovo with a roundup for us. Thanks so much for that. Joining us now for a deeper dive on the financial sector. Let's bring in Devin Ryan at JMP Securities Director of Financial Technology Research. Devin, good to talk to you today. We're going to get to the restructuring on Goldman in just a bit. But let's talk about the roundup of the banks. As Alexandra just highlighted, we did see a big drop in profits when you look at the year on your comparison. A lot of these banks beat expectations, but it certainly didn't really vote well when you look at the outlook here. You think about the concerns in terms of loan defaults, loan loss reserves, increasing as well. I mean, what did you take away from these results in terms of the economic picture to come? Well, I think it's just it's a complicated environment, right? The macro backdrop has been complicated all year. And you know, even as we're about ready to exit 2022, there's still a lot of uncertain. So we haven't really made a lot of progress on that front. So banks kind of being one proxy for the outlook of the economy. You know, it's obviously a wine dispersion of expectations. That being said, what we're actually seeing the results is is pretty encouraging, at least as of now, you know, really no credit issues higher interest rates are driving a guy and tire for net interest income for the most part. And then as you guys talked about investment banking is very weak off of what was by far record 2021 on the other side, you know, trading is helping offset that. So it's just showing that these are business models that are pretty resilient. The bar was low into earnings, but the macro outlook is still uncertain. And so that's why, you know, we think we've been arguing we're kind of in this range bound trading where we got a little bit oversold. And so that's a little bit too negative. Now you're seeing a bounce off of that. But until there's more certainty and stability. It's going to be hard to have really sustained recovery in the stock.",https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1iVTbuGfqnQ,17,2022-10-18 15:07:18
3531," people were a little bit too negative. Now you're seeing a balance off of that. But until there's more certainty and stability, it's going to be hard to have really sustained recovery in the stocks. Let's talk about the other big announcement getting a lot of attention here. Goldman Sachs essentially confirming these reports that came out of multiple media outlets, including the Wall Street Journal, that they are, in fact, restructuring here, going from four divisions to three. There's a number of things to highlight, the consumer business, when wealth management merging with asset management, also investment and banking and trading now being placed under one unit. What do you think this says about where the bank is headed? Someone argue, well, there was this big focus back in 2020 about the consumer side of things. Is there a pivot that's happening? Yeah, I think this is more of a reorganization around the edges. This isn't some major shift in strategy or major pivot. On the consumer side, I think listening to the market, and there's a lot of press out there that is not a profitable business today, it's growing at a pretty strong pace. Your consumer revenues are up 95% year-to-year, but it's a business that I think is still, you're spending a lot of money to expand. And so I think they're pulling back a little bit on that growth investment. Think they're getting a little bit more specific around how they acquire customers and you want to do it in a more profitable way. So those are where some of the changes are, the reorganization of the business units to me is more just getting a little bit more organized around how they report, how management is structured. Don't really see a major strategic shift there, but ultimately, maybe that drives a little bit more efficiency in the business model. But ultimately, Goldman is the same business. They've gained a lot of market share on the institutional side. And we don't think they're pulling back dramatically on consumer. I think they just want to be a little bit more tailored and be able to focus on profitability there. Yeah, I mean, it's not a dramatic scaling back, as you say, on the consumer side of things. Having said that, it's taken a while for that to be a big driver. Do you anticipate that that will ultimately take hold? Or are we just sort of talking about through the traditional revenue drivers remaining in place for the bank? Yeah, so I mean, Goldman's a little bit of victim of their own success. They've had so much success on the institutional side. And those revenues have grown more than, I think most people predicted a few years ago that you'll look at the growth in consumer and say, well, it's still relative in material. They're generating over $2 billion in consumer revenue. So it's not a small business if you took it out and put it on a standalone versus any other digital bank or new consumer startup. So we do think if something is going to take hold, you'll Goldman's not managing the business for the next credit cycle or the next two years. They're managing for the next 20 years or even 100 years. And so when we think about getting into an entirely new business line that is a huge, addressable market, it's going to take time. And they're just listening, I think, to market feedback and pushback that, hey, you need to get this business into a better profitability picture before you continue to add new links to it. And so that's really what this is. But we're still pretty constructive on what consumer can be in the long term and think they'll continue to feed growth there and just be a little bit more tactical around how they do that. Specifically on Goldman Sachs, you've got a price target of $470 a share and outperform rating there. How do you think it stacks up against some of the other banks that have reported in the anticipation of some kind of economic downturn? Yeah, Goldman historically has always gained market share coming out of economic downturn. So in that very moment of market stress, it could be challenging for them as it is for everyone. But they are so good on risk management. And when others essentially get out over their skis and take too much risk, Goldman Sachs is able to really gain market share, take clients. And that's what we think would happen again to the extent the economy does roll over. So again, you're not cheering on a downturn, but ultimately, Goldman Sachs is going to be better positioned in our opinion. And so when you're buying the stock just over book value, book value is $300 to $8 for them right now. That's a pretty good risk or worn long term for investors to compete patient. They're generating returns on equity in north to 10%, even in this really difficult environment. That relationship has always helped invest.",https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1iVTbuGfqnQ,18,2022-10-18 15:11:42
3532," for investors to be patient. They're generating returns on equity north of 10%, even in this really difficult environment. That relationship has always helped investors in our opinion make money when that R O E and book value are correlated like that. So we think this is a pretty good entry point for investors that have a little bit of patience and a little bit of a long-term orientation. Devon Ryan, JMP, Securities Director of Financial Technology Research. Good to have you on today. Appreciate the time. Well, let's take a look at shares of Salesforce. Seeing a big pop on reports that activist investor Starboard value has taken a stake in the company. When you see that stock, up about four and a half percent, founder Jeff Smith telling CNBC his fund has taken a significant position the software maker, although he didn't specify the amount. Smith added that the company is not generating meaningful, operating leverage relative to its peers. And that subpar mix of growth and profitability has contributed to a significant discount in valuation. Shares of Salesforce, by the way, down more than 40% so far this year. Coming up, a flash of luxury, Rolls Royce, unveils its first electric vehicle. We're gonna speak with a group's CEO. You certainly don't wanna miss that. Also ahead, reports suggest the Biden administration looking to dip into the strategic petroleum reserve. Yet again, are the moves justified. We'll discuss on the other side. Well, turning now to oil markets. The White House is reportedly weighing additional sales from its strategic petroleum reserve to help tamp down fuel prices before the midterms. Let's bring in Yahoo Finance, his Jared Blick, right who's tracking the very latest for us. And Jared, I'm looking at oil prices under significant pressure today. WTI and Brent could both down. But of course we did get kind of a preview of this on the back of the OPEC plus decision. The White House statement did in fact come out.",https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1iVTbuGfqnQ,19,2022-10-18 15:15:52
3533," And oil prices under significant pressure today, WTI and Brent could both down. But of course, we did get kind of a preview of this on the back of the OPEC plus decision. The White House statement did in fact come out and say, look, we're going to tap into the reserves again because we expect the prices to go up. Yeah, so that was a controversial decision. OPEC plus increasing, excuse me, decreasing its production facilities by two million barrels per day, very much unexpected. A lot of people thought that was just a blatant shot off the bow toward the U.S. But take a look at crude oil. We see it's down three and a half percent today. You take a look at a year-to-day chart. You can see still see a bit elevated, but it has been in a steady downtrend since the middle of the year. Now, the strategic petroleum reserve of the U.S., let me put it to your chart so I can show you. It was standing at about 630 million barrels. That was as of mid last year, so we can just draw a line up. Then we started tapping it and then we got down to about, let's say, 400 million and change here. Now, what happened obviously since we up, the SPR was being tapped. We did see a tremendous rise in prices, not only in crude oil, but also our Bob Gasoline futures. But guess what was happening in the meantime? We had the Russia Ukraine conflict, which nobody really anticipated. We also had a massive repricing of risk with respect to the Federal Reserve. After that became apparent, we finally saw prices peak about mid-year here and start to come down. You take a look at our Bob Gasoline futures, which closely tracked the price of gasoline at the pump. Very similar story. So the SPR, when it was tapped mid last year, didn't have an immediate effect, but we did talk with Ed Morse over at cities, head of commodities there. He said the administration gets high marks for controlling the price of gasoline, actually the supplies online. But in terms of price controls, not so much. And here's what he had to say. The history of trying to put a price cap on is not very good. And it's kind of ironic that they're doing this at a time when the producers look at them and say, hey, they're putting on a price cap. We're trying to put a floor under prices. They don't like that. Why should we like them putting a price cap on Russia when they could do the same thing to us if this kind of thing works? So it has mixed grades, I think. And imperfect mechanism, Akiko. So that's how we see it. Okay. Something to watch, especially when you consider the reserves are so low. Yes. Already that they'll have to refill it pretty quickly. And by a third already. Yeah. Number to watch there. Thanks so much for that, Jared. Who rules Royce is unveiling this spectre, the luxury car makers, first fully electric vehicle, the two door sedan marks of BMW subsidiary, rules, Royce's appeal to upmarket EV buyers. Joining us now is Torsten Mueller, Otvos, rules Royce CEO, also with us is Prada Supermanian, of course Yahoo Finance car reporter. We should point out the segment presented to you by BMW, which owns rules Royce. Great to have you on today. Certainly a big day. You're taking the wraps off of the big EV here. Question to you here. We have seen this market get increasingly crowded, but you are competing in the ultra luxury space. What's the demand for EVs look like there? I mean, so far I can tell you, first of all, good morning. It's great. And this is a historic day here. We are launching, first of all, the very first electric Ross Royce. We are the very first loans rightly so, as you said a minute ago, to be in that ultra luxury segment, the very first offering an electric car. And for that reason, we are very much looking forward to it. And so far, order entry is already really great and very pleasing. And it's not only the United States, but it's all over the world. And I think we are working on electrifying the brand already for quite a while. We are experimenting with it since 10 years and quizzed our clients worldwide on what their requirements would be. So I foresee a very good future also in the ultra high luxury segment. And for us, along with you say that electric propulsion fits perfect to the brand. It's quiet, silent, very talky, delivers worthability. And also interesting story goes back to what one of our founding fathers said in 1900, Charles Roles made a prophecy and said, the perfect propulsion for cars is electric. Once charging is fixed. And I think now we are here fulfilling his prophecy. Hey, Toros and Price.",https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1iVTbuGfqnQ,20,2022-10-18 15:20:17
3534," Pollution for cars is electric. Once charging is fixed. And I think now we are here fulfilling his prophecy. Hey, Toros and Prasya, good to see you again. I had a question about sort of the engineering challenge is making a Rolls Royce into an EV. I know you say that it's a Rolls Royce first and an EV second. What kind of challenge did you guys face having to make this sort of appeal to your audience? Good point, Pras. I think, as I said already, we started looking into it over 10 years ago when we launched that experimental phantom, a 102 ex. And we put quite a lot of clients worldwide behind the wheel. And one finding was, fits perfect to the brand, but charging time and also range needs to be fully sufficient. So for that reason, that took us a while because one thing was also clear, don't compromise the Rolls Royce experience. And all that in combination challenged our engineers, as you can imagine, because it was clear, it needed to be magic carpet ride, it was clear, that it needed to carry sufficient range. And we are offering now 520 kilometers, we are in a 20 miles range. And I think that is very sufficient and definitely on what our clients expect in that segment to happen. And for that reason, I think we got here, but the challenge was on our hands and we are not yet completely finished. The car is still in the testing worldwide and the testing ends end of June next year. And then first deliveries will be done by end of next year when first clients, also in the United States market, take delivery of their specter. Hey, Torson, so you guys are, like you mentioned, the cars are going to come out end of next year. Have you guys faced any issues with part shortages, components shortages, things like that that you need to kind of kind of put into place before these cars are delivered? I mean, we are working here closely together, also with the BMW group in terms of, let's say, some technical and laundry components. We have invited quite a lot of clients already over here to Goodwood to see specter and they were all highly fascinated by what they have seen. Many of them placed already orders and deposits. So for that reason, I think that's good. We also see the car now more often in the markets. We will bring it also to the United States before so that clients can see it real in front of them. So I think we're going to shorten that, or we're going to make waiting fun for specter. That's for sure. Torson, I wonder where you think we are in this transition to EVs? And I'm not just talking about the ultra luxury space when you look at where market share is globally. It's just over 10% in terms of where EV stand in the broader auto market. Here in the US, it's just up 5%. Are we at a tipping point, or is it going to take a little more, whether that is higher oil prices, or higher gas prices, or a little more accessibility in the cars to get to full acceleration in this transition, which a lot of governments hope will be 100% EVs? Yeah, I mean, first of all, we are not really in the car business. Sounds funny now. We're in the luxury goods business. Nobody needs us to come from A to B. All our clients have multiple cars in their garage. So I think this is here different. It is that you are seen for the very first time, completely emission-free in a luxury rolls-roise. And I think that's a statement. A statement quite a lot of our clients would like to make. For that reason, I definitely foresee not only specter being excesses in the market, but also our forthcoming strategy to say by the end of 2030, the entire brand Rolls-Royce motor car is fully electrified. So all new Rolls-Royces in the next years to come are fully electrified. Hey, Toros. That's clear. And... Yeah. Sorry about that. Hey, Toros. In the last time we spoke, at the end of the summer, we talked about how there was insatiable demand for luxury cars. You mentioned the specter being at the highest in a luxury EVs. Does that still exist now? Are we still seeing any kind of hesitation as a global market uncertainty sort of builds up here? No, not at all. I remember I talked that evening at Pebble Beach, obviously. So no...",https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1iVTbuGfqnQ,21,2022-10-18 15:24:36
3535," Builds up here? No, not at all. Pros and I remember I will talk that evening at Pebble Beach, obviously. So, no, not at all. I think we still have a very strong order intake worldwide. I think there is no reluctancy currently to invest and to indulge luxury. I think the entire luxury market, not only the car market, but also fashion, whatever runs pretty well, currently worldwide. And I think that it's also due to the fact that there was quite some money accumulated in the Corona times. And for that reason, there is a new kind of understanding. You better live now and don't postpone it to later. So people are prepared to still spend money, which is great. And I think that puts us here into work. We are employing here at Goodwood over 2000 people and they profit from the fact that the luxury business is allowing me to say booming. Okay. I know the process is waiting to take a test drive in that car, right? Yeah. Always looking for a test drive. We've got to make that happen. Terce and Mueller, Otposts, it's always good to have you on this show. Really appreciate your time and our thanks to Pros Supermanian as well. Well, coming up, warnings over COVID variant starting to grow louder as we approach the winter. Anthony Fauci says they are in his words, that the white house is a little bit of a trouble. And the white house COVID is our urges boosters will break it all down on the other side. And then we gathered up the hospital through theرك to stop a lot more. Johnson and Johnson topped estimates and its latest quarter, but it could still see job cuts as it battles in Flation. We are watching shares there pretty much unchanged trading pretty flat right now. Let's bring in Yahoo finances, Anjali Kamlani, who's breaking down the numbers for us today. Anjali. That's right, Akiko. As you mentioned, beating on earnings and expectations and to that point of the job cuts really pointing out the fact that...",https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1iVTbuGfqnQ,22,2022-10-18 15:29:05
3536," numbers for us today, Ashley. That's right, Akiko. As you mentioned, beating on earnings and expectations and to that point of the job cuts really pointing out the fact that even a company as large as Johnson and Johnson not immune to the impacts of inflationary impacts there, we saw specifically growth in some segments, though specifically the pharmaceutical sector of business. And that was on its cancer drug, Darsala. That one specifically, you know, an interesting one as a company we know is in that focus of blood cancer, so that multiple myeloma drug. We also saw a little bit of an increase in medical devices. Now that's a segment that's been under pressure in previous quarters as a result of reduced hospital visits. You've seen how the hospital sector has been impacted and so that has impacted Johnson and Johnson as well. And so what we've seen is a change in that this quarter possibly looking to slowly bring that back depending on how hospital visits turn out. Also want to point out that the company, you know, those job cuts, that announcement really coming as the company is quote, right sizing as it splits into two that new can-view brand that's going to house all the consumer products we know well like Tylenol, Band-Data and the like. That is set to spin out officially late next year and that's still on track according to everything we heard on today's earnings call. So looking at the total business as you mentioned, training flat but still growing slowly as Johnson, Johnson tends to do. So that's where things stand right now for the company. And Angelie, meanwhile, you know, we're in October. We have certainly heard from plenty of health officials within the Biden administration warning about these new COVID variants that they expect to really tick up going into the winter. What do we know about how different this is and just how much immunity we're likely to have with the current boosters on the market? So what they're expecting is that we will have some protection from these boosters. Now when it comes to individuals who are highly vulnerable like immunocompromised folks, we're looking at the monoclotal antibodies and the reduced efficacy of that and the sort of limited protection we have in terms of treatments, which is why the administration has been so bullish on pushing for these vaccines and the need for majority of Americans to get vaccinated. We heard from White House COVID-19 response team coordinator Dr. Shish Jai yesterday talking about just that and what sort of the tools are as the administration has continued to say we have in the book, Solicin. Right now we do have widespread availability of these brand new by-vailant vaccines that are free, widely available, pretty much everybody is eligible for it. We have treatments. We have lots of testing capability in that context. Yes, I mean, obviously we're looking at the flu, we're looking at and worried about we might see with COVID or RSV, but I don't think we're going to need to do anything that resembles what we had to do in previous winter. I really do think we're in a very, very different place. So as you can hear, I asked specifically about moving back to stronger mitigation measures like indoor masking and it seems like the administration is still convinced that we don't necessarily need to do that as long as we get boosters and are, you know, staying pretty cautious and vigilant. So that's where things stand right now. Okay, a reminder for everybody to schedule that booster ahead of the winter. Thanks so much for that, Anjali.

While amid a fractured geopolitical landscape deteriorating relations with the US and slower growth at home, Xi uses Sunday speech to the party congress to emphasize the importance of in his words high quality growth and the reality of a struggling economy is certainly amplified by the failure to release GDP data as scheduled. Joining us now is Christopher Markowitz, he's senior professor of Chinese management at the University of Cambridge. He's also the author of Mao and Markowitz, professor good to talk to you today. We've come to expect these party congresses to pretty much be about messaging, not about a new shift in policy or an introduction of a new strategy here, but I thought it was interesting the Sunday speech that we got from President Xi felt a little more downbeat. He used the word struggle multiple times and what was considered a pretty short speech also seemed to brace the Chinese people for economic conflict. What was your takeaway and what we have heard from him so far? Yeah, no, I totally concur and agree with you. I do think that hit all the sort of common messaging that people were thinking it was going to hit, but clearly with the economy down, with COVID controls likely to continue, China's economy is not going to be going up anytime soon. And so what's the expectation of me? Do we get any more clarity on any kind of shift here? He certainly seemed to double down on the zero COVID policy. Didn't talk too much about what we're seeing in the real estate sector in terms of the debt growing, you know, defaults, concerns about defaults, piling up there, in terms of the economic picture as the world's second largest economy, what do we come to expect based on what we've heard from the President? Yeah, I mean, I think that China's years of 8% growth are behind it. And I think I mean, part of that is the zero COVID has really slowed things down. You mentioned in your opening this high quality growth idea, which certainly I support in many ways, because it's about, you know, listening.",https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1iVTbuGfqnQ,24,2022-10-18 15:37:40
3538," COVID has really slowed things down. You mentioned in your opening this high quality growth idea, which certainly I support in many ways because it's about lessening China's tremendous income inequality. Unfortunately, a lot of times, many of those policies end up resulting in robbing from the rich to give to the poor, instead of having a more systematic way of rebalancing income inequality. So I think it's more of the same as compared to the last two years. We certainly didn't hear the Chinese leader single out the US, but he did talk about sort of a divided world, which was kind of a nudge at what we've been seeing in terms of US policy going into the party congress. Of course, we had the Biden administration release these really harsh measures, especially against the semiconductor industry, which seems to signal more of a division globally, especially around technology. I wonder how you're looking at that, and the implications not just in China, but in the US. Yeah, I mean, I think you're exactly right. I mean, the Chipsville Biden's executive action around it. I think we're particularly executive action. I think went further than many observers thought that they would. And I think this is going to result in a new era of technological splitting. I mean, the US and China are connected in so many ways, economic ways. But if people with US passports can't be working in Chinese semiconductor firms, I mean, that creates a rift that is really hard to get over. On the issue of Taiwan, we did hear she talk about peaceful reunification still being the goal, but sort of also alluding to the fact that he shouldn't hesitate to use force if necessary. Where does that tension stand right now? And did we glean anything new from how the Chinese leaders thinking about this right now? I mean, clearly, I think he put stronger stakes in the sand than I would have expected around the Taiwan issue if things were just going to stabilize. I just saw Anthony Blinken recently had a statement in a speech that he feels that forceful reunification may occur in the near term. So I think that, observers, knowledgeable observers are really very worried about the trajectory of China's approach to Taiwan. Finally, I see you've got your book, Malon Markets, right behind you there. But this is an interesting comparison that you're making. I mean, we have heard the comparisons going into this party Congress that essentially by him cementing this third term, it does make him the most powerful Chinese leader since Mao Zedong. In terms of economic policy, what are the parallels that you see? I think one parallel is this interest in putting sort of the party in ideology above economic relations. The past 30 years under Deng Xiaoping and Jiang Zemin, Hu Jintao, this was not necessarily the case. So I think really the sort of party at the center ideology first, I think also the idea of really having this top down campaign logic is a big deal. So Mao had campaigns throughout his time as China's leader. And you look at semiconductors, you look at anti-corruption, you look at COVID. I mean, these are all very much about, let's have a top down campaign. So I think those are the two key parallels that I think help us understand she and his governance. So really quickly, does this mean that this isn't about Chinese ambitions to be the world's largest economy anymore? That has that kind of been put on hold? I don't think the ambitions in this have been put on hold. I mean, I do think that some of the policies are counter that. But another sort of famous statement of Mao was sort of standing up to the West and resuming China's place in the world. And I don't think that she has put that idea behind him at all. Christopher Marquess, sinew professor of Chinese management at the University of Cambridge and author of Mao and markets. Appreciate your time today. Great, thanks for having me on. Well, coming up, holding studies at US with Haynes, its position in global tax competitive and its ranking.",https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1iVTbuGfqnQ,25,2022-10-18 15:41:50
3539," and author of now and market. It's appreciate your time today. Great, thanks for having me on. Well, coming up, holding steady, the US retains its position in global tax competitive and its rankings. But the inflation reduction act mean big changes ahead for going to dive deep into that report on the other side.Beifall for our 2019 A new report from the Tax Foundation finds that tax competitiveness in the U.S. remains steady among the world's top economies ahead of big changes for 2023. For more on the report is Daniel Bunn. He's executive vice president at the Tax Foundation. Daniel, get to talk to you today. Walk me through for those who aren't as familiar with this report that you put out every year. How you sort of determine what is competitive and where the U.S. ranks right now in relation to its peers. Well, thank you for having me. This report is designed to help policymakers see where their tax system is strong on things like pro-growth measures or policies that avoid distortions and complexities. In measures the tax systems of the 38 OECD countries and the U.S. ranks 22nd on the index this year, as you mentioned, the same place as it held last year. The index puts France at the bottom and Estonia at the top. Estonia has had that place every year that we've published the index and this is its ninth year. So let's make that comparison between a place like Estonia and the U.S. where does the U.S. really get hurt and to your point or to the point that we made in this introduction coming to you, how is this likely to shift as a result of the provisions that have been included in the Inflation Reduction Act? So the Inflation Reduction Act introduced a tax on stock buybacks. It introduced a alternative minimum tax based on financial statement and income. It introduced a different wave of...",https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1iVTbuGfqnQ,26,2022-10-18 15:46:28
3540," based on financial statement and income, and introduced a different way of calculating a lot of different tax credits. And a lot of these things just add complexity to the system. And if things stay as they are in current law, including some provisions that are expiring based on the Tax Cuts and Jobs Act from 2017, the rank will likely be slipping for the US next year unless other OECV countries make them even worse than the US. Yeah, how big of a decline I was talking about. Right now, based on what other countries are looking at, it's a shift in two places. So I would say a shift from 22nd to 24th. We've also been following very closely what's been playing out over in the UK. You could call it the big reversal. Obviously the tax cut policies that were initially proposed by UK Prime Minister Liz Truss now in full reversal as a result of her former finance minister getting cut, you've got Jeremy Hunt now in place as well. I wonder how you look at this in the context of how competitive the UK can be. Number one, the policies that are now being proposed by the new finance minister, but also just how quickly things have been reversed, you know, sort of the policy swings that we have seen in a very short amount of time. One of the things that really matters for tax policy is stability. And what we've seen in the UK is the opposite of that over the last several years. And what we've seen in the last few weeks is enough U terms that we're kind of spinning in circles. I think what this means for UK competitiveness where the UK ranks right now is 26th on the index. And it looks like unless policies are to improve and it's not really clear where the government's going to go over the long term here, then that rank will be slipping as well, potentially into the 30s on the index. A lot of the policies that they introduced recently, you know, they might have improved the rank somewhat, but I think the pro growth measures that the government kind of could have done were left on the table. Tax Foundation Executive Vice President Daniel Bunn good to talk to you tonight. Thank you. It is now time for our chart of the day. And today we are looking at a whole lot of cash. Take a look at this chart from the latest B of A Global Fund Manager survey, which shows that fund managers have taken their cash positions to the highest level in 21 years. The survey found the average cash level was 6.3% in October. That's up from 6.1%. The prior month and will above the long term average of 4.8%. All this of course coming on the back of the volatility we've seen in the equity space. Well, let's turn our attention to the uptick and union activity across the country, starting with Amazon and a fourth union election for the company this year. Yeah, who finances Alexis Keenan here to break it all down for us in Alexis. We're looking at the vote in Albany. Close to Albany. Close to Albany, what are we expecting that number to come down? It's underway right now. It started at 10 a.m. Eastern Times. It's expected to take about three, four hours. And so we should have some numbers by this afternoon, but like you said, it would be the fourth time workers for Amazon in their facilities have voted yes or no on union. So let's look at the numbers. This particular facility in Castleton, New York, it has about 400 workers. That's just an estimate though. Those that say they want a union, they say that they want it because the management is prioritizing profits over people. That's a bit of a vague statement there. But these workers make approximately $17 an hour after pay hike that was at $16 an hour. So if we look at the numbers, that brings the total number of union votes for Amazon 2, 4, the vote underway today, plus that first yes vote, that's pending certification, that was that big, stand, and island facility that has 8,300 workers. They voted yes back in March. Also no votes from two different facilities. A second one in Staten Island came down in May, as well as a no vote in Bessamer, Alabama in March. So the company kind of getting a 50, 50 result there. Also looking at today's Starbucks, Starbucks is holding held a couple different votes yesterday. One was in Seattle, another one was in Portland, Maine. Those workers are going to decide whether to join Starbucks workers united in that case. And we've seen this get a little contentious. I mean, it's not just Starbucks, but just the very latest for these tensions to flare up within the stores. And what's going on there? Tensions are very high with Starbucks, and that is evidence.",https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1iVTbuGfqnQ,27,2022-10-18 15:50:44
3541," Starbucks, but just the very latest, for these tensions to flare up within the stores. And what's going on there? Tensions are very high with Starbucks, and that is evidenced by a lawsuit that was filed yesterday by eight Starbucks workers. They are located in Anderson, South Carolina. This is a unionized store already. And we have some video of the incident that gave rise to this lawsuit. And what the lawsuit is saying, the employees are saying that the manager of the store, as well as Starbucks, appeared to have coordinated to a ledge that they were preventing the manager from exiting the store. The workers said that they confronted their manager asking for a pay raise, asking for also some of the equipment in the store to be addressed. Now we've spoken with Starbucks this morning. They say they are aware of this complaint. They are still reviewing it. However, they do note that the manager came and filed this complaint on her own. That this was not the company's action to go ahead and file what was a police report. So once these employees that you just saw in that video had asked for a pay raise and these other things that they were looking for, the manager then went to the police there locally and said that she was prevented from exiting the store, which amounts to, in some cases, a kidnapping. And also said that the employees assaulted her. Now a lot of work to still be done, but a police report that was given to a local reporter said that that wasn't the case. That after having reviewed that video that they found that it was a peaceful incident that they did let the manager go back and forth at will. So more to be learned there, but the employees in this case were suspended. And I had asked Starbucks whether they were suspended with or without pay. They're still working on giving me answers on that, but the manager in this case also suspended, though, with pay. It's getting kind of ugly. It's getting very ugly for Starbucks. The company is fighting these union efforts across the country and just tensions are very high. And look, Starbucks, it's a little bit easier some experts in union organizations say for Starbucks workers to organize because you're going store by store where there are fewer employees in each location versus an Amazon in that case. Thousands of workers. Thousands have to coordinate to even get a petition in line for a vote to happen. Yeah, a lot of companies watching both of those was very closely. Thanks so much for that. Well, coming up fresh offerings, Apple gets ready for the holiday season with new versions of its iPad Pro and an updated version of the Apple TV 4K.

3542," Sit on the skyline, Well, a quick update to bring to you on that story. We're going to be talking about Amazon warehouse workers looking to unionize near Albany, New York. We've now learned that employees there have overwhelmingly rejected that unionization effort. The final vote count coming in, 206 votes in favor of the union, 406 votes that were opposed to it. And we should point out these results still need to be certified by the National Labor Relations Board. But another setback for the Amazon Labor Union there. Well, Apple's announcing new versions of its iPad Pros and an updated Apple TV 4K this morning. The launch giving shoppers new items to add to their wish list ahead of the all important holiday season. Let's bring in Yahoo Finance's tech editor, Dan Halley, with the very latest. And I was just saying, I feel like we just got a new iPad Pro. But what do we know about the details of this latest? Yeah, that's right, Kiko. There's a 2 new iPads and a new Apple TV 4K. Let me just run down real quick starting with the most expensive. That's the iPad Pro. There's the 11 inch and the 12.9 inch. The 11 inch starts at 7.99 while the 12.9 inch starts at 10.99. The big difference here is that these now get Apple's M2 chip. That's the in house chip that they have running in some of their laptops and desktops at this point. The second generation of iPads to get an M chip. The first iPads to get the M2 chip. Apple says that it's up to 50% faster, 15% faster than the M1. And 35% faster on graphics. There's also a new feature for the Apple pencil called hover over where the actual iPad will detect the Apple pencil 12 millimeters above the display. So you can actually see where you're going to be placing your marking. And that should be good for sketching as well as writing. They also introduced their stage manager feature. That's part of the updated iPad OS 16. It improves overall multitasking and then you're also going to be able to connect up to a 6K display and use that as an external monitor for your iPad. So that's for the pros. And then on the regular iPad, this is the base level iPad. This gets a price jump to 449. It gets an A14 Bionic chip right now. The iPhone has the A16 Bionic. So this is just a few generations behind that as far as capabilities. There's a bigger display, completely new design. It's 10.9 inches versus the 10.2 inches. There's no longer a home button. So what you're going to be able to do to use Touch ID is press the power button. It uses USB-C instead of lightning. So that's a big change in something that we'll start to see potentially for the iPads. And then we have the Apple TV 4K. That gets an A15 chip and starts at 129. More things to put on the wishlist. I had a holiday season. Dan Halley's always thanks so much for that. Let's do a final check of the markets before we let you go. The rally that we talked about, losing a bit of steam, but the Dow still ups almost 200 points there. The S&P 500, up about 21 and the Nasdaq, up 49. That does it for me in this hour. We've got much more to come here and Yahoo Finance live. Keep it right here.",https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1iVTbuGfqnQ,29,2022-10-18 15:59:24

3544," This year we have a lot of models in the heart of the market, the largest segments in the market. We're here in GM's Design Center. Talk to us about what this means to GM history and also what it means for the future of the company. Well this is literally the building and the room where we review new vehicles and look at them from a design perspective, clay models or we have a lot of technology in this room from a virtual perspective as well. So this is where it happens this is where decisions are made and it's a vital part of the design process because no matter how much technology you have on a vehicle it has to start with being beautiful. Beautiful and I'm so excited about the new designs we have coming out. I want to ask you about the economy and you have obviously a unique perspective because you can talk to your dealers and they can talk to you about consumer demand. Where is the economy right now based on where you sit and what do you see going forward? Well you know we are starting to see some you know changes from a use car pricing perspective and you know we're watching and we're seeing you know right now it's very hard to know exactly what's happening in the market because you know we have been supply constrained for so long so we know there's pent up demand but also there's challenges in the logistics and moving vehicles once they're built. You know even we we still are dealing with semiconductor shortages but then when we get to that point getting vehicles moved to get to the dealers has been challenging as well so it's it's really an interesting time we're watching almost on a daily basis to see what's happening. We still see you know strong demand for many of our products especially our full size trucks that are mid-size crossovers but again we're watching all the signs I mean you know I think we're listening to what everyone else is saying around the globe and so we're preparing next year for a year that will you know look more like we have a little it will actually be more demand but a little less than man than what we would think because you know we're we're going to be conservative make sure we set our cost structure up that way so then if things turn out better we're well positioned but most importantly because we have so many important EV launches next year as well as crews growth we want to make sure that we can fund our future regardless of where the economy is you know downturn recession all those words that are being used we're we want to be prepared regardless of the environment and you're not seeing higher rates impact and consumer demand we haven't so far but again it's a very unique situation because we've been supply constrained for so long and so that's what we're watching because we know a vehicle is a very important purchase that people make and you know that they may make different decisions depending on how they feel about their own personal economic situation and you mentioned the chip shortage and supply chains a couple times now and how is that being mitigated is it improving and then what about some other supply chain issues might have with batteries and the inputs that go in there sure well you know from an overall supply chain we do see the semiconductor supply improving quarter by quarter but we still see more volatility than than we're used to I think one of the reasons for that is the supply chain has been stretched so thin so we're looking for improvement as we go forward but you know it's still there and it's still an issue as I said logistics is a you know getting the vehicles moved is a is another challenge but then when you look at you know other like supplying for EVs you know one of the things that's going to be key to unlocking more hummers more lyrics and all of our vehicles is the battery plants and we're actually running the battery plan in Ohio now and as that is able to ramp up more more cells will provide our ability to provide more electric vehicles I would also say GM we actually have signed agreements for the production that we need between now in 2025 to get to our million units in 2025 in the United States and more than that in in China so we're on track to do that and we have that supply chain secured you just mentioned China I want to follow up there you've had such success in that country with Buick there are a lot of new EVs there what is the future of that marketplace look for you well we're still we still think there's tremendous opportunity there you know as you mentioned the Buick brand is very strong as is Cadillac and we also have Chevrolet there but we also have a joint venture ship with Luling that allows us to sell not only the Bao Zhu brand but",https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1iVTbuGfqnQ,31,2022-10-18 16:08:04
3545," very strong as is Cadillac and we also have Chevrolet there. But we also have a joint venture ship with Luling that allows us to sell not only the Baozun brand but some other vehicles like the Hongguan Mini EV has been one of the highest selling vehicles this year from a Chinese perspective for EV. So we think there's opportunity. We're definitely seeing the landscape change. We're seeing more competition from domestic suppliers but we think especially in luxury and with you with the strength of those brands we think is going to remain strong. I want to drill down on a couple domestic brands, Equinox for instance which sounds like a car for everybody right with a price point. It's an EV coming out in a year or so. Talk to us about that one. That comes out in the second part of next year. And what's so important about the Chevrolet Equinox EV is that it's in the biggest segment globally, the biggest segment from a North America perspective as well and it's about affordability. So if you're around $30,000 you really get into the sweet spot of the market. And we've been really excited because we revealed the vehicle and people, there's been such a strong positive response to the vehicle and when people get in and actually get to drive it and see how great driving an EV is and then they see the technology on that vehicle. It's got a 17.7 inch screen, it has safety features and safety technology. People are going to realize they're getting a great vehicle and able to move into EVs with confidence. On the high end the Solistic. Yes. Am I saying that right? Yes. It's sort of a customized Cadillac right. Talk to us about that one. Well so it's a bespoke Cadillac. It really, if you look at what Cadillac means for so many people, people still use the term Cadillac for standard of the world and we really believe with all the work we've done, not only in our internal combustion with the Escalade V and the Blackwing series and the attention to design, as we move to our all-electric future with Cadillac, Solistic is really is going to be the pinnacle from that perspective. It will be hand-built on this site and the customers that will be able to customize the vehicle from interior to exterior. We're really excited the response for people that we've really revealed the vehicle to has been very, very positive. This really is one of the final steps in regaining that standard of the world for Cadillac and the response has been tremendous across all of our Cadillac products. Mary GM Stock has lagged a bit over the past year. I'm wondering what you would say to shareholders, why should they buy the stock hold the stock on the stock going forward? I think there's been so much attention earlier this year was how many EVs are used settling today and we were in a difficult situation because we did the right thing for the consumer and for safety and when we found there was a manufacturing defect in the bolt cell, we stopped producing so we could do the replacement cells for our customers. Because we've moved through the year we were able to start building the bolt again and we've actually had two record months in a row of sales of the bolt EV and EV. So I think that impacted the early view but what I would say to shareholders is take a little bit longer view because this isn't a one-year race. We are at the very early stages of driving EV adoption and when you look at the vehicles that we have coming out next year with the Silverado EV, the Equinox and the Blazer, again those are big segments of the US industry and to have really credible products in that I think is going to allow us to grow and that's why we're confident that we're going to hit our ability to produce a million units and see strong demand for our vehicles by the time we're at 2025.",https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1iVTbuGfqnQ,32,2022-10-18 16:12:24
3546," you you you So right? Cloud migrations were super critical during the pandemic even for resilience. And now, Cloud, if you're not on the cost frontier of the cloud, then you're falling behind on productivity. If you're not on the efficiency frontier of cloud-native applications, you're falling behind on productivity. If you're not able to use the hybrid work infrastructure to bring everybody to be able to sort of participate, collaborate inside the organization, you're falling behind. So this idea that everybody now needs to really show the results of productivity, do more with less, whether it's the operating expenses and the leverage there, or even your capital efficiency. So that's what, in some sense, is, I would say, with all the macroeconomic headwinds, which I think all of us face, none of us are immune, the tailwind, at least we as a company have, is our ability to deliver these solutions. Software is ultimately the biggest deflationary force businesses can use to tame all of the forces that are there for our own inflation. Well, that's something that I kind of want to touch on as well. Is Microsoft itself having to make adjustments? And then what kind of opportunities do you see in the current economic climate? Yeah, the opportunity I see is for us to be able to take that entire stack, whether it's cloud infrastructure or the cloud-native databases, and application development, or something like power platform, right? I mean, that's a great example of how you can involve everyone inside your workforce to help with automation and drive productivity up. And of course, everything that we're doing with Microsoft 365 and Teams, in helping customers just really deal with what does productivity and collaboration look like in a hybrid work environment? So we are definitely seeing tailwind there, we are seeing share gains there, we feel very, very optimistic about our own ability to deliver value to customers and do well in the marketplace. But I think at the end of the day, even by the way, that also applies to Microsoft, we are applying it ourselves inside, right? How can we be more efficient in whether it's in our people operations or in our R&D or whether it's in our finance and our supply chain? So I think you will see us use in some sense, take our own solutions and deploy them as efficiently as possible to drive productivity and leverage in operating expense and capital efficiency. Capital efficiency is another one, one of the things that I'm seeing a lot of businesses.",https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1iVTbuGfqnQ,33,2022-10-18 16:16:19
3547," employ them as efficiently as possible to drive productivity and leverage in operating expense and capital efficiency. Capital efficiency is another one, one of the things that I'm seeing a lot of businesses. I mean, to take the energy crisis that we have in particularly more stick, acute in Europe right now. Multiple things, right? If you move to the cloud by definition, you have the most efficient use of the scarce energy resource. Second, let's take a manufacturing plant. If you create a digital twin of a manufacturing plant, one of the benefits is, you can make it more power efficient, right? Because you can do the simulation to do the power draw that's most efficient. In fact, you can reduce waste as well. So overall, things of that nature, I think, are going to drive up productivity. I want to talk about kind of the idea that we're moving towards a hybrid work environment. I know that's something that Microsoft has talked about. You mentioned it earlier. You know, what are you seeing there as far as customers moving to a hybrid work environment? Are they continuing to do so? And will that stick around? Yeah, in fact, we just released some data, you know, called the Work Trends Index, which is sort of survey data. That's got good cross-section of customers, geographies, industries. And there are three points down, I would say, that sort of stand out, right? The first one is what we call the productivity paranoia. Basically, 85% plus workers or the members of the workforce think that they're being productive. 85% plus percent of the managers think that there's more to be desired on productivity. So there's that paradox. And I think the best way to bridge that paradox is not to have more dogma, but more data. Things like Viva Pulse can help everyone get to the same data. And more importantly, something like Viva Goals, an OKR system can help everyone align, right? So instead of this being some kind of an argument, let the data really help us move forward. The second one is people come for other people, right? People don't come to work or any place because of policy. They come because of the connection they want to have with other people. So that me, I say that we all have to learn new soft skills as even leaders to facilitate those moments where people can come. And of course, even tools like Viva Connections and so on can help. And then the last thing is just because you had an offer and you recruited somebody doesn't mean you don't need to re-recruit. And so this is where again, everything about what you as a leader can do to re-recruit employees, help them with even their own career progress, right? One of the things that we are seeing is, you know, skilling. I want to be able to come in. I want to be able to make progress in my profession. And so anything that we can do to help show that we are re-recrooting them and then energizing them, I think is all going to be very, very helpful. And so a lot of what we have done in particular with Microsoft 365 Teams and a new product suite called Viva are all focused on that. But at the end of the day, these are tools. What is required is a little more enlightened management and leadership and skills that all of us have to learn. You You You",https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1iVTbuGfqnQ,34,2022-10-18 16:20:52

We have a clear set of goals. In fact, compensation even at the highest level, including mine, are triggered by us hitting these goals. So overall, I feel that we have the right process, but a lot of progress that needs to be made. And one of the things that we're also focused on is not just about bringing people in. It's also about the inclusion, right? The culture of inclusion is an everyday exercise, right? It doesn't matter what happened yesterday, but what is the lived experience of every individual, right? Aggregate data sometimes, you know, it doesn't really represent the lived experience for any individual. And so that's continuous process. You can never claim anything. All you can at least do is to have a culture that allows every leader, every manager and every employee to have both the confidence as well as the introspection capabilities to say, let's just push and make sure the diversity and inclusion are key priorities for us. And I just wanted to ask one last question. As far as Microsoft and the cloud, it's clearly one of the leaders in the industry. How is that kind of helping with all of these various objectives, whether it's ensuring employees feel like they're wanted, eliminating that productivity paranoia, and then helping to help companies deal with the current economic climate? Yeah, I mean to me, you know.",https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1iVTbuGfqnQ,35,2022-10-18 16:25:19
3549," eliminating that productivity paranoia and then helping to help companies deal with the current economic climate. Yeah, I mean to me, you know, the idea that digital technology is got transformative capabilities, I think are very clear. Everybody recognizes the digital, even in this macroeconomic headwind, no one's sort of looking at their IT budget or digital budget is the first place to go to cut because they realize that coming out of this constrained economic environment, they'll be stronger if they use technology to drive productivity. So very specifically to your point, people are looking to say, are my on the right cost curve? That's where something like cloud infrastructure is massive, right? Because of Afroly, you only pay for what you consume. I mean, they cannot be about more capital efficient way to do run things than the cloud economics. The other way is if you're not building cloud native applications, I mean, just to put it in perspective, right? If you are just doing application development like you did even three years ago, four years ago, and I'm not using some of the things like the container technology or some of the stuff like our Cosmos DB, it's like 100x different in terms of efficiency. Or using tools like teams and we were to drive hybrid work because Afroly, that's a reality be all phase. So I think in each layer of this technology, you want to make sure that you are on the right cost curve and you're using the best tools to drive productivity and your ability to do more with less. So that's what's exciting for us. We know that this is a great time, but frankly, to be having all of these conversations with customers and also making sure and that we're delivering for them. All right, Microsoft CEO Satinadella, thank you for joining us. Absolutely, we can anticipate a period of economic softness here. And I do think the definition of recession sort of ebbs and flows, but let's just say for the record, a period of economic softening is what we anticipate for 2023. But I think that you mentioned valuation, and that's really, really important because if you think about this particular bear market, it kind of is in two phases. The first phase is very much evaluation driven experience. And interestingly, you even mentioned like the NASDAQ and then the S&P. The NASDAQ is the growthiest index. The S&P is also a pretty growthy index and they're very sensitive to changes and interest rates. We know the market is a discounting mechanism and when you have a higher discount rate, you have a lower present value. So the growthiest NASDAQ.",https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1iVTbuGfqnQ,36,2022-10-18 16:29:35
3550," And they're very sensitive to changes and interest rates. We know the market is a discounting mechanism. And when you have a higher discount rate, you have a lower present value. So the growthiest NASDAQ was hit the hardest. The S&P's been hit pretty hard too. And valuation contraction has been more than 100% of the market downturn this year. Earnings have been up. So all of what we've seen this year has been a contraction and valuations. That's phase one. The second phase is related to your question about a recession. And that is what's going to happen to the E of the price to earnings, the earnings. And we think earnings are probably going to be soft in 2023. We have an estimate far below what Wall Street analysts have right now. We think they're just a little bit too optimistic on the go-forward view given the fact that we are entering a soft period. And Katie, what is your estimate on earnings? And why do you think Wall Street is a little bit too optimistic at this point? So I mean, we've seen corporations, the US large corporations, be incredibly resilient and the face of an incredible amount of headwinds. We've had higher rates, we've had pandemics, we've had problems in getting workers back to work. Despite that fact, we have had pretty good earnings. And I think everyone was sort of waiting with baited breath for the shoot to drop in the second quarter. And it didn't. We had a good second quarter. Estimates have come down to the third quarter, but the third quarter might shape up to be pretty decent too. So I think Wall Street analysts are just building off those kinds of estimates, but for us, with the softer growth outlook in 2023 and the fact that the S&P 500 has about 40% of their revenues tied to overseas growth. We just think those headwinds are pretty strong and we come in sort of around $228 for S&P earnings for next year. And you mentioned that statistic there, 40% of revenue coming from overseas. That of course brings up the strong dollar, the risk of the challenge that that poses for companies here. How are you assessing that risk and I guess how long do you see that risk lasting here? Because it doesn't seem like anything is going to take some of that strength out of the dollar anytime soon. Well, you're right to bring up the dollar as they say our currency, your problem. And it has been a significant problem for US corporations overseas. And also for the translation of non-US investments back to US dollar terms for our investors and for our clients, you know, develop markets. XUS have outperformed the US on local currency terms, but when you translate it back to the dollar, it's been a huge headwind. So what could stop the dollar? Well, what propelled the dollar has been a very aggressive Fed coming out first and very aggressively with this rate hike path that has been extremely front-end loaded to face inflationary pressures. We think we're closer to the end of the policy tightening. We'll probably see the last rate hike in early 2023. And we also see inflation coming off the boil. Those two things should help to stabilize the dollar. So we don't anticipate we're going to see the kind of strength that has created these headwinds in 2023. You mentioned inflation coming off the boil to put it in your terms. Do you think we have seen inflation peak? So inflation has so many dimensions and many of them, particularly the ones that were really pressured because of COVID, have been abating. Supply chain constraints have come off. We see prices coming down and use cars. I mean, we're all talking about use cars these days. It's a pretty important price barometer. So we see inventories that prices down and some of the things that have been really impacted by COVID. So generally speaking, we do see inflation coming down. We saw an empire state manufacturing survey this morning that had some interesting insight on prices coming down where we are still concerned though is in wages. And also, frankly, in owners equivalent rent, these two pieces of inflation are sticky. Owners equivalent rent, we can all see that prices have stabilized and have come down. But it takes a while to get that through the inflation pipeline. So we're not going to see the benefits of that until well into 2023. And wages have stabilized, but at a high level. So we do see lots of inflation elements coming down. And we are watching really closely what happens to wages because that's going to really dictate what happens to CPI and Core CPI and Core PCE in 2023. Yeah, the last jobs print that we got in inflation or excuse me, wages were moving to the upside. Unemployment rate actually went down. So even though we did see a little bit of cooling in that headline number, those.",https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1iVTbuGfqnQ,37,2022-10-18 16:34:15
3551," We got inflation or excuse me, wages were moving to the upside. Unemployment rate actually went down. So even though we did see a little bit of cooling in that headline number, those two factors were really something that a hawkish Fed obviously would keep a very close eye on. What's your assessment just of the jobs market and how substantially we need to see maybe some of that growth begin to cool in order to get inflation under control? You're absolutely right. It's economics 101. We have more demand for labor than we have supply and it's really shocking actually to look at the numbers. When you look at the Joltz data at over 10 million job openings and then you look at the number of unemployed people in the US that are on 7 and a half million, there's just a mismatch. So yes, the ultimate soft landing would be slowing demand enough that the brunt of that is felt on the opening side. So companies just freeze hiring versus actually increasing unemployment. That's a pretty tough needle to thread. It's, yeah, certainly is a very tough needle to thread. Kady, I want to go back to what you said earlier when you were just talking about, you gathered some data I know on the cost of panicking, pulling out, pulling your money out of the market in a volatile time like this. What can you tell us about that and why it's so important to stay invested through on certain times? It's so important always, but more important during volatile times, if you missed just the best 10 days out of the last 10 years. So you're talking 2,500 days. Your return went down by 40%. If you missed 20 of the best days, it went down by 2,3. So there's a really high cost of missing out. And as I said before, we tend to see very strong days of the market during bear markets. And the really tough time for investors. And again, it goes back to market time. It's always difficult, but it's really difficult during these times of high volatility and bear markets. The reason is the best days and the worst days tend to clump together. So you're never going to get it right because you're going to have a terrible day, followed by a great day. So the best advice, the best guidance for investors, especially during times like this, is stay the course, stick with your strategy. Make sure that your equity risk, that your risk assets are aligned to your longer term goal. So you don't have to worry about short-term volatility, but you really need to stick to your strategy or your risk missing out. You know, back in June, we made a pretty bold and decisive decision. We said, all right, inventory is built up. Consumer shopping habits have changed. They moved into different categories. And we said, we're going to get out in front of this. So for Target, we put that inventory problem behind us. And now we can focus on great execution, delighting our guests, getting ready for the big holiday season. So we were pretty decisive and said, we're not going to just let this roll into the next quarter. We'll deal with it up front. And now we're excited.",https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1iVTbuGfqnQ,38,2022-10-18 16:38:27
3552," getting ready for the big holiday season. So we were pretty decisive and said, we're not going to just let this roll into the next quarter. We'll deal with it upfront. And now we're excited that we're ready to play for the holiday season. I've followed your entire time as CEO as Target. You've made a bunch of bold decisions. You exited Canada. First thing you did, I remember writing on that story as soon as it out. You 2017 investor conference. We're investing billions of dollars. Markets didn't like it. Now you're clearing out inventory. How hard is it to make these decisions as a leader? Well, if I think about each one of those decisions, there was probably a very similar model that we followed. So all right, what's the right thing for the target brand? What's the right thing for the target guest? What's the right thing for our team? And when we think about it through that lens, it's always the right thing for our shareholder long term. So whether it was leaving Canada and putting all of our focus on the US business or making that decision back in 2017, when others were closing stores, we said, we're going to double down on stores and put stores at the center of our strategy. We took the same approach as Summer and said, all right, across all of retail, inventory is a reason. We're going to get out in front of this and make sure that we have the right assortment. We deliver great value. We protect that guest experience in our stores. And we also did the right thing for our team. Thank you mentioned. This is your ninth holiday season as CEO of Target. How do you think this season will shape up compared to those other eight or nine? Well, Brian, you know we spend a lot of time talking to consumers, talking to our guests. And the one thing we've heard throughout this year is they want to enjoy and celebrate seasonal moments. So the guests this hold us, they're excited about Halloween. Still a few days away. They're looking forward to Thanksgiving and celebrating with family and friends. And they are looking forward to the Christmas holidays. So we know the consumer in America, the guest at shops target, they are excited about seasonal holidays. And we're going to be ready to make sure we delight them. Recession? Anything, any indications you see? Store traffic, what they're buying, anything that would suggest this could be a gloomy holiday season. Well, everyone's talking about recession. And you know, sitting here today, there's different points of view. You talk to bank CEOs, some gloom and doom. Others are saying really healthy consumer. What we've seen all year long is really healthy traffic. And a guest that's shopping in our stores and shopping online so that strength and traffic has been driving our business. We've delivered solid comps throughout this year. We expect that to continue over the balance of the holiday season. All right, that is good to hear. So back to my shopping list here, if you can, you can just indulge in. Let's do it. 42 count of tide pods online, $13. Now, I'm a dumb millennial. I don't keep track of things that I buy in terms of price. But to me, that seems like a lot. Our shoppers to your stores trading down. That seems like a lot of money for basic essential. Yeah. So, Brent, you know core to our proposition is making sure we deliver great value and affordability every time you shop. So, we measure pricing really carefully versus our competition. And we want to make sure we're priced right daily. We deliver great value and affordability. So, on those items that you're looking at, we've got to make sure we have the right price every time you shop. And the guests expect that from Target. How is private label business doing in the S&R? It's been burning up. So, we now have a $30 billion own brand business. $30 billion. And it's performed incredibly well throughout the pandemic and continues to grow. So whether you're shopping, good and gather, or getting something for yourself, you know, good fellow that you can wear on set, or shopping any of our great brands, we now have $11 billion own brands in our portfolio. So that business just continues to perform. We'll perform over the holiday season. Huge, Brian. So yesterday, I was actually in Bayshore Target. All right. Well, every weekend, Bayshore Target, shout out, Bayshore Target. 15 registers open. Two of them were self checkout, but 15 registers total. 11 and more closed. Is that the worker shortage? Brian, we've been staffed throughout the pandemic. We have 400,000 team members across the country. And going back to 2017, you remember we made a big commitment back then to invest in our team. We said in 2017, we were going to get to a starting minimum wage of $15. Now, sitting here today, we made another big investment just a few months ago to say, all right, depending on the market, we're going to start at either 50.",https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1iVTbuGfqnQ,39,2022-10-18 16:42:59
3553," minimum wage of $15. Now, sitting here today, we made another big investment just a few months ago to say, all right, depending on the market, we're going to start at either 15, but it could be as much as $24 an hour to make sure that we have the team in place. We're going to hire another 100,000 seasonal team members for this holiday season. So because of our investment in wages, in benefits, in training, you know that we launched a debt-free educational assistance program last year. We had over 70,000 team members raise their hands and say, I want to take advantage of that. So those investments have allowed us to retain and attract great talent. And we'll continue to make sure our team is our most valuable asset. 100,000 workers, that's a lot. Are you confident you can get that number? We are. We're off to a great start. Interesting. So you spent some time in the grocery industry. Of course, Target is big in selling groceries. And I know you watched a competition. What do you think about this Coralger and Albranson's merger? Does this change the game for the grocery industry and doesn't make you change how you think about your grocery offerings? Well, we'll watch it carefully. Obviously, it's a new announcement. It's going to take some time to close. But we're going to continue to focus on our food and beverage business. I mean, we've seen really strong growth and market share gains for over 20 consecutive quarters. So the strength of that business has really connected with the guests during the pandemic and has come out of the pandemic. It's really a strong driver of growth. So we're all in on the food and beverage business. We'll continue to invest. We've had a couple of great own brands there. We've been good and gathered as a $2 billion brand for us now in food and beverage. The guest has really responded all to a brand called Favorite Day. So we feel really good about food and beverage driving traffic and complementing our multi-category portfolio. I think I've seen wine at a Target too. These are big departments. They are. They're really important. And it's important for our guests. So we always listen to the guest. And they've told us food and beverage is an important category for them. It drives traffic. But I also know when they're there. They're shopping beauty. They're shopping in a peril. They're getting something for their home. So it compliments our business really nicely. Beauty's been an important category for years now. And all to just compliments our beauty offering. And it was one of the things that our guest told us. We said, all right, what brand would you like to see here? On the top of their list, they said, we love Starbucks. We love the fact you've got Disney stores. They'll take away my Apple stores. But they love the fact that we've added ultra beauty. So those partnerships, whether it's CVS and pharmacy and Starbucks in almost every store, more Apple shops, more Disney shops, and now Ulta, it just compliments the great offering we have of national brands and home brands. You just signed on for another. I think the press release said.",https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1iVTbuGfqnQ,40,2022-10-18 16:47:01
3554," Apple shops, more Disney shops, and now Ulta, it just compliments the great offering we have of national brands and home brands. You just signed on for another, I think the press release said about three years. So let's just say three years. What is the next three years in Brian Cornell's look like, life look like in terms of charm and sea of tiredness? Yeah. I think it's going to be another chapter of growth for our company and continuing to invest in remodeling stores and building new stores and great locations like Bayshore, developing our own brands, accelerating our national brand partnerships, and making sure that we continue to invest in our team. And there's lots of things I'm proud of. In fact, that we added $30 billion of growth since the start of the pandemic is something that our team feels really good about. What I feel to me, most, what really fires me up, is the investments that we've made in our team. And seeing the diversity in our organization, seeing the growth opportunities, seeing our culture come to life. When I talk about culture, we always talk about a culture of care and growth and winning together. That's something that I'm going to continue to focus on for years to come. Brian, I've only known you to be a fired up guy. You're fired up right now talking about the target's business in its future. Where does that come from on a personal level? Well, you know, for me, this is an amazing brand. And I've got to tell you, Brian, I wake up every day feeling the responsibility of leading the target brand. Those 400,000 team members that work for us, those families that depend on us across the country. So I wake up with a huge sense of responsibility. And the pride I have in the team in that brand and the role we play in America is something that gets me up each and every day feeling great about the role that I sit in today. Growing up, did you see yourself as a CEO? Yeah. Well, Brian, I think you know my story. And I grew up right down the road here in Queens as a poor kid who kind of has worked for everything I've had. And I never even imagined I'd be sitting in a chair like this. But I embraced the moment and I just feel proud to work for a great company. I very much, I was just having a moment there. I very much identify with that, Brian, that much is for sure. How do you, how have you balanced it all? This has been a very challenging three years for executives, not just CEOs, CFOs, CEOs. How do you balance this time? And how do you just stay grounded? Yeah. Well, I'll go back to. I work with a great leadership team, the best leadership team I've ever been part of. I have an amazing wife who's been married to me for 40 years now. A great family that supports me. And as you know, I take care of myself. I make sure that I get to the gym every day and call me out of that. Yes, I shouted that out. Full disclosure, when Brian, that news hit the really hit the wires that you were staying for three years. I said, look, Brian's a fit guy. He can stay on for another 15 years. How do you, how do you think about succession? At some point, you will not be the CEO of Target. You know, shareholders, I'm sure, won't like it. But is that one of your most important jobs right now outside of planning for holidays? Yeah. I think for any CEO, succession has to be something you focus on every day. Not just for my role, but for my leadership team and the officers and those key roles throughout the company. So we spend a tremendous amount of time. I have a fabulous HR partner, Melissa Kramer. And we spend time every week talking about talent. Last week, I was traveling. I was in Washington, DC. I had a group of 28 black target officers that were with us in DC. We visited stores together. We spent time with outside speakers. And I'm always investing in talent and making sure I get to know the team. I spent time with them. We traveled together. But as a CEO of a company like ours, $106 billion growth company, you've kind of constantly be focusing on talent development. And thinking about who are the future leaders that are going to guide this company whenever that day comes. And I'm not here fair enough. Let's just before we let you go, we're running short on time here. Let's just go back to the economy real quick because we are up against the holiday shopping season. So you see nowhere session. You think consumers will spend this season like they spent last season? I think it's just a very unusual time from an economic standpoint. And we're coming out of a pandemic. There were lots of stimulus checks that have been written, lots of child care support. We're starting to see a consumer get back to normal life. They want to travel again. They're out in restaurants. So.",https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1iVTbuGfqnQ,41,2022-10-18 16:51:28
3555," Effects that have been written, lots of child care support. We're starting to see a consumer get back to normal life. They want to travel again, they're out in restaurants. So sitting here today, we're on one side. We've got inflation that's at a 40-year high, but unemployment, incredibly low. And I think those two things are balancing out right now. So we continue to see a healthy guest shopping in our stores and shopping online. We'll see how they react throughout the holiday season. But when we talk to them, they continue to say they want to celebrate the holidays. And we know they're out on the streets of New York. They're in restaurants. They're in our stores. So right now, we're seeing a stable environment. Do you worry about, and I'm sure in the green we heard, Hilton CEO, Chris Nacetta just talked to us about what the Fed may do to the economy. Do you fear the Fed and what they're doing? Well, we've got to watch it carefully. But in our business, Brian, we've got to be agile. We've got to prepare for any environment. It's part of the strength of our multi-category portfolio. We sell food and beverage products and household essentials. We have all your beauty needs. We have toys for kids and apparel and home items. So we'll balance our portfolio to make sure we're meeting the needs of the consumer no matter what the environment looks like. Everyone's talking about the last CPI report. The Fed is a global economy, and it's a large number. So you understand, from the Fed standpoint, they have to tackle inflation. They have a blunt instrument. They have a blunt instrument, which is interest rate policy at this point. They're trying to increase rates. They're trying to increase rates to slow demand down, just take demand out of the economy. They really cannot affect the supply side of the equation. The problem that we have, or the issue that people are debating now, is the Fed started raising rates earlier this year. We've gone through quite a few interest rate rises already, and the economy has not slowed down from an inflationary standpoint. That said, we all know that this monetary policy takes time to feed itself through the economy. Unfortunately, it hits consumers almost immediately. So if you've got an adjustable rate mortgage, it adjusts the next day. If you've got credit card debt that adjusts it adjusts the next day. But the real policy affects on slowing down demand, that takes months, and almost a year to a year and a half, to feed through the economy. So there's this discussion going on, has the Fed done enough in interest rates to slow down the economy. And we don't know because the effects are still being felt of the first rate increases. Or they not done enough because...",https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1iVTbuGfqnQ,42,2022-10-18 16:55:44
3556," They had done enough in interest rates to slow down the economy, and we don't know because the effects are still being felt of the first rate increases, or they not done enough because we continue to see inflation move higher and higher. So I think the Fed isn't a very difficult position. They were late to the game. They started raising rates late, which means they're now playing catch-up. I think we all believe that they will raise rates two more times this year at the two more meetings. Probably at least 75 basis points in the November meeting. And probably another 50 to 75 basis points at the end of the year. So we will have gone from basically zero Fed fund rates in the United States to well over 4% rates in the course of a year. That's a fairly dramatic move. And we need to understand what impacts that's going to have longer term to the economy. And what impacts do you think it could potentially have longer term? And are we going to be able to do this without going into a recession? Well, the question is what are the impacts? And as I said, the Fed can try and affect demand, the demand side of the equation. They can make borrowing money more expensive. They can make homes more expensive. They can try and slow consumers down because things are harder to buy because they don't want to finance them. They can't affect the supply side of the equation. And right now when you look at the data and you look at what's going on in the inflationary front, a lot of the inflation comes from commodities and commodity inputs. So by raising interest rates, we don't create more oil. We don't create more food. So we're trying to create a balance of oil. We're trying to create a balance of food. We're trying to create a balance of workers back into the labor force. I think one of the big underlying components of inflation is wage price inflation. We keep seeing 5% plus wage inflation. Wages filter through everything we do. As the economy has shifted during COVID to where we're buying lots of goods because we really couldn't leave our houses. So we're buying things. We're having them sent to our houses and we were consuming goods. We're now back into a more normalized economic cycle. In a normalized economic cycle, we as Americans, we're good consumers of services. We like to go out. We like to be entertained. We like to travel. We like to go to events. The service economy is all labor. When you go out to a service event, you're really buying mostly labor. So when you go to a concert or you go to a restaurant or you go to a bar, you're buying some inputs, some commodities, but you're buying an awful lot of labor. That labor cost has not come down. And it's another area where the Fed is trying to get some response. They're trying to get businesses to not grow as fast. They're trying to get people to businesses to not hire as many people. But we saw even in the last month's unemployment report, we saw 3.5% unemployment. We still see non-farm payrolls growing. So the interest rate impact has not fed through to the business cycle yet. We're going to have to see job destruction if we're really going to see inflation be curtailed. And I think that's hard because we've gone through a lot of fundamental changes in this country. Prior to COVID, we were all talking about the aging American workforce. Guess what? We're still an aging American workforce. We didn't stop aging during COVID. Unfortunately, during COVID, we lost about 2 million people from the labor force. Either through long COVID or unfortunately they passed away, which is a horrible event. But we've got to recognize we've lost people from the labor force. And then we had a bunch of people sort of late in their work cycle who decided to leave the labor force. So we've now have a smaller labor force population in the United States. So businesses to attract workers into the labor force are having to pay more to get workers into the cycle, which is inflationary. Wages go up. They pass those increased wages onto the consumers. And we're in this inflationary cycle. So the feds are going to continue to keep raising rates to try and break this cycle. They won't know they have broken it till long after it's broken. So what does this mean then for the equity markets? Because here we stand today, the S&P off more than 20% in your to date. And Nasdaq down more than 30% in your to date. When you try to gauge that downside risk here for equities, what does that look like? So again, the famous ad is don't fight the fed. It's been true for this cycle. It was true for last cycle. When we had a zero interest rate policy, you'll you wanted to own risky assets. When you've got the fed increasing interest.",https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1iVTbuGfqnQ,43,2022-10-18 17:00:15
3557," Fed. Yeah. You know, it's been true for this cycle. It was true for last cycle when we had a zero interest rate policy. You'll, you wanted to own risky assets. When you've got the Fed increasing interest rates and the alternative, you know, the risk-free rate, the rate of return it now, sort of 4% for short duration treasury bills. You know, that's an attractive rate of return for short-term treasury bills. And really what's what's happening more than anything is the equity market is trying to figure out what are the future earnings of a company. So remember the value of a stock is the the present value of future earnings. So if a company has higher input cost and it has higher labor costs and hopefully if the Fed is successful, lowered demand for their goods or services, what is the forward earnings of a company look like? Then I could put a multiple on that. And right now the market is trying to determine what forward earnings are going to look like and what multiple that should trade at. And as long as the Fed is continuously raising rates, trying to slow down the economy, trying to make things more expensive, trying to make labor more expensive, the market is going to continue to try and find a clearing price for that. We again, it's it's like everything else in this world. We won't know we've met that clearing price till long after the bottom is here. We may have met it already. A lot of people think we have not got to that clearing price. But you know, the market right now is trying to figure out what future earnings look like and what multiple we should put on that. In this episode of influencers, Gregory Zuckerman, author of a shot to save the world. I think we're too close to this miraculous development of these vaccines to appreciate it normally of it. I really do think it's modern science is greatest achievement. I believe that this pandemic is going to end, but this virus is not going away. It's going to end that. It's going to kind of melt into the background, but we're always going to have things dropping up. I write the same story all over it. Over and over. I write about overlooked, underappreciated individuals, achieving something that the experts told them they couldn't do. Hello, everyone, and welcome to influencers. I'm Andy Surtwer. And welcome to our guests, Gregory Zuckerman, award-winning journalist, special writer at the Wall Street Journal, an author of the new book, A Shot to Save the World, the Inside Story of the Life or Death Race for a COVID-19 vaccine. Greg, nice to see you. Great to see you, Andy. So congratulations on the book. A lot to talk about. You've noted that you wanted to focus on the triumphs of the triumphs, I guess you should say, of the development of the vaccine. And one thing you talked about was a lucky break that occurred with regard to MRNA research, which occurred a couple years before the pandemic, which probably allowed for the rapid development of the vaccine. What would the world look like if the pandemic had arrived five years earlier? Do you think we'd still be waiting for a vaccine? It's a great question. So I think we're too close to this miraculous development of these vaccines to appreciate the enormity of it. I really do think it's modern science's greatest achievement. And to your point, the technology was not ready a few years ago. So we need to be grateful that the pandemic, that this virus emerged at a time when the scientists I write about in my book thought they had an approach that would work. They weren't sure we're talking the end of 2019 very early part of 2020. And they turned around and they created these really effective protective vaccines. But again, a few years earlier, I don't think we would have been nearly as lucky. But there's a few different types of science that have been applied to the different vaccines. You want to just go through them and sort of lay person's term, which I know is your specialty. Sure. So MRNA, we are familiar with that with that approach, that vaccine approach, because that created the Moderna as well as the Pfizer vaccines. MRNA is short for messenger RNA, which is just a molecule we have inside of us. It transports instructions from the DNA to the part of the cell where proteins are created that we live on, and it depends on every day. And it was always this sort of dream of scientists.",https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1iVTbuGfqnQ,44,2022-10-18 17:04:26
3558," of us, it transports instructions from the DNA to the part of the cell where proteins are created that we live on, it depends on every day, and it was always the sort of dream of scientists to create mRNA in the lab. Well, if it's so important in the body, maybe we could create a synthetic version, just like there's, you know, sugar, natural sugar, and synthetic version of sugar. So the idea was, well, if we could create mRNA in the lab, we could tell our bodies to create any protein. And that was the idea. That's the just of the mRNA approach. We is a vaccine. It sends a message and a message obviously in this case is an instruction for the body, the immune system to create the protein, the protein in this case is despite protein. So like any other vaccine, it's an education for the body. And the other approach I write about the adenovirus approach that led to the J and J, as well as the AstraZeneca vaccines. That's a really interesting one. Two, that one also took years in making and I write about how that began really with HIV, effort to solve HIV. We haven't figured that one out yet, but they shifted these scientists and said, okay, we can't do HIV, but we're going to get a vaccine for COVID. Yeah, Dan Baroque, one of the scientists working on that later endeavor I spoke to has been, and you're right, I've been working on that for a very long time, but switching back to mRNA, you do focus a lot on Moderna, which could have been one of the biggest losers in the race for the vaccine and being a big winner. How much credit should the Moderna CEO get here? It sounds like, you know, his background as a salesman was sort of key in bringing this all together. Yeah, he's a fascinating character. For years, people whispered about him. They suspected he was exaggerating more donors, ability to create either vaccines or drugs. There wasn't much proof. They were very secretive kind of firm. He was very hard on his employees. You could read about it in a book. People were collapsing in the office, outside the office at home, hitting their heads, being rushed to the emergency rooms, he was firing people left and right. Very difficult. And yet, inspirational too, in hard driving. And he had a vision. His vision was that mRNA was going to save lives. And he felt he needed to push his people hard. He's a little bit of a Steve Jobs kind of character in that regard. And he said, guys, one day we're going to be the ones to step up in a crisis. And he was right. And maybe it takes some money like that. And like you said, he's a great salesman. And he raised billions and billions for Moderna over the years without any proof of concept. And people were jealous. There were a lot of envy in the industry. But turns out that that money was what was fed to people made a lot of money investing in Moderna. Yeah. And I heard, you know, whispers in Boston in that biotech community about him for a while, just what you're sort of saying, Greg. And even while they were sort of getting up to speed, that, you know, I mean, maybe Charlotton is too strong a word, but there were serious doubters. Do you think those people, you know, are sort of eating crow right now? So Andy, in my book, I, people compared him to Elizabeth Holmes. They said, just like Sarah knows, there's nothing there to this company, Moderna. And, you know, you can understand it to some extent. They didn't have any proof. They'd spent years working on drugs. And now right in the book, they gave up on making mRNA work for drug. They had to pivot to vaccines because it wasn't working with drugs. And vaccines is not a really popular area for a lot of pharmaceutical companies. So are they eating crow? Yes. But, you know, there is some reason why they were skeptical all those years. But in the end, they were wrong. Right. Operation works. Where do you come out on that? I mean, this was a Trump administration program. Controversial. There are some, let's just say colorful people steering it. But was it effective, Greg? So like most every other topic in society today, it's sort of black and white against you. Either Operation Warp Speed saves everything and we have to give Donald Trump all the credit or it was useless. I come down somewhere in the middle, meaning that Operation Warp Speed was very helpful. There were a lot, there's a lot of money that it was given to these companies. Resources to, I'm a little parks that were necessary from all over the country that were brought to the necessary spots on bioperape, should warp speed employees. But you also have to remember that warp speed made it early bet on a different vaccine, the AstraZeneca vaccine. It did not give money to my journal early on when it was desperate for money. And Moderna has recently as made.",https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1iVTbuGfqnQ,45,2022-10-18 17:08:56
3559," made an early bet on a different vaccine, the AstraZeneca vaccine. It did not give money to my return early on. When it was desperate for money, and Moderna, as recently as May 2020, was running out of money and couldn't get money from the government, could get money from private industry, from public, from foundations, from Merck, they went to Merck, and they were almost unable to create these vaccines. Were you one more reason to be grateful for what happened? So Operation Warper Speed was very helpful in the end, Moderna did get a lot of money from Operation War Speed, others did too. But you don't want to save all due to Warp Speed and the success of these remarkable vaccines. There is the perspective case where the government's going to suggest that everyone gets every person in America gets a booster. So, Moderna is going to be a good one. And I think that is coming. And also, down the road, I believe that this pandemic is going to end, but this virus is not going away. It's going to be endemic. It's going to melt into the background, but we're always going to have things cropping up. Areas that aren't vaccinating, we're going to have issues. It's going to morph, and we've got more strains. I'm not saying this to people for people to be too concerned. I do think Pfizer, Moderna, and the other companies can adjust their vaccines. So, you'll go in, and there'll be second and third generation vaccines. You'll go into a doctor's office and get a COVID vaccine, but it'll be in all-in-one, maybe with a flu vaccine. Maybe they'll throw something else in there too. So, I don't want people to be too discouraged, but the vaccine research is that a right about. They're trying to stay ahead of this thing. Yeah, I mean, is that a losing battle? Is it going to be like the flu? Are we going to continue to need new vaccines all the time? I mean, this seems like it's not going to just...",https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1iVTbuGfqnQ,46,2022-10-18 17:13:20
3560," Is it going to be like the flu? Are we going to continue to need new vaccines all the time? I mean, this seems like it's not going to just end as you suggest. Yeah, it won't. Right. It won't. But I wouldn't call it a losing battle. I think we'll stay ahead of it. And these vaccines are so much more effective than the flu vaccine. So if you've got protection of 7 to 80% and it's even high of our hospitalization and death, it will allow us to return to some to a normal say, really. In society. You hear that other countries vaccines are not as effective, you know, like the Chinese vaccine. I don't know where the Russian vaccine stands. I heard there was one in Cuba that was not not effective at all. Like, why is that? Well, they use different approaches. So I write in the book a little bit of the Russian approach is a variation on the one that you mentioned with Dan Baruch and the J&J one. It's not quite as good. And frankly, we just don't have as much data that's reliable. It doesn't help that Putin himself didn't take the vaccine from months and months. He wouldn't take it. So, listen, if that was the only vaccine in the world either the Russian one or the Chinese one, I think we would all embrace it and take. And it's largely effective, but just not as effective. MRNA as revolutionary as it is, it just is so much better than these other vaccines. How come Merck and Santa Fe and other companies that are known as leaders in this space were not at the fore? That's a great question. And frankly, when I started researching this book, I kind of expected the vaccine giants to be the ones to save us. I mean, Merck is the one that created the MMR vaccine that we're all familiar with. The Mums, Meezels, or Bella, they're a vaccine giant. So as Santa Fe is you say, GSK, and yet they started to drag their feet. I write about some internal rift within Merck about whether to pursue a vaccine for COVID-19 or not. GSK and Santa Fe teamed up, but their approach isn't quite very yet. I would argue that vaccines until this past year are not a really sexy area for big pharmaceutical companies. You get one every few years or once a year, once a lifetime maybe, so much you can charge for a vaccine. And as a result, I think the big pharmaceutical companies had mixed feelings about chasing after a vaccine for COVID-19. MR. There's no money there. GSK there is, as we're seeing now this past year, but at the time it wasn't clear. And listen, you put all this work into it. They've done this. Merck has chased vaccines in the past for things like Zeke and such that have dissipated, gone away and they wasted tons of money, resources, et cetera, opportunity cost was it was high. So if you're going to chase after a vaccine and when you don't even know if there's going to be a need for it by the time you develop it, it's a risky business proposition. Right. Moderna just recently announced an agreement with Gaby, which the vaccine alliance to ship more vaccine doses to areas around the world that are still behind in 2022. Is this too little too late? MR. I think it's popular to criticize Moderna. You see how much money they're making. There are always these suspicions about them. I think the back of people's minds, they remember that, that those questions and they're eager to criticize Moderna. I'm not here necessarily to defend them, but I do have to note that they didn't have a part unlike Beontek, which works with Pfizer, but you're to confine a part, they're to turn them down. So they had to do it all themselves and they've been taxed. They've been going to the limit. I know the people internally, they believe that they wish they had been able to produce more, but their vaccine supplies were scooped up by the West. They paid the most and they got there early. And now they're trying to help elsewhere. Is it too little to lay? I would say it's slow and happening, but I also understand what's going on internally with a Moderna. It's just destroyed physically, psychologically, it's been a really difficult year, even though they've made a lot of money. By the way, you just saw a little mystery in my brain, Greg. Beyond tech, that's how you pronounce it? You know, there are different ways of pronouncing it, even internally to pronounce it differently. Yes, that's why I pronounce it beyond tech, you can't go wrong that way. It's like Tesla and Tesla. We ask the people there how to pronounce it, they said either. Really, that's funny. I didn't know that. So what about mRNA research? What do you think the next breakthrough is going to come from there and how will this change the development of future vaccines? So there's a lot of excitement now about what mRNA can do besides COVID-19. Ugr Sahin and Beyond tech have been working on cancer vaccines for many years.",https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1iVTbuGfqnQ,47,2022-10-18 17:17:40
3561," teen, um, Uger Sahin and Beyond Tech have been working on cancer vaccines for many years. They're very excited to take the billions they're making right now and shift and focus on other pathogens, ailments, um, oh, and so it's Moderna. So we're talking about everything from Lupus and MS, turning off the immune system just like we've been able to turn on the immune system perhaps for autoimmune kind of issues. Um, malaria, some people are going after, um, Dan Brook, as you mentioned, AIDS, um, so some of these same vaccine, um, specialists, uh, revolutionary, pioneering, um, researchers that I write about in my book are shifting to all kinds of new challenges. Now, I want to caution just a little bit because until his past year, MRNA has proved pretty disappointing when it comes to drugs and there are some vaccines coming up and believe for things like, um, RSV and CMV, some viruses that are very lethal and harmful for some people. But I want to have a little bit of caution in terms of revolutionizing the world. But I'm excited about the future. Um, I want to ask you about vaccine hesitancy as someone who intricately knows how these vaccines can be. What do you make of these continued conspiracy theories around them and how much are they hurting, uh, efforts to get everyone vaccinated? So, Andy, I speak to a lot of vaccine hesitant audiences and, um, I enjoy doing so. There's always, um, a split. There are some people who are reasonable and cautious, um, and for good reasons, they're, they're wary. Um, I get it. Um, these vaccines were developed in 330 days from the time the sequence was revealed until they were authorized and historically that's just remarkable. I mean, um, the average vaccine took 10 years until last year and the fastest was four years. So here we are coming in three hundred and three days. So I understand the, the weariness and MRNA has never been proved effective. Um, that said, one of the reasons I wrote my book is to show that it was years of research. It wasn't done quickly. They didn't cut corners in any way. Um, what we've been able to do, and partly thanks to warp speed was we were doing things simultaneously. We were developing, testing and manufacturing the vaccine. That's never been done before. Why would he spend billions of dollars to manufacture vaccine? It's not even authorized or approved yet. No one ever did it historically. So those are the kind of reasons why I think some people were hesitant. And I think they should be reassured by the fact that the work corners caught. And this process, this research, these vaccine approaches took years. And that's partly why I wrote the book. Now in terms of conspiracy people, conspiracists, you're not going to make much headway there sadly.",https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1iVTbuGfqnQ,48,2022-10-18 17:21:50
3562," you you you you you you you've been skeptical understanding break of the you've been skeptical of the so-called lab leak theory when it comes to Wuhan and China and the origins of covid-19 the idea that it came from the Wuhan lab but the pandemic's origin has been really difficult to pin down definitively how much have you focused on that question in your reporting and you think we'll ever have a clear answer there so I am skeptical of the lab leak I'm a even more skeptical that China created this vaccine and my reporting is based on talking to top of the doctors structural colleges etc. around the world and the view is that it's a little bit like HIV HIV for years they were suspicion about that as well people accused use CIA, you have government, you have US Army, KGB of creating this virus because there was no natural host, there was no evidence of the animal that had the original virus, and then they found one. It's a year, it's about a decade or so. And likewise, we haven't found the host here, but I think it will be identified. It takes a little bit of time. Those people who say it was created by China, and then they said, well, it won't spread in China, it will only make it spread elsewhere. That seems preposterous. The lab leak is a possibility. I'd say it's a 10% possibility. But if you just remember that animals were encroaching on wild kingdom all the time, cutting down trees, their viruses are jumping all the time from animals we start with SARS, we start with the earlier coronaviruses, MERS, others. So to expect this one to be unusual and surprising and to be a bit leaked, it's possible, but unlikely. I'm an Occamus Razor kind of guy. Right, is the wet market, does that come into play you think, or is that kind of a blind alley? No, I think there's a good possibility that it's spread there. I'm not sure, they're originally there necessarily, but historically that's how the first one spread to the first SARS in China in a wet market is a good chance that that's how it's spread. Right. Right. And in recent weeks, when we talked about the pill a little bit, I just one last follow question on that. And so is that a big breakthrough or not? I think it is. I think it's going to be kind of a one to punch. That's really going to help us get out of this pandemic as long as people continue to get vaccinated. But we've got this backup of pills that are quite effective. I think modern science is going to be fixing this thing and addressing this thing and helping us out of this pandemic. Yeah. What do you make of Tony Fauci? I mean, is he this American hero or, you know, listen, your book journalist or like, ah, it's not all that. Or is he all that great? What do you think? I think Tony Fauci is a hero. His whole life is dedicated to public health. It's a remarkable and quite frankly, just depressing idea that we as a people are part of our country have turned on those who look out for us. Is he perfect? No. He advised us early on not to wear masks. He could have been more wrong about that. The real kinds of mistakes he and other scientists have made. But for Tony Fauci and his colleagues at NIH others, they could have quit years ago and made a fortune in private industry. And they didn't. Why? They don't look out for health and they're trying to.",https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1iVTbuGfqnQ,49,2022-10-18 17:26:29
3563," There's that could have quit years ago and made a fortune in private industry. And they didn't, why? Because they look out for our health and they're trying to give us good advice and guidance. And he's also pushing the research and he behind the scenes made a lot of contributions in terms of these vaccine approaches that are right about in my book. So we owe him and his colleagues a great deal of gratitude. They're not perfect whatsoever to make the stakes left and right, but who doesn't? Yeah, I think you're so right making that point that of course you could have become the top scientist of the giant pharma company, the anonymous and very wealthy living in a nice suburb and all that. But he just said, then we would criticize him for the revolving door and how dare you go private industry after public, yeah, they get it criticized either way. Yeah, after everything has happened over the past 18 months, do you think we're better equipped now, better prepared for the next pandemic? Well, I think so given that mRNA has been proven and we figure out how to manufacture it efficiently, distribute it, took us a little while, but we've learned a lot of lessons in terms of trials as well. So mRNA now we can depend on. So the next big pathogen, lethal virus that emerges, I think we can adjust and create vaccines quite quickly. Other lessons I don't think we've learned to mean as a nation, we don't look out for each other like we should where a group of individualists and that's helped us arrive at these vaccines. And only in America could we, these vaccines have been created. Granted, there's one from Germany, but even the German CEO I've talked to who said, without American investors venture capitalist people rolling the dice on their approach years ago when they went public, when they were raising money, these vaccines could not have been created. So there's a lot to be proud of as an American. There's also a lot to be discouraged about, about how we get advice from our brother-in-law or some video that we saw on YouTube as opposed to our own internist. It's pretty discouraging both for me, but also for the creators, the pioneers that I talked to for my book, when they see that all their hard work has led to this split and some people were resistant and pointing fingers at them for their efforts, it's quite discouraging. And at times left that we have left, Chair Greg, want to ask you a little bit about you and the process and writing books. How did you decide to do this particular book? So I was deep in my basement office in New Jersey, locked down like everybody else, and kind of discouraged about the world. And I thought it could be a fun project to trace and speak to the researchers, the scientists, the pioneering kind of remarkable innovators that are behind his vaccines. I didn't know at the time that they'd be proven effective, but I kind of made a bet that they would and I tracked them along the way. So in some ways it was a healthy distraction for me, gave me encouragement and my book is about what went right, as opposed to what went wrong. I wanted it to be an upbeat book that gives us hope about the future because these vaccine specialists, they're turned, they're focused on other pathogens and other illnesses and viruses, and we're going to need them again sadly, I think in the years ahead. And finally, Greg, so this is one of several books you've written. Is there a common thread or how do you choose what to write about? I mean, it's such a big commitment. You know, I read the last one that you did about a Jim Simon's was great. But you know, you're kind of the rolling the dice yourself in the sense that like you're picking some of your committing to it and you hope that it resonates, right? Yeah, so Andy, one can criticize me because, and I only realized this after I started to pass in my manuscript, I write the same story all over again, over and over. I write about overlooked, underappreciated individual and over looked underappreciated individuals, achieving something that the experts told them they couldn't do. And I write about that over and over again, unlike the heroes. I just happen to, that resonates with me. I find that fascinating. Why is it that conventional wisdom is so wrong so often? All my books and my first book was about the financial crisis and the individuals who anticipated it shouldn't have been these guys. And then I write about the energy revolution. It should not have been these frackers in Oklahoma who turned this country around. It should have been Chevron and BP. And like you said, my last book, The Man of South of the Market, is about a bunch of scientists who don't even care so much about capitalism and business, who have the greatest investment for them in history. And this time it's a group of companies and approaches that were overlooked. M-R-N-A, and these companies, Pfizer, notwithstanding, beyond tech is the key person, key company. Yeah.",https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1iVTbuGfqnQ,50,2022-10-18 17:30:41
3564," It's a group of companies and in approaches that were overlooked, mRNA and these companies, Pfizer, notwithstanding, beyond tech is the key person, the key company behind the vaccine, Moderna and the others I write about. So I'm taken with that theme. I think come, it's one that you can learn a lot from and hopefully readers enjoy it as well. Well, as one reader, I certainly have, Greg. And so keep on doing it. I didn't realize that, I didn't notice that theme throughout. So now I will be noticing that. And if and when you do another one. Yeah, I didn't notice myself until I passed it in. But yeah, I love like that theme, a little bit of a David and Goliath, but I think there were lessons that can be learned about overcoming obstacles and criticism even and skepticism from the so-called experts. Greg Zuckerman, author of the new book, A Shot to Save the World, The Inside Story of the Life or Death Race or a COVID-19 vaccine. Thanks so much for joining us. Oh, great to be here. You've been watching influencers. I'm Andy Cerwer. We'll see you next time. Mm Welcome back to Y'all Finance. I'm Brian Sasi here with Julie Hyman and Brad Smith. I'm just taking their cue this morning from a less bad than expected earnings report over at Goldman Sachs. Similar to the market reaction to Bank of America's numbers on Monday. Right now, we're seeing all three major indices nicely in the green. Here's what we have for you on tap over the next hour. Bear Market Bounce, our friend Rick Reader from BlackRock is here with his latest analysis on all things markets and hitting the bulls eye. Day after target CEO Brian Cornel struck an upbeat tone on the holidays in a Yahoo Finance exclusive. One analyst is upgrading his rating on the stock. We have that analyst joining us very shortly. And into the metaverse, Roblox's ticker page continues to be electric on the Yahoo Finance platform. Talk to an analyst to see if the interest has staying power. Bad over to you. My favorite wedding song to dance to and get on the dance floor with the electric slide. All right. Well, we're seeing a little bit of a positive movement here. Continue to hold early in trade on the day that adjuncts an industrial average DJI or DJI. You're seeing that up by about 1.8%. Nasdaq in Posit still holding that's up by about 2% right now. 209 points to the upside there. S&P 500 you're also seeing that hold at about 1.9%. So much of the positive activity that you're seeing around the world here also continuing to protrude into today's market activity. And over the past two days here early in the trading week or at least for the first two days, you're seeing that hold for the S&P 500 over the two day period up by about 4.6%. Also, want to take a look at some of the trending tickers here on the day that we've been tracking as well because.",https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1iVTbuGfqnQ,51,2022-10-18 17:35:42
3565," You're seeing that hold for the S&P 500 over the two day period up by about 4.6%. Also want to take a look at some of the trending tickers here on the day that we've been tracking as well, because there is a major tie up at least in the pharmaceutical space, excuse me, where you've got AVO pharmaceuticals that's actually being acquired by LG Chem. You've got shares of AVO moving higher by 40% here on the day in reaction to that. Some details of the deal, we do know that it's going to be acquired in equity value of about $566 million on a fully diluted basis, and it represents a 43% premium to AVOs closing share price as of October 17th. So that move being priced here in today and early in trade, still holding on to some healthy gains this morning. Yeah, even though we're down off the high. So really interesting here you guys, we are continuing this sort of debate here with stocks rallying about whether this is a bounce, right? Whether it's sort of a bear market bounce, whether it's going to be something more fundamental, we talked to Simeon Hyman earlier, who said that there are some fundamental reasons here to be optimistic. One slide that Whitman has been September CPI report, of course, which suggests that the Fed is going to have to keep going to get inflation levels where they want them to be. The Fed continuing its data-driven approach. And so there's a lot of questions about whether they're behind the curve. Joining us now to discuss all of this BlackRock's global fixed income CIO, Rick Reader. Hey, Rick. How are you? Nice to see you, a person. Sure, have me. So we have this sort of bounce that we're seeing in the market here, and this debate now about whether it's going to be sustained, whether this is another head fake. What do you think? So I don't think you can count on the market, continue to have, by the way, it's nice being here on a green deck. We don't get any of those these days. But I think it's hard to count on sustained this being sustained. You've got a Fed that's still tightening financial conditions. You've got inflation that's still running too hot, and they've got to keep moving. I think that the markets are priced in about as far as the Fed is going to go, but you don't know the answer to that yet. And until we get more data, we just came off a strong CPI report. We came off a strong payroll report. Now all eyes turn to the employment cost index, PCE data. And we need to see it start to trend down for the Fed to come off this, and then it's hard to take a lot of risk until that happens. Has it been encouraging to you, though, Rick, that we've seen the market rally in response to earnings that aren't necessarily great Goldman Bank of America? They were okay. They weren't as bad as feared, but even go back to last week, you saw some hot reads on inflation. The market bounced on those numbers as well. Those to me seem like positives. They definitely do. And by the way, the bank earnings are pretty good. I mean, when you break it down, those are pretty good. You also had a big relief off of this dynamic that was happening in the UK. I mean, this unwind of the leverage in the pension system was incredibly dislocating. The impact it was having on rates in the UK, and then infecting the US and Europe. That was a big deal. Listen, I think you've got the equity market has some pretty sizable short positions in it today. And I think people underestimate how much the market has gotten repositioned around equities. And you're seeing some pretty big put option trading, very big and positions. And short interest, that's pretty sizable. And so the technicals in the equity market are pretty darn good today. So you get these bounces. And my sense is you'll keep getting them, but can you count on a sustained rally? I think it's still early to think that. I want to pick up on the point about the UK for just a second. There was more news out this morning. The financial times said they were going to delay their quantitative tightening. Then the bank of England says, no, we're not necessarily going to delay it. But I've been sort of struggling to some extent to understand the interplay between what's going on in the UK and here. So can you sort of lay that out for us and why it is so important what's happening? 100%. So you've got dynamic in the UK, which is extraordinary, in that you had what appeared to be at the time aggressive fiscal easing. At the same time, you were seeing central bank tightening. That is not nobody in history has ever seen that work out. So that was creating this volatility in the markets. But then you have a dynamic that you had this leverage on one. So you have these pension funds had to sell huge amounts of assets, including long-term interest rates, interest rate products generally. And so what happens is the development market interest rates, markets tend to work together. And so that was putting pressure on the markets here. And then just the general dislocation, one.",https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1iVTbuGfqnQ,52,2022-10-18 17:39:27
3566," And so what happens is the development market and interest rates, markets tend to work together. And so that was putting pressure on the markets here. And then just the general dislocation, London is the second epicenter of finance and as you're getting this extraordinary volatility there, and it was permeating all the markets generally. So by the way, when the central banks raised rates as much in tight liquidity, you see the leverage, you know, I would say every day, but periodically you see, wow, I didn't realize that risk was on. I didn't realize this leverage is on. And we're going to keep getting reminders of that for the coming weeks and months. I say, I hope that the Fed is going to reach a point where they could pause at these elevated rates, whether it's 4 1 1 2 1 3 1 2 4 4 5. You know, once they pause, then you could start to get comfortable. And I'm going to take some more risks in my portfolio. But I'd like to see some better data to allow us to think that. Well, you know, on something that you just mentioned a moment ago, where are you seeing the largest volume of kind of outsized short positions right now? I mean, the overall market, I mean, the size, I was looking at the size of put options trading for a week straight, you're talking about about a trillion dollars worth of of notional puts. So by the way, put that number in perspective, the high yield markets, the US high yield markets are trillion and a quarter, a trillion a day. Put options are trading. Now, they're, that's full notional size. So they're obviously trade on a delta basis lower than that. But that is big. And then I look at exposures across a lot of the, what is faster money, hedge fund type. And that's really low in terms of exposure. And I think money managers have brought down their exposure pretty significantly. So, you know, that is significant. And that's where I think you've got a market that once it jumps, you get some short covering that comes in. Or so people worry that they're going to miss it. I guess I, I don't think they're going to miss it. But it's not to say, you know, you go through periods where you have real bear markets, you get these spiked rallies. You mentioned a minute ago that in periods like this, we start to see where the leverage is in the system, where the risk is in the system. Where do you have your eyes on that we might see more signs of that? So, you know, there's something really different than 15, 20 years ago when you had the big subprime crisis. And you had leverage in the financial system, corporates, households. You actually don't have that today. The banks are in good shape from a leverage perspective. Corporates are households are in good shape, in a real world where they've been in history. You know, the one place you got to keep your eye on is the real estate market. So commercial real estate, residential real estate. You know, that's where you have financing. Not just leverage, but you've got to roll over your financing. And so the way commercial real estate projects work, obviously, Rezi is you've got to roll over your financing. And that's where you can get some tricky things. And by the way, you've seen it, you know, we've been buying triple A commercial mortgages and getting close to six and a half. And you know, with this one piece, we bought a close to seven percent triple A. You know, so you think about subordinated, done underneath that. So when that happens, you start to think about cash. If I can buy triple A assets, that's sort of yield. Why would I take much risk otherwise? Well, the other difference between now and then, though, is that you have a lot more private credit companies that are not the banks. Are they a source of risk at all in this environment? I would say generally not because their liabilities, they're usually locked up money. Usually they've got not money for a longer period of time. So I generally don't think that they are significant risk to unwind. You know, there are structures that take place in the market that are, you know, in and around, you know, some of the C-Low markets or otherwise that you got to keep your eye on. But I would say generally, the private financing generally is pretty well termed out in terms of where that capital has been raised. So I don't think that's a stress point today. But like I say, guaranteed, whenever you get this sort of shock to the system, something's going to pop up that you didn't expect. And you know, similar to what happened in the UK. I mean, who would have thought the UK, you'd have an issue in the pension system? And that's, but that is a luscious of what happens in these situations. Let's say on financial stability, a competitor puts out a survey this morning, lots of charts in there is noting worsening risks to financial stability, now weighing on equities. But you don't see that. This is not great recession stuff we're seeing right now in the markets. It's great recession in terms of the economy slowing or it's... I mean, we don't see the same things in housing. I mean, there's not a same situation. We just see stock prices going down. Right. I so... Listen, I mean, it's been historic in 50 years, probably longer than that. You've never seen rates...",https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1iVTbuGfqnQ,53,2022-10-18 17:43:51
3567," In the same situation, we just see stop prices going down. Right. I so, listen, it's been historic in 50 years, probably longer than that. You've never seen rates and risk go down at the same time. And that is, I mean, that is an illustration of the fastest tightening we've ever seen by the central banks in history. By the way, not just the US, but the emerging markets, the ECB, the Bank of England. So that is just what happens on the backside of it. And it's just not clear how much the economy is going to slow on the backside of it. What we are seeing that I think is encouraging is you're starting to see the goods part of the economy come down a bit. And that is healthy. You're seeing that inflation. You're seeing that in sheer demand for goods. What you're not seeing yet is a service sector. The service sector is in great shape. Education, leisure, healthcare, solid, both in terms of inflation as well as demand. So you've got an economy that's actually in pretty good shape. I think people underestimate while the economy is going to slow, the goods sector is going to slow. You're seeing that embodied in commodity prices, home builders, et cetera. But the service economy, the US economy is two thirds, consumption is two thirds service. It's hard to bring that down. That's exactly what I wanted to ask you about with regard to where we sit right now within this shift because what we've heard so far from the banks that have reported, from the airlines that have reported, we spoke with Delta CEO. And they're talking about this shift in goods to services really benefiting the experience economy as well. Is that something that if you look out into early 2023, even further into midway through 2023, that remains that demand remains strong and solid enough as consumers are still looking across their own balance sheets where we've seen that go from as the banks would describe it as strong to now just healthy, if you will. I mean, listen, there is, when you lift fuel costs and food costs as much as they have, it definitely has an effect on consumption generally. But gosh, if you side, will a service sector continue to hold up? You still got, you look at where wage levels are relative to anything we've ever seen in history. You look at where the amount of savings that's built up, my sense is the service economy will continue to do well. By the way, it's an aging demographic. The demand for healthcare services is not going anywhere other than up from here. So I still think you've got a solid service economy. People lament where the economy has slowed to. But keep in mind, we had double digit nominal GDP last year. We're slowing from that. And you're still going to have nominal GDP this year. That's going to post an impressive number that could be closer to five. So still pretty good. Are we slowing? Is a good sector slowing? Yes. But by the way, it's very different in commodity or anti-accompanies. It's very different in parts of China today, although we think next year will be better. Emerging markets are tougher. But by the way, we go to Europe, and this is what's creating a lot of the fall. In Europe, when you lift fuel costs as much as you have historic, and then you look at the UK, you look at mortgage rates, swiping higher. Consumers 70% of the consumption basket gets now eaten up by just their utility bill and their mortgage. So you think about how difficult that paradigm presents itself. But US relative to the rest of the world is in reasonable shape. Let's leave it there on that hopeful note. Good to see you in person. They are BlackRock's chief investment officer of global fixed income, Rick Reader. We'll talk to you soon. Thanks for coming. Thank you guys. Before we head to break, let's toss up Snap onto the screen ahead of its earnings report on Thursday. Since the company's layoff announcement in late August, the stock has outperformed the broader market by about 5%. But the outperformance looks overdone. Contents Deutsche Bank analyst Benjamin Black says Black quote, we think near and medium term upside remains limited due to the impact macroeconomic uncertainties could have on ad spent, not only given the experimental nature of Snap's ad platform, companies exposure to volatile categories such as crypto and apparel and potentially dilutive engagement shifts.

Another step back for Boeing 737 MAX JET as the Federal Aviation Administration has requested the company review the safety paper work for the JET. According to the Wall Street Journal the FAA is unable to review the company's submissions through the missing and incomplete information. Boeing now runs the risk of not being certified by the December deadline as they continue to await regulatory approval for carrying passengers. Boeing has said safety remains the driving factor in its effort to meet all regulatory requirements in certifying the 737 MAX 7. And US Air Taxi startup Joby has applied to Japan's transport ministry for aircraft certification as it prepares to launch its urban transportation services. Joby is backed by Japanese automaker Toyota. It's already received certification from the US Federal Aviation Administration allowing it to begin commercial air taxi operations with conventional aircraft. Our brand Tazzy, yesterday asked LinkedIn co-founder and Joby investor Reed Hoffman to give his thoughts on that company. I'm looking forward to being able to ride in one. We're still in a place where it's only test pilots but they're super quiet and they're super safe. So the goal is there to create an uber for the skies? Yes, exactly. It's still early days.

And most importantly, I learned from Oscar Munoz they're not helicopters. All right. Hard turn here. American security experts expect Russian hackers to attack voting systems and stir up trouble in the final days before the midterm elections on November 8th. Y'all find it seem calm. This Rick Newman is here for more Rick. Interesting story you're working here. Yeah. And my point is that Vladimir Putin, the president of Russia, he is already interfering in the US election and it's not in the familiar ways as much that we saw in 2016 and 2020 with this information on social media. It's through inflation. What is the biggest issue for voters right now? It is the economy in its inflation. Now in the beginning of the year, shortly after Russian invaded Ukraine, Biden, President Biden used this phrase, the Putin price hike to explain away rising oil and gasoline prices. And that wasn't really the case at the time. But we now have a different kind of inflation. It is not oil and gasoline prices anymore. I'm going to isolate two things here. It's food and it's natural gas. People do not see the price of natural gas the way they see the price of gasoline. But we've got soaring natural gas prices all around the world. That is because of the Russian war in Ukraine and the energy war that goes along with that. That is raising prices here, not by as much as it is in Europe, but they are going up. We're going to feel that. That passes through to food prices because natural gas produces electricity. You need electricity to process food. There are other factors pushing up food prices that go back to the Russian war in Ukraine and sanctions related to that. So all of this, these are all major factors that are keeping inflation high in the United States, still 8.2 percent. And this is President Biden's principal problem right now. And so for the oil reserves that are slated to be released, how does that kind of play and factor into the Biden administration's strategy at least at this point? So let's talk about oil for a second. So oil prices right now, last I looked, US oil, $8, around $84 a barrel. That is lower than the price before Russia invaded Ukraine on February 24th. So oil markets have normalized. Gas prices have not come down all the way to where they were before February 24th, but they're getting pretty close. And that market has stabilized. And President Biden did release oil from the strategic reserve. That's a small part of it. The biggest reason the oil market has stabilized is we have a global slowdown, especially in China. And so oil has just come down in a way we should be happy about that. The inflation story has since shifted. And it's over to these other things. I mean, food inflation, latest numbers are 13 percent year over year. That is a big ask for a lot of people. Food is 12 percent of the typical households budget, gasoline, only 3 percent. So it's harder to absorb food inflation. And that food inflation looks pretty persistent at this point. It's going to be hard to get that down. So bring it back around to politics for a second, because the proxy for President Biden's polling, for example, and Tiden with the midterms as well, has been the gasoline price. Because it's that one sticker price. It's easy to see food while everybody feels it. You don't have that one sort of thing that's symbolic of it. So how is this going to play as gasoline comes down and food continues to be up? So you're right. So there has been a fairly direct correlation between gas prices and President Biden's approval rating. So gas prices go up. Biden's approval goes down and vice versa. So that was all improving for Biden. The Democrats had momentum as gas prices were coming down sharply. But food inflation started to go up. And I think most people don't look at the CPI numbers in a spreadsheet, the way I do, every time the numbers come out. But people know when stuff gets more expensive. And they know that their paycheck is not going up by the same amount as expenses. And there's going to be another shot coming. People are just starting to see this. And utility bills this summer because natural gas, which is the main way we generate electricity, that is higher than it was this time last year. And that is going to mean higher heating and electricity prices over the summer. So people know they know something's wrong and they're right about that. So the midterm elections are a reference.",https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1iVTbuGfqnQ,56,2022-10-18 17:56:33

So, you know, the midterm elections are a referendum on the president and his party and normally the president's party does lose seats in Congress and does look like that's what's going to happen here. Yeah, I'll finance his own Rick Newman. Thanks for tracking this source. Appreciate it. You guys coming up target, getting an upgrade from Jeff Freeze. We're going to speak with the analyst behind the call. Next. We'll watch you shares of TGT, Target or Tarje. Today after the company got an upgrade to buy from hold from Jeff Freeze saying headwinds for the retailer are mostly near-term problems. Every senior research analyst Corey Loew joins us now. There's so much inventory that has flooded the store ahead of the holiday season. How are they going to be able to work through that? Sure. So there are three key pillars to our upgrade today. The first one is inventory as you mentioned. Second one is margins and the third one is valuation. I'll start with inventory because that seems to be the most topical subject today. On inventory, our proprietary work illustrates that the headwinds, the target and other retailers face might not be as bad as what people think. And why do I say this? Well, we've done some really differentiated work on this topic. So we looked at inventory cycles over the last two decades. And what did we find out that when analyzing inventory growth and sales growth and profit growth throughout the last two decades, when inventory growth peaks, you tend to see a trough or a bottoming in sales and growth profit growth about five quarters after inventory growth.",https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1iVTbuGfqnQ,57,2022-10-18 18:00:42
3571," of peaks. You tend to see a trough or a bottoming in sales and growth growth profit growth about five quarters after inventory growth peaks. And what are we seeing right now? Well, most of the retail coverage that I focus on is continuing to go like this. But for target in the last quarter, we saw an inflection, right? Where we saw a peaking in inventory growth. So what does that mean? At some point between now and five quarters from now, you're going to see a bottoming in sales and growth profit growth and inflection in the stock. And after talking with the company, target only has a couple hundred million dollars of excess warm weather appell in inventory. And you see this in our note today, we publish pictures of this in our store checks. And this is already in the guide that's already been reduced. Earningers of visions are now down. I believe close to 40% in the last nine months. And the balance of the inventory should improve meaningfully from here and skew much more towards consumables, which is still 45% of target's business. So that helps to add a substantial layer of defensibility for this business. And what are frankly, as the CEO called it yesterday, unusual economic times. And he even cited that he's seeing some healthy spending trends despite the atypical environment in which we're in. I'm glad you mentioned Brian Cranel because he made those comments here on Yowl Finance at an all market summit. And I really enjoy talking to him. But Corey, take a listen to this, because I asked Brian about the inventory challenges they are having. Here's what he told us. You know, back in June, we made a pretty bold and decisive decision. We said, all right, inventory is the built up. Consumer shopping habits have changed. They moved into different categories. And we said we're going to get out in front of this. So for target, we put in that inventory problem behind us. And now we can focus on great execution, delighting our guests, getting ready for the big holiday season. So we were pretty decisive and said, we're not going to just let this roll into the next quarter. We'll deal with it upfront. And now we're excited that we're ready to play for the holiday season. So Corey, it's not just target. I hear what you're saying on target. And it sounds like just my vibe talking to Brian that they are working through this inventory. Maybe an issue that is going in the rear view mirror for them. But what about the broader industry? I mean, Walmart exited that second quarter with a lot of other inventory. Department stores high levels of inventory. I mean, how big a problem is this going to be for the retail universe at large this holiday season? It's likely going to be pretty significant in categories that are more discretionary in nature. And that's part of the reason that we are a little bit hesitant on certain discretionary retailers. But target, frankly, is one where we see a lot of opportunity. And why? Well, let's take a look at the margin. For example, in that clip that you just showed, Brian Cornell talked about how they had cleared a lot of inventory in the second quarter. The business drove close to a 1% EBIT margin in the second quarter, which is rather uncharacteristic for a business that drives typically an EBIT margin over the last decade, close to 7%. So clearly, the last quarter was an aberration. And a lot of these self-inflicted or COVID-induced wounds are likely to lead to probably a subdued margin this year from an EBIT perspective. So probably around 4% to 5%. But as we looked to next year, we think that a 6% or more margin would probably be reasonable. And I don't think that the street is quite get focused on that, particularly given the near-term hurdles that exist as a result of elevated inventory in the environment that you point out in holiday. But on holiday, what I would say is that we've heard from several retailers now that consumers are, while they're being more intentional, are still spending on holiday. So I was at a conference a few weeks ago. The CEO of Walmart, U.S., had cited a strong tailgate season, a strong back-to-school season. And then just a few weeks ago, the CEO of Costco had even, or CFO, excuse me, had mentioned that he seemed sort of strong momentum in Christmas and Halloween inventory that has already hit the stores. So I think that that does, despite the elevated inventory environment that we're in, owed quite well for the holiday season ahead. Hey, Corey, it wasn't just a target that you are looking at here. You upgrade.",https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1iVTbuGfqnQ,58,2022-10-18 18:05:14
3572," Despite the elevated inventory environment that we're in, both quite well for the holiday season ahead. Hey, Corey, it wasn't just a target that you are looking at here. You upgraded target, but you still like Walmart also. And so it sounds like you don't think there's going to be a zero sum situation here. Do you think Walmart is also going to be okay on the inventory front? And also, it sounds like you think they'll benefit from the, from people maybe trading down and trying to save money a little bit? Absolutely. So part of the reason that we do like Walmart is that it's a value leader and it benefits from a trade down. But beyond that, we took this a step further and we said, okay, if it's going to benefit from a trade down, how much do we see it benefiting over the next 12 to 24 months? And the reality is that we think that when we went through a really highly differentiated and unique analysis that we think Walmart can drive over 100 basis points to its same store sales as a result of trade down in grocery and that could drive upside to consensus comp numbers. Not only this year, but next year too. And our estimates are above consensus this year and next year by over 3%. There's upside devaluation. This business is trading at 19 times to your forward earnings versus historical average of 22 times. So it's trading at a three turn discounted historical average. And that range is typically about 17 to 27 times. So it's actually trading even toward the lower end of that range, which means that there's plenty of upside from not only a numbers perspective, but evaluations perspective as well. Corey, thanks for joining us. Good to talk to you. Corey Tarlos, Jeffrey Senior Research Analyst, talking to us about the retailers today. Appreciate it. Thanks so much. Have a great day. You too. All right, let's talk about some other movers that we're watching today. One of them is Colgate-Pamala of CBC reporting that Dan Loeb's third point has built a stake in the company. And we should mention we're not, Yagyu Finance did reach out to third point for comment. We've not yet heard back at this point. The shares are trading higher by 3.4%. And the reporting over there talks about that maybe there should be a break up of Colgate, or at least it's been off of some of the businesses. The pet nutrition, Hills Pet Nutrition is one of their divisions there. You're looking at me skeptically. I can see you processing. Processing. I dig this potential call by Dan Loeb. Why are they selling pet nutrition next to my toothpaste in the same way? Why does it have to be together? Does that make any sense anymore? Do you use the same ingredients in toothpaste as you do in making pet products? I'm guessing no. But don't they keep the operation separate in how they're producing those products too? So hopefully there's not the usual ingredients that are going into your toothpaste versus the pet food. But we know that you would be willing to try. I just wanted to get you to come up. All right, done deal. So does he got to say these good things? All right, switching gears from pet food to cars. We're also watching shares of Tesla after City. Reiterated, it's celebrating on the EV Maker, saying the update in Q3 has not completely addressed macro concerns. This calls a little bit all over the map because the analyst here at Tei, McAlley, we often said his work, celebrating, but he's saying the stock could rise coming out of this quarter if Tesla reports any upside related to EPS or auto delivery. So kind of talking out of both sides here. Yeah, I mean, even if we think about what Tesla has put out thus far and how they're going to continue to run into in China, especially a region where there is more of the appetite from the consumer to actually go towards some of the homegrown brands. And I think that's something not just across automobiles and vehicles. It's actually something that we've seen already referenced from our company in Nike as well. An analyst that cover some of the athlete's space, of course, largely different purchase, but still the consumer sentiment or at least that propensity that still remains. And so with that type of trend that we're seeing right now, what does that spell out for? Not just the Tesla Shanghai production, but also where they see future demand continuing to come into. Yeah, and Tesla reports after the close of trading tomorrow, analysts looking for a bucko too in terms of earnings per share. We're going to be paying attention to the outlook, of course, as well, and see, you know, we tend to get some pretty big swings in Tesla shares after the numbers. So we'll be watching that closely. Absolutely. Also watching closely here today shares of Carvana, they are moving on the day up by about 2% will round that off to after WEDBUSH downgraded the stock to neutral from outperform and slash their price target from $50.",https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1iVTbuGfqnQ,59,2022-10-18 18:09:39
3573," Moving on the day up by about 2% will round that off to after WEDBUSH downgraded the stock to neutral from outperform and slash their price target from $50 to $15 here. Now in the use car landscape, of course there is this massive shift of and the inventory concerns particularly because even at the prices that use cars had skyrocketed up to, it's a larger question of where consumers are starting to push back on some of those prices and where Carvana, CarMax, where they'll actually be able to move some of that inventory off the lots that they've paid so much to be able to bring on as well. That $50 price target, wow, that stock has come way down. From a consumer standpoint, I bought two cars off Carvana. I think the consumer experience is very, very impressive. But of course, you have to separate the consumer experience from the financials and I understand this downgrad makes a lot of sense. We've seen used car prices start to roll over, consumer spending under pressure here a little bit, so I get it. Yeah, makes sense.

Doug, good to see you here. Is that move overdone in your view? Yeah, it was a bit aggressive. The September numbers were fine. We now know that their bookings for Q3 are going to come in slightly ahead of cell-side consensus and basically align for our numbers were, which is good. They've now returned to your growth after a few quarters where that wasn't the case. They had tough comps. I think there were two things going on yesterday. One is that there had been chatter we've been hearing that mobile gaming spending overall might have slowed down in September. That certainly didn't seem to be the case in their numbers, so that may have surprised people a bit. Also, I don't think it was widely understood that the KPIs were actually going to be reported yesterday. So, people who were short the stock may not have realized that data was coming out on the Monday morning and got caught on by surprise.",https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1iVTbuGfqnQ,60,2022-10-18 18:13:50

Yeah, and if there's one thesis that underlies sort of my entire approach to covering stocks, it's that content is game. And if you want to be a great platform, you're going to need great content. I think right now they have some great content for kids, but not for adults. And ultimately solving that problem is probably going to be very difficult. That is why my kids are on it, and I am not. Cowling Senior Headless Doug Gray, thanks so much, appreciate it. Thank you. Well, coming up, Walmart is stepping into the content creator space. We have the details on that. Walmart. Walmart, making a play for the Gen Z crowd with a new platform called Walmart Creator, a creator. Influencers can now let followers shop what they wear, talk and promote directly through their profiles or pages. I can find this is Berk De Palma here with the details. And hey, Brooke, it seems like Walmart's a little bit late to this, right? This is something other shopping sites have tried to. I'm just still trying to wrap my head around like Walmart being a fashion leader here. So tell us about this program. Julie, you might be surprised that a lot of influencers are currently sharing Walmart creative, one of the most popular fashion brands, including Scoop, Guilty as Charge. I actually own one of their sweaters, but this new Walmart creator platform is actually currently a beta version. It's going to launch fully in 2023 now, curators or creators rather can sign up for the platform, share these product links onto their social media pages like Instagram, Facebook, TikTok, of course, potentially be real here or a group of their choice. Now the platform will also create recommendations based upon these creators' interests. And they'll then be able to track how these recommendations do, how they perform, how their followers click the links and then buy the products from Walmart. And of course, from there, that's when the creators will earn commission, but they can also apply to be part of their upcoming brand campaigns out of Walmart. Now some of the influencers that they're getting on board here to start include Devon on Dak. He has a three P However,",https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1iVTbuGfqnQ,61,2022-10-18 18:21:17
3575," But they can also apply to be part of their upcoming brand campaigns out Walmart. Now some of the influencers that they're getting on board here to start include Devon on Dak. He has 3.8 million followers on Tik Tokies, a fashion influencer and also a more older crowd here. Cooking with Darrell is a dad that rose to fame during the pandemic for his quick family style recipes. He has 2.7 million followers. But Julie the catch here, they're really looking to let everyone monetize not just influencers that you think of who have millions and millions of followers. Break this down further for me for an old person such as myself. So if I go on to the platform, I see Joey the body builder. I'm like, wow, that person has an amazing physique. I want to buy a 40 pound tub of weight protein. Does it extend to food or is this just a peril? Well according to cooking with Darrell, he just posted a video on Tik Tok and he seems like he's going to be posting different products. Of course, Brian, this is currently in a beta version. So I think Walmart really experimenting here, what people will be interested. It seems like it's going to be a whole foray of different offerings. One thing to note here is that Walmart is saying that there's no cap on just how much money creators can earn here. Walmart, spokesperson confirming an achievement that we don't share commission percentages for our creative partners. But also here, one of their biggest competitors, Amazon, of course, doing that. You can buy anything that Amazon influencers program creators recommend from that protein powder or you know, iron, potentially. But one thing to note is that according to Amazon, these influencers can earn 2%, 10% up to 20% for their recommendation that 20% being for Amazon games. So there is a fixed commission income for Amazon there. Of course, Amazon came in earlier to the game here back in 2017. They also recently launched Amazon live. They also recently launched that in India as well. They also saw others like like to know it, get into the space, will work style those as some of their early comers. But lots of opportunity to grow. This is expected to reach $1.45 billion by 2028. But to answer your question, Brian, for the entire influencer space, they're really recommending all different products. So I think Walmart really looking to get a slice of that here as well. All right. Time for me to start serving more loops on the ground. I'm going to do better than my goose bumps t-shirts. Thank you all for everyone. Thanks so much, Brooke. Appreciate it. Coming up, Mehta is being forced to sell. Giffy, giffy, giffy, giffy. We're going to break down the details next.

3576," electronic Good as time for credit for time. Two stories today. One minute each we start with this meta platforms is unwinding its 2020 purchase of the animated image platform Giffy after British regulators blocked the deal on concerns that meta could deny or limit competitors access to Giffy's Gifts or Giffy's Gifts whichever way you're pronouncing it at home. I say Giffy and I say Gifts. I'm never posted a Giffy on Facebook. Have you guys on Facebook? No. Mostly on Twitter. Are we even on? On Slack. If they took the Gifts away from Slack. Yes. That would be a profound decrease in my well-being at work. That's true. We have great ones in our live during Christmas. I don't ran that deep. If meta did take it over and then blocked it from Slack or charged too much in Slack, I'd just stop using them. I'm thankful that the British authorities have done this if that would be the outcome. This was a really early pandemic deal. I remember what March of 2020 we had heard some of the deal making really start to bubble up and this really kicked off. Where tech companies would look at these opportunities, go after some of these smaller, privately held companies and just seeing kind of good valuations that they could ultimately be able to capitalize on. All right. We didn't have a chance to discuss this one yesterday. Yay. Kanye. That is, says he's purchasing the controversial social media platform Parlor. It has a reputation for being favored by right-wing extremists. Yay, in a release by Parlor said, conservatives have to make sure they have the right to freely express themselves. Of course, Kanye over the weekend was expressing quite a bit of anti-semitism and that's something that's on that platform. So I don't even know what to say about this. I mean, a lot of different businesses are cutting their ties with him. And he's aligning himself more closely with extremism, it seems. No pun here. And the next sure drop is really Adidas severed ties with him. Right. They're reviewing that relationship, right? But it would be a big blow, of course, to Adidas. Big blow to him financially. I'm surprised that it has taken Adidas this long to step up and do something. I think in what we've seen from Yay and the activity and what has clearly been extremely shortsighted, Tarnas says reputation from what hasn't been Tarnas to this point, he's going to quickly discover that freedom of expression is not the same as extremism. That takes place and emanates and continues to boil over on platforms like Parlor. Yeah. Well, I don't know if you will get that message. We'll see what happens. All right, we've got stocks that are still remaining in rally territory today and coming up, Akiko Pajita and Prosti remaining are going to rev up the EV discussion with the CEO of Roll Royce.

3577," libertarian whatnot, grab some life. ре................................................................... We are going to be speaking with world voice and care on thelad points here, the FMP 500 up 44 and the NASDAQ up 127. In terms of the sectors we're watching, materials, a big one that's seeing some big gains to date, financials also won and you are seeing the energy sector, the only one that's in the red, although that's trading pretty flat right now. We should mention bond yields as we see the 10 year yields still trading above that, actually, it's now right below that 4% level. All this is earnings continue to roll on. We've already heard from several of the major banks. Goldman's act, the latest to report its quarterly results coming out with a beat. But how do these big banks compare to one another in the latest quarter? Let's bring in Yahoo Finance's Alexander Seminova here with me at the desk. We got all the big banks out of the way. In general, a pretty positive outlook, I don't know if you should say positive outlook, but a beat. The expectations were fairly low. Yeah, absolutely. Kiko, I have to start out by saying it's really been a mixed bag for financials as they've been reporting their results. On one hand, the banking industry is still doing just fine compared to what analysts are expecting to see from some other sectors that are set to report in the coming weeks. It's really just the year over year comparisons that have been really tough after an incredibly lucrative 2021. And they're still meeting analyst expectations for the most part. But on the other hand, we are seeing big profits taking a huge hit, driven primarily by two things, lower deal-making activity that is really putting a dent in investment, banking revenues, and them setting a sign funds for potential loan losses, which is also weighing on their profits as they expect to the possibility of an economic recession.",https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1iVTbuGfqnQ,64,2022-10-18 18:34:51
3578," and them setting a sign funds for potential loan losses, which is also weighing on their profits as they expect to the possibility of an economic recession. But there are a few, of course, that have held up better than others. Goldman Sachs yet again was a standout today, beating on all fronts, coming in far better than Wall Street had expected. Profit was down 43%, but that was partially offset by an 11% jump in trading activity, led by fixed income trading specifically. So again, the expectations were low and this was very much a better than feared situation with the big banks. Bank of America also posted a drop in profits year over year. However, it did see an earnings per share beat compared to what Wall Street was expecting, also benefiting from better than expected trading revenues. So those are kind of the winners as you put it. The biggest loser. Well, one more winner we have, JP Morgan actually saw a drop in quarterly net income, but openheimer analyst said it was a blowout quarter saying that blowout would be an understatement because analysts were really preparing for the worst when it came to this. But then you look at city group profit fell 25%. Revenue however rose 6% again at beat Wall Street estimates. Morgan Stanley was the only bank that really disappointed Wall Street, missing expectations and reporting profit that fell 29%. So that was one of the banks that saw much more challenging quarter compared to its peers. Okay, Alexander Seminovo with a roundup for us. Thanks so much for that. Joining us now for a deeper dive on the financial sector. Let's bring in Devin Ryan at JMP Securities Director of Financial Technology Research. Devin, good to talk to you today. We're going to get to the restructuring on Goldman in just a bit. But let's talk about the roundup of the banks. As Alexander just highlighted, we did see a big drop in profits when you look at the year on your comparison. A lot of these banks beat expectations, but it certainly didn't really vote well when you look at the outlook here. You think about the concerns in terms of loan defaults, loan loss reserves increasing as well. I mean, what did you take away from these results in terms of the economic picture to come? Sure, well, I think it's just it's a complicated environment, right? The macro backdrop has been complicated all year. And even as we're about ready to exit 2022, there's still a lot of uncertainty. So we haven't really made a lot of progress on that front. So banks kind of being one proxy for the outlook of the economy. There's obviously a wind dispersion of expectations. That being said, what we're actually seeing as a result is pretty encouraging, at least as of now, really no credit issues, higher interest rates are driving a guy in tire for net interest income for the most part. And then as you guys talked about, investment banking is very weak off of what was by far record 2021. On the other side, trading is helping offset that. So it's just showing that these are business models that are pretty resilient. The bar was low into earnings, but the macro outlook is still uncertain. And so that's why we think we've been arguing we're kind of in this range bound trading where we got a little bit oversold. People were a little bit too negative. Now you're seeing a balance off of that, but until there's more certainty and stability, it's going to be hard to have really sustained recovery in the stocks. Let's talk about the other big announcement, getting a lot of attention here. Goldman Sachs essentially confirming these reports that came out of multiple media outlets, including the Wall Street Journal that they are in fact restructuring here, going from four divisions to three. There's a number of things to highlight, the consumer business and wealth management merging with asset management, also investment banking and trading now being placed under one unit. What do you think this says about where the bank is headed? Someone argue, well, there was this big focus back in 2020 about the consumer side of things. Is there a pivot that's happening? Yeah, I think this is more of a reorganization around the edges. This isn't some major shift in strategy or major pivot. On the consumer side, they're listening to the market. There's a lot of press out there that it's not a profitable business today. It's growing at a pretty strong pace. Your consumer revenues are up 95% year-to-year, but it's a business that I think is still spending a lot of money to expand. I think they're pulling back a little bit on that growth investment. Things are getting a little bit more specific.",https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1iVTbuGfqnQ,65,2022-10-18 18:38:35
3579, is still you're spending a lot of money to to expand. And so I think they're pulling back a little bit on that growth investment since they're getting a little bit more you know a little bit more specific around how they acquire customers and you want to do it in a more profitable way. So those are where some of the changes are you know the reorganization of the business units to me is more just you know getting a little bit more organized around how they report how a management structure don't really see a major strategic shift there but ultimately you know maybe that drives a little bit more efficiency in the business model but ultimately you know Goldman is it's the same business they've gained a lot of market share on the institutional side and we don't think they're pulling back dramatically on consumer I think they just want to be a little more tailored and be able to more focus on profitability there. Yeah I mean it's not not a dramatic scaling back as you say on the consumer side of things having said that it's taken a while for that to be a big driver do you anticipate that that will ultimately take hold or are we just sort of talking about through the traditional revenue drivers remaining in place for the bank. Yeah so I mean Goldman's a little bit of victim of their own success they've had so much success on the institutional side and those revenues have grown more than I think most people predicted a few years ago that you look at the growth in consumer and say well it's still relatively immaterial they're generating over two billion dollars in consumer revenue so it's not a small business if you took it out and put it on a standalone versus any other digital bank or or you know new consumer startup so we do think if something is going to take hold you know Goldman's not managing the business for you know the next credit cycle or the next you two years they're managing for the next 20 years or even 100 years and so when we think about you know getting into an entirely new business line that is a huge addressable market it's going to take time and you know they're they're just listening I think to market feedback and pushback that hey you need to get this business into a better profitability picture before you continue to add new lines to it and so that's really kind of what this is but we're still pretty constructive on what consumer can be in the long term and think they'll continue to feed growth there just be a little bit more tactical around how they do that specifically on Goldman Sachs you've got a price target of $470 a share and outperform rating there how do you think it stacks up against some of the other banks that have reported in the anticipation of some kind of economic downturn yeah Goldman historically has always gained market share coming out of economic downturn so in that very moment of market stress you know it could be challenging for them as it is for everyone but they are so good on risk management and when others essentially get out over their skis and take too much risk Goldman Sachs is able to really gain market share take clients and and that's what we think what happened again to the extent the economy does roll over so again you're not cheering on a downturn but ultimately Goldman Sachs is going to be better positioned in our opinion and so when you're buying the stock at just over book value book value is $300 to $8 for them right now that's a pretty good risk reward long term for investors to be patient they're generating returns on equity north of 10% even in this really difficult environment that relationship has always helped investors in our opinion make money when that ROE and book value are correlated like that so we think this is a pretty good entry point for investors that have a little bit of patience and a little bit of a long term but orientation Devon Ryan JMP Securities Director of Financial Technology Research good to have you on today appreciate the time well take a look at chairs of Salesforce seeing a big pop on reports that activist investor starboard value is taking a stake in the company and you see that stock up about 4.5% founder Jeff Smith telling CNBC his fund is taking a significant position in the software maker although he didn't specify the amount now Smith added that the company is not generating meaningful operating leverage relative to its peers and that subpar mix of growth and profitability has contributed to a significant discount in valuation shares of Salesforce by the way down more than 40% so far this year coming up a flash of luxury rolls Royce unveils its first electric vehicle we're gonna speak with a group CEO you certainly don't want to miss that also ahead reports suggest the Biden administration is looking to dip,https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1iVTbuGfqnQ,66,2022-10-18 18:42:51
3580," Three Rolls Royce unveils its first electric vehicle. We're going to speak with a group CEO. You certainly don't want to miss that. Also ahead, reports suggest the Biden administration is looking to dip into the strategic petroleum reserve yet again. Are the moves justified? We'll discuss on the other side. We'll turn it on to oil markets. The White House is reportedly weighing additional sales from its strategic petroleum reserve to help tamp down fuel prices before the midterms. Let's bring in Yahoo Finance, this Jared Blick, who's tracking the very latest for us. Jared, I'm looking at oil prices under significant pressure today. We're going to tap into the reserves again because we expect the prices to go up. That was a controversial decision. OPEC plus increasing, it's a production facility by 2 million barrels per day. Very much unexpected. A lot of people thought that was just a blatant shot off the bow toward the U.S. But take a look at crude oil, we see it's down 3.5% today. Take a look at a year-to-day chart. You can still see a bit elevated, but it has been in a steady downtrend since the middle of the year. Now the strategic petroleum reserve of the U.S., let me put it to your chart so I can show you. It was standing at about 630 million barrels. That was as of mid last year, so we can just draw a line up. Then we started tapping it and then we got down to about, let's say, 400 million and change here. What happened, obviously, since the SPR was being tapped, we did see a tremendous rise in prices not only in crude oil, but also our Bob Gasoline futures. But guess what was happening in the meantime? We had the Russia Ukraine conflict, which nobody really anticipated. We also had a massive repricing of risk with respect to the Federal Reserve. And after that became apparent, we've...",https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1iVTbuGfqnQ,67,2022-10-18 18:47:08
3581," We had the Russia Ukraine conflict, which nobody really anticipated. We also had a massive repricing of risk with respect to the Federal Reserve. And after that became apparent, we finally saw prices peak about mid-year here and start to come down. You take a look at our Bob Gasoline futures, which closely tracked the price of gasoline at the pump. Very similar story. So the SPR, when it was tapped mid-last year, didn't have an immediate effect, but we did talk with Ed Morse over at cities, head of commodities there. And he said the administration gets high marks for controlling the price of gasoline, actually the supplies online. But in terms of price controls, not so much. And here's what he had to say. The history of trying to put a price cap on is not very good. And it's kind of ironic that they're doing this at a time when the producers look at them and say, hey, they're putting on a price cap. We're trying to put a floor under prices. They don't like that. Why should we like them putting a price cap on Russia when they could do the same thing to us if this kind of thing works? So it has mixed grades, I think. And imperfect mechanism of Kiko, so that's how we see it. Okay. Something to watch, especially when you consider the reserves are so low. Yes. Already that they'll have to refill it pretty quickly. And buy a third already. Yeah. Number to watch there. Thanks so much for that, Jared. Well, Rolls Royce is unveiling this spectre, the luxury car makers. The first fully electric vehicle, the two door sedan marks a BMW subsidiary Rolls Royces appeal to upmarket EV buyers. Joining us now is Torsten Mueller, Otfos, Rolls Royce CEO, also with us is Prada Supermanian. Of course, Yahoo Finance car reporter. We should point out the segment presented to you by BMW, which owns Rolls Royce. Great to have you on today. Certainly a big day. You're taking the wraps off of the big EV here. Question to you here. We have seen this market get increasingly crowded, but you are competing in the ultra luxury space. What's the demand for EVs look like there? I mean, so far I can tell you, first of all, good morning. It's great. And this is a historic day here. We are launching first of all the very first electric Rolls Royce. We are the very first loans rightly so, as you said a minute ago, to be in that ultra luxury segment the very first offering an electric car. And for that reason, we are very much looking forward to it. And so far, order entry is already really great and very pleasing. And it's not only the United States, but it's all over the world. And I think we are working on electrifying the brand already for quite a while. We are experimenting with it since 10 years. And quiz our clients worldwide on what their requirements would be. So I foresee a very good future also in the ultra high luxury segment. And for us, allow me to say that electric propulsion fits perfect to the brand. It's quiet, silent, very talky, delivers worthability. And also interesting story goes back to what one of our founding fathers said in 1900, Charles Rolls made a prophecy and said, the perfect propulsion for cars is electric. Once charging is fixed. And I think now we are here fulfilling his prophecy. Hey, Torres St. Prysor, good to see you again. I had a question about sort of the engineering challenge is making a Rolls Royce into an EV. I know you say that it's a Rolls Royce first and an EV second. What kind of challenge did you guys face having to make this sort of a peel to your audience? Good point, pros. I think as I said already, we started looking into it over 10 years ago, when we launched that experimental Phantom 102 X. And we put quite a lot of clients worldwide behind the wheel. And one finding was fits perfect to the brand, but charging time and also range needs to be fully sufficient. So for that reason, that took us a while because one thing was also clear, don't compromise the Rolls Royce experience. And all that in combination challenged our engineers, as you can imagine, because it was clear, it needed to be magic carpet ride. It was clear that it needed to carry sufficient range. And we are offering now 520 kilometers, we are in a 20 miles range. And I think that is very sufficient and definitely on what our clients expect in that segment to happen. And for that reason, I think we got here.",https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1iVTbuGfqnQ,68,2022-10-18 18:51:39
3582," Myles range and I think that is very sufficient and definitely on what our clients expect in that segment to happen. And for that reason, I think we got here, but the challenge was on our hands and we are not yet completely finished. The car is still in the testing worldwide and the testing ends end of June next year. And then first deliveries will be done by end of next year when first clients also in the United States market take delivery of their specter. Hey Torchins, so you guys are like you mentioned the cars when they come out end of next year. Have you guys faced any issues with part shortages, components, or just things like that, which you need to kind of kind of put in the place before this cars are delivered? I mean, we are working here closely together also with the BMW group in terms of let's say some technical laundry components we have invited quite a lot of clients already over here to Goodwood to see specter and they were all highly fascinated by what they have seen. Many of them placed already orders and deposits. So for that reason, I think that's good. We also see the car now more often in the markets. We will bring it also to the United States before so that clients can see it real in front of them. So I think we're going to shorten that or we're going to make waiting fund for specter. That's for sure. Torchins, I wonder where you think we are in this transition to EVs and I'm not just talking about the ultra luxury space when you look at where market share is globally. It's just over 10% in terms of where EV stand in the broader auto market here in the US is just at 5%. Are we at a tipping point or is it going to take a little more whether that is higher oil prices or higher gas prices or a little more accessibility in the cars to get to full acceleration in this transition, which a lot of governments hope will be 100% EVs. Now, I mean, first of all, we are not really in the car business. Sounds funny now. We are in the luxury goods business. Nobody needs us to come from A to B. All our clients have multiple cars in their garage. So I think this is here different. It is that you are seen for the very first time completely emission free in a luxury rolls, Royce. And I think that's a statement statement quite a lot of our clients would like to make for that reason. I definitely foresee not only specter being excess in the market, but also our force going strategy to say by the end of 2030. The entire brand rose rose motor cars is fully electrified. So all new rose voices in the next years to come are fully electrified. Hey, Torson. That's clear. And. Sorry about that. Hey, Torson. In the last time we spoke at the end of the summer, we talked about how there was insatiable demand for luxury cars. You mentioned the specter being at the highest in the luxury EVs. Does that still exist now? Are we still seeing any kind of hesitation as a global market uncertainty sort of builds up here? No, not at all. Pros and I remember our talk that evening at Pebble Beach, obviously. So no, not at all. I think we still have a very strong order intake worldwide. I think there is no reluctancy currently to invest and to indulge luxury. I think the entire luxury market, not only the car market, but also fashion, whatever runs pretty well currently worldwide. And I think that it's also due to the fact that there was quite some money accumulated in the Corona times. And for that reason, there is a new kind of understanding you better live now and don't postpone it to later. So people are prepared to still spend money, which is great. And I think that puts us here into work. We are employing here at Goodwood over 2000 people and they profit from the fact that the luxury business is allowing me to say booming. Okay. I know process waiting to take a test drive in that car, right? Yeah, always looking for a test drive. We got to make that happen. Terce and Mueller, odd post.

3584," you you you Steven today. We're really looking at across the board, industrial utilities, materials leading today's gains here, but still technology and health care holding on to some of those gains. I mentioned some of the outperformance that we're seeing today because of earnings. Let's take a look at some of these bank names. Goldman was out with the results before the bell this morning. They're up nearly 2%. We're really looking at gains across some of the largest banks here. JP Morgan nearly 2% Bank of America up 3% today. We're going to see some of the earnings here. We're looking at some of the earnings here. We're looking at some of the airlines with delta up just over 2% united. We'll be getting earnings from them after the bell this afternoon that stock up another 2% today and American leading the way there up just about 3%. Dave. Despite the warning starting now. Stay and strong aren't they very resilient? Let's get up speed now on the housing market where the carnage continues there. The latest homebuilder sentiment has been falling for the 10th straight month. It's now half of what it was just 6 months ago. The national association of homebuilders single family index falling 8 points to 38. That's the lowest level in more than a decade with the notable exception of those early days in the pandemic. Freddie Mac has the average Morgan rate on a 30 year fix. It's 6.92 and no doubt folks headed well above 7% in months ahead said NAHB chairman Jerry Comter quote seeing significantly weakening demand particularly for first time home buyers adding the situation is unsustainable. Regionally sentiment fell the steepest in the west where it's just 34. Also today mortgage bankers association with new numbers showing new home mortgage applications decrease more than 13% in September. More bad news. Richelle. Indeed, sharp declines they will. Let's now also get you up to speed on Netflix. We're seeing the stock under pressure here down about 1.8%.",https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1iVTbuGfqnQ,71,2022-10-18 19:04:27
3585," In September, more bad news. But, indeed, sharp declines there will now also get you up to speed on Netflix. We're seeing the stock under pressure here down about 1.8%, they're going to be reporting earnings after the bell today. They're expecting adjusted earnings per share of $2.22 on revenue of $7.85 billion. Also keeping an eye on that subscriber growth, which used to be the key metric that Netflix was judged by before, of course, the streaming sector got so crowded. That's expected to top 1 million. Netflix is still bullish, though, after they add tear announcement, which advertises a flock to. But we'll see if subscribers feel the same and investors as well in the following quarter when that shows up. Just under an hour to go until the closing bell, you're looking at gains across the board, Dallas and P&Nazdak, moving to the upside. Let's bring in Kathy Jones, a Charles Schwab, a chief fixed income strategist. Kathy, it's great to see you here. So on the equity side of things, we're looking at gains bond markets at least a 10-year, pretty much holding steady today right around 4%. What do you make of activity that we're seeing today and really what we've seen play out over the last several trading days? Yeah, I think the bond market, and to some extent probably the stock market kind of caught between this dynamic of worries about recession, but the idea that perhaps some of the worst is over. And so we've got still the prospect of fed tightening, which could slow the economy even more down the road. But we've seen some resilience in terms of consumer spending, and that has left us in this kind of volatile trading range. But I think as we get closer to the next Fed meeting, there'll be those renewed concerns about higher interest rates and what impact that has next into 2023 on the economy and on profit margins and just in general the outlook. Are the equity markets, Kathy, continuing to ponder when that pause comes and should at least stop? Yeah, well they were all pondering, right? So even talking about it's not so much a pivot, meaning a reversal or even a pause, but really with the pace that we've been concerned about. So the Fed has really ratcheted up rates so fast in this cycle on a rate of change basis, it's the fastest rate cycle we've had in modern history. And you know it takes 12 months, maybe sometimes 18 months for those rate hikes in that tightening to work its way through to the economy. So we're really just starting to see the impact. We think that means the Fed will slow down at some stage of the game. Probably 75 basis points at the November meeting, maybe 50 after that and then maybe starting to level off. And I think though the market is really caught in this kind of game of trying to figure out when that moment comes when there's a shift in Fed policy. And at this stage of the game it doesn't look like it's in the near term. So Kathy, how is that informing your investment strategy? If you have a short term horizon versus a longer one, as you were mentioning some of these 12 to 18 months that we might see this play out in the economy. Well we think that from the fixed income side, investors should be really looking at the opportunities that are there in fixed income. You know, we came into the year expecting rates to rise and we're short on the duration and now we think you should start extending, maybe gradually. But the fact is you can build a high quality portfolio right now with treasuries, investment grade, corporate bonds, municipal bonds with very attractive yields. We haven't seen in many, many years, 5, 6 percent yields. And that's pretty attractive, I think, for a base of a portfolio. And that is kind of the way investors should think about it over the long run, that over the short run, you start compounding 4 or 5 percent or 6 percent over 5 or 6 years. That's a pretty attractive proposition compared to potential volatility might see elsewhere at a portfolio. Kathy, we spoke to Gary Cohn yesterday, joined us for Yahoo Finance's All Market Summit and I asked him what he thought, what he thinks needs to happen in order for the Fed to get inflation under control. I want to play a quick bite with what he had to say. That labor cost has not come down and it's another area where the Fed is trying to get some response. They're trying to get businesses to not grow as fast. They're trying to get people, businesses to not hire as many people. We saw it even in the last month.",https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1iVTbuGfqnQ,72,2022-10-18 19:09:04
3586," They're trying to get businesses to not grow as fast. They're trying to get people, not to, this is not higher as many people. But we saw even in the last month's unemployment report, we saw a 3.5% unemployment. We still see non-farm payrolls growing. So the interest rate impact is not fed through to the business cycle yet. We're gonna have to see job destruction if we're really gonna see inflation be curtailed. Kathy, that job destruction, I wanna ask you about that. I know we just got your predictions in terms of what fed policy is going to be. But if we see even further weakening then maybe the fed is expecting to see in the jobs market, what does that mean then from a market's perspective? Yeah, and I would agree that what the Fed is waiting to see is the pace of wage growth slowed down. So it's running around 5% year over year right now. I think the comfort level for the Fed is 2 to 3%, which means we probably do need higher unemployment to reach that goal and slower job growth. But this is a very, very strange dynamic too. We saw 1.6 million people out of the labor force because of COVID and long COVID. And we just don't have the participation rate up. So I'm not sure that wages will fall as quickly as the Fed would like to see. And if that's the case and they keep raising rates hoping to see wages decline and see unemployment rise, well that's just going to squeeze the economy even more. And that's not likely to be good for risk assets. Kathy, you mentioned the lag and all the data that the Fed is using. Is there something you'd prefer an alternative gauge? And when do you think we'll actually see inflation cooling off? Well, we should see over the next couple of months the year over year pace of inflation come down because just looking at the rate of change versus last year that should come down. And we started to see softness, as you just mentioned in the housing market, that's going to feed through to lower rent down the road. But that takes a long time to work its way through. So and we've seen commodity prices come off. Despite all the predictions, OPEC plus, et cetera, energy prices have really not accelerated. They've been falling over the last couple of months. So all that suggests to me that we will start to see some of the inflation figures come down. But the wage component may be a lagging indicator this time. So that's really kind of the combination of things. If the Fed doesn't call me and ask my opinion, but I think they should slow down the pace, right, where we are. And take the cumulative impact of the tightening to date, the rate hikes and quantitative tightening, and let it cool off a minute, let it feed through, and see where we are. Otherwise, we could just have a damaging recession that doesn't really do anybody any good. And Kathy, for some of the stickier parts of inflation, like housing as well, how does that complicate the pitch and when you're really trying to navigate, how inflation is actually fairing right now? Yeah, it's really an interesting mix this time around because we've seen wholesale prices come down. We've seen producer prices. The rate of change come down. We've seen softness in certainly some of the other areas. But it complicates it because the Fed is no longer looking at their forecast because the forecast was wrong before. Now they're looking at current inflation data and that will lag the economy. So we're almost sort of manufacturing a recession or a downturn in order to get that inflation down. And the risk is it's more damaging than it needs to be to get inflation down. Well, Fed's certainly saying they'd rather do too much than too little. We have to see what that cost ends up being Kathy Jones. Thank you so much for joining us this afternoon. All right, well, we're just getting started here on Yahoo Finance Live. Coming up, Apple unveils its newest line of iPads, see what's changed and what they'll cost. Plus, we'll bring you the results of a new survey that breaks down what consumers want to see from retailers this holiday shopping season. And United earnings are on tap after the bell.

3587," Milton Ny oczywiście Apple shares erasing gains on a report it's cutting production on the iPhone 14 Plus. Yahoo! It's tech editor Dan Howley here with those details. Hey Dan, what are we learning? Yeah, this is a report from the information talking about Apple cutting the production numbers for the iPhone 14 Plus. There was previous reports from Bloomberg that they were going to cut as many as 6 million units in the second half from the iPhone 14 family. So this could be that or it could be something additionally. I think really the big thing to look at here though is that it's not from the iPhone 14 Pro line and that's really what Apple was pushing consumers towards. They put all the new features, most of the new features into the iPhone 14 Pro line and so the kind of expectation is that average selling price for the iPhone will rise as a result of that. When you look at something like the iPhone 14 Plus and its price versus the 999 for the iPhone 14 Pro consumers may simply be saying look why would I spend money on the plus when I can get the pro with the better features for a slight increase in price. It's not fully certain if this is because of a broader slowdown in iPhone sales or it's just because consumers are looking for that pro device instead. And then sticking with the gadgets we know the Apple unveiled a new iPad today. What are the details on that and of course the price. Yeah, so they have two new iPads. They have the iPad Pro and then they have the basic iPad. The iPad Pro is going to start at 799. It's available October 26 and the big deal about this is that it's the first iPad to come with the M2 chip. That's Apple's in-house processor that they built previously. iPads were running on the M1. And so this is expected to provide a 15% speed increase over the M1 iPad and a 35% increase in graphics.",https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1iVTbuGfqnQ,74,2022-10-18 19:18:28
3588, M1 and so this is expected to provide a 15% speed increase over the M1 iPad and a 35% increase in graphics processing performance. There's also a new feature for the Apple pencil that if you hold the pencil or the stylus 12 millimeters above the screen you'll get a little notification showing where you're going to start writing or drawing so that could be helpful for people who sketch or take frequent notes. This is also going to come with iPad OS 16 so you'll get the ability to do things like multitask better on this and then there's also the ability to output to a 6K monitor. So really looking for multitasking on the iPad Pro there then there's the base iPad which also got some upgrades mostly to its price. It's 449 now. It was below that prior and it's now coming with the A14 Bionic chip. That's the chip that was not in the iPhone 13 but in the iPhone 12 the iPhone 13 had the A15 and now we're on the A16 for the iPhone 14. There's also a bigger display on it. It's got a new 10.9 inch display versus the 10.2 inch screen that was previously on there. That also means that the fingerprint sensor the home button is now gone. The fingerprint sensor will be built into the power button on the side so it's more of an edge-to-edge style display and it also gets USB-C instead of a lightning cable. That iPad is going to cost you 449 and then of course Apple just announced their new Apple TV 4K. That starts at 129 and it has an A15 chip in it. All right good stuff Dan Hally looking forward to that. Thank you. Shana? Amazon securing a victory in the latest a union vote. Ali Garfinkle is following in that story and has the details for us. Hally. Hi Shana great to see you so this was a decisive loss for the Amazon labor union. 206 votes for the union. 406 votes against the union and this is kind of coming in a moment where we've actually really seen some momentum gathering around organizing in Amazon. We saw a series of walkouts last week and a Southern California warehouse is recently petitioned for an election with the NLRB looking to be represented by the Amazon labor union. I spoke to a couple experts what they're saying is that right now they're expecting the Amazon labor union to turn its attention to SoCal and kind of move on from this loss in here in New York. All right Ali Garfinkle great stuff thanks so much for staying on that story for us. One more reason to steer clear of the mall on Black Friday. Amazon announcing it will add a streaming game on Prime Video the day after Thanksgiving starting next season. The teams will be announced in May with the NFL schedule release. Prime Video paying more than a billion dollars per season for Thursday night streaming rights in a deal that runs through 2033. Amazon's VP of Prime Video Sports Marie Donahue saying quote the fact that there were no NFL games on that day. We thought we could treat it like a Super Bowl. You can see Amazon shares there on your screen. This is interesting. It was kind of inevitable once those two linked up. The thoughts were that it would happen this season but there is World Cup this year. There's a lot of college football games this year. Just one more weekend that it takes total control of our calendar. Are you excited about this for Shell? I don't I mean it's at three o'clock so I guess I could like stumble out of bed and watch it out of my sort of food cover. It's interesting because she was saying Marie Donahue was saying that these discussions about Black Friday actually began when the original contract was being negotiated but obviously as you see these incredible results it's picked up steam. It's made people more interested in it. I would tune in on what should I mean we're all sort of sitting around anyway. Why not? Yeah and I just think it's so smart. It's going to be interesting to see what they do from an advertisement perspective right more eyeballs on prime people are going to be ready to shop if they're able to integrate that somehow make it easier for people to be shopping and watching the game at the same time that's going to be a home run for them. I think right now they're wishing they did it this year just given the expectations for Black Friday sales are not exactly expected to meet what we saw last year so it would have been a good opportunity if they could have gotten it on the schedule this year but I think it's very very smart for them. It's going to be interesting to see how they're able to marry the two the game and the shopping experience. I get the sense they're not going to do that just yet from listening to Marie Donahue talk. I expected to see some barcodes up on the screen in which we could shop but realizing it as I listen to her talk their audience was not me it was not you.,https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1iVTbuGfqnQ,75,2022-10-18 19:22:06
3589," listening to Marie Donnelly talk. I expected to see some bar codes up on the screen in which we could shop. But realizing as I listen to her talk, their audience was not me, it was not you. It was not the people that are gonna watch this game. Their audience is solely the NFL commissioner Roger Gidell and the 32 owners who just want to feel comfortable that streaming is no different than NBC, CBS, or ESPN, that the stream will stay out, that it looks good, that it sounds good. Make them comfortable. These are very conservative owners that want to see the future on streaming but don't want to see integrated fantasy stats or shopping or gambling. Just one day. Yeah. It is inevitable I agree with you, but we're not quite there. Well, we will see. I do think it's a very, very smart move though from Amazon. I agree with that. All right, coming up next as the US prepares for its next move following OPEC, a plus oil cuts. Our next guest explains how President Biden something keep a cap on oil prices. Stay tuned. Oil prices retreating today as the Biden administration reportedly plans to release 10 to 15 million barrels of oil from the strategic petroleum reserve. We're joining us now is Dan Dicker, the energy word founder, good to have you back on the show. So as we're seeing here, we see WTI down about 3% today, Brent down about 1.8%. What do you make of where the oil markets are right now and the sort of factors that are weighing the heaviest on them? Well, Richelle, the fundamental picture for oil couldn't be more bullish. And we could stay with you for a long time and tell you all the bullish factors that are in the market with Russia particularly and their troubles with Ukraine. But in the last three months, the Biden administration, along with the Federal Reserve, has done a lot to dampen.",https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1iVTbuGfqnQ,76,2022-10-18 19:26:52
3590," troubles with Ukraine. But in the last three months, the Biden administration, along with the Federal Reserve, has done a lot to dampen the prices of oil and gas lean, the Biden administration by using these SPR releases, and the Federal Reserve, obviously, with their rate hikes, which have dampened oil risk assets, and along with bringing the dollar a lot stronger, have basically said to traders, look, the United States wants gas prices to be low through the midterms, and they're going to take major steps to do that. And that has scared most traders out of their lawns. And we've seen lawns in the oil market disappearing since late July. And that continues despite the OPEC cut of 2 million barrels a day, it made for a very, very short-lived rally in the oil market. Very short-lived. And I love the words right. Joe Biden is the greatest oil trader that ever lived. Why then was it such a short-lived rally? And why are we seeing prices right back down? Is it the strategic petroleum reserve release? Again, it's been all of these factors that have been going into it. It's entirely my entire career in oil, where I have posited for decades now, that financial inputs into markets like oil can have a more significant effect than even the fundamentals can for at least a short period of time. And this is how powerful these financial sort of tricks are in the oil markets. We've seen oil prices moderate more than 40 percent from a high of over $120 under 80 before that OPEC announcement. And at least until these midterms are out of the way, the signals are to traders don't get long, get out of the way, and let the United States and the central banks, not just the Federal Reserve, but the European central banks, jawbone with financial instruments, these oil prices lower. In the end, it won't make a difference because there's a huge supply problem and oil prices will rebound to the upside and very strongly. But for a long time, you can make these inputs into the oil market and keep gas prices low. And we've seen they've been very, very successful. So, how long do you expect OPEC and OPEC plus to really stay the course? A lot of people were surprised about the production cuts. Obviously, we're seeing what's happening with Ukraine and Russia. A lot of people are saying, look, it seems as if OPEC and OPEC plus taking Russia's side, those sort of geopolitical dynamics, what does that mean for the longer outlook for oil prices? Yeah, and I think that this is, you know, you can see the frustration on the part of OPEC and the oil producers in the mid-ease to rely on oil revenues for everything. And they see a fundamental picture that should allow them to get $110, $120, $130 a barrel, but are getting only $80 a barrel. And that is frustrating and they know why it's happening and they're trying to fight back to gain control of their market space. But for right now, the Federal Reserve and Joe Biden do have control of this oil market, which is why I kind of made a joke about Joe Biden being the greatest oil trader I've ever seen. He released oil about 250 million barrels and basically sold it into the marketplace at $110, $115. And now he's looking to buy it back for $80. Now, that's a heck of a trade on 250 million barrels. That's about $10 billion in profit. He's going to make the United States. That's a pretty good trade. He's become a pretty good oil trader. There was a relevant joke. So the mid-terms are less than three weeks away. Are we going to see $100 barrel by the end of the year? I don't know if it's by the end of the year, of course, because the recession talk is so massive. And therefore, it does, you know, put a damper on risk assets. But we will see sometime in 23, my prediction, new highs above $120 a barrel. The fundamental picture on oil is as bullish as I've seen in the 40 years I've been following it. And in the end, fundamentals will out. You know, we will see those prices rise. Now, a lot of people are wondering, does this necessarily mean we're going to see some more relief at the pump ahead of the midterms? You know, that's one of the main reasons we're seeing this release from the SPF. Do you think that's going to be the case? Yeah, you're going to see prices. I mean...",https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1iVTbuGfqnQ,77,2022-10-18 19:30:46
3591," more relief at the pump ahead of the midterms. We know that that's one of the main reasons we're seeing this release from the SPF. Do you think that's going to be the case? Yeah, you're going to see prices. I mean, we've seen them basically moderate. A lot of people were screaming with their pants on fire when OPEC made that announcement for a two million barrel drop. The gas prices would immediately shoot back to $5. But, you know, we kind of knew that it was going to stay. It was an unsustainable rally. And so, you know, you're seeing what, $363.70 a gallon, I don't think you're going to see $4 in any, in any shape or form before the midterms. And if it does get close to that, a Biden will make another release of the SPR and chase more traders out of the market and drop prices. Because that is the prime directive right now for the Democrats to make sure that gas prices aren't what's, what mess up for them are possible success in the midterm elections. Sure, huge ramifications for the Democratic Party. Do you expect OPEC plus to have a counter move? That was the counter move, the two million barrels. And in fact, now that they've made that counter move, they will wait until after the midterms and see if the markets will start to respond to fundamentals. And if they don't respond to fundamentals, that won't be the last cut that they announce. And they will continue to cut prices until they feel they're going to get, you know, the fundamental price that they think they deserve, which is triple digits and above. That was my question. So post midterms, you could see a further cut from OPEC, yes? They will, they will continue to cut until they see what they believe to be a fair fundamental price for oil, which is what they're not getting right now. Wow, so this battle, not over yet. Dan Dicker, the energy we're good to see, a man, good information. Thank you. All right, just a few weeks removed from comparisons to Lehman Brothers, Credit Suisse is reportedly working with some big banks on a potential capital increase. I'll find out to Zalix Andrews, someone over here with those details. Alex, good to see you. What are we learning? Good to see you. Well, Dave, more drama in the endless saga that is Credit Suisse Europe's beleaguered investment bank, which we've seen a lot of headlines in recent weeks amid concerns around its financial health. Now Credit Suisse is looking for someone to come to the rescue. The bank is reportedly in talks with Morgan Stanley and RBC about helping raise capital for potential restructuring plans and to improve its balance sheets that's according to a report from Bloomberg. I did reach out to Credit Suisse. I didn't immediately get any confirmation or comment on this. Executives are apparently scoping out every area of the business for any extra capital that they can get. This also includes reported discussions about parting ways with some of their businesses, including parts of the investment banking business and the US asset management arm. So as Credit Suisse is looking for ways to kind of improve its balance sheet and restore investor confidence, it's also now seeking third parties for help. Credit Suisse has obviously been grappling with a lot of issues in recent years around its financing, dealing with scandal after scandal, and losing a lot of faith from investors. A source has told Bloomberg that the bank would seek out at least $2 billion to cover those potential restructuring costs and operating losses as it works to do this. This is also quite a change for Credit Suisse, which typically looks to its wealthy Middle Eastern investors for help in situations like this. It did apparently reach out to the Qatar Investment Authority also for a potential capital injection here. We're gonna get more news on this on October 27th when Credit Suisse is set to announce restructuring plans. Interesting article in the Times this morning. How Switzerland's oldest bank became a meme star? That's what it is. This is certainly a great one. Interesting headline, yeah, a little bit. Alexander Seminova, good stuff. Thank you. All right, another day, another exit from Peloton. We'll tell you who's leaving the company now after the bridge. So",https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1iVTbuGfqnQ,78,2022-10-18 19:35:26
3592,"prüj All right everyone, time now for triple play. The three stocks that we're watching in the final 30 minutes of trading. We've got Lockheed Martin, Peloton and Hasbro in deck. Now might be a Lockheed Martin to get LMT, the world's largest defence contractor, really enjoying gains today after a strong Q3 showing. The stock as you can see they're up just about almost 9% there. Earnings of $6.71 per share on revenue of 16.6 billion were in line with expectations, profit speed estimates and net income coming at $1.78 billion. Aerospace and their space businesses really leading the way there. Now when a statement CEO James Takley said Lockheed Martin delivered a solid quarter, highlighted by strength in free cash flow, orders and operating margins that positions us well to achieve our four year commitments. Now we're seeing this patient really paying off for investors. Lockheed also announcing a $14 billion share by-back authorization and they expect to execute a $4 billion accelerated sharey purchase programme in Q4. Now that's an interesting timing because it's before that new tax on by-backs kicks in in January. Now while Lockheed also has a $140 billion backlog of future orders, growth isn't expected to really accelerate until 2024 as some of their investments in hypersonic missiles and other futuristic innovations really need a bit more time to pay off. Yeah, Michelle, when you take a look at the jump today, it's the biggest intraday game that we've actually seen in just about two years. So putting today's gains into perspective here. One of the leaders in the SMB also want to point out an interesting part of this report is that Lockheed actually plans to drop its traditional fall guidance and I bring this up because they are believing supply chain issues for the reason that they're doing this and this has really been used as a guide here in terms of industry-wide. What we could expect here going forward. So when Lockheed does drop that guidance in 2024, it'll be interesting to see what that means for the industry and just in terms of their metrics and what they use to gauge demand going forward. All right. Well, my pick today is Peloton. Two big stories for the stock. Another executive is leading and the company is also extending. It's refund window for its tread plus. So starting with the refund existing users will now have another year until November 2023 to get their money back for.",https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1iVTbuGfqnQ,79,2022-10-18 19:39:29
3593," also extending its refund to window for its tread plus. So starting with the refund existing users will now have another year until November 2023 to get their money back for their tread mills and news coming as a company is still working on a fix for that treadmill. The US Consumer Product Safety Commission writing in a statement that Peloton is still working on that rear guard to address the hazard of the back at the back of the treadmill plus no repair has been approved yet. We also have more changes coming to the top for Peloton on the second part of this story today. Chief People Officer Sherry Eton is leaving the company her departure. It's just the latest in a series of C-suite Resonation changes that we have seen play out in Peloton and Dave Eton are talking another day, another headline coming from Peloton. Yeah, I mean they're competing with Elon Musk in terms of just sipping from the rear of the news. But the treadmill itself, when you look at it, you can see the injuries happening. It's raised off the ground. There's a considerable gap between the belt and the floor. You look, juggernaut 330 incidents, 87 injuries, surprising it took this long. But I got a question because we're all together. Biggest impact of the retail partnerships. Amazon, Dix or Hilton Hotels. What do you got? I think it's going to be Hilton Hotels. I do as well. It's hard. I would say that at least Hilton and Dix give you a chance to try the product. But Amazon in terms of pricing competition, but they had the big deals for prime day. You had a lot of people buying it there. So if perhaps the price is right, because when you look at the price of the treadmill, they're rowing machine, that's a little too much for people. But if you can get the pricing right and get that good introduction, I think they get more people on board. I agree with Hilton's. I think people need to try it. They need to see that they like it. They won't try it at Dix. They can't try it at Amazon, but we will discuss because they'll be in the news tomorrow. My play is Hasbro reporting sales dropped 15% in the third quarter as we head for the holidays. The Eocris Cox saying during the earnings call that the company is seeing, quote, average consumer becoming increasingly price sensitive as the year has progressed. Hasbro reported net income of 129 million. That's down from 253 million one year earlier. Hasbro like many in the sector had inflated inventory and as a result leaned heavily into promotions, cutting profits. They are optimistic though about an unprecedented lineup of entertainment and Q4 that of course starts with Wakanda forever, which will be released on November 11th. What are shares doing there down about 3% on the day and down 35% year to day? This just jumped out of me, Rochelle, because look, almost every earnings we've seen hasn't shown the calamitous predictions of recession. This is the first one to show at least a bit of a weakening consumer in the holiday season. Not a disaster, but at least a hint of what might be coming. It's interesting because when you bring up the idea of inventory, it's different if you're selling something like towels, but things like toys, they're trendy, they're seasonal. People don't want lost-years toys that are just now coming in when you have things like Wakanda forever coming up. They want the newest, the latest. That might be a more unique headwind if you're someone who's in toy sales. This is a company that has struggled year to date off 36%. I thought it was interesting though looking at the analyst commentary after we got these results. MKM was out and they actually took a positive spin. Obviously, for this current quarter, the results weren't too strong, but they were reassured just in terms of the fact that Hasbro reaffirmed their guidance. That was enough for them to at least not be bearish on the stock for now, but you mentioned that 36% drop for shares. The fact that it's been under tremendous amount of pressure going into holiday season, if they don't see, they're not too bullish, it could be a couple of rough quarters ahead. That's a big Q4. Alright, well coming up next holiday season is here holiday shopping season, not even Halloween yet. We've got a closer look at new data on what consumers are expecting from retailers this year.",https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1iVTbuGfqnQ,80,2022-10-18 19:43:53
3594," Nice, I found it, let's do it. The holidays will be here before we know it and shoppers are already getting a head start out from the junior market. We've got a new survey out from ICSC found that 3 quarters are planning to buy gifts far in advance capitalizing on the trend of early season deals. Here for more on that. We want to bring in Tom McGee. He's a CEO of ICSC. Tom, it's great to see you again. Let's start with this survey because you were tracking how much people are looking to spend when they are planning to spend it. And on what? Let's start with that when part 75% are looking to shop early. Does that mean that we're already in the middle of the Solidarity Shopping season? Yeah, it does. Well, first of all, good afternoon. It's good to be with you again. Also, and yes, we're got you. No, we got you. How you got me? OK, OK. First of all, good afternoon. And it does mean we're in the middle of the holiday season. Holiday season starts earlier. That trend really began a pre-pandemic, but has accelerated now post-pandemic in an inflationary environment with a price-conscious consumer looking for deals and being very selective and their shopping habits. They kind of make sense that people would start shopping earlier. We do expect it to be a solid holiday season. We're cautiously optimistic that despite the uncertainty and concerns around inflation, which are real, that consumers will shop this season where our expectation is for 6.7% retail sales growth, and almost 10% growth in people going out dining over the holiday season. Well, almost 10% increase on dining. We talked about that early shopping. Amazon Prime at their October day, target, and Walmart both had competing events is Black Friday dead. It's an iconic day, for sure. But I think that Black Friday's importance in the holiday shopping season isn't what it once was. With a longer holiday season, Black Friday is one of many important days during the holiday shopping season. And Tom, when it comes to promotional activity, we've heard from a number of CEOs on recent earnings calls, anyone from Target to Nordstrom, that they're planning heavy discounts. I guess from your perspective, how does this year's promotional activity...",https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1iVTbuGfqnQ,81,2022-10-18 19:48:15
3595," a number of CEOs on recent earnings calls, anyone from Target to Nordstrom that they're planning heavy discounts. I guess from your perspective, how does this year's promotional activity compare to what we've seen in the past? You know, I would expect there to be more promotional activity this year than what we saw last year. You know, the environment's different than what we were experiencing last year. There was certainly a lot of enthusiasm and pent-up demand as we got back into live shopping and a lot of our holiday traditions. We still have a lot of enthusiasm but certainly more concern around pricing. And so I think one way that retailers will differentiate themselves is a focus upon promotions and being selective and how they price things. You know, this is a price conscious consumer right now. They're continue to spend and we continue to see retail sales growth. But certainly the level of consumer confidence and concern around pricing and inflation is at a very high level. Top for years we've heard about the death of brick and mortar stores and then some surprising numbers this year retail vacancies 6.1% lowest since 2015. More stores open and closed in 21. First time in 27 years is there a shift away from online shopping or how do you explain this trend? Yeah, retail real estate. If you would have closed your eyes going into the pandemic a lot of people would have assumed that this was going to be devised at retail real estate and the opposite is really happened. It's been a rebirth and a renaissance four times in many store openings and closings this year. And really it's a combination of factors. Certainly the convergence between online and physical is upon and real. Stores are being utilized in a whole host of ways for traditional shopping but also for fulfillment. Whether that's shipping from stores or consumers coming and doing click and collect and curbside pickup. And having retailers have really understood the importance of having a physical store to build their brand and their relationship with consumers. Online acquisition costs are significant and online only retail is not very profitable. And certainly a focus and profitability is also helping the physical retail space. So there's a whole confluence of things that have come together. But the store is here to stay and it's prominent in retail is back where it belongs. Tell me, now you just said the store is here to stay but I want to ask you about this online trend in the journal today they were talking about the big bet that brands are making on live stream shopping. When you take a look at the success at least that we've seen in this space in China compared to what we've seen here in the US, I guess do you think we could have a similar type of success here in the US and how critical do you see this being for the future of brands? Well, I think the whole use of media and technology and shopping is continued to evolve and mature over really the last 20 plus years. So I do think there's a role for live streaming and there's a role for a whole host of media and shopping. So I think ultimately it will just enhance and adjust the shopping experience. But I don't think what we've seen over the course of the last 20 years is that really these things come together and consumers find the right balance. I don't think live stream shopping is going to, in some way diminish online or physical retail. I just think it'll be part of a compliment of things that are at a tool chest or retailer will provide. Very interesting retail season ahead IS. ICS, CCEO, Tom McGee, good to see you sir, thank you. I had more drama in the Elizabeth Holmes case. We'll tell you the details and what comes next after the break.",https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1iVTbuGfqnQ,82,2022-10-18 19:52:24
3596,"icians and How to Apply Convected Silicon Valley entrepreneur Elizabeth Holmes is now waiting for a judge to decide if she'll get a new trial. Holmes and her lawyers went to court yesterday to argue she deserves a redo after a jury in January found her guilty of using her blood testing company Theranos to defraud investors. The finances Alexis Keenan joins us with the details now. So what do we need to know here? What is the likelihood she'll be successful? So probably slim. That's what former prosecutors tell me, but the purpose of this hearing yesterday was to question Theranos's former laboratory director who was a key witness for the prosecution. His name is Adam Rosendorf, Dr. Adam Rosendorf. And he made a last minute visit after the trial to the homes that, to the home that Holmes shares with our partner Billy Evans. And according to Holmes and Evans, he had expressed that he tried to testify truthfully at the trial, but that the government made it sound worse than things really were at Theranos. But he got up on the stand yesterday. He was questioned under oath at which time he stood by his trial testimony. And that's really the key because if you stand by your trial testimony, what the judge is interested in is whether you testify truthfully. And if you did, that really declines Elizabeth Holmes' chances for getting a new trial. So things not looking very good for Holmes there. So this is probably, and I'll just say probably with a little caveat there, the last time we'll see Holmes in court before she is either maybe granted a new trial, which the judge will decide sometime after October 24 on that matter or her sentencing, which is scheduled for November 18th. Also though, and I'll throw a wild card in with this case, there's always one. Holmes, there were rumors that she may be pregnant with her second child. Certainly that could change things for the trajectory of the case because if she's pregnant and she has to go ahead and deliver a baby, that could impact when she would potentially go to prison. So I think we can expect to see some additional motions here if that is the case. The reporters that were in the courtroom said she appeared visibly pregnant. So we can expect that maybe that will delay things even further. Wild card indeed. You think this case is done with a new ring.",https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1iVTbuGfqnQ,83,2022-10-18 19:57:26

Thank you as always, Alexis Keenan there for us. All right, well coming up, we're counting down to the closing bell, Wall Street. Stick with us here on Yahoo Finance line. Two minutes to go in the treating day, we're still looking at gains down on S&P, both up just about 1% and almost happened today as well. Now let's take a look inside the market sector action today. Everything has been in the green. I believe the entire day or at least most of it industrials in the lead that's up 2% followed by materials. Those are on the backs of a declining dollar utilities also in the lead along with financials consumer discretionary and real estate. Even staples all of those are more than 1% all of them are under outperforming excuse me what's under performing health care communication services tech and energy. Let's take a look inside some of our market leaders and sentiment indicators only emerging markets in the red right now. We're seeing some love for solar stock gambling stocks home stocks internet stocks software IPOs our components and retail as well. Taking a look at our meme stock board here we can see a lot of green kind of an indication of risk appetite we got Robin Hood in the green for 2% so is game stop also macy's is up more than 3.5% after the bell we're going to take a look at net flip",https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1iVTbuGfqnQ,84,2022-10-18 20:01:01

After the bell, we're going to take a look at Netflix earnings that is coming out imminently and looking at the Nasdaq 100. We're talking retail before Amazon up more than two percent PepsiCo is staple up more than one percent. And let's take a look at our travel board as we head into the into the closing bell. We got Delta Airlines. That's up more than three percent. United, we're going to bring in those earnings to you in about 30 minutes. And that's up three percent Royal Caribbean up seven percent. Here's your closing bell. There you have it. How your market's a close for Tuesday. Let's take a look. We're seeing the down there ending the day up about 1.1 percent. The Nasdaq bear up just shy of a percent only S&P 500 up also by a percent there. So some positivity in the market today will see how short lived or long lived that might end up being or break down the market action with our guests. Now let's bring in Christian to do cap trust director of investments and Francis Newton Stacey, optimal capital director of strategy. Welcome to you both. So Christian, what do you make of the current market that we're in at the moment in terms of what they're digesting knowing that the Fed isn't going to change course anytime soon? Well, I think we had a bit of a panic about a week we can have to go when we saw the news at a UK with their pension system problems. But when it was reassured that we did not have the same systemic kinds of risk in the US, we recovered a lot of that. But I don't think that the market is clear in the way until we know where the Fed's going. And frankly, a lot of market participants are starting to think maybe the Fed is going to be a little too fast here and should slow down. Francis, what has rally the markets the last two days? Just the fact that it was oversold, just the fact that you know, bonds and the NASDAQ have lost over 30% this year and people are starting to think it's cheap. And I think there's a contingency of traders that thinks that the Fed is not going to make it with their hawkish sentiments. And particularly due to the liquidity crisis in the UK, you know, we could easily have that over here as well as we reduce the money supply at a record rate. And so I think traders are starting to think, well, the Fed may have to pivot even if it doesn't want to to protect the system. And they have proven to do so in the third quarter of 19 when they had a spike in the overnight, you know, overnight rates in the market because of tax payments and they did so during COVID. So that's what I think some of those pivot traders are starting to get a little trigger happy again, thinking the Fed's not going to make it even though we have two more 75 basis point hike priced into the Fed Fed funds futures. Some friends, what does that mean for downside risk? Because here we are today with the S&P back above 3700. It looks like you might think that we have some downward moves here ahead. What does that potentially look like? Well, you know, we could have a rally, for instance, if the Fed decides that they're not going to make it through those two hikes or if they change their sentiment whatsoever, we could see a rally in risk assets. But the thing is is that the twos and the pens are inverted by 80 basis points and that's, you know, pretty extreme going back to the 80s and the swaps market and, you know, the corporate on, you know, the corporate overtreesuries, you know, the option of adjusted market there is those spreads are, you know, widening slowly. And so the credit risk is starting to get priced in. We've got 61% of people living paycheck to paycheck in America. The credit card usage is going up every time we, you know, raise rates that that service is getting very onerous. And so, you know, in the background, we're pricing in a hard landing, which is a credit event. And so the question, obviously, this is all happening while we're getting into the thick of earnings season. What are you expecting in terms of Ford guidance, given some of these pressures? Well, we've seen a few of them already. Some of the food companies have shared that they've passed on prices very successfully. I think we all know that the volume of the economy is starting to slow down, but we're not seeing it in pricing data. And that's, you know, these companies are conduit for inflation. And their pricing power is being demonstrated here. And I don't think that they're going to give that up at minimum, they'll slow down their price increases or keep them.",https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1iVTbuGfqnQ,85,2022-10-18 20:05:27
3599," And their pricing power is being demonstrated here. And I don't think that they're going to give that up. At minimum, they'll slow down their price increases or keep them flat while at the same time working on costs. So I would expect that you're going to see some layoff announcements in Q3 or at least implied in some of the guidance for margins. And that'll hold stocks up. That'll hold earnings expectations up pretty well for next year. And then on the flip side of what's happening in the market, you've got really cheap valuations. So if those earnings can show that they are durable, I think investors will welcome that with some higher prices. Christian, you say you're seeing inflation coming down. And what data? Oh, just the real-time commodity numbers. We've seen, well, food is continued to stay high. Even the Zillow home indices show that there's roll over in actual prices transacting. But you're not going to see that in the inflation data that the Fed tracks, because that is just lagging. Friends, what do you make of the strong dollar? Obviously, a headwind year, we've heard it a number of times from corporations over the last week, we can have. We heard it during second quarter earnings. How big of a risk? Could you see this being at least over the coming quarters? Well, obviously, it's putting a lot of pressure on emerging markets. The thing is that the strong dollar is not going to remain at the Fed pivot thread. I'm watching $1,250 as a line of support or resistance coming down or going up. And that's the thing. So I'm watching the dollar, the 10 year, and I'm watching gold, and I'm watching the corporate spread, and I'm watching this inversion, and I'm watching the swap to see when one of these things indicates that there's something else occurring with traders, because actually the Fed can control the discount rate, but they only really give an estimate for the Fed funds rate, and then that's actually priced in by traders. They've had to remain quite hawkish in their narrative so that traders don't try to anticipate a pivot as they didn't July, and then once again, in September, and undo those tighter financial conditions. And as far as inflation goes, most of those components, even though the prices have dropped precipitously, for oil and gas, you've seen that come down. That has a one to two month lag, and a CPI reading, food has between a four and a eight month lag and a CPI reading. The thing that's going to keep CPI sticky for quite a while is owners equivalent rent. Owners equivalent rent makes up about a third of the CPI, and because housing has become so unaffordable, with mortgage rates hitting the seven handle, those rents are going to remain quite high, and then it takes 18 months for that third of CPI to come down on a lag effect. And so that keeps the narrative for the Fed very strong and the limit yet, and so that keeps those narratives in place because they're so lagging, so the Fed can remain hawkish until something breaks, so that they actually then know where the liquidity threshold is for the amount of debt, because we put a lot of new fiscal and monetary money into the system. We're trying to take that money out of the system, but you can't remove the debt from the system. Thank you, Christian. With those narratives in mind there, you're saying that stock valuations are getting really attractive, but what is cheap and actually good in looking attractive to you right now, out of what's out there? Well, I think you've seen a better out performance in cyclical stocks recently, and a lot of cyclicals are trading at sub 10 times earnings, even on lower expected earnings in 2023. I think the analysts have done a decent job at forecasting where earnings are going to trend in places like home builders and steel companies, chemical companies. And if you can get a sub 10 PE on a lower 2023 estimate, you've probably got a pretty good entry point. And I would say one thing about rates here, so everybody's talking about these lagging effects, including your other guest here, higher rates have a lagging effect too. These are going to have to hit the economy over time. We can only hope that the Fed realizes that soon enough that the higher rates are already having a big impact. All right, Christian, the view, and Francis Newton, Stacey, thank you both, much appreciated. All right, some big earnings, news now just coming in, Netflix shares jumping after hours up more than 11% on a terrific report. Jared Blickery here with the numbers. Hey, man, hey there. Let's start with the headline number here. Streaming paid net changes. So was estimating 1 million guess what?",https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1iVTbuGfqnQ,86,2022-10-18 20:09:56
3600," Now just coming in, Netflix shares jumping after hours up more than 11% on a terrific report. Jared Blickery here with the numbers. Hey man. Hey there. Let's start with the headline number here. Streaming paid net changes. Oh, it was estimating 1 million. Guess what? They came in at 2.4, 1 million for the third quarter. Stream paid memberships at total comes to 223.09 million, up 4.5% year over year. Revenue also beating expectations that came in at 7.93 billion versus estimates of 7.85 billion small beat there. Operating margin, 19.3% versus the estimate of 15.9%. So really a lot more efficient there than people than the street thought at least. EPS earnings per share coming at $3.10 for the quarter versus estimates of $2.12. So huge beat there. Lots of concern over not only their expenses, but also their subscribers. Free cash flow. Here's another one ending the quarter at 472 million versus estimates of 1.8 for 184.2 million. So more than double the expected amount. Also coming from a negative number, we'll recall that from the last quarter. Now for the current quarter, that is a fourth fiscal quarter. They're seeing streaming paid net change of 4.5 million. The estimate was for 3.9 million. So better on that front. Seeing revenue of 7.78 billion. That's a little bit lower than estimates of 7.98 billion. EPS, that is expected to be 36 cents. Quite a bit lower than the estimate of $1.20. And paid memberships at total coming to 227.59 million expected versus estimates of 225.7 million. Also seeing operating margin of 4.2%. Now starting with the fourth quarter, 22 letter, in January of next year. So that's coming in at the end of January. We're going to provide, this is a company, is going to continue to provide guidance for revenue, operating income, operating margin, net income, EPS, and fully diluted shares outstanding for the following quarter. But no guidance for paid memberships. So I think that's an interesting point that's going to get some questions on the call here, guys. Jared Blyckery with the Netflix earnings report. Thank you, my friend. Good to see you. It is an impressive report. Beat on the top, beat on the bottom, and a crush on sub-adding $2.4 million after the first ever back-to-back quarters in which Netflix lost subscribers. There ain't much to not like in this report, especially as we get to the biggest question, which is how does this add to your impact the stock and help the shares we now know it's seven bucks a month? What jumps out to you, Shana? There isn't much not to like in this report. The one thing I would point out is that Netflix actually coming in a bit light in terms of their fourth quarter revenue guidance. They're expecting $7.78 billion. The estimate out there from the street was for $7.98 billion. So that is a miss there, but you're right, Dave. Investors looking beyond that shareholder's really focusing on that subscriber growth number. I think we were all expecting a pretty wheat quarter here from Netflix. We didn't really expect us to really, the company to really return to strong growth when it comes to subscribers until the current quarter here when they are launching that add supported tier. So 2.41 million new subs during the quarter, Richelle, very, very strong report here from Netflix. I also wanted to point out that the company did say will not provide pay subscriber forecasts starting in the fourth quarter, so any more information. On that, I think is something that people will want to hear. Of course, it makes you question just in terms of why they're doing that. I think we can all point to the fact that we are seeing slowing growth, but that is an important tidbit to point out in this report. And you mentioned that slowing revenue growth. And they said that it was the result of competition, account sharing, and other factors that they hopefully then now will be addressing by adding this add tier as well as that people can pay less, perhaps share passwords. But I mean, this was, I mean, rocketing, 2.4 million subscribers after we saw all that fuss over, for the first time when they had their subscriber losses and they were like, well, we're not going to be basing in on that anymore because of the competition. I wonder if they're re-changing their tier now that they've got this bumper addition here. So I mean, this beat on the top on the bottom really surprising. And it just goes to show Netflix not out of the woods yet. Obviously, a lot of competition in this space still, but Netflix still has a lot of fight, still investing in some of the big budget productions as well. So a lot to like in this report. Yeah, again, the new add supported tier will debut in November 699 a month. That, of course, is going to be a key focus on the earnings call that will get underway soon.",https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1iVTbuGfqnQ,87,2022-10-18 20:14:20
3601," A lot to like in this report. Yeah, again, the new ad supported here will debut in November 699 a month. That, of course, is going to be a key focus on the earnings call that will get underway soon. And we, of course, will have more on Netflix here coming up. But I want to switch gears here and look at United because this stock moving to the upside following its earnings and beat here. You look at that. Chairs up just around 4% revenue coming at a 12.9 billion. That was better than what the street was looking for. Adjusted EPS 281. The S&M on the street was 229. So beat there on both the top and bottom lines. Third quarter available seat miles coming at 67.7 billion. S&M out there for 66.9 billion. A couple of comments from United COVID recovery turned to overcome recessionary pressure. That's a bullish sign here for the company as there was some fear that people would begin to pull back in spending because of the slowing economy. They also expect fourth quarter adjusted operating margin to exceed 2019 level. So that beat on the top and bottom line, the bullish commentary there. Dave, from executives in this release, really adding to the momentum that we're seeing after hours now, the stock up nearly 6%. On top of what we saw from Delta Airlines just about a week ago, and I hate to be the bearer of bad news. But if you are the Fed chair and you're seeing these numbers, this is another inflationary story. This is not the news the Fed wants to see. This is not the news you want to see if you expect the Fed to pause. Not one bit, you know why? Because airfares are up 8% month over month. And a staggering 43% year over year and yet they're not seeing demand destruction. Rochelle, that's great news for United and for their shareholders. That is bad news in terms of the Fed story in this country. I mean, it really is. And we've been talking for a while about when we're going to start seeing this demand destruction. The prices are not going down. This is still not deterring people. We were saying, oh, perhaps this is sort of the post-COVID buildup. We're now heading into the holiday season, even when you look ahead to the next quarter, demand still not slowing down. So I don't know what it's going to take for consumers to pull back on that spending. We're seeing them pull back in other areas, but not on this. And you have to factor in, obviously, they're paying these inflated prices. So obviously, it's going to be boosting airlines' profits. But the consumer not letting go. Not at all. It's the case that we need massive job losses in order to bring inflation down to even 4% let alone the Fed's target of two. But certainly a solid report from Netflix and from United. Straight ahead, Netflix shares, skyrocketing after that big earnings beat will get an analyst take right after the break.",https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1iVTbuGfqnQ,88,2022-10-18 20:18:35
3602," GitHub. Let's go. Ned Flick shares soaring. Look at that up 14% after hours following its quarterly earnings beat here to break it down further in Santos. Rao, Manhattan Venture Partners, head of research. Santos, I'm old enough to remember when we graded films, two thumbs up, Cisco and Abort. But let's just go. No one knows what that is because Shana is too young. Those were shale. One to ten based on your expectations. What do you grade this Netflix earnings report? I would say A+. From where it was coming from, I think it's back to growth. It's doing everything from a position of strength now. Because the big concern was, are they rushing into this act to your model from a position of weakness? Is their whole business model not working? I think this shows that everything's working. They're just layering on another layer of revenue source. So I think this is a good quarter across the board, good in terms of revenue growth, I mean, subscriber growth. And even the numbers, the top line, bottom line, everything seems to be on track doing well. I think Netflix is back in the saddle, so to speak. So Sandosh, as we dig down into what Netflix has done differently over this past quarter to really get these sorts of results, what do you attribute that to? Well, I think one thing is Netflix was never out. I think what happened was there was this pre-pandemic, this pandemic pull forward, and it was adjusting to all that. So I think there was a lot of moving parts. And it had to adjust to this post-pandemic world. And then it's the new competitive landscape. I think it's got all its strategy together at this point. It's executing. They had good content slate this quarter. They have good coming up also. So I think that's the beauty of Netflix. They have good content, good stickiness. The churn is low. It was pretty high for some time. But I think last quarter, but I think that's kind of moderating. It's coming down to reasonable levels. And that's the thing. It's just keep on producing good content. And keep the stickiness going. And be aware that competition is nipping away at your heels. So you just need to keep on keeping on. And that's what Netflix is doing very well. Sanders, one thing sticking out to me in this report. Netflix is not going to provide guidance, a propane membership as of next quarter, the fourth quarter letter, just from an analyst perspective. What's your reaction to this? And of course, do you think that this is just because of the slowing growth that we have simply seen from Netflix over the most recent quarters? No, I think that makes it a little difficult. But I think right now, there are some unknowns. We don't know how many people will get the tier ad tier. We don't know. There's going to be a lot of movement within their subscriber base. We don't know where the chips are going to fall. We think it's just going to be incrementally positive adding on this ad tier. So it's going to be a good backstop for people who want to leave the platform. They can just come back to a lower tier. So they can just concast us, kind of entice them to stay on with a lower price point. So there are a lot of good advantages to having the ad tier in their whole revenue mix. Revenue mix. So I think that's the thing. It's overall, I would say it's on the right track. Do you expect there be, I don't know the number. Do you have an expectation on people trading down their subscription to the ad tier from say, you know, the 20 bucks a month that a lot of people do pay?

And what do we know about the password sharing that they're tweaking in Latin America, how significant a revenue generator do you expect it to be? Yeah, I think it's going to be definitely net additive down the road. We still don't know how well it's going to be. They're still trying out in various markets. Overall, I think with at least 15 to 20% of their pace of the 100 million non paying the password sharing base will come on immediately by next like 15 up to 15 million new subscribers will come on next by next year and more later on. So that's the big unknown. I think if they're playing around, they need to do different things, tweak different, it's a lot of competition, competition to get it all right. So, but overall there are options, they're creating options. And we'll wait and see. I think at this point, my estimate is about 7 million next year, by next year we'll have 7 million in the North American base and then overall about 15 million overall in the ad tier market. That's what I'm talking about. So I had tiered layer. I think that's what. So it's a lot of numbers, 15 million here, 20 million there. We don't know yet. There's no precise number because we still haven't seen the full rollout yet, but net net, it will be additive. We'll let's wait and see what the uptake rate is. Hopefully it'll be very good because the content should be good and will be good. I'm sure and they need to be good rather. So and they'll do it. Next Netflix executes properly very well. And they know what the downfall is. There is competition, they need to execute, they need the good content. They invest 17 to 18 billion content. So I think they'll get it right. And Sam, I want to ask you about the international markets because they're saying excluding the foreign exchange impact that revenue grew 13% Euro via an average revenue per membership grew 8%. Talk about the impact of the foreign exchange, the foreign exchange impact. And also what lies ahead in terms of international growth for Netflix? Well, international growth is a key aspect of its whole growth story. They need that based on growth. I mean, North America is pretty much saturated. So it's now about taking market share from other people, other bases are adding on from the linear TV people. But overall, international is where the growth is. And the effects impact is going to be huge. And if there is a slight miss on the 4Q number, it's probably because of the effects impact and a few other things. So I think probably they want to be conservative in terms of projecting their 4Q estimates. But 4Q guidance. But overall, I think for a strong dollar is a big negative. It weighs on their numbers. And it will weigh on. But that's where the growth is. That's where the next leg up is in international markets. And they continue to do it. They have the market share outside the US. St. Teresa Ernie's call is going to get underway here pretty soon. A lot of the focus is going to be on that ad here that you have already mentioned. What else are you looking to hear from executives this afternoon? Yeah, I want to see how their expense management, cost management is going. That's what they said. They're going to focus on the free cash flow. We'll be here about that. And basically, the whole focus is going to be on the ad here. What their projections are, how they think it'll roll out, and what they expect, and also the passport sharing. So there's more color on those two aspects. And other than that, let's see if they can just throw some more light on the slate, content slate coming up. And what their plan is for 2023. And if this momentum will continue, how confident they are about the future. I think that's the tone we want to hear. And I think we'll see that. They can certainly be confident today based on what we've seen with the share price. A big thank you to St. Joshua Alfa joining us this afternoon. Thank you. All right, coming up. Office occupancy rates across the US are hitting their highest levels since the start of the pandemic. We'll tell you how full they are after the break.",https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1iVTbuGfqnQ,90,2022-10-18 20:27:06
3604," Good jobyah! Let's talk RTO. Now offices in the U.S. cities are getting busier lately. According to new data from Castle Systems offices here in New York City, hit nearly 48% occupancy last week, marking a post-pandemic hide. That's up nearly four whole points from just two weeks prior. Castle's 10 city average saw a similar uptick as well, reaching 49% for the nationwide average that to a post-pandemic peak. But it also bears the question, what level will we ever get back to? It does not appear, well, let's just dismiss with the notion that we're ever going to get to 100% of pre-pandemic numbers. Those days are gone, say goodbye employers. But Rochelle, how high do you think we get in 75% of the ceiling? I'm not quite sure if we even get there. I mean, a lot of employees are still figuring out how to get the employees back in. Even though you have the office space you're seeing some of these commercial rents starting to come down a little bit, still not encouraging people to come in though. We know that some of the numbers are a little bit skewed though in the data because you have cities like Austin, Texas where they have offices that are two thirds full. So that's perhaps, when you think of the averages, it's maybe not as rosy as it appears. But I mean, I think they might be lucky if they even get to 75% occupancy as early as really. Yeah, 75% is a huge jump from where we are today. You have to think that we might, that we would pretty much be back at this point just in terms of the people who do plan to return to work. The companies that do plan to make it mandatory. Of course, we have heard more and more announcements come out over the last couple of months. I don't know how much more head, headway we are going to make from here. We're still below 50%. I think we're going to get above that 50% number. I'm not so sure that we're going to actually push above 60%. When you take a look though, Dave, and I wanted to point this out to you. I know you take the Metro North. I do. I know North trains hit 74% of their 2019 average, which is interesting to me.",https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1iVTbuGfqnQ,91,2022-10-18 20:31:41
3605," I wanted to point this out to you. I know you take the Metro North. I do. Metro North trains hit 74% of their 2019 average, which is interesting to me. So the Metro North, it looks like a lot of people from your neck of the woods are the ones that are coming back into the office, 74%. That jump dot to me was much higher than what I was anticipating to see given these office occupancy numbers. Funny to have you say that, because that was the first number that jumped down to me. I live in an entirely commuter town. All of them commute to New York City. Well, how is that number so high if New York City is nearly 30 points below it? Yeah. And that is a discrepancy that I cannot account for, but also based on that, interesting that reveals Wednesday is the most full day, then Tuesday and then Monday. But easily Wednesday is the winner in terms of the Metro North train commute. But ultimately as we move forward, if we have a recession, and then employers have a bit more power with Shell, maybe that is the thing that ticks that number up. Sure to that, I don't see it can ever even get near 60% again. It's true. If we can get labor force participation back up, you're getting more people back into the offices, not because of a hybrid situation, but because of a recession, because of the actual monetary need for it, perhaps you could see a shift in there. But even then, some people still would rather work from home or have some sort of remote options. They'd rather, but the power dynamic would shift. Exactly. You wouldn't really have the upper hand anymore when it comes to the employee. All right, we'll have to leave it there. But coming up a new study reveals that more women in leadership and leaving their companies at the highest rate in years. The authors of that study tell us why next. A new survey out highlighting and alarming trend in the workforce, women leaders are leaving their jobs at the highest rate on record. And it could have serious implications.",https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1iVTbuGfqnQ,92,2022-10-18 20:36:09
3606," A new survey out highlighting and alarming trend in the workforce. Women leaders are leaving their jobs at the highest rate on record and it could have serious implications for companies joining us now are the co-authors of this report of women in the workplace. We want to bring in Rachel Thomas, CEO of Lean End and we have Lurian A.E. McKenzie, senior partner. Rachel, let me start with you just in terms of the fact that women are leaving the workforce, especially women in leadership positions. What do you attribute this to? So you're absolutely right. We're in the midst of a big break up. Women are leaving their companies at the highest rate we've seen and at a higher rate than men leaders and we want to be clear women leaders are just as embarrassed as men, but they're looking for more opportunity and they're placing a higher premium on the culture of work. They want more flexibility. They want to work for companies that are deeply committed to diversity, equity, inclusion and employee wellbeing and to give you a sense of the scale of the problem. For every woman director who's getting promoted, two women directors are leaving their company. That's one up and two out. So the matches to companies is they need to figure out how to hold onto those precious women leaders. So Lurian, what do they need to do? What are some of these women in leadership roles? What are they asking for that they're not getting from the companies that they're leaving? That's a great question. So what we're seeing is we're seeing an enormous number of headwinds for women and we're also seeing a change in stance in terms of what women are thinking about. So in terms of the headwinds, imagine you go to work. 40% of the women we surveyed said that they had other people take credit for their ideas on a regular basis. There are two times more likely than men to be mistaken for someone more junior. And there are just a really long list of these slights and cuts day to day that take away their experience. And what boils down to is companies are sending women signals that they're not going to advance because of these experiences, but also because the extra work that they do, the performance that they give, it's not always reflected in their performance reviews. And so that's what's happening on the headwind side. On the other side of that, women are saying, wait a second, I'm ambitious, positively ambitious, I'm talented. I actually might go try somewhere else. And what's critical is they're not breaking up with work. They're just breaking up the companies that they're at. Rachel, I mean, this is the largest study on the state of women in corporate America. What are you hoping that people take away for these findings? What are you hoping they're actually going to do? Well, so for the last eight years, we've been reporting that there's a broken wrong at the first step up to manager. So every 100 men promote the demander last year, only 87 women were in 82 women of color. So that's one pipeline problem. Now we have this new pipeline problem that women are leaving their companies at the highest rate ever. So we want this to be a wake up call to corporate America because we know that women leaders are precious. But not only underrepresented, they're more likely to be investing in lifting up employees, good people management. They're more likely to be fostering inclusion on their team. And they're more likely to be showing up as allies. And we also know business results are better when there's more women and more diverse leadership. So it's about the numbers, but it's also holding on to the women who are driving the change in organizations that we need to see right now. We're into this study also broke it down by company specific roles. I noticed a massive deep underrepresentation of women in technical roles from companies in this sector that are doing it right that are able to attract women into these jobs. Any idea what they're doing? Yeah, so a couple things. So in 2018, we saw that technical roles women only had 18% share of those jobs. And today we see that number has gone down to 16%. And you may be asking why is that so important? Well, one of the things is when we look at economic growth, when we look at job growth, technical roles, either in engineering, data science, all of these types of roles, that's where job growth is in America. And we see such a small participation of women. And you can't just say it's an education pipeline problem. It actually is also the responsibility of companies to recruit more, to invest in the career development, in the training, and also the ability to advance. And so this is a really big mess. A huge mess here. And Rachel, this troubling study coming at a time when we're seeing the economy slow down, all the reversessions seem to be rising almost on a daily basis. What do you think that this will potentially do just in turn?",https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1iVTbuGfqnQ,93,2022-10-18 20:40:14
3607," Troubling study coming at a time when we're seeing the economy slow down, all the reversations seem to be rising almost on a daily basis. What do you think that this will potentially do just in terms of further complicating that gender gap? Yeah, it's interesting. Certainly the recession will likely have an impact on the dynamics we're seeing, but I actually think we've seen a sheet shift. Employees saw what companies were able to do as a result of the pandemic. They invested in flexibility in a way that we'd never seen. They invested in employee wellbeing at levels that were unheard of before. And I think employees and particularly women employees have said, we're not going back to the past. We want to lean into the future of work. And so what that'll look like over the next six to 12 months, during what might be a recession, I don't know, but I think that sea change is permanent. And I think we're seeing employees expect something different out of organizations going forward in particularly those women leaders and those rising women leaders, those young women. Rachel Thomas, Lauren, thanks so much for taking the time to join us. Well, women also more likely to take on more student debt. So let's break some of this down because it's smooth sailing so far on the government's student debt relief website. Now, if you're among the eight million who applied for student debt relief during this beta test period, the Department of Education says you will be processed and you don't need to reapply. Now, it's a very straightforward form on the student a.gov website. You put in your name, date of birth, your social security. And of course, your contact information, but you'll also need to confirm your eligibility. You have to be an individual that made less than 125,000 in 2020 and 2021, or a family's making less than 250,000. Now, this, what you're qualified for, up to 20,000 to federal Pell Grant recipients, and up to 10,000 for non-Pell grant recipients. Unfortunately, though, loans from private lenders are not included. Now, some key dates to be aware of. The Education Department recommends getting your application in before November 15th to get forgiveness, because approval takes about four to six weeks. So you want to get those in before the loan payments that were paused in order to help borrowers during the worst of the pandemic. Those are going to resume on January 1st. Now, the application is going to be open through December 31st of 2023. Now, this is going to impact more than 40 million borrowers, but of course, there's plenty of pushback. So you might want to get your filing in early. You have the Congressional Budget Office saying this executive order will cost about $400 billion. You also have Republican legal challenges already mounting, saying that it's going to impact state tax revenues. So definitely get that in early and make sure to check your eligibility. All right, we're coming up. Despite high inflation, rent is the beginning to feel relief in certain U.S. markets. Find out which ones after the break.",https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1iVTbuGfqnQ,94,2022-10-18 20:44:30
3608," Up The current inflation picture may not fully reflect what's going on in the U.S. rental market. Yahoo! Fanat's just here. Romero joins us now to explain how inflation lags behind current rental data. Big story in this country right now. Yes. Yeah. So the key component of CPI consumer price index is shelter. And that is an indicator that is lagging behind many of the private sector data points out there, such as Zillow co-star. That's just a name of few. And that's what economists have been saying. But the way one economist put it is that the shelter numbers that we got last week really reflect what happened last summer in 2021. So the reason why there is this lag is because CPI captures rents. So, landlords can't raise rents to their existing tenants at the same level that they're raising rents to new tenants. They would have to wait for that existing tenant to renew the lease in order for that bump to occur. So that's why there is that lag. But again, many economists have said that rent prices are actually now peaking. So we can expect about three months of month to month CPI increases before we would actually see a clear slowdown. And that's why so many are saying take it easy, let the medicine take hold, maybe pause for a moment beyond a 275 point hike that are probably coming. Danny, thank you. Good information. Rochelle? All right. Well, staying on the topic, the cost of rent rose 0.8% in September and is up over 7% year over year, but there are some signs the market may be cooling off. Now, who finds it's contributing very gibbons joins us with the details. Vera, what do we need to know? Well, yes, I mean, the overall inflation rate was a little uncomfortable for a lot of us because it's still well above the feds 2% target rate and rents are a big part of that rent and food continue to go up. But the thing with real estate, as your last person just pointed out, is that it is local. So while we are seeing rent growth continue to rise in some of those peripheral markets outside of the core cities, like Cambridge, Massachusetts, Freeman, California, Tempia, Arizona, to name three, we are seeing an overall leveling off or plateauing, if you will, in rents in many of the other markets throughout the country. And this is providing welcome relief for renters who have seen sky high rises almost month over month. Vera, how significant is rent when it comes to the inflation number we're seeing and therefore, how warp to sense, are we getting of how lagging this data is as we just learned from Danny Romero? You point out, you make a good point because it is pretty significant when you take a look at the inflation rate, you see rents and food, big parts of the inflation data. It shows it's at uncomfortably high levels. But the good news is that in the major cities that saw the biggest run up in rent prices, we are seeing a leveling off or plateauing. I was speaking to the CEO of Zumber and he said that in over half of the cities he actually follows, he is in fact seeing a plateauing of those rents, places like Nashville, Tennessee, a lot of the Florida markets, for example, they're coming down.",https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1iVTbuGfqnQ,95,2022-10-18 20:48:57
3609," is in fact saying a flat telling of those rents, places like Nashville, Tennessee, a lot of the Florida markets, for example, they're coming down, but it's important to point out that we're coming off with very high highs, we're coming off of very elevated levels. So any relief is going to feel modest compared to where we've actually been, particularly in year two of COVID, but some relief is good relief, and we will take any kind of relief because like I said in some markets, the growth has been substantial. We're talking double digit growth month over month over month. So yes, it's still a bit of a problem, but the good news is that the home sales market is cooling down, and as a result, the home rental market is in fact cooling down. And, Vivier, what about the more expensive places? And does this mean that they're still going to see a lot of turnover because you can't afford a house, you still have to read, you have to live somewhere. That's interesting. You point that out because yes, we are seeing a lot of, we have seen a lot of return over the past couple of years. I was speaking to a lot of landlords and they said, oh my god, the turner has been ridiculous. They get people in for ridiculous amount of money and then they're gone and they have to put a lot of money back in and then they jack the rent price up. So some of the landlords I interviewed for a piece of road for Yahoo Finance are saying, you know what? A leveling off or telling your rents is actually a good thing because we can get a qualified decent renter in who will take good care of the property and stay a long time. I was speaking to one ranger who said, her previous landlord, she couldn't even get them on the phone to fix a leaky faucet and went on for like four months and she's since moved into a different location, has a different landlord. And the landlord now is so anxious to get her to stay that she's even bringing over fresh fresh flowers. So it's just, it's just a show that things are in fact cooling off. I mean, the bidding wars we saw over the past couple of years, the competition just got completely crazy. So it'd be interesting to see sort of how the landlords respond to the cooling of the market. But as I say, well, landlord, I spoke to you said he's actually happy about it because he's started the turnover every year, every six months, people are moving out, it's going to put thousands of dollars in to fix it up and then rent into the higher price. Well, there you go, landlords, buy your tenants some flowers. Very good one. Thank you so much for joining us. Sure, let's take a look at what's trending in after hours. All right, Michelle, we've got a couple of big gainers here on the board. Netflix united into it. If surgical and JB Hunt all has to do with earnings. Let's kick it off with Netflix. The stock popping here after hours a very, very strong subscriber growth number. That's the reason that we're seeing a 13.5% jump in shares after hours, 2.4 million subscribers added during its most recent quarter. They added customers in every region here, surging past what Wall Street was looking for. That's a big reason why you're seeing that jump today. The company though did offer revenue guidance that came in just a bit light, but it doesn't look like that's holding too much weight at least for now. The company says it is on the path to reaccelerate growth as sequential decline in revenue was entirely due to the strong dollar. Taking a look at the past three months, Netflix, you can see has gotten some of its momentum back. We're shares of 26% on a year-to-date basis, though. We are still well in the red off just around 60%. Let's take a look at United, another company out with earnings here after the Bellers, seeing the stock up just around 7.5%. Beating up both the top and bottom lines revenue of 12.9 billion adjusted EPS of 2.81. The company saying that COVID recovery trend to overcome some of those recessionary pressures, very similar to what we heard from Delta and Delta gave that up be guidance here for the holiday quarter. Take a look at the past three months, you can see United still in the red, though off just around 5%. Taking a look at intuitive surgical, another mover here to the upside up just over 8%. Beating on both the top and bottom line revenue for the third quarter coming in above 11% up 11% from a year ago at 1.56 billion EPS at $1.19. That was better than what the street was looking for. The company did say, though, that profit did decline from a year ago because of rising expenses. It doesn't look like the street is too worried about that at least for now or the past three months. The stock off just around 6% on a year-to-date basis. We're off just around 46%. All right, let's round it out here with JB Hunt, the transportation services company taking a look at these numbers here. $2.4 $2.57 on EPS. That was better than what the street was looking for operating revenue.",https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1iVTbuGfqnQ,96,2022-10-18 20:53:12
3610," and the transportation services company taking look at these numbers here $2.2.57 on EPS and that was better than what the street was looking for. Operating revenue of 22% year over year 3.84 billion year to date the stock is still in the red though off just around 17% Dave. Great stuff is always. We want to thank you. My stock to watch for Wednesday is Tesla who reports earnings tomorrow after the close. The central question for investors is if the EV maker is seeing declining demand. Tesla has repeatedly raised prices in recent months but now faces high inflation rising energy bills in Europe at a weakening economy in China among their many macro challenges. Tesla's Q3 deliveries fell short of Wall Street estimates sending the stock down 8.6% and JP Morgan analysts Ryan Brinkman saying, well, Tesla continues to point to supply constraints as limiting deliveries the potential for demand destruction looms large. Tesla shares down 44% year to date tomorrow will be pivotal. Coming up, Krispy Kreme Donuts will be popping up at the menu at one fast food giant next week. And to find out who. All right, this is an exciting partnership in the food space. McDonald's is going to sell Krispy Kreme Donuts at nine store locations in Kentucky this month. Both companies up today, maybe something of that has to do with the news that we got now McDonald's saying the menu shake up could reveal how adding bakery items would impact its restaurant's customer is going to be able to get the original glazed chocolate ice with sprinkles. The raspberry filled donuts and that is not all the news coming up from McDonald's today. We're also back with their Halloween.",https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1iVTbuGfqnQ,97,2022-10-18 20:57:16

And we've got this McBoo bucket on set for you guys. A very exciting thing bringing it back right in time for the Halloween holiday and returning after six years. So they're doing all they can to try to add some excitement here to their menu, Michelle. I mean, I do love the idea of the Krispy Kreme partnership. And they say you can either get them as the three pack or part of a six pack. I need very little motivation as an impulse buyer to sort of like, oh yeah, let me grab that as well. So I will probably be it. When it eventually comes here right now, it's just limited to Louisville Kentucky. So lucky for you all sad for us. I think these boo buckets though are absolutely adorable. I think they should have put the meal inside the bucket. But Dave, you have theories about why that's not the best idea. McDonald's has got your back. They're putting it in a bag so it stays warm. You don't want those fries in a bucket and cooling off in the environment around it. That is smart. Plus, you don't want it stinking up your candy for the candy that's going to go in there in Halloween. Let me say this, McDonald's. If you don't put a breakfast sandwich on a Krispy Kreme donut, I am dearly disappointed in you. It's easy. Sausage, egg and cheese on two Krispy Kreme's. I don't know what we'll call it. That's a hard attack in the sandwich. Krispy Kreme. It's cool. That's called a trip to the dentist. That's too much. Dentist. Oh, come on. Krispy Kreme and everything else. Krispy Kreme, a sandwich with sausage, egg and cheese. You could thank me later, McDonald's. You can thank me later. But they also have adult happy meals. They do. And they've been a huge hit. The toys in them have been slion. They become collectibles. I don't know that the happy meal itself has been that popular, but the toys sure have. We're going to get a look at their earnings next week. I hate to be the wonky guy. But it'll be interesting because the lower income bracket will be interesting to see if there are cutbacks on that side of things. Despite all these promotions. Yeah, definitely will give us a good gauge just in terms of how hard inflation is hitting everyday Americans. I think this is really, really cute. This is the make-up. They all have a mcconkin and a mcgoblin. I like what they're doing here. I'll be sure to get mine. But we'll have to leave you there. That'll do it for today's Yahoo! Find out slides.

3615," new ad tier or next guess is this change could be a good thing for Netflix's global strategy. Let's bring in city managing director Jason Basine to talk more about this. Jason good to see you. So Netflix interesting here and as we were talking about at the top of the show, the company really changing the tone and entering a different phase of its life cycle with this focus more on profitability as a distinguishing characteristic from its competitors versus its growth. Do you think that's the right way now to think about Netflix? Yeah, I do. I mean, who doesn't like profits? You know, the issue for the stock right is they had a 10 year plus run where everyone just focused on net ads and no one really cared about profits or cash flow. And when the net ads stopped, they sort of had no natural constituency on the buy side. The growth investors left, the value managers looked at the stock that was cut by 70%, and they looked on the cash list statement and there was no cash there. So they weren't interested. And so they were sort of in no man's land. And I think this ad tier is important because it should bring back subscriber growth, but importantly is also going to come with it material profits and cash flow. How quickly do you believe that Netflix is going to be able to really advertise, who marketers to run these massive spend campaigns that it's anticipating on its platform? Oh, I don't think it's going to be difficult at all. You know, marketers talk about top of funnel and bottom of funnel, right? And top of funnel is where you're spending ad dollars just to get consideration. And then bottom of funnel is where the consumer is very close to making a purchase decision. Most marketers almost all need both. And their problem is that the classic top of funnel medium that people would use television, linear television is going away. And so, you know, I think marketers are hungry for a scale large player to place ad dollars and Netflix is obviously a large scale player. So it will be no difficult. It will not be difficult at all for Netflix to attract advertisers. Jason, how big do you think that ad business could be next year? Well, this is the interesting debate. The where the buy side is struggling, I think, is to understand the key metric is not the ad dollars per se, but the way the buy side talks about it is the ad revenue per user that buys the ad tier. And the way we frame that, we think they can do $10 of advertising revenue per ad tier sub in the United States. That's really important because they've only offered consumers a $3 discount. So that means, you know, the buy side is all nervous about what they call spend down risk. What if someone's taking the ad free version and they spend down to the cheaper ad tier, isn't Netflix going to be in the hole? And the answer is exactly the opposite. It's not a spend down risk. It's a spin up opportunity because Netflix will get $3 less in subscriptions and we think $10 more in advertising. So net $7 to the good. You know, Jason, I think about maybe three years ago, we were talking about the golden age of television or, I guess, television in quotes, right? Video. And now it feels like there's just so much content out there that the overall quality is not what it was. Does does that matter? I mean, Netflix still has some prestige stuff that it throws out there once in a while. But a lot of the stuff on there is pretty much lowest common denominator. I don't know. Maybe I'm editorializing too much. But how are you thinking about that issue and does that matter? You know, it's so interesting when we went back and looked at content spend versus the size of each of the streamers. It was amazing and that it took about $140 a content spend to get a net ad. And it didn't matter whose content you were talking about. Whether it was great content, mediocre content. So that, but so what does that tell you? We were just in sort of the land grab phase where consumers were just so hungry for anything that was, you know, available on demand and commercial free. You know, I think it's natural that we'll start to shift and consumers will become more discerning. I think the interesting thing we know from, let's say, the days of HBO is there's sort of two types of content. There's the sort of marquee content that causes the consumer to consider buying the app. And then there's like all the other stuff that keeps you engaged with the app, right? And I think it's fair to say that Netflix has a lot of the ladder and not enough of the former. And so, you know, having those sort of tinpole marquee things to get the buzz is going to be important, but the point is it doesn't have to encompass the vast majority.",https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OFbNeKtIJNY,1,2022-10-19 13:55:38
3616," enough of the former. So, you know, having those sort of tinpole marquee things to get the buzz is going to be important. But the point is it doesn't have to encompass the vast majority of their total cash outlays. You just need a few of those trickling out that sort of capture the zeitgeist of the consumer to keep the consumer excited about it. But most of what they're going to be watching is what you and I would call low quality stuff. Is it other streaming companies that Netflix needs to steal advertising dollars from or is it other digital advertising platforms or behemoths like an alphabet or like a meta platforms from your perspective? I don't think it's either of those. It's just it's taking dollars from linear television. You know, the the the those other firms that you talked about those big digital guys are all bottom of funnel, right? Marketers are going to I think migrate dollars away from linear television and push it towards all of these things. You know, you can see about platforms or S-Fot platforms with ads. Giving us plenty to watch of varying qualities. Jason Bezzane, thank you so much. Really great analysis on all of this. Jason Bezzane is with City. Thanks. Coming up, Saaz is going to take us inside the C-suite and share the top five things he has learned from hearing from all of these company leaders we talked to over the past week. Okay, so Mr. Earlier this week we held our all market summits. Yahoo, finance is big annual event where we talked to all the marquee folks in business finance and beyond and of course, we talked to some of those folks. Brian Sazzi, avid viewer, not just a participant in that day. And so he was listening very closely to folks like target CEO Brian Cornell and GM CEO Mary Barra and he has some lessons from those folks who take away from what they had to say. That conference was dope. So let's run through some of these takeaways. Again, I wrote more about this in the morning brief newsletter on our home page right now. First up target CEO Brian.",https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OFbNeKtIJNY,2,2022-10-19 13:59:41
3617," We take away from the dance. That conference was dope. So let's run through some of these takeaways. Again, I wrote more about this in the morning brief newsletter on our homepage right now. First up, Target, CEO Brian Cornell telling me that they may be on maybe beyond the worst of the inventory. Glent and Julie, that is indeed a good thing. Yeah. There we go. Next up, Chipotle. I think Brian, I think Brian Nichol telling us that price increases. You know what? They might be increasing prices or just moving forward. But still, you have that takeaway. You see Chipotle shares up really pretty well under Nichols leadership in part because they have increased price. But also, they still are not feeling the effect of higher minimum wages. It's something to watch out for, especially in California. We talked about this yesterday. And Brad, you know, very interesting and important and key ingredient Chipotle story. Ultimately. Yeah, the two bowls are going to get a little bit more expensive. Yes, indeed. All right. Next up, Hilton, you and I talked to the CEO of Hilton. That's Chris Nassetta. Travel. The travel rebound is looking pretty strong. So that was interesting and very much dovetails with what you talked to Delta CEO at the Bastion about and what I talked to Brian Moynihan, Bank of America CEO, as well. Consumer spending looks to be holding up. Paramount, our very own Alexandra Canal, sniffing out really or just, I think getting Bob back, I should see a Paramount to expand more on their plans for streaming. Streaming looks very strong. Something we heard about, of course, from Netflix last night, that stock is ripping higher. I'm not surprised based relative to what we heard from Paramount. And then bonus one here are two more. I should say General Motors, CEO Marabara telling our energy any so far. More electric vehicles are coming, not one, not two. But there's a barrage of EVs coming that are going to look to challenge Tesla in the months and years ahead. And lastly, a bonus one. I caught up with Goldman Sachs of CFO Dennis Coleman yesterday after their quarter, asked him if there's any workforce reductions coming up. He said no dramatic reductions. Now that is not saying no reductions, but they're going to have to make some fine tuning, given the declines, them and all of Wall Street has seen in deal activity this year. It's really hard to pick out a common theme. Because a lot of what you said sounded pretty positive. Then you get the likes of Jamie Diamond, you know, raising a lot of red flags about the economic growth and economists who we talked to, who were also cautious about the economy. So it's difficult to sort of synthesize all of this into a coherent narrative. Well, I did. In fact, there's my take. And I think that perfectly summarizes everything you just brought up. It is a weird time to be an investor. In many respects, receipt economic growth slowed out. We're seeing consumer price inflation still at a 40-year high. But again, you have a proctor and gamble coming out here beating on earnings, Goldman Sacks, beating on earnings, Bank of America beating on earnings. It's strange. We need like a wolf sound with that full screen. I guess. Something aggressive. You're, or you and, you know, the Michael Jackson thriller. There you go. There you go. All right, guys, coming up on the other side of this short break. Why are next guests expects an upcoming recession that hits the economy much harder than anticipated? It's coming up. It's coming up. It's coming up. It's coming up. It's coming up. It's coming up.",https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OFbNeKtIJNY,3,2022-10-19 14:04:10
3618," Hey Welcome back to Yowl Finance. I'm Brian Sasey alongside Julie Heiming and Brad Smith. Markets, well we're seeing some a little bit of red action on the screen despite a better than expected earnings you for from PNG. CEO John Mueller told me the consumer is staying resilient in the face of high inflation, but nonetheless right now we're seeing the markets in the red. Now here's what's on tap for you this hour. Here comes Tesla's earnings. Our senior auto correspondent, Presseuber Maiden, teased up Tesla's earnings for you as they are out after the close. The demand for faucets, Fortune Brand, CEO Nicholas Fink, stops by for an in-depth look into the building products maker amid the housing market slowdown. In over session that's a take from Bank of America, CEO Brian Moynihan and my chat with him just moments ago will have that interview coming up. Brad, over to you. All right, take a look at the major averages here as we've struck the top of the 10 AM hour, 30 minutes into trade and I want to give you a three-day look at what's kind of taken place here over the course of this week. Even despite today's little blip-a-dip blip, we are seeing us hold on to a three-day gain of about 2.8% here for the Dow Jones industrial average. The NASDAQ composite, you're seeing that hold on to gains of about 3.7% over that three-day period. But here today, right now, down by about 6.35% minutes into trade. Also the S&P 500, you're seeing that lower on the day. That's down by about half a percent. We ran through some of the sectors earlier, but I'd love to shift your attention over to retail as we're keeping an eye on some of those names, especially within that consumer discretionary construct or discussion here, and especially going into a holiday season where we're still going to be looking through Amazon, Walmart, and some of these sales that are set to commence that have already actually kicked off. Walmart actually announced this morning that they are not going to be open on Thanksgiving. That continues what we had seen over some recent years as well in 2020 and 2021. So keep a close eye on these retail names. Amazon down by about 1.7% Walmart down by about 2% of a percent target. Also lower on the day by about 6% of a percent. So that's a retail roundup if you will for right now. This is the top of the 10 a.m. hour. Julie? Oh, no, actually no. We've got a guest that's coming in. Although it may feel like we're already in one many economists, still don't think the US meets the formal definition of a recession based on broader measures such as income, spending, and job growth. The street is currently expecting a recession sometime in the first quarter of 2023, but our next guest says it will take a bit more time joining us now. You've got Jeffrey senior economist Thomas Simon's Thomas. Great to have you here with us today. Help us really run through what your expectations are and why and when, why in terms of the catalysts and then when in terms of timing you're expecting a recession to hit. Sure. So I think the main difference between our call and many of our competitors is just this sense that the economy is really approaching this period of time from a position of much greater strength than it typically does as it rolls into the recession. So you know, you pointed out just the chart before you had a couple of quarters of negative GDP growth, but Q3 is really shaping up to be quite a bit stronger. Thank you for, you know, I don't have any expectations that we're going to end up with.",https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OFbNeKtIJNY,4,2022-10-19 14:08:39
3619," the chart before you had a couple of quarters of negative GDP growth, but Q3 is really shaping up to be quite a bit stronger. In Q4, I don't have any expectations and we're going to end up with a negative number again. It's really into the second half of next year that we're going to start to see the cumulative effects of all the hikes start to really hit and plus the strength of the dollar as well. I don't think that we've really seen much evidence that that's actually taken a big bite out of economic activity just yet because the economy is just generally less interest rate sensitive that it normally is at this point in the business cycle. Lots of consumers and businesses already have a lot of locked in cheap borrowing that doesn't need to be refinanced anytime soon. You look at things like mortgage rates and these sorts of things that are spiking, but consumers don't have a lot of adjustable rate loans. So the same sort of dynamic is at play with businesses, with balance sheets are very, very strong. We haven't seen much margin compression just yet either. These sorts of things we expect are going to start to really take hold into the second half of 2023, especially as effect continues to raise interest rates here. Thomas, man, we have been on the drumbeat for this recession for what feel is like so long now. And now it sounds like according to you, we're going to be on it for a while longer before we actually get there. You in your latest note have this sort of scenario that you're painting of entering it later. And then I believe in the first quarter of 2024 seeing the worst of it with a drop in of 2.3 percent in growth here or in GDP, I should say. What is that going to feel like? How does that comport with what we are hearing generally painting a picture of a relatively mild recession? I mean, 2.3 percent is that a relatively mild recession? Now what it all happens in one quarter, it's not going to feel particularly great. One thing to keep in mind is that it's not going to feel like 2020 and it's not going to feel like 2009 either. Even though 2.4 percent are thereabouts for a quarterly decline is something that we are not used to and seems like a lot in the context of some pretty positive growth rates we've seen recently. It's not totally out of the question relative to how the economy used to behave before the financial crisis. So I mean, I think it's interesting that just in the past segment that we had before, we're talking about all these comments from CEOs about how the inventory cycle isn't as bad as they thought. You know, margins are still good. Pricing power is still pretty well retained. These sorts of things are what's going to push us a little bit further and is what again, is going to have to make the fed raise rates even a little bit higher and is going to cause us to fall farther and faster and slow down faster when we get into the second half of 2023 and into 2024 like you mentioned as well. So Thomas, you know, against this backdrop of a recession next year at some point of some magnitude, what happens to inflation? So inflation, we expect this going to gradually slow through this year, you know, the remainder of this year and into next year. We probably have peaked, I want to say, although I feel like we've been saying that inflation has peaked since March of this year, something like that. And then we continue to see this really sticky pressure in a lot of the core measures, you know, specifically housing seems to be pushing us recently. I do think that as we get into the second half of or into the first half of next year, excuse me, we will see a gradual decline and then more of acceleration of that decline as we get into the second half of next year as unemployment rises. It's really that's the key, is that the Fed needs to raise rates to lower demand, which is going to lower employment, raise the unemployment rate and get us to lower inflation eventually into next year. The question is how much does unemployment have to really rise, right? That's certainly an open point of debate at the Fed right now. We think that the unemployment rate probably has to get above 5% before we're going to get meaningful significant deceleration towards target for inflation because, you know, with inflation so high as it is now, it can decelerate a lot and still be uncomfortably above target for the Fed. 5% out. All right, Jeffrey, senior economist Thomas Simon, thank you so much. Really appreciate perspective here. And even big tech can't shake off the economic slowdown that we have been again looking ahead to for a long time. Yeah, who finds this tech editor Dan Halley is joining us now.",https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OFbNeKtIJNY,5,2022-10-19 14:12:53
3620," And even big tech can't shake off the economic slowdown that we have been again looking ahead to for a long time. Yeah, who finds this tech editor Dan Halley is joining us now. And obviously we've been paying a lot of attention to tech and sort of a retrenchment in tech. But you've got a sort of big picture look at what we're seeing. Yeah, so we're talking about the different variables that are going into kind of the tech industry right now and what we're seeing. You know, we usually look at tech obviously is kind of not necessarily not even close to you know recession proof, but they we have these stalwarts that you think can weather these storms pretty well. But we're starting to see cracks in this kind of facade. So Microsoft obviously announcing layoffs yesterday not saying how many exactly we had, but about a thousand is what the going number is. That follows their prior move to layoff about one percent of their workforce in July. So Microsoft despite being this huge cloud company that does incredibly well in that area. They had you know, a double digit growth in cloud in the prior quarter. They're still having to contend with these kinds of issues. We have meta and Intel to the worst performers right now. Metastock down 60% year to date. Intel down 49% year to date. We also have meta pushing people out the door not necessarily laying people off, but saying maybe you're not right for this position in so many words. We had Google they weren't necessarily laying people people off, but they closed their area 120 division, which does some research for different products. And so they shuttered those products and they had these people reapply for jobs. And then when you look at the consumer side of things, we have Apple yesterday basically not announcing, but the reports coming out that they're cutting production of their iPhone 14 plus. And that was prior to that we had heard that they were reducing some of the production for their iPhone 14 in general to about what the iPhone 13 levels were. This whole idea of big tech being this huge force, obviously the idea that them being immune to any kind of market factors is really, I mean that's not true at all. But we are starting to see kind of the pain really set in for these companies. And I talked to some people, they're saying that essentially this isn't going to get better until perhaps some point in 2023. At least for the tech industry could go into 2024 though. There's effects concerns that they've cited as well. Many of these tech businesses, if not all of them are certainly impacted by that. But then you mentioned the consumer side and if we can go deeper into that, you know what does that really spell out for this holiday season for some of the consumer technology that they're expecting to move through into households and into consumers hands? You know it's interesting because as obviously these a lot of products haven't companies haven't raised prices on consumer products just yet. At least here in the US overseas we've seen Apple raised prices. We saw Sony raised prices on their PlayStation 5. Obviously a big holiday gift, you know both of those. If you could find it. If you could find it. Now it's a little bit easier because not everybody's looking for them again. I do think that we're seeing this issue with not just the slowdown in the PC market which we've been talking about. That obviously impacts the likes of Microsoft, Intel, AMD, Nvidia. It's all these kind of knock on effects, the memory chip makers. But we're starting to perhaps see it on the smartphone inside of things. And that would then start to hit the likes of Apple, the likes of Samsung companies in those areas. So I do think that we're going to see fewer people spending on these big ticket items. I video games I think you're still going to do pretty well. We have a couple that are coming out that are big names. But you know I don't know if it's going to necessarily be this huge blow up that we saw during the pandemic where gaming was so big. But you know that should still continue to do well. But you know the PCs, the tablets. I don't necessarily know if people are going to be getting those. Just because they already bought them. And so you're going to a season where people are trying to save maybe. I don't know if those are going to do particularly well. There's only so much space you have in your place to store the next computer, Dan Allen me, man. I know, right? Dan Allen. Great analysis. Appreciate it.

Coming up, Mackenzie Scott is making a big donation to the Girl Scouts of America, Julie will break down today's top headlines next. You Let's get down to business now. Look at some of the other headlines that we are watching. One of them involves French cement maker Lafars. It's going to pay $778 million in penalties for conspiring to support the Islamic State and in Al Qaeda affiliate. In 2013 and 2014, the company made regular payments to the Islamic State to protect its cement plant in Syria from attack. That agreement evolved into a de facto revenue sharing scheme in which Lafars actively concealed payments by forging invoices. Although Lafars' Syrian subsidiary involved in the scheme is now defunct, the company's guilty plea marks the first time a company has been charged with providing material support and resources to a terrorist organization. The TSMC could expand its production capacity in Japan, according to the Wall Street Journal. That move helps Taiwan's semiconductor hedge its chip production against potential conflicts over Taiwan. While as an increasingly belligerent China continues to claim the self-governed island as part of its territory, a new Japanese plant would be in addition to one already established in Kyushu and would focus on chips used in automobiles and sensors.

It's the largest donation by a single person to that youth program. Scott, who divorced Amazon founder Jeff Bezos in 2019, had earlier pledged to give away about half of her fortune to charity. The Girl Scout says the funds will be used to expand STEM and career training in its programs. Soz? If Tesla earnings are out after the close today, yeah, finance senior auto correspondent Prasdub remaining has a previous surprise. I'm guessing Tesla is going to be by 10 cents. Stocks going higher, right? I mean, with the bulls, I'm a lot better. Yeah, you know, I think it's going to be all about the delivering, I'm sorry, the demand and production sort of outlook and story there. Big headline numbers here, we're looking at about 22.13 billion. We'll be its highest ever record, highest ever, quarterly record on adjusted EPS of $1.02 cents, gap net income of $3.2 billion, that would be near it all the time. So, you know, a big quarter for them in the books, but we're all watching that. Can they hit that 1.4 million 2022 annual production kind of delivery outlook? You have to make 500,000 vehicles in Q4, which is, you know, possible. But the question is, is there demand? You know, there's concern about demand slowing in China and things like that. But, you know, other things we're going to watch, for me personally, I'm going to kind of watch about these. And Tesla semi kind of outlook, are they going to be able to hit that delivery, December 1st delivery kind of with Pepsi and what's coming up for that in 2023? And then also what's happening to Cybertruck? Is that still on track for mid next year? Okay, and so it's all about where we're also going to hear capacity being brought online at some of the new factories, whether that's Austin or Berlin. What do we expect there and how many vehicles are they going to continue to produce at these factories? So, you know, last quarter, they said that free amount was about 450,000 vehicles a year. Shanghai, they say 850,000 vehicles a year, install capacity. So that's already 1.3. The rest, Austin, Giga, Berlin. You get a couple hundred thousand from each of those, they're still ramping up. So maybe you're at 1.5, 1.7 give or take. I think that's what the street is looking for. But they're going to have to hit about 2 million in 2023 to hit that 50% compound annual growth rate. There's a lot a long way to go, but in the question also, it's like, you know, how can they keep raising prices for their cars and then also in this kind of slowing global macro environment, are those, you know, sales going to come down potentially? Did we talk about mask being on the call yet? Did we talk about that? We didn't talk about that. He's going to be on the call. Yeah, he's going to be on the call, which he hasn't been on the call's recently. And you have to wonder, like, the whole Twitter thing is still going on, but he hasn't really gotten a lot of questions directly about that. So you wonder, are Tesla analysts going to ask about that? I don't know. It's scared. They're going to have to ask about the call. What's the hell it's going to say? They posted a couple of the institutional questions that they did on their like, they they pulled a survey monkey kind of thing and also their top retail investor questions. I didn't see any on the, what is Musk going to do with Twitter, etc. on there. Probably asked about stock sales, but I didn't see anything about his role in Twitter as of yet. I'm going to get that. Yeah. I feel that confused. We'll see how much of this time goes there. Ross, thanks so much, you know, you're going to be tracking this after the close very closely. Everyone coming up, President Biden has unfailed his plan to combat oil production cuts by OPEC Plus. We're going to share the details next. preservation community. So nice.",https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OFbNeKtIJNY,8,2022-10-19 14:26:14
3623," song ends President Biden has unveiled his plan to release 15 million barrels of oil from the U.S. strategic reserve in response to OPEC-plus production cuts. Yahoo, finances Rick Newman joins us now with the details. Hey Rick. All right. So Biden is now going to release more oil from the U.S. strategic reserve and other 15 million barrels. This is a continuation of a program that's been going on since May. And that was originally supposed to end in October. And it has now been extended into November. And then in December. And I wonder why that might be. Oh, it could only be the midterm elections. Biden obviously wants to look like he's doing something continually to get gasoline priced down. There's another important element of this though that's new. It's getting less attention, but it might be more important by the energy department is going to do something new and they're going to enter into contracts to buy oil from the private sector from the market at prices of around $70. And the reason that's important is that it is telling oil producers that there's going to be demand for oil even when the price falls below current levels. So the government is kind of establishing itself as a customer of last resort, if you will. And the thinking behind this is oil producers will say, oh, well, if oil prices fall, we will still be able to sell it to the government at prices where we can make a profit. And so that's a little bit of extra demand that producers know will be there in the future. And that might get them to produce more oil. We will find out this goes all the way into 2324 and probably even into 2025. So it's meant to have a long term effect on oil supplies. But that also continues the sort of thorny questions of climate change and the sort of push pull that the Biden administration has done with the oil industry, right? If they're, you know, saying on the one hand, everybody should be transitioning to renewables. On the other hand, we're going to be buying oil from you for a few years for $70. But I guess that also helps ease the transition for the oil companies. You're right, Julie. But I think one of the things that we should have clearly learned in 2022 is we need a better bridging strategy from fossil fuels to renewables because we don't have nearly enough renewables to replace fossil fuels right now. And because markets, energy markets are priced at the margins, you could have just a small shortfall of oil or natural gas or whatever it might be. And prices can double or go up by more than double. So, you know, Obama during the Obama administration, he had a phrase.",https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OFbNeKtIJNY,9,2022-10-19 14:30:03
3624," whatever it might be. And prices can double or go up by more than double. So, you know, Obama during the Obama administration, he had a phrase, you know, what's our approach to energy, all of the above. And I think Democrats got away from that and they pushed a little bit too hard on renewables without figuring out how to meet, you know, the demand for the fuel that we need today. And I don't think Biden's going to come out and say this, but I think what we're seeing from the Biden administration is kind of an all of the above energy strategy, which is acknowledge that we need these fossil fuels today. And we need to we need to assure these supplies for the next several years while at the same time pushing for renewables. Good analysis. Y'all find this is senior columnist Rick Newman. Good to see you. Hi guys. Coming up, we'll share my interview with Bank of America. See a Brian Lonehan on the back of there better than expected earnings report earlier this week. That's next. Welcome back. Bank of America. See a Brian Lonehan tells me spending remains strong among consumers and that a recession may not be imminent. Take a listen. Nice to be with you again. And my teammates produced a great quarter again. And I thank you for that. But I think if you're talking about what we saw at our customers in turn of the consumer spending for the third quarter of 2022, the consumers spent about 10% more than they did in the third quarter of 2021. So 2022, third quarter, 10% over through third quarter 2021. And frankly, for the first couple of weeks, I told we've seen that same 10% increase. Now, when you think about that spending, think about two things. One, it is still very strong at a relative basis. Even the transactions are up 6% outpaces inflation.

3625," the situation, travel being a very growing part because coming from last year when we had the Delta of COVID, you know, variant to this year, people are traveling. But on top of that, though, be mindful that early in the year is probably more like a 13, 14 percent to 12 percent to 10 percent. So it's being mitigated. So I think the feds, changes and rates, the concerns about it's going out there, people are slowing down a bit, but not slowing down consistent with a real slowdown economy yet. And that's the good news. Brian, that's interesting. You're calling out 10 percent growth through October. And I just talked to Proctor and Gamble CEO after their earnings. They're talking about a resilient consumer. Are you surprised by the resilience we're seeing in US consumers here? Well, we talked in our earnings materials about resilient consumer, frankly. And you think about that long three or two or three dimensions. First is the unemployment, obviously, is still very low. People working. And second is, do they have money in their bank accounts? In the bank accounts of our consumers, our 35 million core households at Bank of America. At the end of September was the same as it was at the end of August. And in fact, it's multiples, multiples, over where it was before the pandemic, especially for those consumers who are in the $100,000 under income bracket. That means that they haven't spent down the stimulus and stuff. And while I say multiples, I give you an example. I've never had about an average of $3,500 in account pre-pandemic, now has 13,000 in account. And it's not going down. So that's goodness. So one, they have money in accounts. Two, they're spending. Three, they are employed. Four, they have capacitive borrow. Our credit card borrowings are still about 12 percent below where they were pre-pandemic. Home equity line draws are down about 25, 30 percent still. Now mortgage finances slow down because rates went up. But the people have home equity lines in place or have capacitive borrow. The house values are still strong. So all that bodes well. Now inflation hurts consumers, especially consumers in modern income because inflation and goods and services, they spend a lot of their income on. But, you know, so we have to be careful about the overall position versus certain types of consumers. But generally, the American consumer is very resilient. Brian, a lot of your peers on the street over the past few weeks have come out and warned about a recession sometime over the next six months. Of course, that brings us into 2023. Where does Brian Monahan suit? Well, I don't make those projections. I have this talented research team, one of the best in the world, if not the best in the world, run by Candace Browning, Platt and the team. And they basically been consistent. They have this quarter, meaning the past quarter, third quarter, 22 growing. Then they have the fourth quarter, the first quarter, the second quarter, the third quarter, all in negative territories, around half percent, one to one and a half percent. So a slight shallow down, and we're trending and growing at the end of next year. They have pushed that projection for recession out a little bit into 23. But the core belief, it's a mild recession. It's coupled with unemployment. It gets up to, you know, four to half to five percent. A Fed funds rate, likewise around five percent. But inflation does get under control and we come out of that recession. That's the core projection. Now against that, though, the real facts are today, the consumers are spending commercial credits and grade shape, consumer credits and grade shape. Even though things like housing and stuff like that have flattened out because that's the way the Fed slows down the economy, the reality is a consumer store employed earning money. And so the Fed's toughest job and inflation is also the best thing about the U.S. economy, which is a strong consumer. So our team predicts a recession, a mild recession. They've had that projection, frankly, for six months ago, they had the same projection more or less. It just pushed out a little bit. But what we're not seeing is it come to four yet and that keeps moving it out because of that resiliency and the consumer. By all indications, Brian, the Federal Reserve is going to continue to move higher with rates over the course of its next few meetings. What does that mean for your net interest margins over the next couple quarters? Well, one of the things that people know about banking is a core way you make a half-hour money or more is through what they call a spread. I either difference between what we lend a customer money and what we pay on the deposits and the money customers give us where we can borrow in the market. And that margin had been compressed dramatically as rates fell. And so it expands back out, getting to a more normal level, which it usually is, and that has shown a rapid increase in net interest.",https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OFbNeKtIJNY,11,2022-10-19 14:39:00
3626," and compressed dramatically as rates fell. And so it expands back out, getting to more normal level, which it usually is, and that has shown a rapid increase in net extent, or NII improvement over last year. As you look for, we told our shareholders earlier this week that we'd expect another billion dollars plus increase from the third quarter to the fourth quarter. But that's driven by the great core deposit franchise we have. We have a lot of zero interest checking balances, which are transaction accounts, which money flows for all time. That will stay in zero interest no matter what the rate environment. Then the rest of our deposit rates move up, and the loan rates move up, and we'll get back to the two and a half percent spread that we have typically made in our balance sheet. It's been depressed for the last few years, and then was okay in a 17th time when the rates came up. It was depressed before that. So, you know, this is really the basic structure banking to get back to margin in those ranges as opposed to a depressed margin under two percent we've had for the last few quarters. Want to give your team a shout out here, Brian? Global markets business of 30% in the quarter. Strongest since the third quarter of 2010, but no trading lost days in the quarter. Despite all the market volatility we've seen, how does that happen? And do you think that can continue and just be sustained over the next few quarters? Well, it happens because we have a talent team and Jimmy DeMar that runs a business force has, you know, been a running major parts of business for a long time, took over the whole business last year and we went on Montag retired. And so, it's a great business. The team that works for Jimmy's very solid, but it also comes from a decade long focus on responsible growth. We're in a business to move and risk through the system. We're in a business of managing risk. We're in a business of helping customers achieve what they want, not taking big principal risk. And therefore, evil and market volatility a team did good job and we didn't lose money on a trading day. But by the way, if you look back across the last 10, 12 years, very rarely do we lose money. Maybe a couple of trading days of quarter when something really changes dramatically. But this year, what we saw is from last year to this year, the investments we've made in the last couple of years in the business in terms of talent, technology, even more capital, more balance sheet capacity, has shown up and our team has a consistent drive to it. And Jimmy and the team did a great job this quarter and we expect them to do more next quarter. And lots there to unpack from Bank of America CEO Brian Monhan. Mikey, take it away, was that Oxails in October, consumer spending in October, up 10%. So still running at double digits, despite what we're seeing with inflation and the economy's going down. They had a lot of new credit card accounts that they added on during the quarter as well. They got into this a little bit more on the earnings call, 1.3 million new credit card accounts. And you know I love talking about this shift right now that we're seeing and how consumers are spending because it's so important, especially as households are really looking through where their spending capacity is. That's why it was diving into retail earlier on because going into this holiday season, it's just going to be a huge question of how consumers are spending, where they are trying to figure out, okay, are we in a recession? Are we going into a recession? And what do I need to do now, preemptively to prepare for that too? Well, if unemployment is going to 5% at some time in late 2023, 2024, they still have some time to save, they'll spend a little bit less before that happens. I don't know. All right, coming up, housing market headwinds, we'll speak with the CEO of Fortune Brands and home security. That's next. Why don't we build a rest room?",https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OFbNeKtIJNY,12,2022-10-19 14:43:38
3627," MUSIC We're rising interest rates are causing new headwinds in the housing market. Our next guest though says any slowdown should be relatively short-lived. Fortune Brands home and security CEO Nicholas Fink is joining us now and Fortune Brands home to a lot of different brands that people use in their houses, mown faucets, for example, master lock is another one of your brands. So talk to us about what you're seeing in this current cycle. Well, you know, in the cycle right now you're at a point where, you know, we have seen a lot of home price appreciation. You are seeing obviously mortgage rates go up significantly and that does put pressure on the consumer and the affordability of housing, right? And so what did you expect to see and we've seen in prior points in the cycle? As you do see a slowdown in new construction, you may see a slowdown in home sales turnover. But ultimately, the market remains fundamentally underbuilt. There are huge demographic tailwinds in need for housing, particularly in our core US market. And there's this little thing called supply and demand, which will always come back into effect over time. And so the fundamentals of housing are very, stronger, very intact. There is a period of softness that we expect to see as consumers, buyers and sellers adjust to this affordability pricing in the market interest rates. And we've usually seen that take anywhere between one to three quarters and then the market digestives and people get back to get back to some home turnover. Ultimately, as I've said, housing is not a discretionary purchase. The timing of housing may be discretionary, but ultimately it's not a discretionary purchase that people come back to the marketplace. Nicholas, we were talking earlier on about a company called Genorac. And they warned this morning about higher inventory levels in the channel. Now you're a major player at home due point and lows. I mean, what are you seeing from these home improvement chains in terms of inventory given things have slowdown? Right. Well, they do an excellent job managing inventory, managing working capital. We work very closely with them. Now, one of the hallmarks of our business is in addition to really managing our brands and innovation really, really well. We do manage our channel and our service to the channel really well. So if you look back at how we've performed through the whole COVID period, you would have seen that we were able to serve at superior levels. We were able to gain market share as a consequence. And so we've been back in the market, I would say. Certain customers really well. And as a consequence, we've seen inventories right size over the period. And we talked about that previously. And so there's certainly dollar inventory.",https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OFbNeKtIJNY,13,2022-10-19 14:47:29
3628," consequence we've seen inventories right size over the period. And we talked about that previously. And so, you know, I, you know, the certainly dollar inventory is higher as pricing and inflation is the impact of the cost of inventory. But I think it a lot of our major customers that is kind of equalizing over time as service levels come back into line. I mean, at the end of the day, it's still going to come down to where we're seeing more of the DIY projects that perhaps move forward from this point. If people are getting into some of the user, not used, but existing homes out there on the market. And so as you're kind of tracking both the health of real estate more broadly as well as how that correlates to your business, what are your expectations going into next year where there's already been a slowdown in housing? Right. Well, you know, you come back to that fundamental right? The consumer over time is going to need housing. The US market's hugely underbuilt. And so over time, we're going to have to add more homes into the marketplace. So, you know, that's a fact. I think we'll see a slowdown in your construction. You saw some of that in today's data, although it put it in context. I mean, single family in your constructions now at 2019 levels and multi-family is still well about. That's on today's data, right? And so kind of returning to that pre-COVID levels. But you have a lot of consumers that are in homes with, you know, the majority of mortgages are below 4%. You know, those homes need renovation. And you know, even today we're seeing consumer interest. For example, we look at Google search data, you know, 25, 35% above pre-COVID levels. And so people are really interested in the home. They're really interested in that space. And so we expect that to carry through. Now, you know, you may again see a period of softness around some uncertainty. I think as we get into 2023, that's a fair expectation. We pride ourselves in being able to manage those and actually turn them into opportunity to gain more share, really, to like the consumers and meet the consumers where they are with our brains. But, you know, over the medium term to long term, we expect both from the art and our perspective as well as new construction consumers to come right back in and be supporting the tremendous equity that they have in their homes today. And Nicholas, when it comes to your business, how much is split between going directly into the retail channels to how much ends up in professional hands? And kind of how does that ever flow with the housing market? Yeah, I mean, we're still, you know, very heavily geared to work towards the old sell channel. So if you think about it's probably 23rd, 23rd, similarly for renovation and repair, we're 23rds new construction more, you know, one third or less or some international markets as well. Until that is very much the gearing of the poor falling. And, you know, there's a little bit of ebb and flow. I think depending on times, you know, where products sit, we inventories that, you know, you saw some of that during the pandemic. As the retailers opened up, people really went in there looking for product that inventory there able to service the channel. You know, but that's our broad exposure. But, you know, we really focus on meeting the consumers where they are. And, you know, one of the big drivers, I think, in the home market over the next period, is really going to be creating affordable homes for consumers in the US. And, you know, here the builders talk a lot about the work they're going to do to create affordable homes. You know, we geared up, we're following it to be at the heart of the market. And so whether it's a consumer that's moving up through the price points with some of our higher end brands and offerings or whether it's really at the heart of the market, you know, we've had the portfolio very, very good to meet them there. At good margins. And so we'll continue to do that and continue to leverage the brains and the innovation to be at that point. And I think that's going to play very strongly through, you know, both the retail as well as the wholesale channels. Nicholas, I recently got a new faucet and it's one of those touchless faucets. And once I installed it, I'm like, wow, why have I not been using this the past 10 years of my life? I'm glad I traded up to get it. I think it just works. It's good. You know, but what type of innovation? What's the next big product for a brand like a moment? Well, I'll tell you, I mean, as we, you know, as you may know, we're taking the company through a separation of some of our businesses now. One of our cabinets business that's, you know, really going to focus on being.",https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OFbNeKtIJNY,14,2022-10-19 14:51:56
3629," Well, I'll tell you, I mean, as you may know, we're taking the company through a separation of some of our businesses now, one of our cabinet's business that's really going to focus on being the best in that industry. But then the rest of the business and you're touching on sort of water management business is really going to be focused on super-charge categories. So things that are connected, water management, outdoor living, things that really, really drive consumer value. And that experience you have, I'm smiling because I hear that all the time. I mean, I've got this in and how did I live without it? I mean, we're actually taking that product line as an example to a completely connected ecosystem inside of the house. I mean, it's the touchless faucet that's going to be connected to where it already is. An AI system that understands water flowing in house can tell you if you've got a leak. And shut your main down. If you're going to have a catastrophic leak, we'll save just an absolute fortune for homeowners and insurers can protect you from freezes, can protect you from health threats by managing your water supply. And so that experience you're having is really one of the most exciting moments in our industry. It's really this convergence from historical kind of mechanical water management into these connected products that we have in the marketplace. Nicholas, I wish you would have told me that before. I would have not gotten this touchless. I want to know when there's leaks. I mean, that makes sense. That's a good product. That's a good product. We can help you out with that. No problem. Anything that's going to help Amazon packages from getting stolen? We do have some great security products in our monster-like portfolio. And again, becoming more and more connected and remote is kind of the big driver of that portfolio. So stay tuned. All right. We'll accept that for now. Nick Fink, who is the fortune brand's home in security CEO. We appreciate the time here with you today. Guys coming up. Inflation may now impact your tax bracket. On the other side. Slap on dub a. It's time for a cup of time. Three stories, one minute each. We start with this on the day. You might find yourself in a new tax bracket next year. The IRS says it's raising tax brackets and standard deductions by 7% for the 2020-23 tax season. The move is in response to high inflation giving tax payers a chance to shield more.",https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OFbNeKtIJNY,15,2022-10-19 14:56:31
3630," Tax brackets and standard deductions by 7% for the 2023 tax season. The move is in response to high inflation giving taxpayers a chance to shield more of their earnings from income tax. All right. The IRS. Everybody's cold. Yeah. This is an automatic thing. Actually, remember they just did it for Social Security also. Now they are doing it for taxes also. And it doesn't just affect like the highest earners. It also affects things like a state taxes. So it's this automatic adjustment that happens that Congress put in place. And I don't think there's a lot of awareness about it because we haven't had as big an increase in inflation for a long time. So this is the biggest adjustment to this for a long time. You consumer spending boom in the spring next year. I kind of like that. I think that it's also an acknowledgement too for the IRS and looking at the tax brackets, especially as they know that they're needing to add on more to their workforce as well. I mean, the IRS right now is still so backlogged. And so this could. Oh, we're taxed. Oh, we're taxed. Sorry. Indeed. All right, taxes to rides. Lyft can help you find a parking spot now. The ride sharing app launched Lyft Parking, a partnership with Chicago-based spot hero. Feature lets you search, reserve, and pay for parking spaces in the app. So I already reserved the closest six spots to the mall in Black Friday. So sorry guys, but I'm really not sorry because this is great. I mean, there are lots of other apps that already do this. Real? Yes. I do. Yes. I can't. You can book most garages in New York City garages. You can't book spots on the street necessarily. So maybe there's not as much competition for that market, but I mean, this business already exists. I'm going to try to book the hot spots in front of restaurants. I mean, I drive nice cars. But it has to be a spot with a meter. You can't just go and park them all. Oh, okay. I thought, well, I'm missing. It's great. It's like a spot. It has to have a meter there that is hooked up to assist. Oh, then I cast my car cap here for the restaurant. Wait, where am I? There's a meter there you can. It's going to reserve a spot to the restaurant this weekend. I'm sorry. I apologize. Anyway, if you were lucky enough to have an adult happy meal from McDonald's, you may have a big payday in your future. The toys that came inside the meal are now selling on eBay for thousands, which one listed as high as $300,000 if you want to buy one yourself. Don't worry, there are plenty on the website still selling for 10 or 20 bucks. The whole set could run you up to $70. The fry smell, it comes with it for free. You ever notice that? Like the stuff in the happy meal retains that. You know how much of a big playday to see you were talking about this? Look at how it's $1000. That's a happy meal. Yeah. It's a happy meal. You know, shots of McDonald's look. They can't have these toys. They're just some buds. They're just some traffic. Also out with the Halloween pells, which I know are three to five team previewed, you know, plastic, pale, big innovation right there from McDonald's. Very excited about it. I'm an innovation. It's retro. They have them before. I know, I used to have one as a kid. I always wanted to use a pillowcase. My mom would not let me. I'd use this dumb hell, but there they are on the screen. The pells are awesome. You wanted to use it. The little kids wanted to use, all the cookers use pillowcases. Pillocases were cool. What's the like and filly? I mean, I don't remember getting to the right, honestly. But on Hollywood, what do you use? Oh, I didn't go Halloween trick or treating, going up. Oh, wow. We have to talk about this offline. OK, coming up, the Kiko Pajina is going to continue our discussion of today's hottest earnings reports, including Netflix and avid labs. This, as we see, a mixed picture for stocks that down now in the green. This is the one brand of Instagram. They go away. This is how the two kids encounter",https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OFbNeKtIJNY,16,2022-10-19 15:00:45
3631,"把 Welcome to Yahoo Finance Live. It is 11 a.m. here in New York City. I'm a Kiko Fuji. Here's where we're watching at this hour. Netflix shares still in rally mode after a strong third quarter report, but higher treasure yields keeping a lid on enthusiasm for tech. Our panel is ready and waiting to get into those numbers. I, on the midterms, abide in administration poise to dip into the strategic reserve yet again, as conflicting signals point to both bullish and bearish catalysts for crude. We're going to get the very latest report out of Washington DC in just a bit. And I, P, know the market for global stock listings has had a dire 2022 and this struggle to raise cash is just as real in the US can intel a mobile line be the rising tide that lifts all boats. We'll speak with S&P Global about that. Let's check in on the market action though 90 minutes into the trading day. We've had a bit of a choppy session here right now. The Dow, the only one that's in the green up about 38 points, the S&P 500 up or down 12 and the NASDAQ down 50. And we've been talking a lot about earnings results there numbers out from United, PNG, among the companies that have helped kind of provide support at those levels. But it is about treasurer yields today as we see the 10 year yield coming over that of 4% level and certainly that weighing on investor sentiment at least so far in the this session. Well, Netflix shares seeing a boost after beating estimates for the third quarter. The streaming giant saw rise and subscriber growth once again. It's now expected to add another four and a half million subscribers in the fourth quarter. But streaming isn't the only thing on Netflix's mind as it looks to also expand into cloud gaming joining us now with more on Netflix's journey ahead is Gita Ranganapa. Bloomberg intelligence senior media analysts. We've also got Dave Hedger. He is Edward Jones, senior equity analyst. Welcome to both of you today. Gita, let me start with you. I mean, certainly we have seen a big rally in the stock, although you could argue that's fallen so much. Expectations were pretty low coming in. They did beat on the sub numbers. What else stood out to you? Yeah, so I think definitely the one thing that stood out is this company is clearly back on track. I mean, of course, the three key numbers were definitely much stronger than expected. But I think what was equally reassuring and even encouraging is the four cube guidance kind of came in slightly higher than consensus. And remember, this was not even factoring in a huge catalyst that they have on the horizon.",https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OFbNeKtIJNY,17,2022-10-19 15:05:27
3632," and even encouraging is the four-q guidance kind of came in slightly higher than consensus. And remember, this was not even factoring in a huge catalyst that they have on the horizon, which is the debut of their new ad-supported tier. They're going to be pricing. This is at a really aggressive $7 price point, historically, the lowest price that Netflix has ever come out with. So it should kind of open up a whole new market for them. And then, of course, they're, you know, they're again reinforcing some of their financial metrics in terms of free cash flow, as well as profit margins. Yeah, indeed, to that point, the company making a pretty clear, they ad-supported tier. And not really going to be a material impact, at least in this quarter, because it's being introduced a little later. But I want to point to one thing that has really stood out here. And that's the FX headwinds highlighted many times in this report, the sequential decline in revenue. They say it's entirely because of FX looking through the numbers here. They estimate full year appreciation of the dollar will negatively affect full year revenue operating income by one billion roughly each. So how does the company adjust for that? Is there anything they can do in terms of the pricing or the cost structure that will allow them to have a bit more of a buffer with the dollar expected to be strong for longer? Well, someone that can try to adjust pricing in international markets, they count for the foreign exchange pressure. However, that's a fine tight rope to be walking just in terms of, you don't want to increase price too much. And in turn, you know, affect subscriber growth, we do think that the ad supported service should help drive subscriber growth in international markets. So I think the lower price point will be attractive in certain markets overseas. You know, there's more ability to pay at that lower price point. So that may be where Netflix can find some balance. And certainly the revenue from the advertised and could offset the lower price point and in turn also help offset some foreign exchange pressure. Geeta, as you pointed out, you know, the company highlighting that we are back on the path to reaccelerate growth. Certainly the ad tier is something a lot of analysts have been looking to, but at the end of the day, it is a content company. And they've sort of highlighted that even as the past few quarters have not been as strong in terms of their sub numbers, engagement has still been high compared to other streaming competitors. What's that next catalyst, do you think, when you look at the content pipeline for this company that could push it even higher? I think we've now seen really the steady cadence of, you know, content titles. We were kind of hit by that whole COVID log jam. And they did say that that's going to take a little bit of time to kind of unwind, but we've seen them deliver consistent hits, obviously. You know, they're, some of their biggest hitting titles being, you know, stranger things, but then they've had a lot of newer shows that have also performed really, really well. The Jeffrey Darmershow being a great example of that. And we're seeing them kind of hold their content budget steady, but remember, we are seeing a lot of the other streamers. So a lot of the competition is also dialing back on their content spend. I think that's a really important point because, you know, maybe we're going to see some of those competitive pressures ease up a little bit as some of these streamers start to understand that profitability is becoming more and more important. And I think that really gives Netflix a leg up, you know, as they try and get more and more bang for their buck. And this is exactly what they spoke to. They said they're getting more impact for every dollar of content spend. And we're seeing that with some of the engagement metrics that they post to the other point that I want to make here is that with some of those engagement metrics, you come out with an advertising product. I mean, this is really so attractive to advertisers knowing that they have that deep engagement, knowing that they have a captive audience, which is on their platform for about two to and a half hours every day. Advertisers are going to be willing to pay up. And they finally is the company looks to see, looks, looks for other levers to drive revenue. We got some news from the VP of gaming there saying that Netflix is now looking at a cloud gaming as a potential. They've also going to have a cloud or gaming segment within their Southern California headquarters there or their offices there.",https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OFbNeKtIJNY,18,2022-10-19 15:09:11
3633," as a potential, they've also gonna have a cloud or gaming segment within their Southern California headquarters there or their offices there. I mean, this is a very crowded space. This would be sort of a new venture for Netflix. They've been talking about it for some time. Is this something that you think Netflix can compete in just given the players that are already in the space? Yeah, certainly the gaming space is a challenging market and a lot of competition in that market. We view that as something that might be incremental for Netflix and in particular may not drive a lot of subscriber growth, but perhaps could help in terms of subscriber retention. Yeah, that's I think when the challenge is when the content schedule is a little more uneven that when there's not content that people are urgently wanting to watch that that's where you see churn, tick up and people, you know, put off their service for a while where gaming could be another way of keeping subscribers engaged and holding on to their subscription even when it's a time period that one of their favorite shows isn't, you know, has already debuted and they've already watched those episodes. It is about continuing to make the platforms ticky with so many of these streaming companies. Appreciate your time to both of you, Gita, Runganath and Bloomberg Intelligence, senior media analysts and Dave Hagar, he's Edward Jones, senior equity analyst. Well, now turning to the energy space. President Biden doubling down against big oil. His administration is releasing 15 million more barrels from the strategic petroleum reserve that President is set to speak on the measures in the next couple of hours. Biden also setting out a plan to refill the reserve. Just a reminder, this is oil stored in 60 giant salt caverns in Texas as well as Louisiana. We've got Yaku Finance contributor, Kevin Sirili on the story for us today. Kevin, how much of this is really about the midterms trying to keep the cap there on gas prices as a voter sort of think about that? Well, there's definitely a midterm political, domestic politics angle here, but there's also a geopolitical angle. But we are anticipating as you alluded to, the President Biden is going to release 15 million barrels from the strategic petroleum reserve. He's going to make those remarks later this afternoon. But he's also going to do something else. And that is to say that the administration will repurchase crude oil when the US energy benchmark West Texas intermediate hits between $67.72 per barrel. And what essentially the administration is saying is, quote, this repurchase approach will protect taxpayers and help create certainty around future demand for crude oil. That will encourage firms to invest in production right now, helping to improve US energy security and bring down energy prices that have been driven up by Putin's war in Ukraine. And Kevin, specifically, there's other measures that have kind of been floated around. We know these big oil companies have approached the Department of Energy, the Secretary of Energy, Jennifer Granholm, really saying that there should not be some kind of ban on exports going out of the US at a time when the anticipation is that Europe will implement those sanctions against Russian oil coming in December. I mean, as you point out, a lot of pieces to connect here, but are we expecting any kind of measures on that front to be announced from the White House? Well, potentially, and three points here. First and foremost, economically, the average price of gas that the US consumer is facing right now is about $3.87 per gallon. That's up. Get this 20 cents from just over a month ago and nearly 56 cents when you compare it to a year ago. So when you couple that with high inflation at about 8.1% in the United States, not to mention, as you said in Europe, where in the UK, it's 10.1%. Workers around the world, especially in Europe and the United States, are feeling the brunt of this. But secondly, to take this back to the US midterm election cycle just last night in Miami, when Senator Marco Rubio was up on stage debating val Demings, his Democratic challenger, he essentially said that, quote, our oil reserves do not exist to win midterms, end quote. The Republicans are seizing on this. They view this as a winning issue. They want to increase domestic US oil production. And they don't.",https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OFbNeKtIJNY,19,2022-10-19 15:13:31
3634," exist to win midterms."" End quote. The Republicans are seizing on this. They view this as a winning issue. They want to increase domestic U.S. oil production, and they don't think that the administration should just be utilizing the strategic oil reserves. In contrast to that, there's a political context in this that the President Biden's expected to make later this afternoon. And that is that they are declaring political war against big oil, and they are going to try to especially target big oil profits that have been made throughout the pandemic, and they feel that drawing that contrast is a way for them to mobilize the base of their party, especially those who have interest on climate change while essentially trying to have it both ways by releasing some from the strategic oil reserves. And then quickly, the third and final point is the geopolitics. You can't ignore Putin's war with Ukraine and the impact that that's having on European oil, but you also can't ignore that the pressure that this is now caused on the U.S. Saudi relationship. And already, again, on Capitol Hill, you're hearing members of both parties quite frankly, criticize the Saudis who, of course, run OPEC for their decision. And this impact is especially going to, I think, reveal the leverage that some foreign governments have in terms of impacting the everyday U.S. consumer. Yeah, and we've seen a number of lawmakers come out and talking about restricting arms sales, for example, to Saudi Arabia. On that second point that you just made, though, about this, you know, sort of fight that we're seeing play out between the administration and then big oil, and the reality is these reserves are at their lowest in decades. I mean, the administration needs being oil to be on board, right? What does that look like right now? Well, you know, privately, the energy sector here in Washington, DC, the energy lobby, are, I would say, rolling their eyes because, look, President Biden comes from Delaware. This was a state that has a heavy refinery contingency in the state. And it's really reflective of the dynamics within the democratic party right now, where you have the moderates who are potentially more moderate on this issue. But again, you have this new wing of progressives on the flank of the party who are trying to really move the party much more to the left, especially as it relates to climate change. And so this puts President Biden in a significant, significant political debacle, because here you have an issue that according to most polls, virtually all polls, including the CBS poll that came out just the other week, where the economy is the number one issue amongst independent voters. And in states like Florida, where again, Senator Rubio is beating Demings according to polls, the average of polls are real clear politics by five percentage points, or looking at state like Pennsylvania, where in the Senate race there met Menaz, the Republican challenging John Fetterman, the progressive, had those polls have tightened energy inflation. These are the closing arguments that Republicans are making in their closing bid as we lead up to the mid-serve elections. Just a few more weeks to go. Yeah. Should get interesting. Kevin Sereli is always appreciate your insight. Thank you for having me. Well, strong quarterly results are helping lift shares of Proctor and Gamble. Take a look at that. The stock is up nearly 3 percent after the consumer products giant Beat Wall Street estimates on the top and bottom lines as increased prices help offset lower demand and higher costs. Dollar strength, though, weighed on the company's outlook, cutting its full-year sales forecast. And now, expect sales to decline one to three percent lower than previous forecasts. Furnings per share expected to come in at the lower end of the range as well. CEO John Muller speaking to our morning team is that the consumers remains resilient even in the face of high inflation. But if we look at consumer sentiment and one measure of that is trade down to private label brands, we're seeing very little movement. So in North America, past three in six months, private label brands increase share by only 30 basis points on a 12 month basis. They're flat. Same general situation in Europe. And while we see a pop in the stock today shares of Proctor and Gamble are down roughly 20 percent year to date.

The company lifted its guidance but reported a drop in sales because of the baby formula shortage. A decline in COVID-19 testing also weighed on the quarter. Averturning is called with investors just wrapping up. A key go on that point of the baby formula weighing on the nutrition line of business down 10%. The company noting that there are many global trends that are weighing COVID including inflation, strong dollar. All in all, they seem to be remaining optimistic about the baby formula shortage and that's getting over as they reopen the plan last quarter. Let's take a deeper dive into Abbott's numbers here with Shogun Singh, who's now certainly down despite some of those results. I'm imagining you've got an outperform with the price target of $132 a share so you certainly feel like there's more upside. What do you think investors are getting wrong? Thank you so much for having us here. We do like the stock. The company does have a pretty solid.",https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OFbNeKtIJNY,21,2022-10-19 15:21:58
3636," No, thank you so much firstly for having us here. You know, I we do like the stock we think, you know, the company does have a pretty solid long term financial profile of growth in the high single digits on the top line and double digit EPS growth on the bottom line. You know, if we just look at the Q3 numbers, the quarter was actually pretty strong. You know, they did beat by 700 million on the top line and about 20 cents on EPS. You know, COVID-19 testing was definitely what drove the results, you know, the results came in at about $1.7 billion. Consensus was looking at about 540 million in sales. So really impressive despite the summer months. And, you know, if you look at a full year, a full year guidance at this point, it's 7.8 billion in COVID-19 sales, which is actually ahead of what they did last year. So, you know, pretty solid revenues in terms of COVID-19. I think what the sticking point here really is is the mid to mid single to high single digit underlying growth. So there were factors that impacted the quarter such as COVID, you know, if you back out COVID-19 testing an infant formula recall, there was also medical device supply issues that impacted the company. So if you back out all those one time items on an underlying basis, the company delivered about mid single to high single digit underlying growth, which is slightly below the longer term outlook of high single digits. But I think it's more of a reflection of Q3, which is seasonally a week a quarter, and then the COVID-19 environment, whether recovery is occurring, but you know, it is at a much slower pace than what, you know, we would have liked in a normal environment. Shagun, Angelie here. I want to look at some of the very specific details that they let us know about today, one being the new plant for baby formula production. And then also looking at the Libre test and looking at also models that are pretty different when it comes to direct consumer and subscription models. I know there was mention of that. I wonder how you think this all plays for a company that's as large as it is that has had, you know, quite a diverse market so far. Yeah, I think, you know, both on infant formula recall, I think, you know, it's a good step that they are, you know, planning to, you know, they have made some leadership changes at the Michigan facility and they are planning to move forward with plans about half a billion dollar in investments in a new US nutrition facility for specialty and metabolic infant formulas. You know, I think there is, you know, upside on diabetes as well. And, you know, honestly, if you just take a step back and look at the company, you know, I do like the diversified portfolio that the company has. You know, they are continuing to move forward within medical devices. You know, again, nutrition business. I think this is lost about 20 share points given the recall they gained half of it back as of September and the impact. I think this year is about 750 million, but I think this business should recover into next year. Also in terms of diabetes, you know, there is a CMS proposed coverage guidelines for CGMs, the common period of that is open till about the 19th of November. And if expanded and coverage is approved, you know, it could really bring more eligible patients to the population, 4 million, going to about 8 million, which is another $2 billion US opportunity. So I do like their diversified portfolio. And I think they do have a leapsed of in terms of, you know, just diabetes, medical devices, diagnostics and nutrition coming back. Let's elaborate on that a bit. As you pointed out, you know, some of the sentiment that's weighing on the stock today is about the decline we've seen in COVID testing. Yes, we're going into what is expected to be a period of more optics and COVID cases, but the reality is we're not going to be at the peak that we haven't over the last few years. You mentioned a long list of other levers within their portfolio. What do you think is going to be the biggest driver that gets you to that $132 share price target? Yeah, and I just want to back up. I don't think it's so much about COVID testing. It's more about, like I mentioned, investors focus on the underlying growth profile of the company. When you back out COVID testing, the infant formula recall, which is about a $230 million hit this quarter again. And then the medical supply.",https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OFbNeKtIJNY,22,2022-10-19 15:26:30
3637," company when you back out COVID testing the infant formula recall, which is about a $230 million hit this quarter again. And then the medical supply, medical device supply issue that they faced internationally. So I think the sticking point for investors right now is really recovery. Just in terms of COVID, you know, I think in an endemic phase as a base case, the company is looking for about $500 million in quarterly sales. I think that's a good placeholder even for next year, which does provide some upside. So, you know, I think, you know, again, the mid to high single digit profile versus the highest single digit organic revenue growth that they aspire to get to on a long-term basis. You know, I think the variance between that is really, you know, I think Q3 being seasonally weaker and then, you know, the COVID-19 environment, you know, whether recovery is occurring, but it is not, you know, we are not in normal time. So I think that's having an impact. So I think that's more of a sticking point than COVID-19 testing. And again, you know, just to mention again, they are doing about $7.8 billion, you know, for the full year, that's their guidance at this point, was a $7.7 billion that they did last year. Q4 includes about $500 million in quarterly sales for for COVID-19 testing business. And, you know, again, that does not include any additional COVID surges or government contracts. Sure. Good seeing medical devices analysts at RBC capital markets. Appreciate your time today and our thanks to Angelic Kamlani as well. Well, coming up, scrutiny intensifies. Bankrupt crypto lender Celsius faces US federal investigations. According to fresh legal findings, they highlight investigations in at least 40 states we're going to continue to unravel that story next.",https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OFbNeKtIJNY,23,2022-10-19 15:30:40
3638," We're turning now to crypto Celsius. Maybe gone. But it's definitely lives on the bankrupt crypto lender facing numerous federal and state investigation over its practices, transparency, and even alleged misuse of funds. Let's bring in Yahoo Finance, senior reporter David Hollerith, who has been following all the twists and turns of this company. We're talking what, more than 40 states investigating here. I mean, this is pretty significant. Yeah, Akiko, we've seen reports since last week sort of indicating that 40 states, as well as the SEC, FTC, several other federal agencies have all been looking into the Celsius networks financial dealings before bankruptcy. To our point, if we take a step back, the most important thing for the bankruptcy proceeding, which these investigations will likely not impact too much is how much creditors, mostly customers, get a return on the funds they held on the platform. Now to move that process forward, there's going to be a bidding procedure. In the deadline for that, still hasn't been worked out. There have been a number of other crypto firms that have said they've shown some interest in buying the firm's assets. But if we turn back to what's going on right now, the next hearing for Celsius is tomorrow at 10 a.m. And we're likely to hear more clarity around all these regulatory investigations. I think one thing to point out is that since the beginning of this bankruptcy happened, there's probably potentially some consolidation in terms of all the investigations that are going on. For example, the Unsecured Creditors Committee has sort of teamed up with a third party examiner that's been appointed. So a lot of these reports, I think, are going to be worked out in tandem. That being said, this examiner report, which seems to be the timeline, seems to be shortening for it. That's probably going to be the most comprehensive thing we see from the public. And we haven't seen any outright allegations from regulators yet. But there are numerous examples sort of floating in the public of the indicate that there could be indications of fraud in Celsius's dealings. Obviously, most of it is C-suite and step down. Okay. Potentially new developments coming down tomorrow. I know you'll be on top of it. David Holler, thanks so much for that. Well, coming up the outlier, Porsche's listing may have been the only bright spot for the down-trot and IPO market this year. 2020 has seen the least money raised since 1995. So it's the only way off. We'll get into the conversation with S&P Global on the other side. Okay. All right. All right.",https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OFbNeKtIJNY,24,2022-10-19 15:34:59
3639," So They have this quarter, meaning a past quarter, third quarter, 22 growing. They have the fourth quarter, the first quarter, the second quarter, the third quarter, all negative territories around half percent, one to one and a half percent. So a slight shallow down and we're trending and growing at the end of next year. They have pushed that projection for recession out a little bit into 23, but their core belief is a mild recession. That was Bank of America CEO Brian Moynihan speaking with our very own Brian Sasi this morning. The investment bank beat the results or beat the street, which is to say with results on Monday, benefiting in part from higher rates. Well policy tightening has been the story of 2022 along with sky high inflation. Both of these factors, a lethal combination for stocks and therefore not exactly fertile ground for IPOs either. Fewer companies are looking to navigate a listing in this environment because of the high volatility and low investor appetite in part to poor returns from last year's new issues. Here break it all down to see how this is all playing out in the IPO slowdown. We've got SMP Global's senior writer, Brian Shide. Good to talk to you today. I guess the question here is are we starting to see a turn because we have seen the big, big dip in activity. We're now in October. Are things starting to look up? So thanks for having me out at Kiko. I really appreciate it. If we're looking at 2022 compared to 2021, 2021 was really this record setting breakout year for IPOs, according to SMP Global Market Intelligence data, there were more than 3,250 IPOs in 2021. In 2022, we're on track for about half that. That's thinking that things are going to keep at the same pace, which I think most people are thinking there's going to be an additional downturn. In the US, we're on track to about 1.6 as many IPOs in 2022. It's safe to say that all momentum from that breakout year has been lost. Just a little more perspective on this. For the first three quarters of this year, the IPOs worldwide raised about $144 billion. Now that's $68 billion less than what was raised in the first quarter of 2021 alone. IPO activity really has slowed down to a crawl in 2022. And I'm not sure that it gets much better from here. We have heard over and over, especially with some of these highly valued tech startups that the cons are tough. When trying to come to market, they have slash valuations. Yesterday, we saw Intel looking at a lower valuation for their IPO for mobile I. I mean, how many companies you think are willing to come to market in this environment, even with a lower valuation? So obviously, each company is very different. But you look at sort of the overwhelming factor that companies, they just don't think that they can raise that much cash right now through an IPO in 2022.",https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OFbNeKtIJNY,25,2022-10-19 15:39:30
3640," But you look at sort of the overwhelming factor that companies, they just don't think that they can raise that much cash right now through an IPO in 2022. Whether or not they can take that lower valuation, I think is anyone's guess, I think right now, they'll probably wait it out a little bit longer. If you look at the biggest US IPO as of 2022, we were looking at core bridge financial, that retirement and insurance company. They raised nearly 1.7 billion last month, TPG and asset management company raised about 1.1 billion back in January. Those are really the only billion dollar US IPO's, that's it. So you compare that to last year, you know, you had Rivian, the electric vehicle maker, they raised 11.9 billion, almost 12 billion dollars, lucid motors, EV company raising 4.6 billion. We're just not seeing anything on that scale in 2022. And with all of the different factors that play right now, you know, Fed rate, Higgs volatility, recession fears, like it was discussed, I just don't see that number jumping that much in the fourth quarter. And we're going to have, you know, this severe downturn we're seeing in 2022 and compared to last year. And that's most likely just going to continue. So what do you think is the catalyst that could turn things around? I've heard you say over and over that you don't think things are going to turn at least in the short to medium term. What are you going to be looking for that says that maybe companies are ready to come to market again? Is it about the Fed policy? You're seeing the tightening cycle, you know, wrapping up or I mean, what exactly is it that companies are going to be looking for? I mean, there's all these different factors, right? You have like I said, heightened volatility, the war in Ukraine, inflation hitting levels. We haven't seen since the early 1980s. But you did mention this. The one big thing, Fed rate hikes, that's boosted borrowing costs sort of across the board for these companies. The Fed has boosted its benchmark rate by 300 basis points since March after having this, you know, ultra low near zero rate policy for since the beginning of the pandemic. And that really fueled that IPO growth, that record breaking growth in IPOs. We saw in 2021. Now the futures market expecting another 75 basis point hike at their meeting in November. The Fed could hike, you know, I think the expectation is almost to 5%. So that ramp up from zero to 5%, but you know, by early 2023, I think, you know, at that point, you need to see some sort of Fed pivot. And I think most people, the market, you see these jump starts going on in the stock market right now. And that's, you know, sort of this hope that becomes false hope that the Fed is pivoting. And until you see a very clear sign that that Fed pivot is happening, I don't think that you're going to have much of a turnaround in this IPO and buyer. I expect a little more quiet to come here. S&P Global Senior Ryder Branshide. Get to have you on today. Or public ads are approaching the final weeks of the battle for Congress with momentum as the economy and inflation become dominant concerns. But what happens if the GOP wins one or both houses of Congress in November, Yahoo Finance, senior columnist Rick Newman has the latest analysis. Rick, it was just what a few weeks ago that we were talking about sort of these social issues, like abortion, really driving the gains for Democrats. But it certainly feels like the last few weeks have tipped things over back to the Republicans. It does seem that way. And this has a lot to do with President Biden's approval rating, which is a usually a determinant of what happens in the midterm elections. He has tipped up to around 44 percent. But that's probably not high enough for Democrats to hold onto Congress. So what's the outlook for markets if Republicans do win one or both houses of Congress? Republicans, they could pass some legislation. But if it's anything Biden opposes, he'll just veto it. So it's not like we're going to see Republican priorities suddenly becoming law. But the ability to obstruct could be pretty important. And House Marley leader Kevin McCarthy, who probably would become House Speaker for Republicans win the House, he gave an interesting hint about one thing Republicans might do around the middle of next year, which is potentially block an increase in the federal borrowing limit. Now this is a show we've seen many times before.",https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OFbNeKtIJNY,26,2022-10-19 15:43:52
3641," do around the middle of next year, which is potentially block an increase in the federal borrowing limit. Now, this is a show we've seen many times before. Republicans have used this tactic of trying to hold out on extending the borrowing limit in order to get priorities they wanted. It's usually some kind of spending cuts. This time around it could be reformed to entitlement programs like Social Security and Medicare. Now, the federal borrowing limit, Congress did raise it in last December. It didn't really make news because it just went up. Democrats controlled Congress and they weren't going to have some kind of smackdown given that they were the ones in charge. But we could end up having this battle again sometime in the summer or the fall of 23. And everybody hates this battle when it happens. So something to gurd for. Just over two weeks to go until the all-important midterms. Rick Newman, thanks so much for that. Well, coming up after the peak, use car prices, rocket and during the pandemic, and even clung on to gains during much of this year. Now, the price lump is gaining traction. But how steep for the decline B will kick the tires and Carvana's stock on the other side. Well, what bushes downgrading Carvana to neutral from outperform, saying the online use car dealer is less likely to achieve the potential for solid unit economics at scale. Joining us now with more on this is what Bush Securities Retail Hardlines Analyst Seth Basham sets, walk me three of these. Yeah, bottom line is that we think this company does have a viable business model. There's a compelling value proposition for consumers and the company can make money selling cars online to consumers. But it needs to do that by selling a lot of cars at the same time. That's the way its cost structure is built. And right now what we're seeing is falling use car unit sales and that's pressuring their profitability along with an ill time acquisition earlier this year, which is styling the company with excess capacity and excess interest costs. I mean, this has been a steep fall for Carvana this year to put it lightly. When you look at where the market is overall, how much of this is about sort of the market, the slowing demand dictating where the company has been moving. How much of it?",https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OFbNeKtIJNY,27,2022-10-19 15:48:03
3642," When you look at where the market is overall, how much of this is about sort of the market, the slowing demand, dictating where the company has been moving, how much of it is self-inflicted? That's a good question. I'd probably gauge it as about half and half. The market is certainly moving against them. We're seeing double digit declines and use unit vehicle sales for the industry right now. We're seeing fall on use car prices. They're declining nearly double digits each year, every year right now as well. However, the company was doing everything to grow as fast as it could through COVID and was not very disciplined with the way it was operating in its business that led to a lot of inefficiencies, a lot of blowback from customers, from rating from state DMVs. And it's trying to rectify those issues at the same time that's facing this big decline in the outlook for use vehicle sales. Looking at where the chart is, the stock was at over $200 a share at the beginning of the year. We're now looking at what, $15? Is this the price point to get in? $15 is our target price right now, but we stay sideline for the time being as we think that some of the near term headwinds remain severe. Our forecast for earnings ends cash flow, our well below where the consensus is right now. And I think there needs to be a reset before considering buying this stock. Well, Bush Securities Retail Hardlines Analyst, Seth Abasham, appreciate your time today. Well, new survey from the Federal Reserve shows productivity taking a hit with employees working from home. Let's bring in Yahoo Finance's Carrie Hanon with the specifics on that today. A lot of companies are saying this is not a surprise. Yeah, I mean, the study from the Federal Reserve Bank of New York shows that they looked at 15% of workers are still remote who are full-time workers and about 30% are doing hybrid. And the thing is, this is fabulous for workers. This is what, when I talk to workers out there, this is what they're looking for. They want flexibility. They want autonomy. They want to know that they have more control of their time. And they are doing that, you know, in fact, by saving that commute time, I don't see how that's really hitting productivity that much. What it's happening is people are using that save time and let's say save money as well, to do things that give them that work-life balance that we all discovered during the pandemic that we found out what our priorities were and what we really wanted to do with our time. And, you know, so they found that people under 30, you know, they tend to spend that extra time eating out or exercising. And those over 30 tend to be spending that extra bonus time that they have from saving that commute on, you know, preparing meals and childcare. And they don't mention this, but I would suggest it's probably aging relative care as well and home maintenance. Are you kidding me? That's what they're spending their time on. But guess what? It is having that sense that they know they can do their jobs from home. And they're going to use this as a bargaining thing. And I'm telling you in a type job market which still exists today, even though it's slowly changing. This is something that workers can definitely ask for, bargain for. And this is what they want. They want flexibility, no commute. Now, away from that, there are those workers who are considering making a shift in their retirement accounts. Turns out it might be costly to be moving things. I mean, what more can you tell us there? Yeah, this was so interesting to me. Pew Charitable Trust came out with this study that looked at the basic advice. We tell people, you know, that you always hear of your switching jobs. Don't forget to, you know, roll over your 401k or 430b to an IRA account. You know, your individual retirement account, where you have more control over it and more, you know, investment opportunities and you can continue to add to it. But what they found out, you found that in fact, the fees. And this is something a lot of people don't think about is what the fees charge for your, when you roll over to an IRA, even if it's the exact same mutual fund, will charge higher fees in your account and your IRA because it's a retail account. You're an individual. It's not that same mutual fund in your employer plan was an institutional fee. And so that tends to be lower and that fee, which is your expense ratio. That's what you look for. Is the expense ratio?",https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OFbNeKtIJNY,28,2022-10-19 15:52:39
3643," plan was an institutional fee. And so that tends to be lower. And that fee, which is your expense ratio, that's what you look for, is the expense ratio. That's marketing and management fees. Now, a big company can negotiate for lower fees for those institutional fees. So the point is it may be less expensive in overtime. It seems like these are little just small increments, but it's a big impact over time. They looked at one example that was someone that had, over 25 year period, the exact same mutual fund that was in a retail account and an institutional, had a $10,000 higher cost of fees in the retail fund. So what the point is people need to pay attention to the fees, do your research. Finra.org, F-I-N-R-A.org, allows you to do some research on what those fees are. It's really important. OK, some good takeaways there. And of course, all that information on our website, as well, with Kerry on top of that story. Kerry-Hannan, thanks so much for that. Well, coming up projections suggest the global sports spending market could be worth close to $1 trillion in the next decade or so. And the US wants a bigger piece of the pie. We're talking about one specific company. We'll have that discussion on the other side. So what's that? this is my new Welcome back to Yahoo Finance Live. Sports apparel and e-commerce company Fanatics has taken the next big step into the gambling world as they announced the hiring of Andrea Ellis to fill the role of chief financial officer of its betting and gaming division. For one, let's bring in Yahoo Finance is Josh Schaeffer. Josh, this comes as there's a lot of speculation about what those gambling ambitions look like for the supply. Right. So now we have Fanatics as a CFO and Andrea Ellis. They have a CMO that they hired last month. They have a CEO for the betting part of the company that's Matt King, the former CEO of Fandall. So they have everyone, seems like they're starting to get fully staffed. And Michael Rubin said last week that he thinks this is going to start in January. That's the goal here. So a little bit on Andrea Ellis just to kind of give you a little bit of background. She was at Lyme before this, the scooter company. She was a CFO over there, Harvard Business School grad, Starter Career at Goldman Sachs. So not a ton of sports betting experience per se, but Lyme, another company that is very competitive with other companies in the space, I should say. And that's obviously what we see in sports gambling a lot. Fanatics going to get into this.",https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OFbNeKtIJNY,29,2022-10-19 15:57:24
3644," But I'm another company that is very competitive with other companies in the space, I should say. And that's obviously what we see in sports gambling a lot. Phenatics going to get into this in January. They're going to be, you know, in the ring with Draft King's fan duel, those kind of companies. So let's talk about that because, you know, you cover the space. It feels increasingly crowded. How does Phenatics compete there? Right. Well, I think one of the things Michael Ruben talks a lot about is they're not going to have to spend as much on licensing, right? So they can save. I think that is key. They could save per his estimates 30 to 40%. But you're still going to have to pay to get the customers. So if you look at New York right now, which Phenatics does not have a license in to be clear, but they have very good public records. That's why I use New York and it's the biggest market. Phendual has 47% of the market share, almost 48%. Draft King's has almost 30%. So you're looking at nearly 80% of the market covered by the two companies we talk all the time about. And GM is also in the space, Penn, Caesars, how many of these companies are going to come out as winners? Phenatics is going to have to spend a lot. A company like Draft King spends about $350 per customer in the first six months to acquire a customer. Phenatics is going to want a lot of customers. We're talking hundreds of millions of dollars. Companies valued at $27, $28 billion, $27 billion. So they have the money, but it's going to cost them a little bit more than it does to sell shirts. So it'll be interesting to see how that goes. And as you said, users go where the money is or the promotions are, right? Right. Yeah, they're going to need to spend to get those customers in and then can you keep them? That'll be a big question. January, right around the corner. We'll be watching. Absolutely. Thanks so much for that, Josh. Let's do a final check of the markets before we let you go. As we said, it's kind of been an often down session here. But the Dow still, the only one in the green right now, up just slightly about 35 points there. And the S&P 500 down at seven and the Nasdaq down 27. Certainly earnings, very much the focus of what we have seen in the markets over the last few days. It's going to continue today. We've got Tesla, a big one. After the bell, we're going to have you all covered there in our afternoon show. But that does it for me in this hour. We have much more to come here and yaken finance live. We're right here. Thanks. Shots. Shots.",https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OFbNeKtIJNY,30,2022-10-19 16:01:39
3645," Thank you for being with us this morning. Man, the administration has a tough job and I'm curious how you think they're doing. I mean, between this and now reported upon further release from the strategic petroleum reserve from the back and forth with Saudi Arabia, what kind of grade would you give this administration and how it is dealing with what was a climbing market for gasoline prices? Sure. So the grade would depend on actually what you're looking at in some respects. They get a very high grade. They've managed to actually help engineer the drop in oil prices that we've seen since Brent reached 130 last spring with the height of the first disruption of Russian supply. How they've gone about it is a little bit bizarre, however. Sometimes they've antagonized the producers. I think the price cap issue is the one in which they get the lowest grade so far. Price caps have been tried before. They were tried when the Iran Iraq war broke out and they were designed by the IEA to keep oil prices from running up and they had the reverse effect actually. So the history of trying to put a price cap on is not very good and it's kind of ironic that they're doing this at a time when the producers look at them and say, hey, they're putting on a price cap. We're trying to put a floor under prices. They don't like that. Why should we like them putting a price cap on Russia when they could do the same thing to us if this kind of thing works? So it has mixed grades, I think. Is there any time frame in which this would actually kind of show up for end consumers people who are using the inter-reliant on this actually doing something on the pricing front? Sure. Well, let me give you a perfect example. So the US and allies decided to release 200 million barrels of strategic stocks. They did that when prices were exorbitantly high and there was this distortion in the market with European companies and the US avoiding imports of Russian oil. Prices went up. The release of the strategic stocks actually increased total stocks available in the commercial market by around 200 million barrels. If you look at where the stocks were in the OECD at the beginning of the year and look at where commercial stocks are now on land floating in floating inventory and in transit moving from the seller to the buyer, it's up by around 200 million barrels and we're actually relatively high in terms of total oil that we measure in high frequency data. We're relatively high in terms of the last five year average. So they've succeeded and we've seen the gasoline price come down. They're confronting another set of problems right now. One being that the European Union has decided to have no imports from Russia starting on the crude side starting on December 5th and that is already triggering a kind of buying spree. We've seen a growth in the premium of wet barrels of rent against a screen barrel. So we're seeing a bidding up at the price in the Atlantic base and just as we did last March, the price cap is designed to alleviate that telling companies that if they can buy at a price below whatever the cap is on Russian crude then they can have an exception to the embargo but then they didn't think through what would Russia do. Russia said Putin said they put on this cap, they put on the embargo and we're just going to drop our production and to prove the point they clearly stopped exporting natural gas to Europe when Europe said they were going to put a price cap on natural gas and stop importing it sooner or later. But I have a story on the Yagufan and its home page right now, Home Depot's co-founder Bernie Marcus criticizing the Biden administration for not letting or just not the administration not being encouraging to drilling in this country but the other side of this coin is that all companies may not be drilling as much as you would think in this environment. What do you think is true? What do you think of that, too?",https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OFbNeKtIJNY,31,2022-10-19 16:05:26
3646," Or just not the administration not being encouraging to drilling in this country. But the other side of this coin is that all companies may not be drilling as much as you would think in this environment. What do you think is true? What do you think of that take? So it really begins with what happened historically. We had a pandemic at that pandemic's time. The U.S. production of oil and natural gas was at pretty high. We were growing both at a rapid rate, about a million plus barrels a day per year. We had hit 13 million barrels of production in the early weeks of March 2020. We had a price collapse. We had negative pricing. U.S. companies stopped drilling. U.S. companies are in what we call short cycle oil. We also had a bad hurricane season in 2020. And that 13 million barrels a day of flows turned into about 10 and a half million barrels a day by the end of 2020. We've been rebuilding since then. We're back to 12 million a day. In the natural gas side, we actually have hit a record level of production ever. So I think the constraint there is not even conservative investments by companies because of so-called shareholder requests to return capital to the shareholder. No, on natural gas, the only constraint inside is the lack potentially a pipeline capacity to move it to the export market on the Gulf of a couple of years from now. The return of oil has been slower. It's partly a function of the discipline, the so-called discipline that some companies are imposing on themselves when it comes to drilling, but they're leading and lagging indicators. We actually think the amount of drilling taking place now will give rise to a hefty increase in production this year of around 700,000 barrels a day of crude oil, 500,000 barrels a day of natural gas liquids. So over a million barrels a day, contributions similarly next year. So we're coming back, but the U.S. would have been producing closer to 15 million barrels a day to day. Had there not been that collapse and drilling that took place in 2020? Right, which has to do with the pandemic more so than some of the other factors perhaps. Exactly. And I want to ask you about this winter, both in Europe and in the United States. It feels like there, of course, they're bracing for an energy crisis this winter with a spike in natural gas prices. Here in the Northeast, in particular, there's talk about potential blackouts or brownouts as well. What are you expecting? Can you paint the picture for us? Sure. It's called weather, weather, weather. We've managed not to have the weather that would have hit the world in a significant way had the U.S. had a hurricane season. Yes, my fingers across and the hurricane season is not technically over until November 30th. And if we were to have a big hurricane season, a little factoid in the market that people haven't noticed would really be impactful. That little factoid is that when Europe moved away from Russian gas, they started buying, excuse me, oil. They started buying U.S. oil. U.S. was a gross exporter of around 7 million barrels a day, last January in February, 5 million of that was products. 2 million of that was crude oil. We now have been hitting over 11 million barrels a day, some weeks in exports, and we're averaging closer to 10 million a day. And our exports have crude have doubled from 2 million a day to 4 million a day. So we have become the residual incremental supplier to the European market as this reshuffling is taking place. With we have cold weather this winter, there are two different effects. One is on the gas market, and the other is on the oil market. On the gas market, undoubtedly we have healthy European stocks. That's one reason on the inventory side while European prices have fallen by about 40% from their peaks of a couple of months ago on the natural gas side. But a poll of vortex would wreak havoc in the Europe and would have an impact in the U.S. and the Northeast in particular. In Europe, governments, particularly the UK government, but other governments in Europe as well, are subsidizing the cost of electricity. That means they're subsidizing the cost of gas. This is a question of subsidizing and protecting the consumer. The question is, what do you do when you run out of material? So that's the real danger of weather. With the absence of a flow of gas from Russia, a limited amount of storage, however full it might be now.",https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OFbNeKtIJNY,32,2022-10-19 16:09:57
3647," of material. So that's the real danger of weather. With the absence of a flow of gas from Russia, a limited amount of storage, however full it might be now, if we get a one or two cold spells in Europe, the inventory simply won't be there, the deliveries won't be there, and there will be blackouts. So that's one of the factors. The other on the oil side is that we have had a bizarre thing happening, a shift that is really remarkable, namely that natural gas prices around the world except for the US have risen to the point where it's cheaper to buy diesel than it is to buy natural gas. So we're seeing a lot of fuel switching. Europe is encouraging utilities to move back to using oil, to burn oil. They burned very little oil last year, which was also a last winter, was also a tough one. We don't know what the fuel switching capacity is, but diesel prices are high in part because of an anticipated increase in demand for diesel fuel for power burn, and what remains to be seen by that will actually happen. The recent market rally may give some investors a reason to be optimistic in this bear market. Our next guest says he has three reasons to be optimistic right now, including signs the Fed's plan might be working. We're joined now by pro shares, global investment strategist Simion Heim and Simion Great to have you here in St. Louis. Thanks for having me. Okay, first and foremost, when you think about the reasons to be optimistic in US equities, I mean, some of that has to be based on where valuations in the compression that we're seeing right now where they sit at this point. Absolutely. You got to start with valuations. We're trading around 16 times 2022 expected earnings. Look, we still have a 4% 10 year that still historically reasonably low supports on average something around a 20 PE. So if we do this math, that tells me that we could miss consensus expectations by at least 10 if not 15 to 20% and still be in line with 16 times consensus, which might turn out to be 18 plus times what actually turns up. So that's a valuation, please. We also put up some of the other reasons that the Fed may be achieving their objective and the US economy is relatively well positioned. If we take the second of those, the Fed may be achieving their objective, but if the Fed doesn't think they're achieving their objective and they keep going, that's really the fear of people, right? Is that they're going to keep going, overshoot, and then push the economy into a recession. The evidence, let's start with the evidence first. The break-evens are the big piece of evidence as far as we're concerned. So they have come way, way down. Yes, over the last couple of weeks, they've poked up a little bit.",https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OFbNeKtIJNY,33,2022-10-19 16:14:01
3648," Let's start with the evidence first. The break-events are the big piece of evidence as far as we're concerned. So they have come way, way down. Yes, over the last couple of weeks, they've poked up a little bit. But you had break-events on the two-year at about 5% earlier this year. They're down to about 2.5% right now. That's getting close to the 2% mark that the federal... And do you think the Fed is going to be watching the break-events? I think we have to be cautiously optimistic that we will. But the wild card is employment. If the employment market stays as tight as it is, that's where you get a little bit of the tension. We're getting into what usually is a seasonally good period for the markets. Do you think that seasonality will remain intact, given where we are at the Fed, given how low markets have come down this year? I think there's two ways to think about it. If you're looking for a little bit of a shorter term perspective, then you want to lean into the sectors that are likely as an example to do well in earning season. We're seeing pretty decent numbers for the financials right now. We have an ETF EQR, our equities for rising rates. It piles into energy, financials, materials. That's your best bet for our performance near term in the earning season and kind of if you will, a 369, 12-month horizon. When we look at the BFA Fund Manager survey today, one of the things that sticks out is that we are at the lowest level for some of the investors, the institutions, to really insert some type of speculation within their portfolio or take on risk. And that risk aversion right now at one of those lowest levels since 2008. And so when is it safe to start kind of picking at some of the more kind of speculative names that have been hit as a result of either policy or whether that just be because there's no real earnings to show for some of these companies? So I come from a trust company background and we weren't big sentiment folks really trying to call the bottom. But I think you want to play this. I don't want to call it a barbell, but I mentioned just leaning into the sectors that are likely to outperform in the near term. And that's a shorter time horizon. Again, not in days for us, but in quarters. But if you're looking for a place where you don't have to worry about the inflection point, it's those consistent dividend growers, our ETF which we always talk about at NOLBL, CSNP 500 of risk to crats, the quintessential a hedge against inflation is rising dividends. And if you look to those consistent dividend growers, you don't have to worry about the bottoms tomorrow. Is it next month? Is it even a quarter from now? We haven't talked about crypto much lately. And yet it's the one year anniversary of a crypto ETF that you guys came out with, BIT or BITO, as you guys call it in house, I guess. And I'm curious how it's been doing. I mean, because it's sort of, Bitcoin has sort of fallen out of the headlines to some extent. It's been a volatile period. And what we're very proud of about BITO BITO is that it's done exactly what it's supposed to do. It has tracked spot Bitcoin really, really well. And folks didn't think that was going to happen. They were all worked up about the roll cost. But if you open up a finance textbook, this is a non-yielding thing. It's a financial future. You don't have to store it in tankers out there. So therefore, the roll cost should be equal to the short term interest rate. And BITO holds cash such that it earns interest on the cash about equal to the roll cost. It's tracking its spot on. It's the largest cryptocurrency in the world. And it trades really well. So when you put that together, whether you're time horizon is a short one or a buy and hold, it's really moved to the fore as a vehicle of choice. Always good to get some time.

3649," you you you There's a lot of questions about whether they're behind the curve. Joining us now to discuss all of this BlackRock's global fixed income CIO, Rick Reader. Hey, Rick. How are you? Nice to see you, a person. Sure, have me. So we have this sort of bounce that we're seeing in the market here. And this debate now about whether it's going to be sustained, whether this is another head fake. What do you think? So I don't think you can count on the market, continue to have, by the way, it's nice being here on a green deck. We don't get many of those these days. But I think it's hard to count on sustained this being sustained. You've got to Fed the still tightening financial conditions. You've got inflation that's still running too hot. And they've got to keep moving. I think that the markets are priced in about as far as the Fed is going to go. But you don't know the answer to that yet. And until we get more data, we just came off a strong CPI report. We came off a strong payroll report. You know, now all eyes turn to the employment cost index, PCE data. And we need to see it start to trend down for the Fed to come off this. And then it's hard to take a lot of risk until that happens. Has it been encouraging to you, though, Rick, that we've seen the market rally in response to earnings that aren't necessarily great Goldman Bank of America? They're OK. They weren't as bad as feared. But even go back to last week, you saw some hot reads on inflation. The market bounced on those numbers as well. Those, to me, seemed like positives. They definitely do. And by the way, the bank earnings are pretty good. I mean, when you break it down, those are pretty good. You also had a big relief off of this dynamic that was happening in the UK. I mean, this unwind of the leverage in the pension system was incredibly dislocating. The impact it was having on rates in the UK, and then infecting the US and Europe. That was a big deal. Listen, I think you've got the equity market has some pretty sizable short positions in it today. And I think people underestimate how much the market has gotten repositioned around equities. And you're seeing some pretty big put option trading, very big positions. And short interest, that's pretty sizable. And so the technicals in the equity market are pretty darn good today. So you get these bounces. And my sense is you'll keep getting them. But can you count on a sustained rally? I think it's still early to think that. I want to pick up on the point about the UK for just a second. Because there was more news out this morning. The financial time said they were going to delay their quantitative tightening. Then the bank of England says, no, we're not necessarily going to delay it. But I've been sort of struggling to some extent to understand the interplay between what's going on in the UK and here. So can you sort of lay that out for us and why it is so important what's happening? 100%. So you've got dynamic in the UK, which is extraordinary, in that you had what appeared to be at the time aggressive fiscal easing. At the same time, you were seeing central bank tightening. That is not nobody in history has ever seen that work out. So that was creating this volatility in the markets. But then you have a dynamic that you had this leverage on one. So you have these pension funds had to sell huge amounts of assets, including long-term interest rates, interest rate products generally.",https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OFbNeKtIJNY,35,2022-10-19 16:22:57
3650," Then you have a dynamic that you had this leverage on one. You have these pension funds had to sell huge amounts of assets, including long-term interest rates, interest rate products generally. And so what happens is the development market interest rates, markets tend to work together. And so that was putting pressure on the markets here. And then just the general dislocation, you know, London is the second epicenter of finance. And as you're getting this extraordinary volatility there, and it was permeating all the markets generally. So by the way, you know, when the central banks raised rates as much in tight and liquidity, you see the leverage, you know, I would say every day, but periodically you see, wow, I didn't realize that risk was on. I didn't realize this leverage is on. And we're going to keep getting reminders of that for the coming weeks and months. I say, I hope that, you know, the Fed is going to reach a point where they can pause at these elevated rates, whether it's 4.5, 4.5, 3.5, 4.5, you know, once they pause, then you can start to get comfortable. And I'm going to take some more risk in my portfolio. But I'd like to see some better data to allow us to think that. Following up on something that you just mentioned a moment ago, where are you seeing the largest volume of kind of outsized short positions right now? I mean, the overall market, I mean, the size, I was looking at the size of put options trading for a week straight, you're talking about about a trillion dollars worth of, of notional puts. So by the way, I put that number in perspective, the high yield markets, the US high yield markets are trillion to quarter, a trillion a day, put options are trading. Now, they're, that's full notional size. So they're obviously trade on a delta basis lower than that. But that's, that is big. And then I look at exposures across a lot of the, what is faster money, hedge fund type, and that's really low in terms of exposure. And I think money managers have brought down their exposure pretty significantly. So, you know, that is significant. And that's where I think you've got a market that once it jumps, you get some short covering that comes in. Or so people, people worry that they're going to miss it. I guess I, I don't think they're going to miss it. But it's not to say, you know, you go through periods where you have real bear markets, you get these spiked rallies. You mentioned a minute ago, that in periods like this, we start to see where the leverages in the system, where the risk is in the system. Where do you have your eyes on that we might see more signs of that? So, you know, there's something really different than 15, 20 years ago, when you hide the big subprime crisis, and you had leverage in the financial system, corporates, households. You actually don't have that today. Banks are in good shape from a leverage perspective. Corporates are households are in good shape, relatively, or they've been in history. You know, the one place you got to keep your eye on is the real estate market. So, commercial real estate, residential real estate. You know, that's where you have financing. Not just leverage, but you've got to roll over your financing. And so, the way commercial real estate projects work, obviously, Rezzi, is you've got to roll over your financing, and that's where you can get some tricky things. And by the way, you've seen it, you know, we've been buying triple A commercial mortgages, and getting close to six and a half, and you know, there's one piece we bought, cost of seven percent, triple A. You know, so you think about subordinated, done underneath that. So, when that happens, you start to think about, gosh, if I can buy triple A assets, that's sort of yield. Why would I take much risk otherwise? Well, the other difference between now and then, though, is that you have a lot more private credit companies that are not the banks. Are they a source of risk at all in this environment? I would say generally not because they're liabilities. They're usually locked up money. Usually, they've got not money for a longer period of time. So, I don't generally don't think that they are significant risk to unwind. You know, there are structures that take place in the market that are, you know, in and around, you know, some of the COLO markets or otherwise, that you got to keep your eye on. But I would say generally, the private financing, generally, is pretty well termed out in terms of, in terms of where that capital has been raised. So, I don't think that's a stress point today. But like I say, guaranteed, whenever you get this sort of shock to the system, something's going to pop up that you didn't expect. And, you know, similar to what happened in the UK. I mean, who would have thought the UK, you know, have an issue in the pension system? And that's, but that is a lusher of what happens to these situations. Let's say on financial stability, a competitor puts out a survey this morning, lots of charts in there is noting worsening risks to financial stability, now weighing on equities. But you don't see that. This is not great recession stuff we're seeing right now in the markets. It's great recession in terms of the economy slowing or just... I mean, we don't see the same things in housing, I mean, there's not a smell.",https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OFbNeKtIJNY,36,2022-10-19 16:27:39
3651," session stuff we're seeing right now in the markets. It's great recession in terms of the economy slowing or it's... I mean, we don't see the same things in housing. I mean, it's not in the same situation. We just see stock prices going down. Right. I so... Listen, it's been historic in 50 years, probably longer than that. You've never seen rates and risk go down at the same time. And that is... I mean, that is an illustration of the fastest tightening we've ever seen by the Central Banks in history. Because, by the way, not just the US, but the emerging markets, the ECB, the Bank of England. So that is just what happens on the backside of it. And it's just not clear how much the economy is going to slow on the backside of it. What we are seeing that I think is encouraging is you're starting to see the goods part of the economy come down a bit. And that is healthy. You're seeing that inflation. You're seeing that in... In sheer demand for goods. What you're not seeing yet is a service sector. It's a service sector in great shape, education, leisure, health care, solid, both in terms of inflation as well as demand. So you've got an economy that's actually in pretty good shape. I think people underestimate while the economy is going to slow, the good sector is going to slow. You're seeing that embodied in commodity prices, home builders, etc. But the service economy, the US economy is two thirds, consumption is two thirds service. It's hard to bring that down. That's exactly what I wanted to ask you about. Both regard to where we sit right now within this shift because what we've heard so far from the banks that have reported, from the airlines that have reported, we've spoke with Delta CEO and they're talking about this shift in goods to services really benefiting the experience economy as well. Is that something that if you look out into early 2023, even further into midway through 2023, that that remains, that demand remains strong and solid enough as consumers are still looking across their own balance sheets where we've seen that go from as the banks would describe it as strong to now just healthy, if you will. I mean, listen, there is, when you lift fuel costs and food costs as much as they have, it definitely has an effect on consumption generally. But gosh, if you side, will a service sector continue to hold up? You still have got, look at where wage levels are, relative to anything we've ever seen in history. You look at where the amount of savings that's built up, my sense is the service economy will continue to do well. By the way, it's an aging demographic, the demand for health care services is not going anywhere other than up from here. So I still think you've got a solid service economy. People lament where the economy has slowed to, but keep in mind, we had double digit nominal GDP last year. We're slowing from that and you're still going to have nominal GDP this year. That's going to post an impressive number that could be closer to five. So still pretty good. Are we slowing? Is a good sector slowing? Yes. By the way, it's very different in commodity oriented economies. It's very different in parts of China today, although we think next year will be better. Emerging markets are tougher. But, and by the way, we go to Europe and this is what's creating a lot of the fall. In Europe, when you lift fuel costs as much as you have historic, and then, you look at the UK, you look at mortgage rates, spiking higher, consumer 70% of the consumption basket gets now eaten up by just their utility bill and their mortgage. So you think about how difficult that paradigm presents itself. But US relative to the rest of the world is in reasonable shape. All right. Let's leave it there on that hopeful note. Good to see you in person there, BlackRock's Chief Investment Officer of Global Fixed Income Recreator. We'll talk to you soon. Thanks for stopping by.

3652," you you You Great to have you on today. Certainly a big day. You're taking the wraps off of the big EV here. Question to you here. We have seen this market get increasingly crowded, but you are competing in the ultra luxury space. What's the demand for EVs look like there? I mean, so far I can tell you, first of all, good morning. It's great. And this is a historic day here. We are launching, first of all, the very first electric Rosroy's. We are the very first loans rightly so. As you said a minute ago, to be in that ultra luxury segment, the very first offering an electric car. And for that reason, we are very much looking forward to it. And so far, order entry is already really great and very pleasing. And it's not only the United States, but it's all over the world. And I think we are working on electrifying the brand already for quite a while. We are experimenting with it since 10 years. And quiz our clients worldwide on what their requirements would be. So I foresee a very good future also in the ultra high luxury segment. And for us, allow me to say that electric propulsion fits perfect to the brand. It's quiet, silent, very talky, delivers worthability. And also interesting story goes back to what one of our founding fathers said in 1900, Charles Rolts made a prophecy and said the perfect propulsion for cars is electric. Once charging is fixed. And I think now we are here fulfilling his prophecy. Hey, Torres St. Prasya, good to see you again. I had a question about sort of the engineering challenge is making a Rolls Royce into an EV. I know you say that it's a Rolls Royce first in an EV second. What kind of challenge did you guys face having to make this sort of a pieldier audience? Good point, Pras. I think as I said already, we started looking into it over 10 years ago when we launched that experimental phantom, a 1 or 2 ex. And we put quite a lot of clients worldwide behind the wheel. And one finding was, fits perfect to the brand. But charging time and also range needs to be fully sufficient. So for that reason, that took us a while because one thing was also clear, don't compromise the Rolls Royce experience. And all that in combination challenged our engineers, as you can imagine, because it was clear, it needed to be magic carpet ride, it was clear that it needed to carry sufficient range. And we are offering now 520 kilometers, we are in a 20 miles range. And I think that is very sufficient and definitely on what our clients expect in that segment to happen. And for that reason, I think we got here. But the challenge was on our hands and we are not yet completely finished. The car is still in the testing worldwide. And the testing ends end of June next year. And then first deliveries will be...",https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OFbNeKtIJNY,38,2022-10-19 16:35:47
3653," The car is still in the testing worldwide and the testing ends end of June next year. And then first deliveries will be done by end of next year when first clients also in the United States market take delivery of their specter. Hey Torchins, so you guys are like you mentioned the cars and they'd come out end of next year. Have you guys faced any issues with part shortages, components, things like that as you need to kind of kind of put in the place before these cars are delivered? I mean we are working here closely together also with the BMW group in terms of let's say some technical and laundry components. We have invited quite a lot of clients already over here to Goodwood to see specter and they were all highly fascinated by what they have seen. Many of them placed already orders and deposits. So for that reason I think that's good. We also see the car now more often in the markets. We will bring it also to the United States before so that clients can see it real in front of them. So I think we're going to shorten that or we're going to make waiting fun for specter. That's for sure. Torchins, I wonder where you think we are in this transition to EVs and I'm not just talking about the ultra luxury space when you look at where market share is globally. It's just over 10% in terms of where EV stand in the broader auto market. Here in the US it's just at 5%. Are we at a tipping point or is it going to take a little more whether that is higher oil prices or higher gas prices or a little more accessibility in the cars to get to full acceleration in this transition which a lot of governments hope will be 100% EVs? Yeah I mean first of all we are not really in the car business. Sounds funny now. We are in the luxury goods business. Nobody needs us to come from A to B. All our clients have multiple cars in their garage. So I think this is here different. It is that you are seen for the very first time completely emission-free in a luxury rolls Royce and I think that's a statement. Quite a lot of our clients would like to make. For that reason I definitely foresee not only specter being excess in the market but also our forescrolling strategy to say by the end of 2030 the entire brand Rosrose motor car is fully electrified. So all new Rosroises in the next years to come are fully electrified. Hey Torcins, that's clear. Sorry about that. Hey Torcins, last time we spoke at the end of the summer we talked about how there was insatiable demand for luxury cars. You mentioned the specter being at the highest in a luxury EVs. Does that still exist now? Are we still seeing any kind of hesitation as a global market uncertainty sort of builds up here? No not at all. I remember I talked that evening at Pebble Beach obviously. So no not at all. I think we still have a very strong order intake worldwide. I think there is no reluctancy currently to invest and to indulge luxury. I think the entire luxury market not only the car market but also fashion whatever runs pretty well currently worldwide. And I think that is also due to the fact that there was quite some money accumulated in the corona times. And for that reason there is a new kind of understanding you better live now and don't postpone it to later. So people are prepared to still spend money which is great. And I think that puts us here into work. We are employing here at Goodwood over 2000 people and they profit from the fact that the luxury business is allowing me to say booming. Okay. I know process waiting to take a test drive in that car, right? Always looking for a test drive. We got to make that happen. Terce and Mueller on post. It's always good to have you on this show.

3654," you you you you A new report from the Tax Foundation finds that tax competitiveness in the U.S. remains steady among the world's top economies ahead of big changes for 2023. For more on the report is Daniel Bunn. He's executive vice president at the Tax Foundation. Daniel, good to talk to you today. Walk me through for those who aren't as familiar with this report that you put out every year. How you sort of determine what is competitive and where the U.S. ranks right now in relation to its peers. Well, thank you for having me. This report is designed to help policymakers see where their tax system is strong on things like pro-growth measures or policies that avoid distortions and complexities. It measures the tax systems of the 38 OECD countries and the U.S. ranks 22nd on the index this year. As you mentioned, the same place as it held last year. The index puts France at the bottom and Estonia at the top. Estonia has had that place every year that we've published the index and this is its ninth year. And so let's make that comparison between a place like Estonia and the U.S. Where does the U.S. really get hurt and to your point or to the point that we made in this introduction coming to you. How is this likely to shift as a result of the provisions that have been included in the Inflation Reduction Act? So the Inflation Reduction Act introduced a tax on stock buybacks. It introduced an alternative minimum tax based on financial statement and income. And introduced a different way of calculating a lot of different tax credits. And a lot of these things just add complexity to the system. And if things stay as they are in current law, including some provisions that are expiring based on the Tax Cuts and Jobs Act from 2017, the rank will likely be slipping for the U.S. next year unless other OECV countries make them even worse than the U.S. How big of a decline are we talking about? Right now, based on what other countries are looking at, it's a shift in two places. So I would say a shift from 22nd to 24th. We've also been following very closely what's been playing out over in the UK. You could call it the big reversal. Obviously, the tax cut policies that were initially proposed by UK Prime Minister Liz Truss now in full reversal as a result of her former Finance Minister getting cut. You've got Jeremy Hunt now in place as well. I wonder how you look at this in the context of how competitive the UK can be. Number one, the policies that are now being proposed by the new Finance Minister. But also just how quickly things have been reversed. The policy swings that we have seen in a very short amount of time. One of the things that really matters for tax policy is stability. And what we've seen in the UK is the opposite.",https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OFbNeKtIJNY,40,2022-10-19 16:44:21
3655," seen in a very short amount of time. One of the things that really matters for tax policy is stability. And what we've seen in the UK is the opposite of that over the last several years. And what we've seen in the last few weeks is enough U-turns that we're kind of spinning in circles. I think what this means for UK competitiveness, where the UK ranks right now is 26th on the index. And it looks like, unless policies are to improve, and it's not really clear where the government's going to go over the long term here, then that rank will be slipping as well, potentially into the 30s on the index. A lot of the policies that they introduced recently, they might have improved the rank somewhat, but I think the pro-growth measures that the government could have done were left on the table. Tax Foundation Executive Vice President Daniel Baum, good to talk to you today. Thank you. The holidays will be here before we know it. And shoppers are already getting a head start. A new survey out from ICSC found that three quarters are planning to buy gifts far in advance, capitalizing on the trend of early season deals. Here for more on that, we want to bring in Tom McGee. He's the CEO of ICSC. Tom, it's great to see you again. Let's start with this survey because you were tracking how much people are looking to spend when they are planning to spend it. And on what, let's start with that, when parts, 75% are looking to shop early. Does that mean that we're already in the middle of this holiday shopping season? Yeah, it does. Well, first of all, good afternoon. It's good to be with you again. Tom, let's think you might be muted. Oh, we got you. No, we got you. You got me, okay, okay. First of all, good afternoon. And it does mean we're in the middle of the holiday season. The holiday season starts earlier. That trend really began a pre-pandemic, but as accelerated and outpost pandemic in an inflationary environment, with a price conscious consumer looking for deals and being very selective in their shopping habits, it kind of makes sense that people would start shopping earlier. We do expect it to be a solid holiday season. We're cautious, optimistic that despite the uncertainty and concerns around inflation, which are real, that consumers will shop this season where our expectations for 6.7% retail sales growth and almost 10% growth in people going out dining over the holiday season. Wow, almost 10% increase on dining. We talked about that early shopping. Amazon Prime at their October day, Target, and Walmart both had competing events is Black Friday dead. It's an iconic day for sure, but I think that Black Friday's importance in the holiday shopping season isn't what it once was.",https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OFbNeKtIJNY,41,2022-10-19 16:48:46
3656," It's an iconic day for sure, but I think that Black Friday's importance in the holiday shopping season isn't what it once was. You know, with a longer holiday season, you know, Black Friday is one of many important days during the holiday shopping season. And Tom, when it comes to promotional activity, we've heard from a number of CEOs on recent earnings calls, anyone from Target to Nordstrom that they're planning heavy discounts. I guess from your perspective, how does this year's promotional activity compare to what we've seen in the past? You know, I would expect there to be more promotional activity this year than what we saw last year. You know, the environment's different than what we were experiencing last year. There was certainly a lot of enthusiasm and pent up demand as we got back into live shopping and a lot of our holiday traditions. We still have a lot of enthusiasm, but certainly more concerned around pricing. And so I think one way that retailers will differentiate themselves is a focus upon promotions and being selective in how they price things. This is a price conscious consumer right now. They're continuing to spend and we continue to see retail sales growth, but certainly the level of consumer confidence and concern around pricing and inflation is at a very high level. Tom, for years, we've heard about the death of brick and mortar stores and then some surprising numbers. This year retail vacancies 6.1% lowest since 2015. More stores open and closed in 21. First time in 27 years is there a shift away from online shopping or how do you explain this trend? Yeah, retail real estate. You know, if you would have closed your eyes going into the pandemic, a lot of people would have assumed that this was going to be devised at retail real estate and the opposite is really happened. It's been a rebirth and a renaissance four times in many store openings and closings this year. And really it's a combination of factors. Certainly the convergence between online and physical is upon and real. Stores are being utilized in a whole host of ways for traditional shopping, but also for fulfillment. Whether that's shipping from stores or consumers coming and doing click and collect and curbside pickup. And having retailers have really understood the importance of having a physical store to build their brand and their relationship with consumers. Online acquisition costs are significant and online only retail is not very profitable. And certainly a focus and profitability is also helping the physical retail space. So there's a whole confluence of things that have come together. So the store is here to stay and it's prominent in retail is back where it belongs. Tell me, I mean, just so the store is here to say, but I want to ask you about this online trend in the journal today, they were talking about the big bet that brands are making on live stream shopping. When you take a look at the success at least that we've seen in this space in China and compare it to what we've seen here in the US, I guess, do you think we could have a similar type of success here in the US and how critical do you see this being for the future of brands? Well, I think the whole use of media and technology and shopping has continued to evolve and mature over really the last 20 plus years. So I do think there's a role for live streaming and there's a role for a whole host of media and shopping. So I think ultimately it will just enhance and adjust the shopping experience. But I don't think what we've seen over the course of the last 20 years is that really these things come together and consumers find the right balance. I don't think live stream shopping is going to, in some way, diminish online or physical retail. I just think it'll be part of a complement of things that are at a tool chest or retailer will provide. Very interesting retail season ahead, I.C.S.C.E.O. Tom McGee, good to see you, sir. Thank you. Thank you.",https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OFbNeKtIJNY,42,2022-10-19 16:53:11
3657," you you you IDIOT Oil prices retreating today as the Biden administration reportedly plans to release 10 to 15 million barrels of oil from the strategic petroleum reserve. We're joining us now as Dan Dicke, the energy world founder, good to have you back on the show. So as we're seeing here, we see WTI down about 3% today, Brent down about 1.8%. What do you make of where the oil markets are right now and the sort of factors that are weighing the heaviest on them? Well, Richelle, the fundamental picture for oil couldn't be more bullish. And I could stay with you for a long time and tell you all the bullish factors that are in the market, Russia particularly, and their troubles with Ukraine. But in the last three months, the Biden administration, along with the Federal Reserve, has done a lot to dampen the prices of oil and gas lean. The Biden administration by using these SPR releases and the Federal Reserve, obviously, with their rate hikes, which have dampened oil risk assets. And along with bringing the dollar a lot stronger, have basically said to traders, look, the United States wants gas prices to be low through the midterms. And they're going to take major steps to do that. And that has scared most traders out of their loans. We've seen loans in the oil market disappearing since late July. And that continues despite the OPEC cut of 2 million barrels a day. It made for a very, very short-lived rally in the oil market. Very short-lived. And I love the words are right. No Biden is the greatest oil trader that ever lived. Why then was it such a short-lived rally? And why are we seeing prices right back down? Is it the strategic petroleum reserve release? Again, it's been all of these factors that have been going into it. It's entirely my entire career in oil, where I have posited for decades now, that financial inputs into markets like oil can have a more significant effect than even the fundamentals can for at least a short period of time. And this is how powerful these financial tricks are in the oil markets. We've seen oil prices moderate more than 40% from a high of over $120 to under 80 before that OPEC announcement. And at least until these midterms are out of the way, the signals are to traders. Don't get long, get out of the way, and let the United States and the central banks, not just the Federal Reserve, but the European Central Banks, jawbone with financial instruments, these oil prices lower. In the end, it won't make a difference because there's a huge supply problem and oil prices will rebound to the upside and very strongly. But for a long time, you can make these inputs into the oil market and keep gas prices long.",https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OFbNeKtIJNY,43,2022-10-19 16:57:26
3658," very strongly, but for a long time you can make these inputs into the oil market and keep gas prices low. And we've seen they've been very, very successful. So how long do you expect OPEC and OPEC plus to really stay the cause? A lot of people were surprised about the production cuts. Obviously, we're seeing what's happening with Ukraine and Russia. A lot of people are saying, look, it seems as if OPEC and OPEC plus taking Russia's side, those sort of geopolitical dynamics. What does that mean for the longer outlook for oil prices? Yeah, and I think that this is, you know, you can see the frustration on the part of OPEC and the oil producers in the mid-east who rely on oil revenues for everything. And they see a fundamental picture that should allow them to get $110, $120, $130 a barrel but are getting only $80 a barrel. And that is frustrating and they know why it's happening and they're trying to fight back to gain control of their market space. But for right now, the Federal Reserve and Joe Biden do have control of this oil market, which is why I kind of made a joke about Joe Biden being the greatest oil trader I've ever seen. He released oil about 250 million barrels and basically sold it into the marketplace at $110, $115. And now he's looking to buy it back for $80. Now that's a heck of a trade on 250 million barrels. That's about $10 billion in profit, he's going to make the United States. That's a pretty good trade. He's become a pretty good oil trader. There was a relevant joke. So the midterms are less than three weeks away. Are we going to see $100 barrel by the end of the year? I don't know if it's by the end of the year, of course, because the recession talk is so massive and therefore it does, you know, put a damper on risk assets. But we will see sometime in 23 of my prediction, new highs above $120 a barrel. The fundamental picture on oil is as bullish as I've seen in the 40 years I've been following it. And in the end, fundamentals will out. We will see those prices rise. Now a lot of people are wondering, does this necessarily mean we're going to see some more relief at the pump ahead of the midterms? You know that that's one of the main reasons we're seeing this release from the SPF? Do you think that's going to be the case? Yeah, you're going to see prices. I mean, we've seen them basically moderate. A lot of people were screaming with their pants on fire when OPEC made that announcement for a 2 million barrel drop that gas prices would immediately shoot back to $5. But you know, we kind of knew that it was going to stay. It was an unsustainable rally. And so you know, you know, you're seeing what, 365, 70, a gallon, I don't think you're going to see $4 in any in any shape or form before the midterms. And if it does get close to that, a Biden will make another release of the SPR and chase more traders out of the market and drop prices because that is the prime directive right now for the Democrats to make sure that gas prices aren't what mess up for them possible success in the midterm elections. Sure. Huge ramifications for the Democratic Party. Do you expect OPEC plus to have a counter move? That was the account of move, the 2 million barrels. And in fact, now that they've made that counter move, they will wait until after the midterms and see if the markets will start to respond to fundamentals. And if they don't respond to fundamentals, that won't be the last cut that they announce and they will continue to cut prices until they feel they're going to get, you know, the fundamental price that they think they deserve, which is triple digits and above. That was my question. So post midterms, you could see a further cut from OPEC, yes? They will cut, they will continue to cut until they see what they believe to be a fair fundamental price for oil, which is what they're not getting right now. Wow, so this battle, not over yet. Dan Dicker, the energy we're good to see, man. Good information. Thank you. In this episode of influencers, New York, Congresswoman Alexandria Ocasio-Cortez. Capitalism at its core, what we're talking about when we talk about that is the absolute pursuit of profit at all human, environmental, and social cost. A lot of these pricing increases are potentially due to just straight price gouging by my corporation.",https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OFbNeKtIJNY,44,2022-10-19 17:02:08
3659," Just straight price-gouging fire corporation. If we just allow a full just continuation of student loan payments, we are talking about a catastrophic development for millions. Hello everyone and welcome to Influencers, I'm Andy Sirward and welcome to our guest representative Alexandria Ocasio-Cortez. Representative, nice to see you. Thank you, thank you so much. I know you want to talk about student debt and some other issues as well, but before we get to that, I want to ask you about inflation and interest rates and Fed Chair Powell, who recently said that the strong labor market made it appropriate for him to soon raise interest rates. I wonder what your take on that is. Well, you know, I think particularly when we have this conversation in the context of inflation as well, it's really not just labor, it's not just rising wages, but there's a lot of different dynamics that I think are contributing to the increase in prices, whether it's supply chain complications, yes, labor issues, but sometimes lack of labor, lack of the ability to be able to work consistently in their jobs, which is also tied to pandemic controls, and also there's a real distinction to be made between inflation and price gouging, and there's a lot of evidence that particularly industries with high concentrations, corporate concentrations, whether it's almost oligopoly level industries, a lot of these price increases are potentially due to just straight price gouging by corporations. Are you concerned about inflation and higher interest rates and the impact on working people? I mean, wherever prices are increasing and it's making it difficult for someone to be able to feed their family, that is always going to be a major point of concern, a primary point of concern. But the real key is making sure that we're diagnosing the causes correctly, because the danger here is that if we say we're helping working people too much and say that the cause of this is, oh, it's because we provided too much assistance during the American Rescue Plan, stimulus checks were too generous, that is why we are dealing with the problems that we're dealing with now. What that's going to result in is a pullback in the assistance that some families need the most right now. And when we already talk about the cessation of the Child Tax Credit with the failure to pass the Billback Better Act before the end of last year, we really need to be very careful about diagnosing these issues correctly, because on the flip side of that coin, if we say there are real antitrust issues here, there's a lot of corporate abuse of power, leading to price gouging, then that allows us to pursue lanes such as antitrust, and also pursue labor protections, COVID protections that can help people get back into the workplace and stay safe in the workplace. Right, so you are seeing those who are suggesting that it's because of the assistance that people had during COVID that that's inflationary and therefore we need to swing the pendulum back. Yeah, and I couldn't disagree more. I couldn't disagree more with that assessment. Student loan debt, and I know you've called repeatedly for President Biden for give student loan debt. Why hasn't that happened? And what do you think will happen if the pause that exists presently is allowed to lapse? Well, I cannot understate the danger and the risk economically, politically, and just where we are right now is a country of allowing the moratorium on student loan payments to lapse in May. If we just allow a full just continuation of student loan payments, we are talking about a catastrophic development for millions, the over almost 50 million student loan borrowers in this country. There were millions of student loan borrowers that were already defaulting, going into the pandemic.",https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OFbNeKtIJNY,45,2022-10-19 17:06:08
3660," over almost 50 million student loan borrowers in this country. There were millions of student loan borrowers that were already defaulting going into the pandemic. But more than that, we are at such a delicate point in the financial and just general economic recovery post-COVID that to then restart payments that are essentially the size of a mortgage payment, sometimes even larger on a generation that was already so devastated, not just by this, but the recession, etc. I believe it could throw out of balance already what is a very fragile recovery. Not only that, but this forgiveness is the just thing to do, it's the right thing to do. Why the president hasn't done it yet, I'm not sure, but I do think that this is an issue of increasing urgency. He has already indicated an openness to it, and he has actually already used his authority to forgive student loan debt in certain small, very narrow cases. Because there are people who suggest he doesn't have the authority, is that a legitimate argument or just maybe a smoke screen? I don't think it's a legitimate argument. We've seen, in fact, we've seen him use the same legal authority that the president is used to suspend student loan payments, is the same authority that he would use to cancel them. Not only that, but he has used that authority. He has indicated a willingness to use the authority, and I think that it would be extraordinarily important and urgent for him to do so. What about the argument that it's a moral hazard, in other words, you're letting people off the hook by forgiving the debt? Well, what I think is the true moral hazard here is the surging costs of education in the United States. What is actually created the moral hazard is this guarantee of saying we will issue minors, hundreds of thousands of dollars in student loan debt at almost any level with almost no limit, and we will allow colleges and universities to dramatically increase the costs of their tuition with the guarantee of that loan value on 17-year-olds. What is the actual true moral hazard here in the situation? Is the controls on the cost of education in the United States? One very important control in this, to that note, is tuition-free public colleges and universities, because then what that does is that it introduces competition into the market to which private universities have to actually meet a lower baseline. But people act as though it's just fancy public schools that are extremely expensive now, but public college tuition has also increased dramatically far beyond the pace of inflation.",https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OFbNeKtIJNY,46,2022-10-19 17:10:23
3661, you you you you have a huge social media following obviously in a big platform have you been either surprised by how much or how little influence that affords you in Congress in other words how does that translate representative you know that's an interesting question I think it's the way that I've thought about it I go first going into office and then continuing is that there are a lot of in Washington there are a lot of different sources of power there are some members who have extraordinary connections to different powers players different power centers that are very well connected and networked there are other individuals who are very frankly financially connected industry lobbyists corporations throw their weight and donate and give their influence their lobbyists etc throw an enormous amount of their support behind other members of Congress so every single member kind of has their their you know their assets that they lean on and for me I decided early on because I don't accept money from corporations I do not take meetings with lobbyists I am not well connected I don't come from a well connected family or or community or anything like that that my ability to navigate and advocate is going to have to be squarely rooted in relying on everyday people and their support and my ability to communicate with them what is going on in Washington. It's an interesting perspective you self-identify as a democratic socialist and have called capitalism irredeemable I believe but what does that really mean and does that mean capitalism should be eliminated and are your views compatible with capitalism. Well you know I I believe that in a broad sense because when we toss out these big words capitalism socialism they get you know sensationalized and people translate them into meaning things that perhaps they don't mean so to me capitalism at its core what weren't what we're talking about when we talk about that is the absolute pursuit of profit at all human environmental and social cost that is what we're really discussing and what we're also discussing is the ability for a very small group of actual capitalists and that is people who have so much money that their money makes money and they don't have to work and they can control industry they can control our energy sources they can control our labor they can control massive markets that they dictate and can capture governments and they can,https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OFbNeKtIJNY,47,2022-10-19 17:14:29
3662," She sources they can control our labor, they can control massive markets, that they dictate and can capture governments and they can essentially have power over the many. And to me, that is not a redeemable system for us to be able to participate in, for the prosperity and peace, for the vast majority of people. So people talk about stakeholder capitalism, like Larry Fink at BlackRock, where the waiting for different constituents besides shareholders is more equal. Is that something you'd be amenable to? Well, I think at the end of the day, it's who, it is about who has control over the very core assets of production in society. If it ultimately comes down to a billionaire or the Koch brothers or the Koch family, having control over the vast majority or large plurality of our oil assets in the United States, if it's a handful of very wealthy families having control over, you know, private families having control over means of production, that is essential to the capitalist system that we live in. It is a small group that is of privatized control over what we eat and how we fuel our society. Now where we can transition to, and there are certain ideas where we're talking about, for example, Elizabeth Warren has discussed workers being elected to the board, governing boards of companies, and also, you know, we're here in the Bronx. I represent a community that has the largest concentration of worker cooperatives in, you know, one of the largest concentrations in the world. Now these are alternative ways of doing business. You know, free markets are not the same thing as capitalism. And you can have markets where businesses and ways of producing, trading, selling goods are really controlled and not just controlled, but given more power to workers, people get a fair shake, union jobs, unionized workplaces. All of these are different steps and levels that we're talking about in a more just economy. Congress people trading stocks. You have come out calling for a ban here. And I wonder, and there seems to be some momentum, but I wonder why this seems to be such a difficult thing to pass. And is Speaker Pelosi a roadblock here? Well, you know, I, it's not, it's not really a mystery to me. Why it's difficult to pass. In an enormous amount, I wouldn't be surprised if it was a majority of members of Congress hold and trade individuals stock. I don't know the actual numbers, but it is a very large degree. And you know, the key here is that it's not to say that you can't have a retirement fund or a college savings account or a blind trust. A blind trust, a mutual fund and index fund. These are vehicles of investments that are broad. That individual members of Congress don't have direct control over. But even last year, there was at least 75 members of Congress that held individual stock in Johnson and Johnson, Viderna and Pfizer. And we're talking about in the last one to two years. And so that is where we should be drawing the line. I am a member of Congress. Members of Congress have access to very sensitive security clearances. We have access to very detailed tailored briefs. We are job is to try to anticipate and legislate for what we see as coming. And we should not have the ability to both have access to that information and be able to hold and trade individual stock. And that's really what this is about. It's about our ability to direct and hold trades in individual stock with access to the sensitive information that the public has given us. Voting rights reform. Is that a dead issue? It's tied to the filibuster? Joe Manchin, Kirsten Sinema, come out against it. What does your take on where that stands? You know, this is, I think, one of the top level questions and issues that we have before us in Congress. I very much believe that.",https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OFbNeKtIJNY,48,2022-10-19 17:19:12
3663," I think one of the top level questions and issues that we have before us in Congress, I very much believe that we are at the precipice of a return to Jim Crow style laws across the country. We are already seeing these wheels of motion, attempts in Texas and Georgia across many different states, attempts at voter suppression. And frankly, what Senators mentioned in cinema failed to recognize and what is disappointing and sad to see is how a historic their stances have been throughout this debate.",https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OFbNeKtIJNY,49,2022-10-19 17:23:20
3664," What is your ultimate objective when it comes to those big tech companies representative? Well when you look at a company like Facebook, you can't kind of put them all in the same boat. They do different things. But when you look at a company like Facebook and the completely corrosive ways that they have exercised in abuse, I believe, in civil society writ large. Not just our democracies, but you look at, for example, what we're hearing from other countries. When we talk about production of vaccines or perhaps like what we can do to export help them, they say it's not just, there are some things that the United States provide that are welcome. There's also things that we want the United States to stop exporting. And one of those things is disinformation. And disinformation through US founded companies like Facebook that have absolutely slowed and frankly sabotaged the global effort to fight against the coronavirus. And we see this both this disinformation used both in public health sphere. We've also seen social scientists have truly shown the impact that Facebook has had in contributing to social violence and perhaps even accelerating at large scale, very dangerous and some would call genocidal activities in places like South Asia, etc. human rights abuses and also hate here at home. But I'm curious what you think we should do about them or what we should do to them, I guess. Facebook should be broken up. We should pursue antitrust activity on Facebook and there are so many different reasons why. They are acting as an advertiser. They're acting as both platform and vendor. They are a communications platform which has historically been a well established domain of antitrust. And so because they are so many businesses and industries in one, the cases I believe right there in and of itself as to why they should be subject to antitrust activity. I want to ask a couple of personal questions about you. I'm teaching a Columbia this semester and one of my students Penny Ramirez Fernandez wanted me to ask you how did being a waitress help you understand the American economy is successes and failures? Well I mean I believe that my time as a waitress is the most politically formative experience that I had. It's that along with just growing up in a working class family experiencing just the ravages of the great recession, almost losing our home, all of that. But particularly the years that I spent working in restaurants. The thing about restaurants is that it is it really is such a crucible of so many different public policies. I worked alongside undocumented workers. I didn't have health insurance. I tried to buy Obamacare, you know the ACA Affordable Care Act. I actually used and relied on the policies that were coming out of Washington. And I worked, you know I was a Senate intern back in college. I got an economics degree. I worked in in in public policy spaces. I also had worked for nonprofits. There is a ocean of a difference between the white papers and the policy you see on paper and how it's experienced by everyday people. And unless you actually go on to the exchange and try to buy health care for yourself and use that health care.",https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OFbNeKtIJNY,50,2022-10-19 17:27:40
3665," by everyday people. And unless you actually go on to the exchange and try to buy health care for yourself and use that healthcare and understand how it's serving you and how it's not serving you, it's very difficult to understand why so many people are frustrated by otherwise well-meaning, sometimes democratic policy. As a former dishwasher, I can relate. So I want to ask you maybe a kind of funny question about the moniker AOC. So is that when your friends and family call you or how did that, when did that sort of evolve? When did you become AOC? I actually think it's funny enough. AOC really emerged after I won my primary. And I think there were a lot of pundits on television that were kind of like stumbling because my name is Alexandria Ocasio-Cortez. It was the news story after I won my primary. It was so sudden. And there were just all these folks on TV that I think were kind of like struggling to say my name that it actually started coming from TV. And so in the past, there were some folks that would sometimes say like jokingly, but it was never a nickname that stuck. But I think it actually kind of came from media pretty overnight. But my friends don't call me that. The folks that I organize with. Do they call you Alexandria? They'll call me Alexandria or they'll call me Alex. My friends will call me Alex. But yeah, it's a, you know, it's shorthand, but I now embrace it, welcome it, except it. And final question, maybe it's too early in your career to ask this, but I'm gonna ask anyway. How do you see your legacy going forward? You know, I always feel like I actually think that it is important for young people to ask themselves questions of legacy very early. And I think the reason that that's important is because we shouldn't root our legacy in a position or a job or a role, but we should really root it in a mission of what we want to do qualitatively and how we want to be remembered. And I don't think it's ever too early to consider that because it helps us make decisions, it helps us root us in our values and our morals. And I just hope that for me, you know, what I do and what my community understands and receives and feels for me as their representative is someone that always puts the people of this country first that doesn't allow herself to be dissuaded or distracted by power, influence, et cetera, and that we are dissuaded and relentless and honest and authentic in our pursuit for a better world and that, you know, that in that pursuit, we just tell it as it is and try to do everything we can in every moment that we can. And I think that's pretty much it. That's it. Representative Alexandria Ocasio Cortez. Thank you so much for your time. Of course, thank you so much. You've been watching influencers. I'm Andy Cerwer. We'll see you next time. We're going to talk about the other sections. Now, that is not saying no reductions, but they're going to have to make some fine-tuning given the declines, them and all of Wall Street has seen in deal activity this year. It's really hard to pick out a common theme. Because a lot of what you said sounded pretty positive. Then you get the likes of Jamie Diamond, you know, raising a lot of red flags about the economic growth and economists who we talk to who were also cautious about the economy. So it's difficult to sort of synthesize all of this into a coherent narrative. perfectly summarizes everything you just brought up. It is a weird time to be an investor. In many respects, we see economic growth slowed out. We're seeing consumer price inflation still at a 40-year high. But again, you have a proctor and gamble coming out here, beating on earnings, Goldman Sachs, beating on earnings, Bank of America beating on earnings. It's strange. We need like a wolf sound with that full screen. Oh, yeah. Something aggressive. Or you and the Michael Jackson thriller.",https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OFbNeKtIJNY,51,2022-10-19 17:32:48
3666," It's strange. We need like a wolf sound with that, with that full screen. Ooh, yeah. Something aggressive. You're, or you and, you know, the Michael Jackson thriller. Oh, sure. Yeah. It's red. All right, guys, coming up on the other side of this short break, why are next guests expects an upcoming recession that hits the economy much harder than anticipated? It's coming up. Chicken. oh, shit. [(loud exploding)] Welcome back to Yow Finance. I'm Brian Sasey alongside Julie Heiming and Brad Smith. Markets, well we're seeing some a little bit of red action on the screen despite a better than expected earnings you for from PNG. CEO John Mueller told me the consumer staying resilient in the face of high inflation, but nonetheless right now we're seeing the markets in the red. Now here's what's on tap for you this hour. Here comes Tesla's earnings. Our senior auto correspondent, Presseuber Manian, teased up Tesla's earnings for you as they are out after the close. The demand for faucets, Fortune Brand, CEO Nicholas Fink, stops by for an in-depth look into the building products maker amid the housing market slowdown. In no recession, that's a take from Bank of America, CEO Brian Moynihan, and might chat with him just a moment ago. We'll have that interview coming up. Brad, over to you. All right, taking a look at the major averages here is we've struck the top of the 10 AM hour, 30 minutes into trade. And I want to give you a three-day look at what's kind of taken place here over the course of this week, even despite today's little blip-a-dip blip, we are seeing us hold on to a three-day gain of about 2.8% here for the Dow Jones industrial average. The NASDAQ composite, you're seeing that hold on to gains of about 3.7% over that three-day period. But here today, right now, down by about 6.35% minutes into trade. Also the S&P 500, you're seeing that lower on the day. That's down by about half a percent. We ran through some of the sectors earlier, but I'd love to.",https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OFbNeKtIJNY,52,2022-10-19 17:37:11
3667," down by about six cents of percent, 35 minutes into trade. Also the S&P 500, you're seeing that lower on the day. That's down by about half a percent. We ran through some of the sectors earlier, but I'd love to shift your attention over to retail, as we're keeping an eye on some of those names, especially within that consumer discretionary construct or discussion here, and especially going into a holiday season where we're still going to be looking through Amazon, Walmart, and some of these sales that are set to commence that have already actually kicked off, Walmart actually announcing this morning that they are not going to be open on Thanksgiving. That continues what we had seen over some recent years as well in 2020 and 2021. So keep a close eye on these retail names, Amazon, down by about 1.7% Walmart, down by about two, tens of a percent, target also lower on the day by about six, tens of a percent. So that's a retail roundup, if you will, for right now, this is the top of the 10 a.m. hour. Julie? Oh, no, actually no, we've got a guest that's coming in. Although it may feel like we're already in one, many economists still don't think the US meets the formal definition of a recession based on broader measures such as income, spending, and job growth. The street is currently expecting a recession sometime in the first quarter of 2023, but our next guest says it will take a bit more time joining us now. We've got Jeffrey Senior Economist, Thomas Simon's, Thomas, great to have you here with us today. Help us really run through what your expectations are and why and when, why in terms of the catalysts and then when in terms of timing you're expecting a recession to hit. Sure. So I think the main difference between our call and many of our competitors is just a sense that the economy is really approaching this period of time from a position of much greater strength than it typically does as it rolls into a recession. So you pointed out just as the chart before you had a couple of quarters of negative GDP growth, but Q3 is really shaping up to be quite a bit stronger. And Q4, I don't have any expectations and we're going to end up with a negative number again. It's really into the second half of next year that we're going to start to see the cumulative effects of all the hikes start to really hit and plus the strength of the dollar as well. I don't think that we've really seen much evidence that that's actually taken a big bite out of economic activity just yet because the economy is just generally less interest rate sensitive than it normally is at this point in the business cycle. Lots of consumers and businesses already have a lot of locked in cheap borrowing that doesn't need to be refinanced anytime soon. You look at things like mortgage rates and these sorts of things that are spiking. But consumers don't have a lot of adjustable rate loans. So the same sort of dynamic is at play with businesses. With balance sheets are very, very strong. We haven't seen much margin compression just yet either. These sorts of things we expect are going to start to really take hold into the second half of 2023, especially as effect continues to raise interest rates here. Thomas, man, we have been on the drumbeat for this recession for what feel is like so long now. And now it sounds like according to you, we're going to be on it for quite a while longer before we actually get there. You in your latest note have this sort of scenario that you're painting of entering it later. And then I believe in the first quarter of 2024 seeing the worst of it with a drop of 2.3% in growth here or in GDP, I should say, what is that going to feel like? How does that comport with what we are hearing generally painting a picture of a relatively mild recession? I mean, 2.3% is that a relatively mild recession? Now what it all happens in one quarter, it's not going to feel particularly great. One thing to keep in mind is that it's not going to feel like 2020 and it's not going to feel like 2009 either. Even though 2.4% are thereabouts for a quarterly decline is something that we are not used to. And it seems like a lot in the context of some pretty positive growth rates we've seen recently. It's not totally out of the question relative to how the economy used to behave before the financial crisis. So I mean, I think it's interesting just in the past segment that we had before, we're talking about all these comments from CEOs about how the inventory cycle isn't as bad as they thought, like the margins are still good, pricing power is still pretty well retained. These sorts of things are what's going to push us a little bit further and is what again, is going to have to make the fed raise rates even a little bit higher.",https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OFbNeKtIJNY,53,2022-10-19 17:41:08
3668," are still good, pricing power is still pretty well retained. These sorts of things are what's going to push us a little bit further. And is what again, is going to have to make the Fed raise rates even a little bit higher and is going to cause us to fall farther and faster and slow down faster when we get into the second half of 2023 and into 2024, like you mentioned as well. So Thomas, you know, against this backdrop of a recession next year at some point of some magnitude, what happens to inflation? So inflation, we expect is going to gradually slow through this year, you know, the remainder of this year and into next year. We probably have peaked, I want to say, although I feel like we've been saying that inflation has peaked since March of this year, something like that. And then we continue to see this really sticky pressure in a lot of the core measures, you know, specifically housing seems to be pushing us recently. I do think that as we get into the second half of, or into the first half of next year, excuse me, we will see a gradual decline and then more of an acceleration of that decline as we get into the second half of next year as unemployment rises. It's really that's the key is that the Fed needs to raise rates to lower demand, which is going to lower employment, raise the unemployment rate and get us to lower inflation eventually into next year. The question is how much does unemployment have to really rise, right? That's certainly an open point of debate at the Fed right now. We think that the unemployment rate probably has to get above 5% before we're going to get meaningful significant deceleration towards target for inflation, because, you know, with inflation so high as it is now, it can decelerate a lot and still be uncomfortably above target for the Fed. 5% out. All right. That's Jeffrey senior economist Thomas Simon. Thank you so much. Really appreciate perspective here. And even big tech can't shake off the economic slowdown that we have been again looking ahead to for a long time. You know, who finance this tech editor Dan Halley is joining us now. And obviously we've been paying a lot of attention to tech and sort of a retrenchment in tech. But you've got a sort of big picture look at what we're seeing. Yeah. So, you know, we're talking about the different variables that are going into kind of the tech industry right now and what we're seeing. And so, you know, we usually look at tech obviously is kind of not necessarily not even close to, you know, recession proof, but we have these stalwarts that you think can weather these storms pretty well. But we're starting to see cracks in this kind of facade. So, Microsoft obviously announcing layoffs yesterday not saying how many exactly we had, but about 1,000 is what the going number is. That follows their prior move to layoff about 1% of their workforce in July. So, Microsoft despite being this huge cloud company that does incredibly well in that area, they had, you know, double-digit growth in cloud in the prior quarter, they're still having to contend with these kinds of issues. We have Meta and Intel, two of the worst performers right now, Meta stockdowns, 60% year-to-date, Intel down 49% year-to-date. We also have Meta pushing people out the door, not necessarily laying people off, but saying, hey, maybe you're not right for this position in so many words. We had Google, they weren't necessarily laying people off, but they closed their area 120 division, which does some research for different products. And so, they shuttered those products and they had these people reapply for jobs. And then, when you look at the consumer side of things, we have Apple yesterday, basically not announcing, but the reports coming out that they're cutting production of their iPhone 14 plus. And that was prior to that, we had heard that they were reducing some of the production for their iPhone 14 in general to about what the iPhone 13 levels were. So, you know, this whole idea of, you know, big tech being this huge force, obviously, the idea that them being immune to any kind of market factors is really, I mean, that's not true at all, but we are starting to see kind of the pain really set in for these companies. And, you know, I talked to some people, they're saying that essentially, this isn't going to get better until perhaps some point in 2023, at least for the tech industry, could go into 2024, though. There's effects concerns that they've cited as well. Many of these tech businesses, if not all of them, are certainly impacted by that.",https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OFbNeKtIJNY,54,2022-10-19 17:45:22
3669," could go into 2024 though. There's effects concerns that they've cited as well. Many of these tech businesses, if not all of them, are certainly impacted by that. But then you mentioned the consumer side, and if we can go deeper into that, what does that really spell out for this holiday season for some of the consumer technology that they're expecting to move through into households and into consumers' hands? You know, it's interesting because, as obviously these, a lot of products haven't, companies haven't raised prices on consumer products just yet, right? At least here in the US, overseas, we've seen Apple raised prices, we saw Sony raised prices on their PlayStation 5. Obviously a big holiday gift, you know, both of those. If you can find it. If you can find it. Now it's a little bit easier because not everybody's looking for them again. But, you know, I do think that we're seeing this issue with, you know, not just the slowdown in the PC market, which we've been talking about, that obviously impacts likes of Microsoft, then Intel, AMD, Nvidia. It's all these kind of knock on effects. The memory chip makers. But we're starting to perhaps see it on the smartphone inside of things. And that, you know, that would then start to hit the likes of Apple, the likes of Samsung companies in those areas. So I do think that we're going to see fewer people spending on these big ticket items. Yeah, video games, I think you're still going to do pretty well. We have a couple that are coming out, that are big names. But, you know, I don't know if it's going to necessarily be this huge blowup that we saw during the pandemic where gaming was so big, but, you know, that should still continue to do well. But, you know, the PCs, the tablets, I don't necessarily know if people are going to be getting those just because they already bought them. And so you're going to a season where people are trying to save maybe. I don't know if those are going to do particularly well. There's only so much space you have in your place to store the next computer, Dan Hall of Amen. I know, right, Dan Hall of Amen. Great analysis, appreciate it. Okay, before we had to break, let's highlight a bullish trade on Amazon, speaking of tech into its earnings report in October 27th. Well, Sandler at Barclays says he is constructive on Amazon's stock on add to positions into the earnings release, says Sandler. Proficiary data shows a couple point B on North America retail revenue, and we think international is holding up relatively well through the third quarter. Coming up, Mackenzie Scott is making a big donation to the Girl Scouts of America. Julie will break down today's top headlines next. Yeah'....",https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OFbNeKtIJNY,55,2022-10-19 17:50:06
3670," Ganif에요 Let's get down to business now. Look at some of the other headlines that we are watching. One of them involves French cement maker Lafars. It's going to pay $778 million in penalties for conspiring to support the Islamic State and an al-Qaeda affiliate. In 2013 and 2014, the company made regular payments to the Islamic State to protect its cement plant in Syria from attack. That agreement evolved into a de facto revenue sharing scheme in which Lafars actively concealed payments by forging invoices. Although Lafars' Syrian subsidiary involved in the scheme is now defunct, the company's guilty plea marks the first time a company has been charged with providing material, support, and resources to a terrorist organization. Chimaker TSMC could expand its production capacity in Japan, this according to the Walls Free Journal. That move helps Taiwan's semiconductor hedge its chip production against potential conflicts over Taiwan. All as an increasingly belligerent China continues to claim the self-governed island as part of its territory. A new Japanese plant would be in addition to one already established in Kyushu and would focus on chips used in automobiles and sensors. And Billion Armequenzi Scott is donating $84.5 million to the Girl Scouts. It's the largest donation by a single person to that youth program. Scott, who deforets Amazon founder Jeff Bezos in 2019, had earlier pledged to give away about half of her fortune to charity. The Girl Scout says the funds will be used to expand STEM and career training in its programs. What's the cost? All right, Tesla earnings are out after the close today. Yeah, finance senior auto-correspondent press, supermaning, has a preview. So, prize, I'm guessing Tesla is going to beat by 10 cents. Stocks going higher, right? I mean, with the bulls, I'm going to be a lot faster. Yeah, you know, I think it's going to be all about the delivering, I'm sorry, the demand and production sort of outlook and story there. Big headline numbers here, we're looking at about 22.13 billion. We'll be its highest ever record, highest ever, quarterly record on adjusted EPS of $1.02 cents, gap net income of $3.2 billion, that would be near and all the time. I saw a big quarter for them in the books, but we're all watching that. Can they hit that 1.4 million 2022 annual production delivery outlook? You have to make 500,000 vehicles in Q4, which is possible, but the question is, is there demand? There's concern about demand slowing in China and things like that. But other things we're going to watch, for me personally, I'm going to kind of watch about these Tesla semi kind of outlook. Are they going to be able to hit that delivery, December 1st delivery kind of with Pepsi and what's coming up for that in 2023? And then also what's happening to Cybertruck? Is that still on track for mid next year? Okay, and so it's all about where we're also going to hear capacity being brought online at some of the new factories, whether that's Austin or Berlin. What do we expect there and how many vehicles are they going to continue to produce at these factories? So, you know, that's quarterly. So that free amount was about 450,000 vehicles a year. Shanghai, they say 850,000 vehicles a year, install capacity. So that's already 1.3. The rest, Austin, Giga, Berlin. You get a couple hundred thousand from each of those. They're still ramping up. So maybe you're at 1.5, 1.7 give or take. I think that's what the street is looking for, but they're going to have to hit about 2 million in 2023 to hit that 50 percent of compound annual growth rate. So there's a lot a long way to go, but in the question also, he's like, you know, how can they keep raising prices for their cars and then also in this kind of slowing global macro environment? Are those, you know, sales going to come down potentially? Did we talk about mask being on the call yet? Did we talk about that? We didn't talk about that. He's going to be on the call. Yeah, he's going to be on the call, which he hasn't been on the call recently. And you have to wonder like the whole Twitter thing is still going on, but he hasn't really gotten a lot of money.",https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OFbNeKtIJNY,56,2022-10-19 17:54:02
3671," Did we talk about that? We didn't talk about that. He's going to be on the call. Yeah, he's going to be on the call, which he hasn't been on the call's recent. And you have to wonder, like, the whole Twitter thing is still going on, but he hasn't really gotten a lot of questions directly about that. So you wonder, are Tesla analysts going to ask about that? I don't know. I'm scared. They're going to have to ask about the call. That's what I was going to say. They posted a couple of the institutional questions that they did on their like, they pulled a survey monkey kind of thing, and also their top retail investor question. I didn't see any on the, what is Musk going to do with Twitter, et cetera, on there. Probably asked about stock sales, but I didn't see anything about his role in Twitter as of yet. I don't know. We got that. Yeah. I found that confusing. We'll see how much of this time goes there. Frost, thanks so much for there. You're going to be tracking this after the close, very closely. Everyone coming up, President Biden has unfailed his plan to combat oil production cuts by OPEC Plus. We're going to share the details next. President Biden has unveiled his plan to release 15 million barrels of oil from the U.S. strategic reserve in response to OPEC Plus production cuts. Yahoo, finances, Rick Newman joins us now with the details. Hey, Rick. Hey. So Biden is now going to release more oil from the U.S. strategic reserve and other 15 million barrels. This is a continuation of a program that's been going on since May, and that was originally supposed to end in October, and it has now been extended into November and then into December. And I wonder why that might be. Oh, it could only be the midterm elections, but obviously once it looks like he's doing something continually to get gasoline priced down. There's another important element of this though that's new, it's getting less attention, but it might be more important by the energy department is going to do something new, and they're going to enter into contracts to buy.",https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OFbNeKtIJNY,57,2022-10-19 17:58:16
3672," attention, but it might be more important by the energy department is going to do something new and they're going to enter into contracts to buy oil from the private sector from the market at prices of around $70 and the reason that's important is that it is telling oil producers that there's going to be demand for oil even when the price falls below current levels. So the government is kind of establishing itself as a customer of last resort if you will and the thinking behind this is oil producers will say oh well if oil prices fall we will still be able to sell it to the government at prices where we can make a profit and so that's a little bit of extra demand that producers know will be there in the future and that might get them to produce more oil. We will find out this goes all the way into 23, 24 and probably even into 2025. So it's meant to have a long-term effect on oil supplies. But that also continues the sort of thorny questions of climate change and the sort of push pull that the Biden administration has done with the oil industry right if they're you know saying on the one hand everybody should be transitioning to renewables on the other hand we're going to be buying oil from you for a few years for $70 but I guess that also helps ease the transition for the oil companies. You're right Julie but I think one of the things that we we should have clearly learned in 2022 is we need a better a better bridging strategy from fossil fuels to renewables because we don't have nearly enough renewables to replace fossil fuels right now and because markets energy markets are priced at the margins you could have just a small shortfall of oil or natural gas or whatever it might be and prices can double or go up by more than double. So you know Obama during the Obama administration he had a phrase you know what's our approach to energy all of the above and I think Democrats got away from that and they pushed a little bit too hard on renewables without figuring out how to meet you know the demand for the fuel that we need today and I don't think Biden's going to come out and say this but I think what we're seeing from the Biden administration is kind of an all of the above energy strategy which is acknowledge that we need these fossil fuels today and we need to we need to assure these supplies for the next several years while at the same time pushing for renewables. Good analysis Y'all fine says senior column is Rick Newman good to see you. Hi guys coming up we'll share my interview with Bank of America seal Brian Lonehan on the back of there better than expected earnings report earlier this week that's next.",https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OFbNeKtIJNY,58,2022-10-19 18:02:26
3673," You You Welcome back Bank of America, CEO Brian Moynihan tells me spending remains strong among consumers and that a recession may not be imminent take a listen Nice to be with you again and my teammates produced a great quarter again, and I thank him for that But I think if you're talking about what we saw our customers in turn are the consumers spending for the third quarter of 2022 the consumers spent about 10% more than they did in the third quarter of 2021 so 2022 third quarter 10% over Third quarter 2021 and frankly for the first couple weeks and October we've seen that same 10% increase Now when you think about that spending think about two things one is still very strong at a relative basis even the transactions are up 6% outpaces inflation travel being a very growing part because coming from last year when you had the Delta of COVID you know Variant to this year people are traveling but on top of that though be mindful that early in the year is probably more like a 13 14% to 12% to 10% So it's being mitigated so I think the the feds changes and rates the concerns about it's going out there people are slowing down a bit But not slowing down consistent with a real slowdown economy yet, and that's that's the good news Brian, that's interesting just that you're you're calling out 10% growth Through October and I just talked to proctor and gamble CEO after their earnings They're talking about a resilient consumer are you surprised by the resilience we're seeing in US consumers here? Well, we talked in our earnings materials about resilient consumer frankly and you think about that long three three two or three dimensions First is the unemployment obviously still very low people working Second is do they have money in their bank accounts in the money in the bank accounts of our consumers are 35 million Core households a bank of America at the end of September was the same as it was at the end of August and in fact is Multiple multiples over where it was before the pandemic Especially for those consumers who are in the $100,000 under income bracket That means that they haven't spent down the stimulus and stuff and I say multiples. I give you an example consumer had about an average of $3,500 an account pre pandemic now has 13,000 that count and it's not going down so that's good news So one they have money in accounts to their spending three they are employed for they have capacitive borrow or credit card Barrowings are still about 12% below where they were peep endemic home equity line draws are down about 25 30% still now mortgage finances slow down because rates went up but the people have home equity lines in place or Have capacitive bar the house values are still strong so all that bodes well now inflation hurts Consumers especially consumers in the modern income because the inflation and goods and services spend a lot of their income on but You know, so we have to be careful about the overall position versus certain types of consumers But generally the American consumer is very resilient Brian a lot of your peers on the street over the past few weeks have come out And warned about a recession sometime over the next six months. Of course that brings us into 2023. Where does Brian Moana hints it? Well, I don't make those projections. I have this talented research team one of the best in the world if not the best in the world run by Canis Browning Platt and the team and they basically been consistent They they have this quarter meaning past quarter third quarter 22 growing then it has the fourth quarter of the",https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OFbNeKtIJNY,59,2022-10-19 18:06:46
3674," Tannis Browning, Platinum Team, and they basically been consistent. They have this quarter, meaning the past quarter, third quarter, 22 growing. Then they have the fourth quarter, the first quarter, the second quarter, the third quarter, all, and negative territories around half percent, one and a half percent. So a slight shallow down, we're trending and growing at the end of next year. They have pushed that projection for recession out a little bit into 23, but their core belief fits in the mild recession. It's coupled with unemployment that gets up to, you know, 4 to 5 percent. A Fed funds rate, likewise around 5 percent. But inflation does get under control and we come out of that recession. That's the core projection. Now against that though, the real facts are today, the consumers are spending commercial credits and great shape, consumer credits and great shape. Even though things like housing and stuff like that have flattened out because that's the way the Fed slows down the economy. The reality is that consumers still are employed in earning money. And so the Fed's toughest job and inflation is also the best thing about the U.S. economy, which is a strong consumer. So our team predicts a recession, a mild recession. They have had that projection, frankly, six months ago. They had the same projection, more or less, it just pushed out a little bit. But what we're not seeing is it come to for you yet. And that keeps moving it out because of that resiliency and the consumer. By all indications, Brian, the Federal Reserve is going to continue to move higher with rates over the course of its next few meetings. What does that mean for your net interest margins over the next couple quarters? Well, one of the things that people know about banking is a core way we make a half our money or more is through what they call a spread. I had the difference between what we lend a customer money and what we pay on the deposits and the money customers give us or we can borrow in the market. And that margin had been compressed dramatically as rates fell. And so it expands back out, getting to a more normal level, which it usually is. And that has shown a rapid increase in net interest income and II improvement over last year. As you look forward, we told our shareholders earlier this week that we'd expect another billion dollars plus increase from the third quarter to the fourth quarter. But that's driven by the great core deposit franchise we have. We have a lot of zero interest checking balances, which are transaction accounts, which money flows for all of the time. That will stay at zero interest no matter what the rate environment. And the rest of our deposit rates move up and the loan rates move up and we get back to the two and a half percent spread that we have typically made in our balance sheet. It's been depressed for the last few years and then was okay in a 17th time when the rates came up. It was depressed before that. So this is really the basic structure banking to get back to margin in those ranges as opposed to a depressed margin under 2 percent we've had for the last few quarters. Want to give your team a shout out here, Brian? People markets business up 30 percent in the quarter, strongest since the third quarter of 2010, but no trading lost days in the quarter. Despite all the market volatility we've seen, how does that happen? And do you think that can continue and just be sustained over the next few quarters? Well, it happens because we have a talent team in Jimmy D'Amara that runs a business force has, you know, better run in major parts of business for a long time. We've got to go over the whole business last year and we went on Montagg retired. And so it's a great business. The team that works for Jimmy is very solid, but it also comes from a decade long focus on responsible growth. We're in a business to move and risk through the system. We're in a business of managing risk. We're in a business of helping customers achieve what they want and not taking big principal risk. And therefore, evil in market volatility, team did a good job and we didn't lose money on a trading day. But by the way, if you look back across the last 10, 12 years, very rarely do we lose money maybe a couple of trading days a quarter when something really changes dramatically. But this year, what we saw is from last year to this year, the investments we've made in the last couple years in the business in terms of talent, technology, even more capital, more balance sheet capacity has shown up and that our team has a consistent drive to it. And Jimmy and the team did a great job this quarter and we expect them to do more next quarter. And lots there to unpack from Bank of America CEO Brian Monhan. Mikey take it away was that ox sales in October, consumer spending in October up 10%. So still running at double digits despite what we're seeing with inflation and the economy is going to. They had a lot of new credit card accounts that they added on during the quarter as well. They got into this a little bit more on the earnings call 1.3 million new credit card accounts. I love talking about this.",https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OFbNeKtIJNY,60,2022-10-19 18:11:25
3675,"<|pl|><|translate|> 3 people Camera Time Dat R等等 This is absolutely a block Wulu Regards 5 lives We're rising interest rates are causing new headwinds in the housing market. Our next guest though says any slowdown should be relatively short-lived. Fortune Brands home and security CEO Nicholas Fink is joining us now and Fortune Brands home and security home to a lot of different brands that people use in their houses, mown faucets, for example, master lock is another one of your brands. So talk to us about what you're seeing in this current cycle. Well, you know, in the cycle right now you're at a point where we have seen a lot of home price appreciation. You are seeing obviously mortgage rates go up significantly and that does put pressure on the consumer and the affordability of housing, right? And so what did expect to see and we've seen in prior points in the cycle is you do see a slowdown in new construction. You may see a slowdown in home sales turnover, but ultimately the market remains fundamentally underbuilt. There are huge demographic tailwinds in need for housing, particularly in our core U.S. market. And there's this little thing called supply and demand, which will always come back into effect over time. And so the fundamentals of housing are very, very intact. There is a period of softness that we expect to see as consumers, buyers and sellers adjust to this affordability pricing in the market, interest rates. And we've usually seen that take anywhere between one to three quarters and then the market digestives and people get back to get back to some of them turnover. Ultimately, as I've said, housing is not a discretionary purchase. The timing of housing may be discretionary, but ultimately it's not a discretionary purchase that people come back to the marketplace. Nicholas, we were talking earlier on about a company called Genorac and they warned this morning about higher inventory levels in the channel. Now you're a major player at home due point and lows. I mean, what are you seeing from these home improvement chains in terms of inventory given things have slowed down? Right. Well, they do an excellent job managing inventory, managing work in capital. We work very closely with them. Now one of the hallmarks of our business is in addition to really managing our brains and innovation really, really well. We do manage our channel and our service to the channel really well. So if you look back at how we've performed through the whole COVID period, you would have seen that we were able to serve at superior levels. We were able to gain market share as a consequence. And so we've been back in the market, I would say, certain customers really well. And as a consequence, we've seen inventories right size over the period. And we've talked about that previously. And so there's certainly dollar inventory as higher as pricing and inflation is the impact of the customer inventory. But I think in a lot of our major customers that is kind of equalizing over time as service levels come back into line. I mean, at the end of the day, it's still going to come down to where we're seeing more of the DIY projects that perhaps move forward from this point. If people are getting into some of the user, not used, but existing homes out there on the market. So as you're kind of tracking both the health of real estate more broadly as well as how that correlates to your business, what are your expectations going into next year where there's already been a slowdown in housing? Right. Well, you know, you come back to that fundamental, right? The consumer over time is going to need housing. The US market's hugely underbuilt. And so over time, we're going to have to add more hums into the marketplace. Thank you, Joe.",https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OFbNeKtIJNY,61,2022-10-19 18:18:31
3676," overtime is going to need housing. The US market is hugely underbuilt. And so, over time, we're going to have to add more homes into the marketplace. So, you know, that's a fact. I think we'll see a slide down. In your construction, you saw some of that in today's data, although they put it in context. I mean, single-family reconstruction is now at 2019 levels and multi-family is still well above. That's on today's data, right? And so, kind of returning to the pre-COVID levels. But you have a lot of consumers that are in homes with, you know, the majority of mortgages are below 4%. You know, those homes need renovation. And, you know, even today, we're seeing consumer interest, for example, we look at Google search data, you know, 25-35% above pre-COVID levels. And so, people are really interested in the home. They're really interested in that space. And so, we expect that to carry through. Now, you know, you may again see a period of softness around some uncertainty, I think, as we get into 2023. That's a fair expectation. We pride ourselves in being able to manage those and actually turn them into opportunity to gain more share, really, to like the consumers and meet the consumers where they are with our brains. But, you know, over the medium term to long term, we expect both from the R&R perspective as well as new construction consumers to come right back in and be supporting the tremendous equity that they have in their homes today. And, Nicholas, when it comes to your business, how much is split between going directly into the retail channels to how much ends up in professional hands and kind of how does that have been flow with the housing market? Yeah, I mean, we're still, you know, very heavily geared towards, I'd say, the old sell channel. So, if you think about it's probably 23rd, 23rd, similarly for renovation and repair, where 23rd's new construction more, you know, 1-3rd or less, or some international markets as well. And so, that is very much the gearing of the poor fall. You know, there's a little bit of ebb and flow, I think, depending on times, you know, where products sit, where inventories that, you know, you saw some of that during the pandemic. I mean, as the retailers opened up, people really went in there looking for product that had inventory there, able to service the channel. You know, but that's our broad exposure. But, you know, we really focus on meeting the consumers where they are. And, you know, one of the big drivers, I think, in the home market over the next period, is really going to be creating affordable homes for consumers in the US. And, you know, here in the build, there's talk a lot about the work they're going to do to create affordable homes. You know, we geared up, we're following it to be at the heart of the market. And so, whether it's a consumer that's moving up through the price points and some of our higher end brands and offerings or whether it's really at the heart of the market, you know, we've had the, we're following it very, very good to meet them there. At good margins. And so, we'll continue to do that and continue to leverage the brands and the innovation to be at that point. And I think that's going to play very strongly through, you know, both the retail as well as the wholesale channels. Nicholas, I recently got a new faucet and it's one of those touchless faucets. And once I installed it, I'm like, wow, why have I not been using this the past 10 years of my life? I'm glad I created up to get it. I think it just works. It's good. You know, but what type of innovation? What's the next big product for a brand like a moment? Well, I'll tell you, I mean, as we, you know, as you may know, we're taking the company through a separation of some of our businesses now, one of our cabinets business that's, you know, really going to focus on being the best in that industry. But then the rest of the business and you're touching on sort of water management business is really going to be focused on supercharged categories. So things that are connected, water management, outdoor living, you know, things that really, really drive consumer value. And that experience you have, I'm smiling because I hear that all the time, you know, people like, I got this in and how did I live without it? I mean, we're actually taking that product line as an example to a completely connected ecosystem inside of the house. I mean, you know, it's the touchless faucet that's going to be connected to it already is, you know, an AI system that understands water flowing in house can tell you if you've got a leak. And shut your main down if you're going to have a catastrophic leak will save just an absolute fortune for homeowners and insurers can protect you from freezes, can protect you from health threats by managing your water supply. So that experience you're having is really one of the most exciting moments in our industry.",https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OFbNeKtIJNY,62,2022-10-19 18:22:51
3677," protect you from freezes, can protect you from health threats by managing your water supply. And so that experience you're having is really one of the most exciting moments in our industry. It's really this convergence from, you know, historical kind of mechanical water management into these connected products that we have in the marketplace. Nicholas, I wish you would have told me that before. I would have not gotten this touch. I want to know when there's leaks. I mean, that makes sense. That's a good product. That's a good product. We can help you out with that. No problem. Nick, you got anything that's going to help Amazon packages from getting stolen? We got, you know, we do have some great security products in our master brand, Master Lock portfolio. And again, becoming more and more kind of connected and remote is kind of the big driver of that portfolio. So stay tuned. All right. We'll accept that for now. Nick, thank you. What is the fortune brand's home in security CEO? We appreciate the time here with you today. Guys coming up inflation may now impact your tax bracket. We've got the deeds on the other side. So, that's it. Slap on database. It's time for a cup of time. Three stories, one minute each. We start with this on the day. You might find yourself in a new tax bracket next year. The IRS says it's raising tax brackets and standard deductions by 7% for the 2023 tax season. The move is in response to high inflation, giving taxpayers a chance to shield more of their earnings from income tax. All right. The IRS, everybody. All right, cool. Yeah, this is an automatic thing. Actually, remember they just did it for Social Security also. Now they are doing it for taxes also. And it doesn't just affect like the highest earners. It also affects things like a state taxes. So it's this automatic adjustment that happens that Congress put in place. And I don't think there's a lot of awareness about it because we haven't had as big an increase in inflation for a long time. So this is the biggest adjustment to this for a long time. You consumer spending boom in the spring next year. I kind of like that. I think that. I think it's also an acknowledgement too for the IRS and looking at the tax brackets, especially as they know that they're needing to add on more to their workforce as well. I mean, the IRS right now is still so backlogged. And so this could. Oh, good tax. Oh, over time. Indeed. All right, taxes to rides. Lyft can help you find a parking spot now. Right, sharing app.",https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OFbNeKtIJNY,63,2022-10-19 18:27:31
3678," It's still so backlogged and so this could. Oh, we're tax. Oh, we're tax. Sorry. Indeed. All right, taxes to rides, lifts can help you find a parking spot. Now, the ride sharing app launched Lift Parking, a partnership with Chicago-based spot hero, feature lets you search, reserve, and pay for parking spaces in the app. So I already reserved the closest six spots to the mall on Black Friday. So sorry, guys, but I'm really not sorry, because this is great. I mean, there are lots of other apps that already do this. Really? Yes. I did. I can't, you can book most garages in New York City garages. You can't book spots on the street necessarily. So maybe there's not as much competition for that market. But I mean, this business already exists. I'm going to try to book the hot spots in front of restaurants. I mean, I drive nice cars. But I car should be in front of the restaurant. But it has to be a spot with a meter. You can't just go and park at the mall. Oh, OK. I thought, well, like, this thing is great. I love it. This is my spot. This is my spot. I love it. I have a meter there that is hooked up to assist. Oh, then I cast my car, camp here, in front of the restaurant. No, wait, we're in my tape. There's a meter there you can. I was going to reserve a spot to the restaurant this weekend. I'm sorry. I apologize.

Here's where we're watching at this hour. Netflix shares still in rally mode after a strong third quarter report, but higher treasure yields keeping a lid on enthusiasm for tech. Our panel is ready and waiting to get into those numbers. I, on the midterms, the Biden administration poised to dip into the strategic reserve yet again as conflicting signals point to both bullish and bearish catalysts for crude. We're going to get the very latest report out of Washington, DC in just a bit. And I, P, know, the market for global stock listings has had a dire 2022 and this trouble to raise cash is just as real in the US can Intel and mobile line be the rising tide that lifts all boats. We'll speak with S&P Global about that. First, let's check in on the market action though 90 minutes into the trading day. We've had a bit of a choppy session here right now. The Dow, the only one that's in the green up about 38 points, the S&P 500 up or down 12 and the NASDAQ down 50. And we've been talking a lot about earnings results there. Numbers out from United, PNG among the companies that have helped kind of provide support at those levels. But it is about treasure yields today as we see the 10 year yield coming over that 4% level and certainly that weighing on investor sentiment at least so far in this session. Well, Netflix shares seeing a boost after beating estimates for the third quarter. The streaming giants all rise and subscriber growth once again. It's now expected to add another four and a half million subscribers in the fourth quarter. But streaming isn't the only thing on Netflix's mind as it looks to also expand into cloud gaming joining us now with more on Netflix's journey ahead is Gita Ranganappan Bloomberg intelligence senior media analyst. We've also got Dave Hedger. He is Edward Jones senior equity analyst. Welcome to both of you today. Gita, let me start with you. I mean, certainly we have seen a big rally in the stock. Although you could argue it's fallen so much expectations were pretty low coming in. They did beat on the sub numbers. What else stood out to you? Yeah, so I think definitely the one thing that stood out is this company is clearly back on track. I mean, of course the 3Q numbers were definitely much stronger than expected. But I think what was equally reassuring and even encouraging is the 4Q guidance kind of came in slightly higher than consensus. And remember, this was not even factoring in factoring in a huge catalyst that they have on the horizon, which is the debut of their new ad supported tier. They're going to be pricing this at a really aggressive $7 price point historically, the lowest price that Netflix has ever come out with. So it should kind of open up a whole new market for them. And then of course, they're, you know, they're again reinforcing some of their financial metrics in terms of free cash flow as well as profit margins. Yeah, indeed to that point, the company making a pretty clear they add supported tier and not really going to be a material impact at least in this quarter because it's being introduced a little later. But I want to point to one thing that has really stood out here and that's the FX had wins highlighted many times in this report, the sequential decline in revenue, they say is entirely because of FX looking through the numbers here. They estimate full your appreciation of the dollar will negatively affect full your revenue operating income by 1 billion roughly each. So how does the companies and the money how much there a different base quality statistics being that the",https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OFbNeKtIJNY,65,2022-10-19 18:35:55
3680," Estimate full year appreciation of the dollar will negatively affect full year revenue operating income by 1 billion Roughly each so how does the company adjust for that? Is there anything they can do in terms of the pricing Or the cost structure that will allow them to have a bit more of a buffer with the dollar expected to be strong for longer Well, it's only can try to adjust pricing in international markets they count for the foreign exchange pressure However, that's a fine tight rope to be walking just in terms of you don't want to increase price too much and in turn New affect subscriber growth. We do think that the ad supported service should help drive subscriber growth in international markets So I think the lower price point will be attractive and certain markets overseas You know, there's more ability to pay at that lower price point So that may be where netflix can find some balance And certainly the revenue from the advertise and could offset that the lower price point and in turn also help offset some foreign exchange pressure Geeta as you pointed out, you know the company highlighting that we are back on the path to reaccelerate growth Certainly the ad tier is something a lot of analysts have been looking to but at the end of the day It is a content company and they've sort of highlighted that even as The past few quarters have not been as strong in terms of their sub numbers Engagement has still been high compared to other streaming competitors What's that next catalyst you think when you look at the content pipeline for this company that could push it even higher Yeah, I think we've now seen really the steady cadence of you know content titles We were kind of hit by that whole covid log jam and they did say that that's going to take a little bit of time to kind of unwind But we've seen them deliver consistent hits obviously You know they're some of their biggest hitting titles being you know stranger things But then they've had a lot of newer shows that have also performed really really well the the Jeffrey Darmershow being a great example of that And we're seeing them kind of hold their content budget steady But remember we are seeing a lot of the other streamers So a lot of the competition is also dialing back on their content spend I think that's a really important point because You know maybe we're going to see some of those competitive pressures ease up a little bit as Some of these streamers start to understand that profitability is becoming more and more important And I think that really gives Netflix a leg up You know as they try and get more and more bang for their buck and this is exactly what they spoke to They said they're getting more impact for every dollar of content spend And we're seeing that with some of the engagement metrics that they post to the other point that I want to make here is that With some of those engagement metrics you come out with an advertising product. I mean this is really So Attractive advertisers knowing that they have that deep engagement knowing that they have a captive audience Which is on their platform for about two to and a half hours every day Advertisers are going to be willing to pay up And day finally is the company looks to see look looks for other levers to drive revenue We got some news from the VP of gaming there saying that netflix is now looking at a cloud gaming as a potential They've also going to have a clouds or gaming segments within Their southern california headquarters there or their offices there I mean, this is a very crowded space This would be sort of a new venture for netflix. They've been talking about it for some time Is this something that you think Netflix can compete in just given the players that are already in the space Yes, certainly the gaming space is a challenging market and and a lot of competition in that market Um, we view that as something that might be incremental for netflix and in particular may not drive a lot of subscriber growth But perhaps could help in terms of subscriber retention Uh, you know, that's I think one of the challenges uh when the content schedule was a little more uneven uh that you know when there's that content that people are urgently wanted to watch that that's where you see turn Take up and people you know cut off their service for a while where gaming could be another way of keeping subscribers engaged and",https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OFbNeKtIJNY,66,2022-10-19 18:40:01
3681," So you see churn, tick up, and people, you know, cut off their service for a while, where gaming could be another way of keeping subscribers engaged and holding on to their subscription, even when it's a time period that one of their favorite shows hasn't, you know, has already debuted and they've already watched those episodes. It is about continuing to make the platform sticky with so many of these streaming companies. Appreciate your time to both of you. Gita, Runganathan, Bloomberg Intelligence, Senior Media Analyst, and Dave Hagar. He's Edward Jones, Senior Equity Analyst. Well, now turning to the energy space. President Biden doubling down against big oil. His administration is releasing 15 million more barrels from the Strategic Petroleum Reserve. The president is set to speak on the measures in the next couple of hours. Biden also setting out a plan to refill the reserve. Just a reminder, this is oil stored in 60 giant salt caverns in Texas as well as Louisiana. We've got Yahoo Finance contributor. Kevin Sirili on the story for us today. Kevin, how much of this is really about the midterms trying to keep the cap there on gas prices as voters sort of think about that? Well, there's definitely a midterm political, domestic politics angle here, but there's also a geopolitical angle. But we are anticipating as you alluded to, the president Biden is going to release 15 million barrels from the Strategic Petroleum Reserve. He's going to make those remarks later this afternoon, but he's also going to do something else. And that is to say that the administration will repurchase crude oil when the US energy benchmark West Texas intermediate hits between $67.72 per barrel. And what essentially the administration is saying is, quote, this repurchase approach will protect taxpayers and help create certainty around future demand for crude oil. That will encourage firms to invest in production right now, helping to improve US energy security and bring down energy prices that have been driven up by Putin's war in Ukraine. And Kevin, specifically, you know, there's other measures that have kind of been floated around. We know these big oil companies have approached the Department of Energy, the Secretary of Energy, Jennifer Granholm, really saying that there should not be some kind of ban on exports going out of the US at a time when the anticipation is that Europe will implement those sanctions against Russian oil coming in December. I mean, as you point out, a lot of pieces to connect here, but are we expecting any kind of measures on that front to be announced from the White House? Well, potentially, and three points here. First and foremost, economically, the average price of gas that the US consumer is facing right now is about $3.87 per gallon. That's up, get this 20 cents from just over a month ago and nearly 56 cents when you compare it to a year ago. So when you couple that with high inflation at about 8.1% in the United States, not to mention, as you said in Europe, we're in the UK, it's 10.1%. Workers around the world, especially in Europe and the United States are feeling the brunt of this. But secondly, to take this back to the US midterm election cycle just last night in Miami, when Senator Marco Rubio was up on stage debating Val Demings, his Democratic challenger, he essentially said that, quote, this our oil reserves do not exist to win midterms, end quote. The Republicans are seizing on this. They view this as a winning issue. They want to increase domestic US oil production and they don't think that the administration should just be utilizing the strategic oil reserves. In contrast to that, there's a political context of this that the President Biden's expected to make later this afternoon. And that is that they are declaring political war against big oil. And they are going to try to especially target big oil profits that have been made throughout the pandemic. And they feel that drawing that contrast is a way for them to mobilize the base of their party, especially those who have interest on climate change, while essentially trying to have it both ways by releasing some from the strategic oil reserves. And then quickly, the third and final point is the geopolitics. You can't ignore Putin's war with Ukraine and the impact that that's having on European oil. But you also can't ignore that the pressure that this is now caused on the US-Saudi relationship. And already, again, on Capitol Hill, you're hearing members of the President.",https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OFbNeKtIJNY,67,2022-10-19 18:44:28
3682," peon oil, but you also can't ignore that the pressure that this is now caused on the U.S. Saudi relationship. And already, again, on Capitol Hill, you're hearing members of both parties, quite frankly, criticize the Saudis who, of course, run OPEC for their decision. And this impact is especially going to, I think, reveal the leverage that some foreign governments have in terms of impacting the everyday U.S. consumer. And we've seen a number of lawmakers come out and talking about restricting arm sales, for example, to Saudi Arabia. On that second point that you just made, though, about that, you know, sort of fight that we're seeing play out between the administration and then big oil, the reality is these reserves are at their lowest in decades. I mean, the administration needs big oil to be on board, right? What does that look like right now? Well, you know, privately, the energy sector here in Washington, DC, the energy lobby, are, I would say, rolling their eyes. Because, look, President Biden comes from Delaware. This was a state that has a heavy refinery contingency in the state. And, but it's really reflective of the dynamics within the Democratic Party right now, where you have the moderates who are potentially more moderate on this issue. But again, you have this new wing of progressives on the flank of the party, who are trying to really move the party much more to the left, especially as it relates to climate change. And so this puts President Biden in a significant, significant political debacle. Because here you have an issue that according to most polls, virtually all polls, including the CBS poll that came out just the other week, where the economy is the number one issue amongst independent voters. And in states like Florida, where again, Senator Rubio is beating Demings according to polls, the average of polls of real clear politics by five percentage points, or looking at state like Pennsylvania, where on the Senate race there, the Republican challenging John Fetterman, the progressive, those polls have tightened energy inflation. These are the closing arguments that Republicans are making in their closing bid as we lead up to the mid-serve elections. Just a few more weeks to go. Yeah. Should get interesting. Kevin Sireli, as always, appreciate your insight. Thank you for having me. Well, strong quarterly results are helping lift shares of Proctor and Gamble. Take a look at that. The stock is up nearly 3 percent after the consumer products giant Beat Wall Street estimates on the top and bottom lines as increased prices helped offset lower demand and higher costs. Dollar strength, though, weighed on the company's outlook, cutting its full-year sales forecast. And now, expect sales to decline one to three percent lower than previous forecasts. Furnings per share expected to come in at the lower end of the range as well. CEO John Mueller speaking to our morning team, and set the consumers remains resilient, even in the face of high inflation. But if we look at consumer sentiment, and one measure of that is it's trade down to private label brands, we're seeing very little movement. So in North America, past three in six months, private label brands increase share by only 30 basis points on a 12-month basis. They're flat, same general situation in Europe. And while we see a pop in the stock today shares of Proctor and Gamble are down roughly 20 percent year to date. While coming up pressure, persists shares an avid continuing a downtrend. Despite the group upping its earnings forecast, it's been a tough year for the stock, despite a diversified business and a big presence in COVID testing. We'll talk healthcare on the other side.",https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OFbNeKtIJNY,68,2022-10-19 18:48:45
3683," Our video is equipped with some task learning applications that give us a free We'll share as of Abbott are slumping after reporting third quarter results this morning. The company lifted its guidance but reported a drop in sales because of the baby formula shortage. A decline in COVID-19 testing also weighed on the quarter. That earnings call with investors just wrapping up for more on that. Let's bring in Angelie Kamlani who's been tracking those comments for us this morning. Angelie. Absolutely. I could go on that point of the baby formula, really weighing on their nutrition line of business down 10%. And then the COVID testing still pretty a decent demand, even though a reduction from the last quarter, the company noting that there are many global trends that are weighing including COVID, including inflation, strong dollar. But all in all, they seem to be remaining optimistic about specifically the baby formula shortage and that sort of getting over as they reopen the planned last quarter. So that's where things stand right now. Okay. Let's take a deeper dive into Abbott's numbers here with Shugun Singh, he's medical devices, analysts at RBC, capital markets, joining us today. Shugun, I'm looking at where the stock is trading right now, certainly down despite some of those results. I'm imagining you've got an outperform with the price target of $132 a share. So you certainly feel like there's more upside. What do you think investors are getting wrong? No, thank you so much firstly for having us here. You know, I we do like the stock. We think, you know, the company does have a pretty solid long term financial profile of growth in the high single digits on the top line and double digit EPS growth on the bottom line. You know, if we just look at the Q3 numbers, the quarter was actually pretty strong. You know, they did beat by 700 million on the top line and about 20 cents on EPS. You know, COVID-19 testing was definitely what drove the results. You know, the results came in at about $1.7 billion. Consensus was looking at about 540 million in sales. So really impressive, despite the summer months. And you know, if you look at a full year guidance at this point, at 7.8 billion in COVID-19 sales, which is actually ahead of what they did last year. So you know, pretty solid revenues in terms of COVID-19. I think what the sticking point here really is the mid to mid single to high single digit on the line growth.",https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OFbNeKtIJNY,69,2022-10-19 18:53:33
3684," solid revenues in terms of COVID-19. I think what the sticking point here really is the mid-single to high-single digit underlying growth. So there were factors that impacted the quarter, such as COVID, if you back out COVID-19 testing, an infant formula recall, there was also medical device supply issues that impacted the company. So if you back out all those one-time items on an underlying basis, the company delivered about mid-single to high-single digit underlying growth, which is slightly below the longer-term outlook of high-single digits. But I think it's more of a reflection of Q3, which is seasonally a weaker quarter, and then the COVID-19 environment, whether recovery is occurring, but it is at a much slower pace than what we would have liked in a normal environment. Shagun, Anjali here. I want to look at some of the very specific details that they let us know about today, one being the new plant for baby formula production. And then also looking at the library tests and looking at also models that are pretty different when it comes to direct consumer and subscription models. I know there was mention of that. I wonder how you think this all plays for a company that's as large as it is that has had quite a diverse market so far. Yeah, I think both on infant formula recall, I think it's a good step that they are planning to. They have made some leadership changes at the Michigan facility, and they're planning to move forward with plans about half a billion dollar in investments in a new US nutrition facility for specialty and metabolic infant formulas. I think there is upside on diabetes as well. And honestly, if you just take a step back and look at the company, I do like the diversified portfolio that the company has. They are continuing to move forward within medical devices. Again, nutrition business. I think they did lost about 20 share points, given the recall, they gained half of it back as of September and the impact. I think this year is about 750 million, but I think this business should recover into next year. Also in terms of diabetes, there is a CMS proposed coverage guidelines for CGMs. The common period of that is open till about the 19th of November. And if expanded and coverage is approved, it could really bring more eligible patients into the population, 4 million, going to about 8 million, which is another $2 billion US opportunity. So I do like their diversified portfolio. And I think they do have levers to pull in terms of just diabetes, medical devices, diagnostics, and nutrition coming back. Let's elaborate on that a bit. As you pointed out, some of the sentiment that's weighing on the stock today is about the decline we've seen in COVID testing. Yes, we're going into what is expected to be a period of more optics in COVID cases. But the reality is we're not going to be at the peak that we haven't over the last few years. You mentioned a long list of other levers within their portfolio. What do you think is going to be the biggest driver that gets you to that $132 share price target? Yeah. And I just want to back up. I don't think it's so much about COVID testing. It's more about, like I mentioned, investors focus on the underlying growth profile of the company when you back out COVID testing, the infant formula recall, which is about a $230 million hit this quarter again. And then the medical supply issue that they faced internationally. So I think the sticking point for investors right now is really recovery. Just in terms of COVID, I think in an endemic phase, as a base case, the company is looking for about $500 million in quarterly sales. I think that's a good placeholder even for next year, which does provide some upside. So I think again, the mid to high single digit growth profile versus the highest single digit organic revenue growth that they aspire to get to on a long-term basis. I think the variance between that is really Q3 being seasonally weaker. And then the COVID-19 environment, whether recovery is occurring, but it is not, you know, we are not in normal time. So I think that's having an impact. I think that's more of a sticking point than COVID-19 testing. And again, you know, it's.",https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OFbNeKtIJNY,70,2022-10-19 18:57:22
3685," but we are not in normal times. So I think that's having an impact. So I think that's more of a sticking point than COVID-19 testing. And again, just to mention again, they are doing about $7.8 billion, for the full year, that's their guidance at this point versus $7.7 billion that they did last year. Q4 includes about $500 million in quarterly sales for COVID-19 testing business. And again, that does not include any additional COVID searches or government contracts.

So the Dow now off just around 200 points. And now is that moving to the downside off just over one person.",https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OFbNeKtIJNY,71,2022-10-19 19:01:58
3686," actually because we are almost across the board, your averages of reversal gains that were coming off off just around 200 points to the downside off just o today at S&P off just around off just over 1% taking a 2000 that's a small cap off just over 2% today. the bond market yield push again, the 10 year yield that we've seen since 2008 the two year yield hitting that we've seen since 2007. This is on the expectation of maybe more rate hikes from some comments that we got from Fed officials earlier today. Take a look at the reaction that we're also seeing play out in the crude market. We're seeing oil jump to the upside here this afternoon now right around $85 a barrel some data out government data showing that supplies did drop and of course traders are weighing this against what we just heard from President Biden. We're seeing a little bit more detail here in just a few minutes. Let's first take a look at the sector. I mentioned the ad the gains that we're seeing in energy. You can see the XLE up nearly 3% certainly the outlier when you look at the rest of the 10 S&P sectors moving to the downside worst performance coming from financials and real estate and digging in to some of those financial players. We did get more earnings out this morning to see Bank of America off nearly 3% in really setting that pace to the downside. JP Morgan, Wells Fargo, Morgan Can Abdul-Korey. In the morning also said well old Soh maybe about about 2% off just a couple days of gold and about 1% off just around 4% account. Good stuff, Shahna Thank you. Let's get shift speech. Now it's the key economic data out today The beige book reflects current economic conditions across and gender Labour detailed financials here. Genaros Schanberger here. Will want to see you what are we learning. Well increases in prices remained high. With significant increases products according to anecdotal evidence on inflation and the economy across the Federal Reserves 12 bank districts. Now, taking a look overall at that inflation picture, some contacts noted solid pricing power over the past six weeks, while others said passing on costs was becoming difficult as customers started pushing back. Though several districts noted some easing of pricing, and the expectation looking ahead is for prices to moderate. Now, taking a look at the job market, is that also leads into inflation as to how high prices consumers are willing to swallow and able to swallow. Overall, seeing some signs of cooling, but the job market remaining strong overall, several districts reporting cooling in demand for workers, while some noted that businesses were hesitant to add to payrolls, because of concerns of a forthcoming economic downturn. Now, there were also scattered mentions of hiring freezes. Half of the districts also noted some easing of hiring, and or retention difficulties. Though, as I mentioned, overall, the job market remaining strong competition for workers has led some companies to try to poach from competitors, or have to offer higher pay in order to get those workers. Weage pressures remained wide spread overall, and contacts expect wage growth to continue as higher pay remains essential to retain those workers. Now, overall, the economy expanded modestly on net since September. However, conditions varied across districts. For districts noted, flat activity, two noted declines was slowing our weak demand attributed to inflation higher interest rates and supply chain issues. Consumer spending has fooled with consumers pulling back on that discretionary spending. And outlooks grew more pessimistic amid growing concerns of weakening demand. So, Dave, bottom line here, the economy holding in relatively strong position with inflation remaining in issue, though there are signs of cooling and businesses do expect a slowdown. Beneficials will take this information into account at their policy meeting in two weeks, where they are widely expected to raise their benchmark interest rate by 75 basic points for the fourth time in a row. Thank you. All right, Jen. Thanks so much for that, Breita. We want to talk about what this means for the broader market for that. We want to bring Michelle Schneider, marketgauge.com, partner and director of trading and research and education as well. Michelle, it's great to see you. So, we just heard.",https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OFbNeKtIJNY,72,2022-10-19 19:07:08
3687," The broader market for that we want to bring in Michelle Schneider, marketgage.com, partner and director of trading and research and education as well. Michelle, it's great to see you. So we just heard from Jen what we got from the Fed-Bajibok and squaring that off with what we just heard from Minneapolis Fed President Neil Kashkari saying that there's no signs that inflation is slowing more rate hikes due in fact to seem to be needed. What's your reaction from that and the losses that we're seeing play out in the market today? Well, if you start to look at all the economic data right now, you can get kind of dizzy because there's contradicting things going on out there, although the labor market is strong if we just look at that. The labor participation rate is still declining and there's this whole movement out there among the younger generations called quiet quitting on top of the fact that many people don't want to work. So I think it's very regional and very corporate based in terms of where they're struggling to find people and where they're still begging for help. So if we just take all of the stats and the interest rate rises and just look at what I think are really key factors right here on whether or not we'll get a soft landing or session, more inflation or whatever have you, is if we just take a look now at the indices, they're all except for the Russell 2000 and the NASTIC above a 200 week moving average and all of them including the Russell 2000 and NASTIC are well above a six to seven year business cycle moving average measured by 80 months, which means that this destruction that we're seeing in the market is certainly hurting and rates are having a lot to do with it, but we still don't really know what's going to happen in the future at this point. The deep recession calls may be premature. I know that sounds like incredibly optimistic. Of course we have to be prepared for the worst. So that's kind of how we're looking at it with the dollar as well. Super, super important right here is what happens with the future of the dollar, which right now still been right a flight to safety. Then you've got Jeff Bezos with a little gasoline on the fire saying we need to batten down the hatches. So let's look at earnings. We've got United, we've got Delta, we've got Netflix, we've got the big banks. What are you learning that might be in stark contrast to all the predictions of a recession? Well, I think basically that reality may have not fully set in in terms of the impact of these higher yields on one level. And we know the consumer obviously has been hurt to a degree, but it's still relatively strong. So like airlines, for example, is a great thing to look at. Actually airfares and clamoring to travel has gone up. And so Netflix of course was a big surprise. The banks they're getting more their money based on deposits because people are putting money in the bank because they're getting higher rates. But none of it, I think really reflects what we could see going forward. And that's where, you know, like today Tesla will be an interesting, I think, barometer because Tesla is going to be, we already know they've delivered a lot of cars, but really it's going to be demand going forward. Maybe that'll give us a clue. But right now we're in a big soup. I don't think anybody really knows exactly what's going to happen except for the fact that inflation that everybody keeps thinking is peaking doesn't seem to be peaking Europe. Historical highs for inflation since 1982 today. Michelle, when we take a look and I know you're watching some key levels here, S&P falling back below 3700 today as we have just around 50 minutes to go in the trading day. It's right at 3680. In terms of the key levels when you're trying to figure out if there's more downside risk or when the market is going to remain bullish, what are you looking for? Well, that 3600 has been extremely pivotal and that is exactly where, Sean, we were just talking about that 200 week moving average, which is kind of an indicator that's often overlooked, but it's a four year cycle. So 3600 is pivotal. We broke through it as we know a couple of weeks ago, but now we're back through it. So if it holds here, that would be good. If we can get through 3800, that would be amazing. We could just chop for a while until we have more data from what happens with the next Fed meeting, more earnings reports. And of course, what happens really with the Bank of England's been affected too because people think, hmm, how far will the Fed go here before they finally say, you know what, we're going to have to start buying bonds back because we don't want things to crash. And again, goes back to the dollar. At least they have reigned it in. A lot of people are pointing to that.",https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OFbNeKtIJNY,73,2022-10-19 19:10:36
3688," finally say, you know what, we're going to have to start buying bonds back because we don't want things to crash. And again, goes back to the dollar. At least they have reigned it in. A lot of people are pointing to the housing sector to suggest things are going to get bad. What are you seeing there? Well, again, that's regional. It depends on where you live. If you like New Mexico, where we live in Santa Fe, the housing market is still tight because there's a shortage of housing. Other areas where they went crazy with new construction, obviously, are feeling big declines. I know the housing numbers came out today with like 8.9 percent decline. Mortgage rates obviously have to hurt. But then again, who's going to sell their house right now? Because if they have to buy a house with a mortgage, they're going to have to pay if they refinance during the drop. They're going to have to pay double triple what they paid back then. So like everything gave, it is so complicated. So to sink your teeth into one aspect and say, that's the defining reason we're going to a recession, I think right now might be a little bit remiss until we have more data coming out. And whether we can see these numbers can hold here, as I said in this 200 week moving average. Interesting times in the market gauge dot com partner and director of trading research and education Michelle Schneider. Good to see thanks so much.

3689," BMW plans to invest $1.7 billion to build electric vehicles and batteries here in the United States. Senior Autos reporter, possibly remaining here with more on that story. Good to see you, Matt. So what are we learning here? Yeah, so you know, it's kind of a slam dunk for them to do this. They already built cars and Spartan Briggs, South Carolina there for like their XUVs and some of their older cars. So now it's like put more morning to make an EVs and do six EVs by 2030, I believe. Including the new XM SUV EV. So kind of a move that you're not sort of surprised by because they want to take advantage of those tax credits and those assembly credits making cars here in the States. A $1 billion towards the factory and 700 million towards a new battery kind of plant. So it's a little bit of mix there of what they're going to do. So I'm not surprised by it. And this is still the IRA in effect, right? This is it's them doing this. It's earlier we saw Polestar, Fisker, even VinFast from Vietnam wanting to make factories in the US to take advantage of these tax credits. Yeah, I'm probably speaking of those tax credits. There is obviously some people on the other side of this who aren't investing in manufacturing here in the US who aren't happy about the new rules that we just got from the Biden administration. What can you tell us about that? Yeah, Hyundai, I don't know, report at Bloomberg, they're really lobbying to kind of get changes into this law that you know, the mansion adding that whole North American assembly requirement for consumer tax credits. That's kind of a big deal for Hyundai because they make other cars and so it's South Korea. They're EVs. They're going to open a plant in Georgia, a $5 billion plant, but not until 2025. So they're going to miss out on credits for three years. And this is a really, really competitive landscape. When more and more cars come online that are cheaper and can compete with Hyundai and Kia on price, they really want that tax rate in order to like kind of up the game for themselves. Yeah, they certainly do. It'll be interesting to see if the Biden administration responds. I don't know off the wait and see about that. Thanks so much for coming on here and explaining that to us. All right, President Biden speaking from the White House earlier this afternoon, outlining his latest plan to lower gas prices. Let's take a listen. Today, I'm announcing three critical steps at my administration will take to reduce gas prices at the pump. First, the Department of Energy released another 15 million barrels from the Strategic Petroleum Reserve extending our previously announced release through the month of December. With my announcement today, we're going to continue to stabilize markets and decrease the prices. I've told my team behind me here to be prepared to look further, look for further releases of the months of head if needed. We're calling it a ready and release plan. All right, let's talk about what this means for the energy markets for that. I want to bring in Alan Nuffman bulls die option dot com's chief market strategist. Alan, it's great to see you. So we just got this announcement from President Biden. And then we also got the data just that regarding supplies. It seems like that's really the driver in today's action with oil back above 85. I guess your reaction first to what we just heard from the president and the potential implications. Well, the president in reality cannot control the price of energy control the price of oil or gas prices. They they try and pamper it because it's a big issue for the markets and for people in general, especially consumers. But if you look at it, we've been trading roughly between 85 and 95 in true oil for the last three or four months. We did have a failed test to the downside and we bounced back up again. So I'm so optimistic overall that in price could move back up once again, but let's put it in perspective. We're still half of the price from 2008. If you adjust for inflation, we have to be above $200 a barrel. It's interesting. I'd love to hear what he means by if needed because theoretically, it's only needed politically speaking. This is not to solve an emergency as the SPR usually is. He also follows that with the tweet and it says when the cost of oil comes down, we should see the price of the pump come down as well. That's how it should work. But right now, we're fine. There's retailers are making record profits at the expense of Americans. What does he have right? What does he have wrong? Well, it's capitalism. Again, the president does not control the price. That'd be a whole different country if the president could determine the price of energy and he can. But that's one of the strongest sectors of the market. If you look at any of the oil companies over the last year and over the last couple of the weeks, we've seen a big rebound in oil and oil services company because slumberj, Halle Burton, Oxy, everybody's had a big bounce and it looks like we're making another attack on those highs. So we've been seeing that sector lead the way here and we've seen a bounce in the overall market. Let's.",https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OFbNeKtIJNY,75,2022-10-19 19:19:16
3690," you know, everybody's had a big bounce and it looks like we're making another attack on those highs. So we've been seeing that sector lead the way here and we've seen a bounce in the overall market. Let's remember that there's still a lot more upside in these oil company stocks. They had the lowest PE of around nine or ten compared to any sector in the S&P. So there's still more upside and money to be made in these in these particular stocks and sector even though it looks like the price of gas may go maybe going higher in the near term. Alan, how much higher could the price of gas go do you think? Well, it can go back up. But again, we had a pretty sharp decline. Let's talk about what's happening in your last gas diluted to it. It's all about the dollar. The dollar had a QRiversal a couple weeks ago where it made new oil, new highs and that had a lower weekly close. That is destructive for the dollar. So if the dollar can decline, that's going to be very much a positive for stocks and for oil. So that's something to watch and the key component obviously is interest rate. Interest rates are going to top out at five percent here in 2023 and then they decline after that. 2024, 2025, they all stabilize around four percent all the way out to 2030. So that's the market telling us that the rate hike cycle is going to be done and the dollar shouldn't go up anymore. That's going to push the energy and commodity complex higher and that's going to hurt the consumer. But like I said, there's money to be made and some of these stocks that will benefit from it. Got to push a little bit. Dan Dicker here yesterday in the program said $120 a barrel early 23. Do you agree with that? Do you at least see over $100 a barrel? Yeah, I see $100 a barrel that's again, like I said, that would be half of where we were. I know it hurts psychologically and it's a red button issue for people, but it's still half off of 2008. The Fed got what they wanted. They knocked oil prices down. They knocked about 35 percent, but I see that as a temporary respite here. And Poowell is always has price pop potential. And you understand there are certain, there are a lot of people around the world that have a vested interest in a higher energy prices and they're going to do what they're going to do because that's how they make money. And let's talk about the energy crisis in Europe. Obviously a huge story, a huge mover here throughout the energy sector. EU companies at least right now at odds just over how best to tackle the energy crisis. What's your takeaway? And I guess what do you think should be done at this point? I just got back from Europe and they live a different lifestyle than we do. Their inflation rate has been much higher and I took advantage of the strong dollar, you know, being an American for that trip. You know, it's always in flux. And you know, in they live, like I said, a different lifestyle than we do. Everybody was driving the little cars and it got a good chuckle. I mean, to not see a truck, I did not see a pickup truck probably for three or four days, which is like I said, a different lifestyle and they're just used to these things. And it's a cycle that we all have to get through. And you know, prices move up, prices move down. That's what we do as traders is we take advantage of those price movements. But I think there's more pop when it comes to these energy prices, especially here in the winter time. Get a Gucci bag, a proud of bag. Curious to hear how you made this. Okay. I'm curious back here, the Strategic Prolete Petroleum Reserve. We're talking 1984 type levels. What are the implications? Again, it's nothing but psychology. You know, it's psychology and sentiment. And right now it's an interesting time for me as a trader. I have never seen the sentiment this negative. Now, you know, let's remember where we were in 2008. And you know, things were much, much different. We actually had a real financial crisis. Now we've got too many jobs and too few people. And you've got corporate profits and margins at record, record levels. So, you know, it's a disconnect. I think the average consumer, the average American is very concerned about the economy. But we're 70% off the COVID lows in the S&P and 20% off the highs. We made 70 some new all-time highs just last year low. So yeah, the market's taken a little bit of a break. But if you do it on a PD ratio, you know, we right now we're at 15. Think about what percentage that is off the high back in January. We're 30% off the high in the P.E. So stocks are cheap. At some people, at some point people are going to realize that. I just don't know when. All right, either do we. We've been trying to figure that out. Alan Nuckman, always great to have you. Thanks so much for stopping by. Thank you. All right, coming up next, you can book more than just transportation with Litt.

When we come back. It's time for triple play three stocks that we're watching in the final 35 minutes of trading. We have Generac lows, Uber and Lyft. Let's stick out with my pick start with my pick. I should say and that's Generac. It's a top trading ticker on Yahoo Finance. Stock today. Look at that. Falling through the lowest level that we've seen in two years on track for its biggest intraday drop ever. This comes after the company cut its full year outlook and announced pre-limbed third quarter results that missed big on both profit and sales. Now Generac cited disappointing residential sales as a headwind here for the company during the quarter. It now expects 2022 sales growth of between 22 and 24%. That's down from its prior estimate of 36 to 40% growth. Now some analysts weighing in here, JP Morgan's slashing its price target on this stock. We also key bank cutting its rating to sector perform from overweight and taking a look at that reaction today, Josh. Over 20% decline. It's a stock that's been under tremendous amount of pressure and really Wall Street trying to figure out exactly what's next. One thing that stuck out to me from the earnings call, Shawna, was that CEO Aaron Yagfeld kind of highlighted the standby generations demand is lagging where production is at right now. The reason it stuck out to me was because a short seller made that call backing June. So Spruce Capital Management said back then that demand wasn't quite where people thought for those generators and that Generac might actually been distracting the street a little bit with some of these acquisitions. They put a price target between 110 and 130 on the stock. Look at it today. It's sitting at $111. They were taking a little bit of a victory lap today on Twitter and talking about that. As they said. Yeah, look at that. That dropped 25%. No.",https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OFbNeKtIJNY,77,2022-10-19 19:27:35

Yeah look at that. 25% well guys my point today is lows companies ticker symbol L O W and you can see shares there falling about 5% on multiple downgrades from Wall Street analysts so B&P Parabas X and downgrading lows from neutral to underperform and Sleshing the price target from $227 down to $159 and Evercore is moving their stock from L Perform moving the stock from L perform to in line as well with a $110 price target analysts from both the firm citing an overall decline in the housing market Dave and kind of those rising mortgage rates as a potential headwind for lows Evercore writing in the note to clients slower demand a mid-disc and Dissinflation could push comms lower in 2023 making margin gains muted you can see low shares down about 30% You're to date and Dave I know you're constantly talking about those rising mortgage rates right we're seeing that starting to maybe Impact some of those housing stocks here. Yeah, we're gonna talk of my place at a two-for but there's a two-for with them because Home Depot right there They're down. Let's see right now three and a half percent so on the same news and people could talk about the declining numbers Josh, but it really is just frozen buyers and sellers are both sitting on the sideline everyone already did their home repairs During COVID so it is essentially just frozen with the notable exception of Florida Hurricane II they are seeing a real bump both lows and Home Depot because it's so many homes Destroyed that is the one notable exception my play as I mentioned also a two-for-its-a ride-hailing two-for-let's start with Uber now Targeting you and launching ads across the app for the first time while this represents a potentially Massive revenue opportunity experts say it could raise concerns about consumer privacy Previously most Uber ads had come over its Uber eats app General manager of Uber advertising saying recently cars will become our next living rooms We spend eight hours a week in a car so it's a huge opportunity Lift users also can now search reserve and pay for parking spaces directly from the app simply by tapping the steering wheel icon Bottom right corner of the home screen. This is a partnership between lift and spot hero if you're not where we are in New York In Chicago spot heroes how we all find discounted parking spaces Lift shares are down 70% near-to-date and about 2% today Uber fell as well But just about a half percent down 38% and just when I thought that was all there was more news Josh it was that Uber is testing tablets in San Francisco and Los Angeles of course to run ads I'm shocked it took this long for Uber to test a tablet We have maxed a cabs and maxed the cabs in New York which already do that right is that interesting where Uber is now following cabs I mean it's we have come for a circle one thing I want to say to on that lift thing Sean I think it's interesting is how much more they're going to get you on the app now right yeah Uber's so good at getting me on the app for Uber eats and things like that now with you're not even getting a ride But they're getting you back on that app that's a me is impressive innovation It is and it's really smart on their part We talked about the fact that they need to diversify their business model They need to find new avenues in terms of revenue and this is a smart play I think by them Dave you mentioned that 70% year-to-date drop it doesn't I guess it's more so I don't know how much the upside potential is but it's definitely not a downside risk I don't think teaming with with spot here are getting people to use or at more and more because I think the data has shown when you take a look at The ride at the ride numbers Uber clearly has the as the advantage here people tend to search Uber first before going to lift So if you get yourself more accustomed to using lift and pray and two pretty key markets I think it can be a huge opportunity for them and back to the ads real quick Uber's ad chief saying that he wants it to become a billion dollar plus business by 2024 so yeah, that's a hundred and forty million and twenty one though. That's almost ten X It is it is ambitious schools. They're laying it out there They needed to do something we've talked about the fact that they needed to be more innovative Two things that they're doing I think it's a step in the right time I just wanted to disagree with you guys on lift because why am I gonna look for parking space from the ride hailing app if I'm in Get if I'm not driving why do I say right now, but what are you gonna say two months from now after you've gone to it a few times Only if they link and give me some loyalty points.

Coming up, US Home Builder sentiment falling as mortgage rates rise, the CEO of the National Association of Home Builders fills us how the industry what lies ahead for that industry ahead. Get inflation under control is impacting the housing market. High mortgage rates leading to a decline in demand. US Home Building fell more than expected last month. Housing starts dropping with an 8% in September building permits up slightly at 1.4%. But one of the biggest laggards of 13% dropped in multi-unit projects. National Association of Home Builders, CEO Jerry Howard joins us now with more on all this data. Good to see you, sir. All this data continues to pour in showing essentially the same things. We're right around early 2020 levels. Right when the pandemic took hold, what concerns you the most about what's to come? Well, that's an interesting question. I think what concerns me the most is the failure of public policy makers to act to stem the tide of this housing recession. Virtually every reason that we are currently in a housing recession is tied directly to public policy, whether it's interest rates being raised. And by the way, those interest rates not only impact the housing consumer, they impact the builder at the front end of the pipeline as the cost of capital for the builders has gone up to get the loans to acquire the land, develop it and construct the homes. It's a double whammy on the cost of capital. We're still having labor problems. We've got to get...",https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OFbNeKtIJNY,79,2022-10-19 19:36:24
3694," get the loans to acquire the land, develop it and construct the homes. It's a double whammy on the cost of capital. We're still having labor problems. We've got to get our immigration situation fixed. We're still having supply chain problems as a hangover from the pandemic. And we're still having regulatory problems, whether it's regulations involving the importation of lumber from Canada, labor regulations, environmental regulations, or simply the reinstitution of the regulations that the Trump administration did away with. Right now, it's a perfect storm for housing. We're predicting that, well, this year, we'll be the first year since 2011, that we built fewer houses than we did the year before. We're worried about next year, not really looking for much of a turnaround until 24. That was the kitchen sink approach, right? But there, your colleague Jerry Conte, the chairman of the NHAB, said, quote, with inflation continuing to run above an 8% annual rate since March, it's truly disingenuous of President Biden to hail their progress on inflation without recognizing the cost of it. Do you agree with that sentiment and what can the President do to fix this situation? Well, in fact, we talked with the White House today. They assure us that they are taking the housing situation seriously. Obviously, we'll see what actions they take. This housing recession is being caused by inflation that is a direct result of a supply shortage. The administration can do everything that I just mentioned, correct all those, egregious policies, and make it easier to build homes that'll end the inflation. Jerry, let's start with labor. One of the things that you just cited in terms of some of the problems that you are facing. It's interesting because I was actually looking at a tweet from an economist that we've had on Yahoo Finance a number of times Diane Swank and she was saying that we could actually see job cuts from home builders because of the fact that the backlogs are declining and demands dropping. But it sounds like, at least from your perspective, that you still can't find the number of workers that you need. Is that right? When we are operating in a normal economic environment, we are woefully short of skilled labor. Obviously, when we're in a recession and building slows down, yeah, we're not in the same boat. But remember, housing has always led the country out of every recession since World War II. If we don't have labor, if we don't have a supply of building materials that can be counted upon to get there on time, we're not going to be able to lead the country out of a recession. And I don't know what other sector of the economy can do it. Someone has done it since, as I said, World War II. You mentioned a conversation with the White House. How did they push back on your recommendations and will housing lead us into a recession? Well, we're already in one. Housing is clearly in a recession right now. I believe, and I think that most economists are now starting to come around, that the likelihood of an overall recession is greater every day. Hopefully, and right now, I think people are saying it would be a shallow and a short lived one. But I think that, yeah, we're headed into an overall economic recession. I think the White House is very aware of what's going on. To the administration's credit, they noted that we had an affordable housing issue, and we also had a housing affordability issue, two distinct problems. They've noted that from the time they were campaigning, but I think the time to put it on the front burner, and that's what they need to do, is put housing on the front burner of all the domestic policies. Jerry, is this in terms of what is the biggest problem facing housing industry? Is it more of a demand problem? Is it more of a supply problem? What do you see at least right now today? Right now, it's probably about 50-50 interest rates have definitely driven demand down, but we still have a major supply problem, which is why, unlike during the Great Recession, when you saw a house prices completely plummet, there's sort of a buffer this time in that there's not enough of a supply for housing values to go all the way down into the tank. It's going to be a unique situation we're facing right now. But Jerry, by some respects, it's still relatively healthy because we're seeing...",https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OFbNeKtIJNY,80,2022-10-19 19:40:50
3695," Values to go all the way down into the tank. It's going to be a unique situation we're facing right now. But Jerry, by some respects, it's still relatively healthy because we're seeing prices still increase. It's just the rate of increases cooling. Where will prices get, too? Do you believe we're talking 2019 pre-pandemic levels? If they got there, that would be about as low as I think they get. All right, Jerry Howard, NAHB. Appreciate being with us, sir. Thank you. All right, coming up, a new study reveals how remote employees are spending the time they save by not having the commute to the office. Stick around. The international monetary funds, as policymakers should re-examine ETFs. The IMF reports saying, quote, ETFs can increase non-fundamental volatility in asset markets and amplify the sensitivity of cross-border capital flows to global financial conditions. Here to attempt to put that in layman's terms, Cynthia Murphy, ETF Think Tank Director of Research as part of our ETF report, brought to you by InvescoQQQ. Cynthia, can you put that in layman's? Should we re-examine ETFs? Seriously, what a mouthful. In the ETF world, we have gotten used to getting this dramatic language of the world is coming to an end. Anytime the markets perform poorly, ETFs get all of the bad rap. The problem ETFs face in situations like this, the trigger these reports. One is, it's just great headline making. I mean, seriously, everybody stopped for a second to look at this study. Second because...",https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OFbNeKtIJNY,81,2022-10-19 19:44:58
3696," In situations like this, the trigger these kinds of reports, one is it's just great headline make-em. I mean, seriously, everybody stopped for a second to look at this study. Second, because ETFs are trading vehicles. So when you're concerned about market action volatility, you immediately look for things that trade a lot and are the culprits of market volatility. In truth, from where we sit, this is a lot of unfair, but there's really nothing here. If you actually read the study, their biggest concern is mutual funds, not ETFs, because ETFs are actually great price discovery vehicles that allow people to understand what's going on in the market, react tactically, implement different things in a way that mutual funds can't. So mutual funds really are more of a risk in a crash than ETFs are, but ETFs always get the bad rap. But we've seen this a lot. We saw this in 2008, we see that every time there's a big market crash, there's the big headlines about ETF risk. Well, some they despite some of the bad rap that you're saying that the ETF industry gets, certainly it is a popular investment vehicle. You can tell that just simply by looking at the fund flow numbers. I do want to bring up though, the people that do have this appetite for investing in index funds or ETFs. There is a different way to go about that. And that of course is direct indexing. This is the other option that's out there at this point. I guess when you're trying to compare the two, what would you say are maybe the biggest differences when it comes to direct indexing versus ETF and what will make the most sense? Yes, so direct index is an interesting new trend. Intruth direct indexing is a really old concept is basically what separately managed accounts have done as a maze for high net worth clients. It's more of a story now really because of technology has evolved and developed in a way where direct indexing can be accessible now to everyone, which basically is ETF is a basket of stocks that are tracking an index for the most part, most of them are passive. Direct indexing or creating your own basket of stocks. The advantage of it relative to ETFs is just this idea that you can customize it. Customization is really the big story here. So say for example, you work for Cisco systems and you have a lot of company stock as a benefit of your job there. So do you want to own a ETF that's also heavily allocated to Cisco? Then you may have too much risk in that stock. So through direct indexing you can have a basket of stocks that you may have thrown ETF, but you can customize that position away. And that's in today easy to do through technology and most asset providers as a managers out there have either acquired that technology or developed their own so that you can actually start creating all these really customized portfolios at a retail level. Before you it takes a lot of assets, it requires an advisor, it can be cost prohibitive if you're only doing it in a thousand dollars, zero thousand dollars there, but technology has made this more mainstream. You know the other advantage of it is just the way you can tax manage your positions, which in ETFs truthfully ETFs are very tax efficient. So at the portfolio level, ETFs are doing a great job at tax loss harvesting, making sure they're constantly lowering the cost basis of the portfolio. I think last year less than 8% of all ETFs issued any capital gains. So ETFs are super tax efficient, but the argument goes at indirect indexing. You can take that to another level because you can do it at the single stock level yourself and really manage that tax exposure in a way. So the story really is, is it a replacement to ETFs? You know time will tell, I mean SMAs have existed forever. This is more of a mainstreaming of that concept, but it's really just another technologically enabled way to invest that has its pros and cons relative to what it else is out there today. All right, Cynthia Murphy, always great to get your perspective of ETF think tank director of research. Thanks so much. Well, with millions of Americans still working from home, a new study reveals what workers are doing with the time that they're saving on commuting and it's actually not works. So let's take a look at this. Those under 30, they're using their extra time to attend social events, eat out, exercise those over 30 in this report, spend more time and there's some of their extra time on childcare maintenance of their house.",https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OFbNeKtIJNY,82,2022-10-19 19:49:30
3697," A 10 social events, eat out, exercise those over 30 in this report, spend more time, and there are some of their extra time on childcare, maintenance of their house, meal prep. This is interesting here because I think one of the big arguments of working from home is yes, you want that flexibility, but you don't have to spend what, three in your case, four hours commuting to and from the office every day. And you can spend that time working more at home, but at least in this study from the New York Fed, it doesn't seem that that is exactly the case. It's not at all. But I think the bottom line is, and this study doesn't directly look into it, it doesn't appear that productivity is in fact going down. If anything, it seems to be a push, therefore giving workers more reason. The one thing that the two age groups had in common is more sleep, an hour extra of sleep across all age groups. And yes, my four hours of commuting is certainly taken, it's told a lot of things. But I think as we learned yesterday with where we are in terms of return to office levels, peaking pre pandemic, still below 50% just tells you, these workers, if they can show that they are every bit as productive, they are going to fight to remain some type of hybrid arrangement, which is what I think currently 30% of the workforce. Yeah, exactly. 15% are full time employees working fully remote, at least according to this survey. So it's a strong argument. I think you have to look at that productivity, that of course is key here. If they're as productive as they were in the office, and I don't think there's anything to be worried about, if in fact they're not and they're taking advantage and maybe slacking off a little bit, then that of course is an argument to get people back into the office. I do wonder about the trickle down of 60 million fewer hours commuting. How does that impact restaurants, bars, gas stations, things all the way down the economy? There's certainly some impact. Yeah, certainly a huge impact, you would think. All right, well, coming up next, the FDA giving Americans another option when it comes to mixing and matching COVID boosters. Take care.",https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OFbNeKtIJNY,83,2022-10-19 19:54:20
3698," The U.S. Food and Drug Administration on Wednesday granted emergency authorization to NOVA. meet on Tuesday at 1 a.m. M. not yet gotten a booster dose, so that's about 50% of the population Novavax says. And then there's also those that still remain unvaccinated that could use the booster in addition to a Novavax primary series or those who've already gotten a primary series. The FDA made sure to point out that this is an option for those who do not want to get an mRNA by-valent booster or those who cannot for medical reasons get a by-valent booster. And that is for the adult population only 18 and up. So that's a good news. I did get word from the company that they are working on getting data to the FDA that would possibly allow them to remove that caveat about a first dose and move into the market for second boosters as well. And Audrey, think this would be good news for the stock. However, it's down with a 4% why? Yeah, you would think, especially considering this vaccine as the first to really get the original formula to get that approval as a booster. But it seems like the investor market is still kind of if you on what the actual market is for the late entrance of Novavax. We spoke to Chief Commercial Officer John Trazino and here's what he had to say. We've got additional data coming that will relieve us of it just being the first dose. But let's remember that there is still 50% of people 18 years of age and above that have yet to receive their first dose. So there's a significant opportunity for us to make our vaccine available to those folks that have previously not wanted to get boosted or not wanted to be boosted with an mRNA vaccine. There's some doubt in the investment community about what the total global COVID marketplace looks like into the future. You know, there's a range of estimates anywhere from, you know, the low teens, 15 billion dollars of market size up to as much as 30 billion dollars of market size going forward. Trazino has also told me that while the US may seem to slow down in COVID uptake, vaccine uptake, they are still looking at the global market which they have had a little bit more success in. So based on the and energy they're seeing there and momentum they're seeing there, they do believe that going into next year, there's still going to be a strong market. Indeed, all right, Anthony, Kamalani. Thanks so much. Appreciate that. Coming up, we're counting down to the closing bell on Wall Street.

That comes from real estate, financials, health care, utilities, also materials and discretionary. All of those underperforming huge surge today upwards in the 13 week tea bill rate. All of this is pricing in an increasingly hawkish fed, no new news today. But apart from the course, you see a US dollar surging. Well, we see stocks ending the day and the red. Now, it is a mixed board here. We're seeing some special weakness here in Chinese stocks. And a lot of these have idiosyncratic risks because of what's going on with President G over there. But I have to say, a lot of these names have already been under a pressure, not looking for a bid definitely today. Here is the our component list. We can see 20 to down 3% square, down 6%. But you kind of get the picture. What has been happening today? So in Erning's land, we had Goldman Sachs this morning. That stock is down to 30% but heading into the bell here. We see more red. Then green, guys. All right, there. Now you're closing bell on Wall Street. Let's check out how the numbers closed for the day. A lot of red on the board, down about 100 points on the Dow. 25 or so on the S&P in the NASDAQ sliding also just less than 1%. All red. Close look at the broader market. Let's bring in a leo chief, UBS chief investment investor of emerging markets America's global wealth management and Mike Vogelzang, cap trust, CIO. Mike, anything to learn from the broader market action but more importantly earnings. We've seen a lot of earnings. But have you got any indication that indeed that recession that everyone's talking about is coming? Yeah, that's the sort of sword point that the market is fighting with right now. We've had the first 25% of the market down drop this year has been sort of valuation compression. As interest rates have risen, equity values have fallen. I think now the...",https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OFbNeKtIJNY,85,2022-10-19 20:02:37
3700," percent of the market down drop this year has been sort of valuation compression. As interest rates have risen, equity values have fallen. I think now the bears are sort of looking at at the likelihood or not of a earnings recession next year down 10, 15, 20 percent in earnings. If that comes through, I think we're going to get some more downside. But if we don't, if we can hang get earnings to hang in there, I think we actually might might have seen the bottom so at this point. So we'll see, but that's really the tug of war that's going on. And optimistic view there, Leho. What do you think? Do you agree? Have you seen the bottom? Look, I think the next three to six months are going to be quite challenging for risk assets. Until we see a clear indication that the Fed has reached a terminal rate, things are going to remain choppy, things are going to remain uncertain. We're positioning portfolios to protect against downside at the same time that we try to allow this portfolio to maintain exposure to medium to longer term upside. We do believe that earnings are likely going to compress in the US in the next 12 months on the in an environment of pretty depressed economic activity. And this is not fully priced in as we speak. So, Leho, what did you make then of those comments from Neil Kashkary that the Fed may have to push rates above 475? Look, I mean, this has been the story of the last 12 months, standing in January of this year, terminal rate was supposed to be zero. In March, one and a half, in June, 3%, in September, 4.5%. We're standing right now today with market pricing in a terminal rate of 5%. What are the balance of risks from this terminal rate levels expectations? I think they continue to be tilted to the upside. Therefore, the conclusion that the next three to six months are not going to be easy for investors. Mike, when you take a look at maybe that risk reward balance here in the markets, what makes sense at this point in the cycle? Where are you seeing, I guess, the most value right now when you're trying to figure out what to do with the portfolio? Yeah, it's a really difficult question in an equity portfolio today. I mean, obviously, the defensive sectors have held in beautifully. Energy is leading the way as I think it's the only sector up this year. The rule of trouble with earnings is so far they haven't fallen much as a block in the S&P 500. But that's because of equity, sorry, energy earnings are up so much. This quarter, I think, they're supposed to be up 115%. So without that, actually, the S&P is already beginning to fade earnings down 3%, 4% for this coming quarter if things continue to play out. So it's very clear, your decision as to whether or not you remain defensive. That is consumer staples and healthcare and potentially utilities, but particularly energy in this environment is really outlook on higher interest rates. I don't disagree with the leo. The point here is going to be the Fed is going to do what the Fed's going to do and they've been very clear about their discipline and the fight against inflation. So I think we simply take them at their word and assume it's going to be a fairly choppy market for a while. And if we do take them at their word, Leo, how do you position yourself? It's very well with what we've heard. We're talking about quality, defensive bias in portfolios. In equities, this means value, prefer to growth. It means defensive sectors such as consumer staples prefer to more cyclical sectors such as consumer discretionary. In fixed income, it means take credit risk responsibly, selectively remain in the shorter to intermediate spectrum of the duration side of the of the equation. In a way, handker down for at least a few months, but important message here is at the same time keep some exposure to the outside because we do think that 12 months from now, the investment environment is going to be much superior than it is today. My God, a lot of the focus here is on earnings. We're waiting for IBM and Tesla. Both of those are expected to cross now any minute. It's very, very early in the quarter in terms of what the earnings that we've gotten so far, but the number and the magnitude of the positive earnings and revenue surprises have been smaller than what we've seen in terms of recent averages. I guess do you expect that to continue? Where do you expect to see some of that outperformance? It's hard to hard to see how earnings are going to accelerate here, right above.",https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OFbNeKtIJNY,86,2022-10-19 20:06:54
3701," recent averages. I guess you expected that to continue. Where do you expect to see some of that outperformance? It's hard to hard to see how earnings are going to accelerate here, right above and beyond expectations. So it's not a surprise if we if we underperform expectations a bit. I'm we're reasonably happy with how it's coming so far with less than 15% of the S&P reporting. One of the things that's interesting to note under the surface is that, you know, revenues have actually been doing okay. They've been doing better than earnings earnings growth. That means margins are beginning to get squeezed by inflation. And I think you're going to see that more. The question is when revenue growth drives up as margins have already been begun to collapse a little bit, we expect to see some significant weakness in earnings going forward, particularly in 2023. So that's the dilemma. That's the question. And that's the point of the sort of being defensive hunkering down. The only worry we have about that outlook is that it's almost consensus in the market. There's not many people who don't expect the softening in the economy and not a lot of people who don't expect an earnings recession. So you're seeing all kinds of very, very interesting valuations in some of the deep cyclical names, whether it's housing, whether it's energy, frankly, you know, some retailers. They're just incredibly inexpensive. The market's clearly anticipating much, much worse news. It's coming. I think it makes some sense to have a little bit of that in your portfolio. All right, Mike Volga-Zang and Alayho Cherwonco. Thanks so much for joining us today, really appreciate it. All right, coming up, we're still waiting on Tesla earnings. We've got that for you when we come back. All right, an earnings alert. Now you can see Tesla shares down just",https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OFbNeKtIJNY,87,2022-10-19 20:11:01
3702," All right, an earnings alert. Now you can see Tesla shares down just over 3% after hours earnings are out. Yahoo! Fanat's senior auto reporter, Prasupramanian, has the numbers for us. Hey man, what are you seeing? Hey man, so yeah, it's knocked down a bit here. There was a miss on revenue, Q3 revenue, $21.45 billion that's a miss. They wanted to see $22.13 or thereabouts. Adjusted EPSB though, $105 versus $101 estimate. And then also the gap made income was $3.3 billion. That topped, estimates $3.2 billion, but it's that top-line revenue figure that's kind of weighing on the stock. They've also maintained their production outlook for the year of a 50% compound annual growth rate. So about, that would be about $1.4 million vehicles in 2022. That means they got to make around 500,000 vehicles in Q4, so that's kind of a stretch. We'll see if they can do that, but that's what they're saying with both do. One of here more about the demand story here tells us about how they're trying to basically increase production as much as they can in the letter. They talk about how we remain focused on increasing vehicle production as quickly as possible, increasing our weekly bill rate in Fremont and Shanghai and progressing steadily through the production ramps in Berlin and Texas. They also added in the shareholder that they see Berlin and both Texas with an in-salt capacity of around 250,000 vehicles or less. So we're seeing that. That's new. So I'm hoping to hear more tonight. Elon Musk will be on the call. We want to hear more about the Cybertruck production and also Tesla selling, which they see still kind of seeing deliveries happening in December 2022. Yes, certainly. That's look out to me, pros. The initial phase of semi deliveries on track to happen in just about two months. Again, on track for that 50% in average annual growth in deliveries. Dave, a couple of other things that stuck out to me in this report, logistics volatility supply chain bottlenecks, remaining immediate challenges here for Tesla. And also they're saying that they continue to believe that battery supply chain constraints will be the main limiting factor to EV market growth in the medium and longer term. So yes, things are improving, but still a number of headwinds do remain. We've heard a lot about that in terms of the supply chain, but really the story leading up has been about demand. They have repeatedly raised their prices several times in the last couple of months. And how will that impact demand around the world? How are the COVID lockdowns in China impact their their Shanghai factory? But a mixed report, but still say they are on track. It is remarkable to hear about the the semi do in December of 2022. And almost no one saw that coming, but a solid, certainly not spectacular report. All right. From more on this, you see the stock off just around 5%. We want to bring Craig Irwin. He's Rothcapital partners, a senior research analyst. Craig, I guess first just your reaction to the number, the stock off a lot of that. I would assume has to do with the revenue miss. Yeah. I know there was a little too much optimism about pricing the follow through from the pricing that was put in in the second quarter, lifting the top line and bringing that possibly in line with original expectations. You know, margins missed by what roughly 50 basis points, you know, clearly top line miss because of this. And you know, they put through the right amount of price to pass through the increased cost that they're seeing. They're they're not being greedy. They're pricing the vehicles appropriately such that they can sell them in volume in the market. The problem is they did they didn't miss by 19,000 in the quarter. And you know, I remember back in the day where 19,000 was a day dream for Tesla as far as delivery in a year. But that's not what counts now. They missed and expectations were too high. Carl's coming up at 530 Eastern time. Biggest question. Oh my gosh. I think the biggest question for investors is how much Twitter, how much stock does he have to sell to fund his Twitter acquisition? I mean, kind of depends where he parked his cash, right? You know, 15 million a sold. You know, he could have done well or he could have done not so well. And you know, it could be anywhere between $5 and $10 billion with the potential equity sales. That I think is is really going to weigh on sentiment for investors until we get clarity. Other than that, the guide for units in the fourth quarter is going to be incredibly important. They should be approaching 2 million units in production rate, exiting the year with both Austin.",https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OFbNeKtIJNY,88,2022-10-19 20:15:31
3703," Other than that, the guide for the units in the fourth quarter is going to be incredibly important. They should be approaching two million units in production rate exiting the year with both Austin and Berlin ramping. That's a phenomenal production rate. We've got to see the demand there and the confidence that they could serve that demand. That'll also have a big impact on the stock. To talk about the stock though, I think the bigger impacts exiting this year, things like Porsche, success at companies like Polestar and obviously the upcoming Ford spin-off. Those are really impacting investor sentiment as they look at things that are potentially much better valued with that similar or maybe even more attractive growth prospects. Great. Let's talk about pricing power because Tesla's cars sold for an average of $57,000 in Q3 up from 49,000 just a year ago. They have been able to pass along those higher prices to consumers. As you mentioned, the demand aspect of this, any worry that that's no longer going to be the case if we do see a bigger slowdown? I'm not worried about demand. I see EVs as inevitable. I think EVs are going to be an increasing mix of transportation no matter what. No matter what we have to do for price because of the technology integration of vehicles. I may be a bear, a loud voice bear on Tesla, but I actually drive an EV. I think the momentum in the market is real Tesla is the category king. And that makes it a difficult path for them that needs to blaze when so many very well-resourced companies are coming right behind them. So the shares are still down 45% year to date and down almost 20% since they slightly misdeliveries. What's the next catalyst to get that stock moving in that direction? And how significant is the Tesla semi, which we just mentioned, begin delivery in December? Honestly, I see the Tesla semi almost as a bad joke because the battery in there, the more range you need on this thing, the bigger battery you have to have, the less cargo you have. So it's cash 22. Either you have range or you have cargo, that's the business model of a semi is to have cargo. So I see that as a much better match for hydrogen. If people really want an advanced drive train technology, I don't know. I mean, I've met with a man that's the largest piece of the Tesla order book. I think there's going to be a very realistic calibration of these vehicles after they're brought online, after they're commissioned. And the actual sales rate might end up disappointing versus what some of the more aggressive bulls would imagine on this. On this vehicle. Okay, let's talk about supply chain because it was one of the bottom supply chain bottlenecks and remaining a immediate challenge. That's what Tesla said in its earnings release. I'm curious from your checks, just improvement that we have seen there. They did know that that they are seeing some improvement. I guess how much improvement are we seeing and how long do you think it's going to be until we're able to resolve these issues? So it keeps the supply chain for Tesla is actually wolf speed. Wolf speed had been a little bit behind on their on their wafer deliveries to both SD micro non-semi. I think some of the upside we've seen a wolf speed over the last two quarters has come from the catch up. As they've brought on additional manufacturing capabilities and six-inch and wafering capabilities there. So that I see as a key component there. Obviously connectors can be a major headache. It can even just be harnesses that you outsource these days. So it doesn't have to be an exotic high technology piece of the build. And everybody's having these problems. Nobody's immune. But I would say that I think Tesla is probably doing one of the best jobs of the companies in the market as far as managing their supply chain. It's stock off just around 3.5 percent on that revenue miss. At Craig Irwin, great to have you. Thanks so much for joining us. Thank you. Are we have earnings results? Keep rolling in IBM out with their quarterly numbers. Do I have a look? Yes, that's right. And you can see the stock up almost so well is up 4 percent. And after I was trading that's after third quarter results showing a beat on top line revenue. $14.11 billion. Beating the street estimate by about half a billion dollars. $13.53 billion. That number is up 6.5 percent year over year. Adjusted gross margin coming at 53.8 percent. That best the estimate of 55.3 percent.",https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OFbNeKtIJNY,89,2022-10-19 20:19:53
3704," 3 billion that number is up 6.5% year over year. Adjusted gross margin coming at 53.8% that best the estimate of 55.3% Operating EPS this is that bottom line number 1.1. And that exactly meets the estimate of a dollar 81 as well. Free cash flow ending the quarter a little bit light at 752 million the estimate was for quite a bit higher 2.76 billion In terms of their full year forecast they are seeing constant currency revenue growth above the mid single digit model And then previously they saw it at the high end of this mid single digit model still seeing free cash flow of about 10 billion dollars The estimate was for 10.04 billion oh four billion so we're going to call that in line and then gap results include the impact of a one-time Non cash pension settlement charge of 5.9 billion dollars and that is 4.4 billion net of tax I do have a quote from the CEO and chairman arvin krischna He said IBM delivered strong revenue growth in the quarter reflecting our continued focus on the execution of our strategy globally clients view technology as an opportunity to enhance their business which is evidence in the results across the portfolio With our year-to-day performance we now expect full year revenue growth above our mid single digit model and Just pointing out too at mid October the foreign exchange rates currency They're expected to be about a seven point headwind so that is a big headwind because by the US dollar Just want to show you a chart real quick. This is the over the last year. This is IBM stock You can see very choppy here although ending on the lower end of the range on the 20 year view also pretty low here But breaking out recently from that very long trend line there guys Yes, certainly and they have outperformed some of their peers at least when you take a look When you align up IBM against some of the larger tech players as of lay pretty strong results here That's why we're seeing that the stock pop Jared like you were just saying after hours in terms of they also Alifted their full year revenue guidance so revenue for the quarter. They'll come in at 14.1 billion in Dave I was able to uh I spoke with Gary Cohen the vice chairman of IBM earlier this week and we were talking about the chips act And I bring that up because it's so central to so many of these players and he was saying that the rollout is going well It's a little bit slower although that had been Anticipated IBM was one of the companies that did come out with an announcement They announced 20 billion dollar commitment to their new york state facilities They're he also went on to say that there is leverage in the system now the big problem that they face is just in terms of speeding up the Permitting process. That's what the government is facing right now But it will be interesting if we do hear any more commentary on that and the impact of the chips act not only on IBM But really on the sector at large here during this earnings call that was that we'll get underway later this afternoon chips act has certainly not been the catalyst that many thought it would be going all the way back to when that was first passed Let alone The recent action and really surprising to see the numbers given the strength of the dollar because they had said Commentary leading up that they expect the strengthening dollar to be a massive headwind and cut down So really when you take into in the context all the issues they're facing and all the headwinds a pretty darn good report And that's why you see after hours up about 3.7% After a beat there for IBM up next we'll get analyst reaction to these numbers from IBM after the break",https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OFbNeKtIJNY,90,2022-10-19 20:24:13
3705," Music Music Music Music Music Music Music Music Music Music Music Music Music Music Music Music Music Music Music Music Music Music Music Music Music Music Music Music your reaction? I reaction as I think this was better than a lot of people were expecting. I think in the lead in you were talking about the potential for currency headwinds. Those were definitely present, but I think people admitted and anticipated those challenges. Notwithstanding that, you're looking at a normalized revenue growth rate approaching double digits, which I think for IBM is probably something that people didn't anticipate. And this is also something that they signaled could very well continue. So overall, I think people are probably encouraged by the growth not only on a corporate level, but by the constituent businesses that the company now is focusing on. And Scott, when you take a look at IBM, its performance has certainly been a steady performer compared to some of those other larger tech firms, the guidance, the up their revenue guidance here for the year. When you look out, pass the current quarter and into 2023. Do you think they're going to be able to maintain that outperformance? Well, look, I mean, I think over the last, I don't know, number of months, maybe a couple of quarters, people have looked to IBM as kind of a safe haven. But not for the reasons that you might think. I think this has historically been a company that's been, you know, at best a mature growth company and at worst, a no growth company. And it's really at this point kind of a low to slow growth company, but when growth globally, when we're talking about global economies, global markets, global demand, it doesn't seem quite so disadvantageous. And in fact, they have a stable kind of customer and revenue base. And so the revenue has remained largely stable, actually, even outperforming as we've been talking about, whereas in other cases where you're talking about high growth companies potentially being impacted by these global headwinds, that's something that I think people have been thinking about and focusing on as it pertains to IBM. They spend more than $100 billion in remaking this company over the past decade. Where has that been the most success? Yeah, I mean, I think it's a good point. I think the company's market cap is only slightly.",https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OFbNeKtIJNY,91,2022-10-19 20:28:14
3706," over the past decade. Where has that been the most success? Yeah, I mean, I think it's a good point. I think the company's market cap is only slightly over $100 billion at this point. And if you think about what they've been focusing on, they've been focusing on handful of things, right? They've been focusing on software, IT consulting, and cloud. And one of the things that we've been told by the experts that we talk to day in and day out is their orientation to being multi-cloud. That being that they can work with whatever cloud environment, a client wants to work with, that actually is very appealing, given all the different choices and all the different technologies, and frankly, all the different options that IBM can fit into. That's something that works really well in an environment where people are looking to make difficult choices. Scott, when you take a look at some of the underperformance or maybe the headwinds that the chip makers are facing, at least in the near term we've heard from a number of companies just about falling demand, yet when you take a longer term look at it, there certainly seems to be this optimistic of you, and you're seeing that by a number of investments that have been made over the last several weeks or announcements, I should say, they have been made by IBM and some of its competitors out there. I guess how do these companies balance that trouble here in the short term, but then also make sure that they have enough invested to capitalize on that long term success? I mean, it's really hard sometimes to not focus on the short term disruptions when it comes to macro conditions, right? And I think all of these companies are dealing with those realities, and we're going to see indications of those loud and clear I would imagine over the coming days and weeks as the reporting results and providing guidance. That being said, historically it's been my experience that those companies that can kind of see through that fog, that uncertainty, those more troubled times, to make investments are the companies that benefit on the other side of those issues. And so companies like IBM that have large kind of financial flexibility and balance sheets are able to do those types of things. And it's my sense that IBM very much has a long-term view, and if they make the right types of investments, they could be one of those winners when it comes to investment now benefiting later. The calls in about 30 minutes, your biggest question? I mean, I think my biggest question is what the single biggest contributors to the upside and revenue were. There are a lot of different categories that IBM has been focusing on, that they've been highlighting, but I'd want them to get very specific on where the upside came from. And then the follow-up would be, how sustainable is that kind of outperformance? And what shall we be expecting, given 2023 is anticipated to be a pretty tough year? All right, Scott Kessler, great to get your perspective here. Again, IBM shares moving to the upside after it's up just around 3% on that piece. Higher inflation is hurting Americans when it comes to things like consumer prices and mortgage loans, but see where it will be helping next. 잼 E This is the first time I've ever been in a car like this.

3707," AD. One more way inflation is impacting you, your taxes, but it might not be in the way you think. The IRS announcing it's raising both the standard deduction and the income thresholds where tax rate take effect for the year 2023. Basically means because of the price increases Americans are seeing, they'll be able to shield more of their income from taxes. Let's start with the standard deduction. Climbing to 27,700 for couples, that's an increase of $1800 from this year for individuals and increase of $900 to $13,850. Tax brackets are also seeing an adjustment of about 7%. Here are a couple of examples. The top marginal tax rate of 37% will apply to individual income above 578,125 and married couples income above $693,750 next year. The 32% rate. That applies to those with incomes over $182,100 or married couples with income of $364,200. The 22% rate will go to those with incomes over $44,725 or $89,450 for married couples filing jointly. Some other ways inflation will impact taxes. The earned income tax credit will increase. The alternative minimum tax EMT amount is increasing and the benefits for tax-free public transit and parking costs will rise to a maximum of $300 a month for commuters that's up 20 bucks from this year. John? All right. Well, midterm elections are about three weeks away in Wall Street, a standing buy to see which party will control the House and the Senate. Now, Edelman Financial Engines recently publishing a study on how markets perform based on the balance of power on Capitol Hill. We want to bring in Isabelle Barrow, a director of Financial Planning at Edelman here to break down this report in. Isabelle, let's take a look at some of these different scenarios here that you guys took to when you took a look at this data. We know there's going to be a Democrat in the White House. So let's start with if the Democrats are able to hang on to both the House and the Senate. What does that mean for the market? Well, overall, we know that politics is a very passionate topic and it can make people act emotionally. We tend to be emotional out so many things when it comes to our money. It may be market volatility, inflation, world events, but ultimately it's best to keep your emotions about those political outcomes out of your investing decisions. So what we like to tell our clients is money is green. It's not red or blue. So in this study at Edelman Financial Engines.",https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OFbNeKtIJNY,93,2022-10-19 20:37:06
3708," decisions. So what we like to tell our clients is money is green, it's not red or blue. So in this study at Edelman Financial Engines, we looked at how the S&P performed under different administrations and political parties from 1948 through 2021. And we analyzed eight possible combinations of control that could have existed in the White House and the two houses of Congress during that period. And ultimately what we found was that no political party substantially impacted long-term market returns. And is about what we hear repeatedly on this show and every show, is that the markets like divided government, do the numbers bear that out? It's true. You know, like I said, no political party has substantially impacted long-term market returns. So for example, when Democrats controlled all three areas, the S&P produced an average annual return of about 15.1%. Under Republicans, it was about 15.9%. Both of which returns are far above the average return. If you had invested, however, $100,000 in 1947 and kept it invested through 2021 only when one party was in the Oble Office, the best return you would have had would be about $3.7 million. So from 47 through 2021, $100,000 grew to $3.7 million. It's not bad. But if you had stayed invested through the entire time, regardless of which party was in power, regardless of the mix of Democrat, Republican Democrat, and this chart you're showing, you would have had more than $31 million over that same period of time. So if you're focused on just who's in the White House, you know, you're missing out on in this case, what would have been around $27, $28 million over that period of time? So is it well done from an investor's perspective? I guess should people be doing anything different with their portfolios or just simply keeping everything the same? Well, ultimately, you know, what the study shows us is that the economy drives the markets long-term. It's not elections. So politics is just one of like thousands of things that are impacting the economy. There are so many factors. It's, you know, not just, and it's not just the markets. It's the Fed, geopolitical events, the market cycle, I mean, pandemics. So what we need to remember as investors is it's best to stay neutral when it comes to our money as it relates to politics or timing the market. So ultimately, don't let the politics dictate your portfolio because politics and investing don't mix. You can change your investment strategy based on all of the other issues within the economy that, you know, are helping to influence those decisions, but don't let it be for one thing like just investment results. So keep your eyes focused on your long-term goals, keep separate, keep separate, fact from fiction when it comes to elections in your portfolio. And it's essential to keep in mind that no outcome of this year's midterm elections will hurt your portfolio more than making that decision based on just the emotion behind it instead of focusing on your long-term plan. But remember the old saying, it's time in the market, not time in the market, and that relates to politics as well. But if you're picking policies when it comes to taxes and regulations, those things certainly are impacted by which parties in control, right? Well, and so that's a little bit of a separate conversation, I think, because what we're talking about in that case is more related to your personal financial economy, your personal economy, your own, you know, your own long-term objectives and how that, how that impacts your financial plan. What I'm talking about and what this study was really focused on is how the political environment impacts the stock market. So yeah, if you're talking about policy, policy can impact us in so many other ways other than just our investments. But if we're focusing on the market, that's what this study showed was that ultimately, who's in power is not what dictates those market returns.

3709," Worried about the green? Not the red, not the blue. Edelman's Isabel Barrel. Really appreciate that breakdown. Thank you. Coming up, Cannes is looking to make a splash with its cannabis-infused cocktails. But first, they have to deal with a patchwork of state laws that regulate cannabis products. And the company's founders joins us to discuss. Go ahead. Hurry! I'm going to do a little bit more. I'm going to do a little bit more. I'm going to do a little bit more. I'm going to do a little bit more. I'm going to do a little bit more. All right, assign marijuana to be going mainstream green thumb industry, signing a deal with circle cake convenience stores to sell licensed marijuana at its gas stations in Florida. The effort will start with 10 stations in the state and green thumb locations will be branded Rise Express with a separate entrance from the store now because marijuana is not recreationally legal in Florida. Purchases at the store will be restricted to residents who have medical marijuana cards. Terms of the deal were not disclosed but green thumb shares did jump more than 3% on this news. Definitely a sign that we are changing. Circle K, just the latest expansion of the cannabis industry. You can get it in all types of forms and you can get it in 19 states recreationally. One of the forms that is the hottest seller in this country includes beverages. Currently the fastest growing segment there. Luke Anderson is the co-founder of the Cannes Social Tonic. That is the best selling THC beverage in the country surpassing 10 million cans sold. Luke, good to see you man. Good to see you too. Kind of felt mainstream when you hit the New York Times with an article all about cannabis drinks with the question, are they safe? So you answer that question. There's not a lot of knowledge. There's not a lot of research. Are they safe? I think the better question is alcohol safe. I think they point a finger at cannabis beverages.",https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OFbNeKtIJNY,95,2022-10-19 20:45:49
3710," that question. There's not a lot of knowledge, there's not a lot of research, are they safe? I think the better question is alcohol safe. I think they point a finger at cannabis beverages as a buzzy alcohol substitute, but they're ignoring the bigger issue, which is trunk driving, domestic violence, the health and wellness issues that alcohol, which is just so apologize for, and advertised so freely, I think that cannabis beverages are absolutely safer than alcohol. Interesting point. What do you want to educate people on them? First off, how do they react differently than alcohol? Well, the other thing that the New York Times piece missed is there are so many different types of cannabis beverages. Can, which is the lowest dosage on the market, two milligrams of THC. It's a product you can drink and it has a similar intensity of effect to light beer or glass wine. There are 100 milligram THC beverages that for an uninitiated consumer, those are dangerous, but because the category is so new, they're all lumped together and sometimes people even think CBD beverages, which don't have an intoxicating effect, are put in that same category. And you think CBD beverages are effective or placebo? I think they're about as effective as a spirulina smoothie, and I think that because it's a three-letter acronym, it's a cannabinoid, there was a lot of confusion. Consumers thought when there were big CBD beverage marketing campaigns a couple of years ago, is this an alcohol substitute? But it does not get you a buzz because it does not have the THC. A study said that more than half of the cannabis beverages purchased in 21 were of the 100 milligram variety Jones soda just came out with 100 milligrams. Yesterday, how do you feel about that segment? Per dollar sales, the 100 milligram beverages are absolutely where the market is today. But if you look at the units and you see these cans here, one unit is six cans. So if you look at a per unit measure, low dose products are actually far outpacing because for every unit that people are buying, you're actually getting six drinks. And we think that that's going to continue to accelerate. The overall cannabis market's growing 30%, beverages are growing 50%, we grew in that same time period last 12 months, 150%. Why? I think it's because we're attacking the mainstream consumer. 80% of adults wants to drink less booze. We are the only product on the market that's safe enough for someone who's trading alcohol with a cannabis beverage to consume without fear of being too intoxicated. So it's a real category expander. The people who are buying can, sometimes it's their first ever cannabis purchase. Sometimes it's their first trip to a dispensary. And we think that's powerful. We think that the growth of the cannabis market relies on welcoming new consumers with something safe. You say you're going 150% yet a patchwork of state laws must make it exponentially more difficult to operate. Absolutely. We have to build a manufacturing facility in every single state we're in. So expanding from California to Nevada to Arizona, we can't move product across state lines. And the packaging looks different because local regulations indicate that it has to. We're also available in Massachusetts and in Illinois with the THC product. But we do have an unspiked product which is available nationwide. You can order it online but no THC, no CBD, just a good tasting drug. Is that selling comparatively? It's a 10% of our overall business, but we don't really market it. It's more for people who want to try can, at least the flavor, and they're not available in the state that they're in. You have some celebrity endorsers, Gwen, if Paul Trollmost notably, who is your target audience? Our target audience is the healthy hedonist. And our celebrity endorsements and we have 35. So they span ages, genders, sexualities. There's no real demographic here that describes someone who wants to drink less booze and switch to cannabis. It's just a desire to be healthy, but you still want to have a little fun. And so we've partnered with a bunch of athletes, actors, musicians, YouTube creators, and we use their celebrity to drive awareness of the brand. And it's an army of people who really just believe in it and they invested with their own money. So it's not like we're paying them a ton of money to do a puff piece. It's just they're part owners of the business. Biggest news to come out of cannabis lately was President Biden with these pardons that some felt was largely symbolic because federally not many were arrested on possession, but reexamining schedule one. How optimistic are you based on that and about federal legalization? I tell you what, it would be a very popular move to legalize. And I think Biden stands to gain a lot by accelerating the progress on rescheduling, descheduling, and eventually...",https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OFbNeKtIJNY,96,2022-10-19 20:50:16
3711," I tell you what, it would be a very popular move to legalize. And I think Biden stands to gain a lot by accelerating the progress on rescheduling, descheduling, and eventually decriminalization, expungement, full legalization. But it's a very complicated process. It'll probably take years. We're building this business as if it could be 2028. And so investors are betting on the dream and the long-term vision, not a short-term outcome. How far are we from drinking these in a restaurant or a bar? Great thing you asked. We actually can do it today in Minnesota. I don't know if you saw, but Minnesota accidentally legalized THC and fuse beverages under a certain threshold. So can is able to be sold in convenience stores just like green thumb and circle K. Those would be adjacent partnerships. Can in Minnesota you can buy convenience stores, grocery, and on-premise consumption? Wow, fascinating. Luke Anderson, co-founder of Can, social ton, a good to see, man. Thank you. Thank you. Shana. All right, David, let's take a look at some of these after hours, movers here. We have Tesla, IBM, Las Vegas, ANS, and LAM research. Let's kick it off with Tesla, the stock here after hours. You can see still under pressure off just around 3.5% mixed results here from the company revenue coming in just a bit late at 21.45 billion. EPS though, better than expected, a dollar and five cents, a company reaffirming. Their delivery target saying that they still see 50% average annual growth in deliveries. They also mentioned that they expect the initial phase of semi deliveries to begin in December just two months from now. Logistics, volatility, supply chain bottlenecks remaining immediate challenges here for the company. Over the past three months, the stock still in the red off just around 9.5% year-to-date. You can see that bigger move here to the downside off just around 36%. All right, let's pull up IBM here. The stock actually popping after hour, strong results here from the company, is again just around a five and a half percent revenue coming in. 14.1 billion. The street was expecting 13.5 billion EPS of a dollar 81 red hat revenue up at 12% here. The company also returning $1.5 billion to shareholders. They also lifted their full year revenue guidance on the three-month basis down 6% so when you compare it to the broader market, IBM has actually been fairing pretty well on a year-to-date basis. This year looking at just an 8% drop. Let's move on to Las Vegas, San, you can see the stock. Not moving a lot here after hour is actually exactly a flap, but we did get some results here from the company revenue just better than expected at 1.01 billion. They did, though, report a wider than expected loss of companies saying that travel restrictions reduced visitation, obviously impacting financial results still. CEO Rob Goldstein, though, was pretty optimistic. He said, quote, he is confident in the recovery of travel and tourism spending year-to-date stock off just around a five percent. Over the past three months, though, we have seen a bit of a recovery, if you can call that, the stock just holding on two gains up just around two tenths of a percent. Let's round it out with lamb research. That's a chipmaker here reporting $5.07 billion in revenue that was better than what the street was looking for. We also beat here on a just an EPS of $10.42, CEO Tim Marterson, a solid execution, also using supply chain constraints as helping the company produce strong overall performance over the past three months. Just around 26 percent. We know that lamb research is far from the only semiconductor that has been under pressure over the last several months. Year-to-date, you're still looking at the stock off just around 54 percent. Dave? Now thank you, all right, we're watching the airline sector. Tomorrow we'll be getting earnings from Alaska and American Airlines. The results come on the heels of very strong numbers in the last week from both Delta Airlines and United Airlines. Just last week, American raised its third quarter revenue guidance to a gain of 13 percent from 2019 levels. The expectation for Alaska earnings of $2.39 per share on revenue of $2.8 billion. There's a very strong sector despite prices up 8 percent month to month with a 40 percent year over year strong demand from both United and Delta.

3717," Shares of Chipotle of Sky Rock and since Brian Nookle took over a CEO all the way back in March of 2018, before he had the company though he was a recent college grad working at Proctor and Gamble, the road of his career caught the attention of our Brian Saasie and that's where he find his stake day. Brian's got to stick together, is that what it is? It's something like that, you see me slew thing, I'm still going over all the transcripts from all markets some had earlier in this week. I'm trying to pick up things that maybe I missed and investors should know about these leaders. I happen to think it is very important that investors know about the people leading the companies that they are invested in. But Brian Nichol, believe or not, started working at Proctor and Gamble on scope mouth watch. Here's story. You never really know where your journey is going to go, but I was very fortunate to get my first job at Proctor and Gamble. I got to work with a lot of great people. They took the time to invest in me so that I became much better at marketing and general management skills. I've taken that with me down the road and here I am at Chipotle. One thing I did discover a while is at the opportunity to work on Pringles is I loved working in the space of food. It just resonated with me. So fast forward here we are today. I still strongly encourage you to scope mouth watch. Obviously I'm a much bigger fan of Blockamolly and Burritos these days. Yeah, just an interesting there, little nugget. My experience has been just talking to a lot of many leaders for many years. Proctor and Gamble and PepsiCo, they just turn out a ton of top executives. There's something about those processes at those older companies, whether it's in the market, how they teach marketing, how they teach leadership. I can't tell you how many people get poached from those organizations to work at mid-level positions and ultimately end up in a CEO job like Brian Nichol. I look at two names, two people that I've gotten to know through the years. That's Chip Berg, the CEO of Levi's. He created the Swiffer device, over at Proctor Gamble and then Clorox CEO, Beno Dora, or former CEO, I should say. He worked at Proctor Gamble as well and he ended up at Clorox. It's just interesting to see the journey for a lot of these executives. But my take here is that it is very important as an investor. Do a search on the internet, see how these company leaders grew up, where they work, where they work, what have they done, pull up their LinkedIn profile and the information is right there. Start putting two and two together. I think it will go a long way to explain why companies are doing good and then why companies may be doing bad. That's really encouraging. Especially for a person like myself whose background was in marketing before getting more into the sales side and the integration and of course they go one and the same and one faster or another. Hearing that about Brian Nichol and the CPG side of his background too, really gives you some insight into how he thinks about the behavioral construct of the consumer and how that's ever changing and what he's navigating Chipotle through with that too now. Yeah and there's no disrespect to Chipotle. This is a restaurant operation increasingly becoming global over 3,000 restaurants. When you work on a global brand like a Pringles and have those complicated operations, that is an incredible experience. So ultimately take over and for him he went to young brands, spent many years at young brands, created the Liv Moss Logan while Taco Bell. And ultimately using all those skills that he learned at Procter and Gamble and now he's putting it all to play over at Chipotle. Oh, that's remarkable. All right, well I ordered one of the burritos. Well the burrito bowl influenced by of course Brian Sasi and broke the palm of the chest. You only got one now. Oh, but I doubled the meat. I doubled the meat. I did double the meat. Yeah, I did. All right, by the way Brad remembered he does have his own Netflix account. This is true. Update on the financials folks. I'm in the financials folks. I mean there's names. And there's names for it. Big time. Guys coming up, if you're in the market to buy a house, we've got some breaking news just for you. We hope it's good. It's on the other side of the show for you. Yeah. Yeah.",https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TFE9bMjrlhU,1,2022-10-20 13:58:21
3718," facile..... Welcome back to OutFiance. I'm Brian Sousy alongside Julie Hyman and Brad Smith. You have some, we will have soon surely some breaking news on existing home sales but Julie over to you right now we're seeing the markets up ahead of that news. Yeah we have it and it looks like it's pretty much in line with estimates here existing home sales coming in annual pace of 4.71 million. It is a decline month over month of about one and a half percent. We also by the way got the index of leading economic indicators down about four tenths of one percent but there's been a lot of attention on the housing market. We also by the way just got the news from Freddie Mac about the average 30 year fixed mortgage rate rising to 6.94 percent and it's obvious the effect that is having when you look at that existing home sales number and the declines that we are seeing there is that higher interest rates are having an effect on the ability of people to buy homes here eighth straight month that we saw the existing home sales number decline. That is the longest declining streak that we have seen since 2007 and obviously 2007 was when we were beginning to see the housing collapse and the beginnings of the great financial crisis and so interesting here that we are seeing that even though most predictions are not for something similar to happen this time around because the tendrils of the housing market and the capitalization of the banks and other lenders is in a different stage now than it was at that point in time. So all of that said this does show the sort of continuation of the waning housing market partly as a result of higher rates. Yeah let too.",https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TFE9bMjrlhU,2,2022-10-20 14:02:51
3719," All of that said this does show the sort of continuation of the waning housing market Partly as a result of higher rates. Yeah, I'll add to I believe was yesterday Just tracking some redfin data that they report on housing. They noted in September 60,000 deals were called off so that was you could see that that slowed down redfin has been reporting some some very good stats on this It's gonna be a question too of where there's gonna be supply that continues to come on the market whether that's on the new homes front and actually being able To complete some of those projects, but then also on the existing side if you have put prospective sellers that are now looking at the market and saying where we're gonna find buyers Then that's still gonna have a contraction in the supply that's actually coming through and so that is a particular risk in the near term as well Even as the rates are rising and compressing the amount of buyers that are prospectively out there the sellers the cell side of the equation That's also still seeing its own Looking across the market and saying all right. Well, why would we list our house now if there's not gonna be people who are able to bid on it right now at this price Yeah, and to your point the number of homes for sale declined to 1.25 million in September from 1.28 million in August So we continue to see that number go down a little bit in the meantime regional Fed officials out recently with some comments on Fed Policy I'll find it's Jen Schomburger has the details we heard from the likes of James Bullard Good morning. That's right Julie St. Louis Fed president James Bullard says he expects the Fed to end Frontloading aggressive interest rate hikes by sometime early next year, but still maintain an aggressive policy stance Now Bullard who made these comments in a Bloomberg TV interview Wednesday suggested he doesn't need to see rate pushed higher Then that 4.5 to 5% range currently projected by the committee Bloomberg Bullard told Bloomberg rather he thinks next year the Fed will be closer to running what he calls quote ordinary monetary policy He said the Fed is at the right level of policy rate to full inflation and can adjust as the data come in now These comments coming as the Fed has said it will be appropriate at some point to slow down the pace of interest rate hikes and Assess what the current rate hikes impact has already had on the economy elsewhere Minneapolis Fed president Neil Cash Carrey said that the Fed could potentially pause interest rate hikes sometime next year if inflation cools Cash Carrey Carrey told travelers Institute that he thinks inflation will level out over the next few months But underscored he doesn't yet the evidence that core prices which of course exclude volatile food and energy costs are moderating Now these are some of the last comments from Fed officials on monetary policy before we go into that so-called Black out period ahead of the Fed's next next interest rate policy meeting and less than two weeks Fed officials widely expected to raise that benchmark interest rate by 75 basis points again for the fourth meeting in a row guys Is there any inclination to or anything that we can extrapolate from Bullards comments? Especially as we were just talking about the housing market as well Bullard seemed to be acknowledging at least of the equation there and what the housing market represents or does not represent but is there a clear sense of how the Fed will continue to monitor housing particularly even as they're going along in their policy pathway Well two points there obviously on the housing front That is the one that has been most sensitive to the interest rate heights and is seeing the cooling Fed officials are still waiting for those rate high risks on the housing front And other interest rate sensitive sectors. They're still waiting for that to filter through now I think there was sort of an understanding from the market that perhaps the Fed to get even more hawkish on the back of an increase in Core inflation on the CPI reading that we got last week moving up to six points that Percent in September from six point three in August, but what Bullard is towing the line here saying look I think that our industry projections are the correct path policy path for right now And that's exactly what Mary Dalley told me last week as well So perhaps that could give investors some solace that the Fed still looking at that range of four and a half to five percent as the peak rate on the Fed funds rate All right, go finance his own Gen Sean burger Gen.

3720," after 5% as the peak rate on the Fed funds rate. All right, go finance his own, Jen Schomburger. Jen, thanks so much for breaking this all down. The Bullard commentary and where this all sits well, or not so well with the markets. Let's continue the conversation on markets with an eye to what fiscal and economic policies have worked and what hasn't in the past. Our next guest is out with a new book called a monetary fiscal history of the United States. Jenny, as now we've got Alan Blender, who is the Princeton University professor of economics and public affairs. Alan, great to have you here with us this morning. First, you just heard some of the comments from Fed, Representative Bullard, James Bullard, essentially saying, within this policy pathway going forward from here, that there could be a pivot sometime in the future, but they're going to wait to see if their policy has actually taken effect. What data would you be most notably looking towards to see where that policy is actually being ingested fully by the economy? Well, I think there's no doubt that you look first at housing as you were just talking about. If you go back through the history of the Federal Reserve in recent decades, I'm not talking about the 1920s, when monetary policy tightens, it has its principal effects on spending in two places. One is new houses, and the other is automobiles. So the spending on houses looks like it's behaving like it has in previous Fed tightnings. It's very sensitive because people finance it with mortgages. The spending on automobiles is a lot trickier because, as you all know, we've had this crazy cycle where people couldn't buy cars. They weren't enough cars to buy because they weren't enough chips to make cars. And a lot of automakers who've got backlogs. Now, a backlog is one thing. People come back out of their intention to buy a car. But I think it's at least believable hypothesis that the impact on automobile sales will be less than it normally has been in the past because of this backlog. Alan, it's Julie here. As you look across back at the history of monetary policy, it seems like no matter what the Fed does, there are always critics of the Fed and what it's doing. And there's always this backward looking. They should have done this. They should have done that. As you look at that history, what lessons do you take away for the Fed today? I guess you can't entirely avoid that criticism, but maybe to lessen it. You know, the old Joe Klein was that something that they paid them to make bucks for. If you actually look at Federal Reserve salaries, you would see how lovely they are. The answer to your question is it's part of the job description. The Federal Reserve knows that it's going to get criticism from one side or the other. Often both, some people criticizing it for being too selfish. Some people for being too hawkish. By the way, that's happening now. That's not that unusual. I can remember just to give you an anecdote in 1994 when we started raising interest rates. I was vice chairman of the Fed. And that was, by the way, ended up with the perfect soft landing. The absolutely perfect soft landing, the best the Fed has ever done. But we were criticized tremendously for wrong footing in the markets and surprising them by raising interest rates, even though Greenspan had signaled that months before. So it's just part of the atmosphere. It's the air you breathe has criticism in it if you're a FFED. Alan, yesterday I spoke to Bank of America CEO Brian Moynihan and he was talking a lot about a recession. Take a listen. Love to get your reaction on the back side. Our team predicts a recession, a mild recession. They have had that projection, frankly, for six months ago they had the same projection more or less. It just pushed out a little bit. But what we're not seeing is it come to four yet and that keeps moving it out because of that resiliency and the consumer. Alan, do you agree that if we are going into recession then it will be mild? I think so. Now one never knows because all kinds of known things can happen. Like a big oil shock from OK. I don't think that.",https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TFE9bMjrlhU,4,2022-10-20 14:11:18
3721," So now one never knows because all kinds of unknown things can happen. Like, you know, big oil shock from OK. I don't think that will happen, but it's possible. So events on unforeseen events can upset the apple card. But I think my central prognostication, if you want to call it that is very similar to what Mr. Miningham was just speaking about with the single exception. And it's trivial is that a few months ago, I was not saying it would happen in 2022. It would probably happen in 2023, which is what I hear him saying. There are a number of reasons to think it'll be fairly mild. I'll just take off too. One is the huge amount of liquidity that consumers have accumulated, largely because of the transfer payments that were made to to lessen the impact of the terrible pandemic recession. So consumers are sitting on a cash pile, depending on how you measure it of two trillion, two and a half trillion. So that's going to be enabling them to bolster their spending, even if their factor incomes go down. And the second thing that's rarely discussed, but Neil Kashkary is a good example of it. You had him on a moment ago. This is a fairly dovish FOMC, Federal Open Market Committee. They vary, you know, it's human beings that are making these decisions. And sometimes the committee has a very hawkish tilt there eager to raise rates. They're very, very inflation-versed. And sometimes they're more hawkish and they're more concerned about the employment impacts. They're still trying to get inflation down. No question about that. It's a matter of degree. And I think by historical standards, this is a fairly dovish FOMC. And what that means to me is they're less likely to overdo it. Kind of piggybacking on something that you just mentioned a moment ago, Alan. I mean, we are emerging from a situation, a crisis that none of us had ever been through in our lifetimes with the coronavirus pandemic. And with that, you had seen economies around the world try to stimulate growth once again, coming out after that. But now there's the larger question of on a global front, on a global picture here, where one economy's trouble is maybe a precursor to another's, or where they may not be. And do you believe that there's anything within Europe right now that is a precursor to what the U.S. may be heading towards? A little bit, right? It's easy to, you know, it's hard to put the right spin on this. I don't want to say it doesn't matter, but it's easy to exaggerate it. Also, point one is that Europe is almost certainly headed for a worse recession than we are. They are more impacted by the food and especially. Oh, it looks like we've got Professor Blinders shot frozen, unfortunately. We got some gremlins today. We got some gremlins today. Well, all right. Nonetheless, we will continue to watch all things fed policy. Very interesting point there, Alan Blinder, making about a potential recession next year if anything, he's looking forward to maybe be mild. He actually, I think we got him back. Alan, do we have you back? I'm here. Okay, great. Can you see me? Yes, we are. I wanted to get you actually for one last question here. And that has to do with the report in the New York Times today. Gina Smilak over there. Talk to you about some comments that James Bullard made on the sidelines, Dan and DC, while the IMF meetings were going on to a private audience of city clients. And this is a pretty rare occurrence for a fed governor to make comments on monetary policy to a private group. I'm just wondering if you could give us your take on that. It is unusual. It's not unheard of. It is unusual. And I'm sure Jim Bullard understood. I don't know the occasion, but I mean, I was sometimes in positions like that when I was vice chairman of the fed.

All right, before we had to break, let's shed light on some positive comments on the retail sector from Wells Fargo analyst, Ike Barchow. The analyst says his data shows US consumer demand continues to be stable across the mall notes Barchow. It appears most companies took their medicine and set more prudent plans post their summer slowdowns. And as such, we see much less near-term risk in the third quarter. His top picks include a bath and body works, tapestry, Burlington stores and barfetch. Coming up, the latest executive movement at Metta, Brad is back with that plus more of today's top headlines next. The UK's Prime Minister Liz Trust resigned this morning. She will stay in the role until a successor is chosen. Until yesterday, there was a widely held view in her party that a leadership change should wait at least until a new economic plan is announced on October 31st to calm financial markets. But in fighting within the Tory party and a realization that she will no longer be able to fulfill her promises sped up that process. The British government will hold a leadership election within the next week. And Marble or Maker, Philip Morris reported third quarter earnings before the bell this morning.

Alright, earnings season is just beginning here, but we've already heard several executives talk about the impact the strength of the dollar is head on the top and bottom lines. The dollar has been on a tear, having his best quarterly performance in seven years. But why exactly does this impact companies? And how can they hedge against it, Professor Julie Heimner's year for her debut of Yahoo, you, Julie, take it away. Alright, take your seats, Jens, because class is indeed in session. We have seen this enormous strength in the dollar this year. We've been talking a lot about it. It has meant about a 14% rally for the dollar versus the likes of the euro, 30% rally versus the Japanese yen. If you look at the year to date, you've seen the dollar index versus a basket of currencies. Go higher. What does this mean in real terms? Well, let's say I had a company called Jewels Tools. I saw all kinds of stuff, square drivers, hammers, power drills. What have you? Let's say I have a big business in the EU and I sell 1000 euros worth of hammers in the European Union. If you go back to March, that sale, if I brought it back to profits here in the US, would be worth about $1,112.40. However, as of yesterday, it was worth less than $1,985. This tells you in real terms, when you bring those profits back to the United States, what happens? It's the inverse of you going to vacation over in Europe and having more power to spend there. A lot of companies have already talked about this effect. We've already heard so many during this earning season thus far from the netflixes and proctoring gambles of the world, for example. It's going to take a head of $3.9 billion over the next year. I forgot that I controlled this and you don't. So here are the various companies that we're seeing here, guys Tesla, one of the companies also talking about the currency impact. Netflix making these kinds of comments as well that it's really costing these companies billions of dollars as we are seeing the currency effect. And most of the currency strategies we've spoken to are saying the dollar is going to continue to go up. So this is not something that's over. So what can companies do in order to try and hedge against the dollar strength? That's something we hear about frequently, this hedging activity. There's a couple things we can do. Jules Tools can pay workers in local currency. In other words, if I have workers in the European Union that are making those hammers, I can just keep the euros there and pay the workers in that currency. I don't have to bring it back to the United States. So that's one way that I can do it. Another way I can do it is issue debt in that foreign currency. So for example, I can sell corporate bonds denominated in euros. And that way I don't have that currency translation effect that is hitting my bottom line. So that's another way that we can hedge potentially. But overall, this is undoubtedly going to have an increase in effect on corporate profits here. 2% increase in the trade-weighted dollar will subtract about a percent from earnings per share in the United States for S&P 500 companies. And according to City and JP Morgan, they estimate that if you see a 10% increase in the dollar basket, it could cut S&P earnings by 15 to 20 dollars or share. So we're talking about a substantial effect here. And this is why we've been hearing about companies offsetting it in a number of different ways, including raising prices. But this is a theme that is going to stick around for a while. Yeah, and it's definitely impacting companies in a big, big way. Really good stuff, Julie. I think that's the debut of the Julie emoji here on Yago Fine. Yeah, I think what for you, Brad. I like my look at mine. I see your, it looks exactly like us. I don't know how they, I don't know how they come up with these things. You're just always good. I'm excited for the new Julie emoji. Within this, though, the impact that you're mentioning, I mean, we've already gotten into some of the tech companies, but we're just at the tip of the iceberg for some of the tech companies that are going to be reporting.",https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TFE9bMjrlhU,7,2022-10-20 14:24:19
3724," OG, within this though, the impact that you're mentioning, I mean, we've already gotten into some of the tech companies, but we're just at the tip of the iceberg for some of the tech companies that are gonna be reporting and talking about FAC. And when you're talking about the hedging that the tech companies can do, for example, if I am a software company, most of my developers are likely in the United States. So I can't do that keeping the currency local situation quite as well to account for expenses. I gotta bring that money back to pay my programmers. Top work there, my friend, Professor Hyman, very good stuff. I very much enjoyed that. All right, coming up, we'll speak to the CFO of AT&T on the back of their third quarter earnings report. That's next.じゃあ 다음에 봐요. Here's a VAT&T. I'm moving higher this morning. After the telecom company reported third quarter earnings showing 708,000 postpaid phone net ads and a 6% rise in mobility revenue year over year. AT&T, CFO, Pescal, Deroch joins us now to discuss. Pescal, good to see you again. Three months ago, we were here having a conversation at a time. Your stock was down, double digits, and you weren't worn on free cash flow. Now today, the stock is up, and there seems to be a different tone on this earnings release. Why is that the case? Look, first of all, good morning, Brian, good morning, everybody. You know, maybe let me just start. I think this journey dates back to a couple of years ago. What we've said is we were going to invest to re-energize growth in this business with a priority towards re-energizing wireless and fiber growth. For a long time, we said that that investment initially would reduce earnings, but over time would produce significant returns. And last year, we said at the second...",https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TFE9bMjrlhU,8,2022-10-20 14:28:57
3725," reduce earnings, but over time would produce significant returns. And as late last year, we said, at the second half of this year, earnings would start to see the benefits of all the work that's been done. So things are playing out exactly as we said. And look, overall, I'd be remiss if I didn't thank my colleagues across the company for all their hard work and getting us to this point. In terms of what's different now, I think, class quarter, there was a bit of an overreaction by, I think, the marketplace and some of the media. In the end, what we flagged and we tried to we tried to every cord to be really transparent what we were seeing in the marketplace. What did we see? We saw that there was a normalization of collection patterns back to pre-pandemic norms. That hasn't gotten any worse. It's pretty much the same. And, you know, in terms of overall delinquencies that I've been saying this since the spring, we are probably slightly worse than pre-pandemic norms, but all of them are really strong fundamentals. The thing to keep in mind is, our business has a history of performing well even in challenging economic times. And we don't expect this time to be any different. You know, that's an amazing acknowledgement here, especially as we think about the fact that within the market, consumers are paying more in some of their other necessities that they have to account for as well. And so when it comes down to their telecommunications service provider, like an AT&T, and the delinquencies that you are seeing, where are you also seeing perhaps the either type of device that customers that are net ads may be opting in for? Is it on the higher tier? Is it on the mid tier? And what type of service for those devices as well? Yeah, and I would say it's a bit across the board. First and foremost, consumers as a general matter, more and more people are signing up to higher price plans because of the value that those plans provide in terms of additional bandwidth. But not everyone is taking the device promotions. In fact, a meaningful portion of our subscriber additions in wireless come through our business relationships. And that channel, it has been and continues to be really efficient source of generating new subscribers. And so we're benefiting from that. And we're seeing just the consistency of our offer quarter after quarter, resonating with customers. And our sales team know how to execute it. And all those things are contributing to continued improvement in continued growth and subscribers, as well as higher RPUs. You layer on top of that a better international, more international travel also contributing to higher roaming revenues. All those things are driving improvements in RPU. And we've been doing a lot of work in our cost structure. And you're starting to see some of that benefit come through to the bottom line. So we feel really good about how we're performing. Pascal, it's Julie here. So obviously a lot of attention being paid to your networking investments as you pointed out. And there have been some reports that you are in discussions to spend a lot more on the network. There was a report recently that you're working with one of the big banks to increase your fiber optic cable investment, a 10 to 15 billion dollar investment potentially. Is there anything you can tell us about that and what it would mean for your customers and for your network? As a matter of policy, we don't talk about rumors in the press. But let me tell you, overall, how we think about fiber. Fiber right now is the best technology. And as we look out the next decade or two, there is nothing under horizon that will match the effectiveness of fiber, especially in terms of the speed that bandwidth and importantly symmetrical speed. And we don't see anything changing that. We are the largest provider in the U.S. We know how to do it very well. We can do it more efficiently than others. And we are prioritizing investing in fiber. If there are opportunities for us to accelerate that through different partnerships, of course we'll look at it.",https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TFE9bMjrlhU,9,2022-10-20 14:32:54
3726," others and we are prioritizing investing in fiber. If there are opportunities for us to accelerate that through different partnerships, of course we'll look at that. As John Stake said on the call this morning, his job and my job is to make sure we are looking at all opportunities to potentially accelerate returns on our owners. Pascal, as it pertains to your planning for 2023, two part question one, are you planning for a recession? And the number two, are you planning for a pickup in promotions to consumers given the slowdown we might see? Here is what I would tell you. You will hear more about how we're thinking about 2023 when we report our fourth quarter earnings. Overall, what I did say on this morning's call is that we understand, we're more than three quarters of the way through the year and we understand what sort of macro environment we're operating in now. And they even considering all the challenges that we read about, we expect to grow earnings of free cash flow next year. But we want to make sure we wait till the fourth quarter and have the best possible information. And at that point, we will tell you how we are thinking about more precisely how we expect the magnitude of earnings of free cash flow growth. Within that, though, and as you start to think about what a potential recession might look like for the business, what does that real margin run rate actually sustain at over that period of time, given the delinquencies that you were talking about a moment ago? When you look back at history, even in downturns, the telecommunications sector tends to be more resilient than most. Clearly, we would be impacted like others, but not nearly to the same extent. And right now, when you look at the criticality of telecommunication, whether wireless or broadband connectivity, that's one of the last things the consumer will turn off, even in a challenging economic environment. With that said, look, they pay me to make sure that we have the opportunity in the event that we encounter difficult operating environments to identify potential offsets. And you know, things we would look to are things like, do we moderate the pace of our investments then in capital, but all in all, the good news about where we are today is that we believe we can continue to invest meaningfully in our business, comfortably pay our dividend, and still continue to deliver over the next several years. But look, if they're really challenging economics environment that we're operating in, you know, we will look for other ways to offset that. They may not turn it off, but would they trade down in terms of the service that they are receiving from AT&T? And have you seen that show up in anywhere in the business? Yeah, it hasn't shown up. In fact, more consumers are opting for the higher price plan. That's part of what's driving the growth in our RRQ that we reported. All right, we'll leave it there. AT&T, CFO, Pascal DeRosch. Good to see you again. We'll talk to you soon. Good seeing you. Thank you, everyone. Appreciate it.

Joining me now discuss is Antonio Nairi, heal the Packard Enterprise CEO. Antonio, always nice to see you. Right off the top, you guys highlighted a $250 billion market opportunity by 2025. What is that market opportunity? Well, good morning, Brian. Thank you for having me today. It's a big market opportunity because not only that market is expanding, but we are entering new segments of the market with new offers as a part of our age-to-class strategy. And those new offers are in the private 5G, in the IoT, and in the data switching portfolio in the connectivity space, as well as security in the SaaS space together with our flagship product, the SD1. And as well, increasing number of offers as a part of our HP Green Lake platform and new data services. So a combination of cable growth at the time and new segments, that give us the opportunity to play over the next three years in that $250 billion market. Antonio, that shift to software as a service which ultimately drives to annual recurring revenue. Where are you at in that journey? Well, we have made a tremendous progress, if you recall, in 2019, I committed to make available all our offers from age-to-cloud as a service. And at the HP Discovery in June, we achieve a major milestone because not only our age solutions are now part of our HP Green Lake platform, but as well as workload optimization infrastructure as a service, as a service, and as well as data services. So we made tremendous progress, but now we are operating as a company in a cloud operating environment where all our new offers are designed and delivered to HP Green Lake. So now is the journey on continuous adding and renewing those offers as we go forward. And that AIR, as we guided for the next three years, is going to grow between 35 and 45 percent, also not only on the back of a significant growth, which this year alone, we are growing up bookings in excess of 86 percent a year today. But the fact that we already have $7.7 billion of total contravalue in the Azure Service Business in our balance sheet. Are you seeing any red flags or areas of concern in your business? Are customers cancelling orders? Are they delaying decisions at all? Well, what is fascinating to me, Brian, is that we continue to see enduring demand for our products and our services. And Green Lake is at the top of that demand. Well, customers love about HP Green Lake. It's the fact that they get a unified cloud experience, inclusive of the public cloud and all the services and applications they have on premises. And now they get the opportunity to extend not only into the public cloud with the same experience, but also at the edge. And that's the next big opportunity for us because we live in a much more distance.",https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TFE9bMjrlhU,11,2022-10-20 14:41:51
3728," to extend not only into the public cloud with the same experience, but also at the edge. And that's the next big opportunity for us because we live in a much more distributed enterprise than ever before. And also new use cases are being developed and deployed at the edge. So that's for us is a point of differentiation in my mind. And then when it comes down to momentum, again, enduring the demand, but we have not seen any major or the cancellations at all. And that to us is a very positive sign that digital transformation and a key top priority for our customers and IT plays now a bigger role than ever before. Antonio, some of the analysts commentary I saw this morning. A lot of them seem to be flagging the outlook for next year. A little cautious, a little below some of the estimates that were out there. Does that outlook account for our potential recession in the US? Well, that outlook has started and I stated yesterday includes what we see as a potential disruption that made the market creates because of the inflation and the foreign current exchange, you know, kind of trends we see. So we have comprehended all of that in our outlook, but we are very confident about our outlook because obviously we have a record-breaking backlog with again, enduring the demand continue to be in the market. Second is that also we continue to make a significant shift in not only in our product and portfolio mix, but in a way with the liver that makes. And third also, this company generates a lot of cash. And so from my vantage point, we are very well positioned to meet or exceed that outlook. Understanding that the biggest issue unknown today is actually in my mind not so much the macro environment, but more the volatility of the foreign exchange. Antonio, I'm on the the Hula Packard Enterprise Staff page on Yahoo Finance and I see your stock trading at under six times for earnings. That is more than half of the broader market. Just given the performance of the business, I mean, that is that shocking how you guys performed compared to the past year. You mentioned you have a lot of cash. How are you going to deploy cash over the next 12 months to get that multiple up? Yeah, I think you just said that really well. I mean, our disappointment is on the multiple because not only we're growing revenues, we are also growing recurrent revenues, which they represent more than one-third of our total revenues. And by the way, almost 80% of our profits are recurring. Okay. I think the market still want to see ongoing what I call performance on a free cash flow, which obviously has been a little bit losing through the separation and spin-offs in the restriction we have to do to rise size the company, which we are now. And our guidance on free cash flow now is at the midpoint two billion dollars. What you're going to see is the convergence of a non-GAP EPS to free cash flow. And that free cash flow is deploying in a balanced way. Obviously, we are super committed to dividends, which today at the current stock price are represented almost at 4% yield, probably one of the highest in my mind in the tech sector. Continue to aggressively buy shares back, obviously because the share price is depressed. But at the same time, we have to continue to invest in the business because ultimately we've got to bring breakthrough innovation for our customers. But that investment in the business has a significant discipline around it or return to invest the capital. And obviously, gear to higher margins and higher areas of growth, but all delivered through HP Green Lake, which drives the recurring revenue. And obviously, over time, that will help our multiples as well. All right. We'll get some rest. I know it's been a long week for you. Antonio and Eric, he'll have packed an enterprise CEO. Always good to get some time with you. I'll talk to you soon. Catch you on Twitter. Thank you, Brian. All right. airline earnings have been impressive.

3729," Über Thanos With consumer confidence, sticking higher in September, signs of life are coming back to the travel industry. Occupancy rates were in line with 2019 levels in September and domestic travel intent trended higher. That's according to data from STR and the conference board. Of course we got a lot of positive airline earnings as well to support that notion. Joining us now to discuss JMP Security's equity research analyst Nick Jones, Nick, you covered the digital travel companies, the booking.coms of the world. And I imagine that the picture is similar for them. Is it sort of a rise in tide lifts all boats? Are we just seeing a kind of rosy outlook right now for the travel industry writ large? Yeah, I think that's right. The airlines have given some good commentary that trends remain resilient. Occupancy rate as you pointed out is back to 2019 levels in September. Conference four is saying intent to travel is increasing average daily rates or are elevated still indicating demand is still high. So trends are really looking good into the end of the year and that it both evolved for early 2023. I think near term, that's absolutely right. In the longer term, we look kind of further in the next year, the probability of a recession continues to increase. If you look back over history, generally the spend on travel does start to decline in a recession. So I think in part that's what's maybe keeping these stocks and really breaking out of kind of near term positive data points. Hope this keeps some of the airlines honest here. From what you're seeing in terms of the number of different flights, the routes that are available, is there actually more capacity that is increasingly being added on here? And is that translating through to better fares for customers from what you've been tracking in your own research? Yeah, I mean so far, the intent is there, the demand is there, but it does not appear that fares are really coming down yet from the kind of the check.",https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TFE9bMjrlhU,13,2022-10-20 14:50:36
3730," research. Yeah, I mean so far the intent is there, the demand is there, but it does not appear that fairs are really coming down yet from the kind of the checks we've done in a anecdotal. You know, the price of flights are still pretty elevated and some are the price of hotels. So, despite their still being pretty high cost, the demand of travel is still there. You know, we have heard some commentary, particularly the hotels, that not all of the rooms are actually available today because they'll have a staffing to make them available. So, that could in Part B, why some of, you know, the average daily rates remain elevated. So, it's kind of more supply comes on. It'll be interesting to watch if the airlines and the hotels actually lower prices are today kind of hold on to where prices are today is kind of input cost increase. What about the sort of international lumpiness, if you will? I mean, a booking.com, which gets more of its revenue from Europe than the others. Is that then more vulnerable? Yeah, there's kind of puts in takes there. So, the US dollar strength is it could create some effects, headwinds, kind of two revenues and costs at booking, but at the same time, the intent to travel from the US to foreign destinations is actually increased back to 2019 level. So, a strengthening US dollar can benefit a company like booking as more US will look to travel to Europe and outside of the US. Is Airbnb still in any type of growth phase from right now, from what you can see? Yeah, Airbnb is, you know, they've benefited from really making alternative accommodations, really just another accommodation. They've really normalized that type of accommodation to consumers. Their growth does appear to be moderating. We have a market for form rating on it, largely due to valuation, but what they've done is, you know, it's heroic what they've done to kind of a new accommodation class. The company still has room to add experiences to its offering. They could have promoted listing to kind of the supply side of the platform that could continue to drive net revenue kind of faster than we're looking for today, but we look for more evidence before we really start making that intro model. But from what we can tell, it looks like kind of the, you know, GBV growth at Airbnb is going to be in line with kind of expedient booking in a couple years and be a similar kind of nominal dollar growth rate. All right, good time to be a bills fan. See the helmet in the back of your shot there. JMP Securities Equity Research Analyst Nick Jones, joining us here today. Thanks so much Nick. Thanks, go bills.

On its third quarter results, expecting a net loss for the quarter. The first three years responded to the news by dropping sharply this morning. According to insurers, inflation is causing costs for payouts to jump across the board with auto and medical costs, climbing significantly this year shares down to 10% right now in trading. The investors aren't in good hands, I guess. Oh, well they are in good hands, but it's costing all state more. Right? If you file a point. Then the company has to pay board. There was also some hurricane costs and that also really weighed on the bottom line for all state. It's going to be hurricane, right? And they do a lot of modeling at the insurance companies, but I guess if your modeling is off from what actually happens with the hurricane. And then you're forced to pay a high number of claims at a higher cost, this is then the result. I'm just fascinated how these stocks are going to do as we get more focus on climate change in this country and as these events potentially pick up over the next decade. Well, it's interesting because for all state, I imagine it's very similar to what I'm going to say. Okay, we're done with that story. In good hands though, China reportedly holding emergency talks with chip makers following restrictions on imported semiconductors from the US. That's according to Bloomberg. The meetings happen behind closed doors to assess the possible damage to China's developing semiconductor markets. So we're seeing all chip stocks rise on this news, but again, a very contentious situation here. Well, the rise in the stocks doesn't make a lot of sense to me, honestly. This report said in this closed-door meeting that there were as many questions as answers. So like, yeah, they met to try and figure out what to do about the issue, but they have no answers. Right, but it's also a very one-sided conversation that's taking place, especially if you still have the US, that is not as willing to let the chip companies hear or abroad either come into the US or for some of the chip companies here go abroad, especially into China. And so that is still very one-sided, even to say, yeah, we're having these discussions on our side right now. Yeah, I think the bigger story, at least near-term for investors, is the PC slowdown over. Do we have any visibility when this might end? Because that is hammered stocks like AMD and Intel. Right, and there's no closed-door meeting. No closed-door meeting. They're reporting earnings soon. It's open to the motto. Yes, it is. All right, let's take a look at what stocks are doing here as we leave you, because we have seen an uptick overall across the board. So really, what started as a very mixed picture today is turning more uniformly positive. All three major averages are higher here. It doesn't seem like there was any particular catalyst that I could see. This chip maker's being up, doesn't hurt matters, to be sure. And coming up in the next hour, Kiko Fujita will speak with Union Pacific Sea-O lands. But that's on the back of his company's earnings report. We talked about it earlier.

So from start to the day, two key things we're watching outside of those majors yields as well as currency swing.",https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TFE9bMjrlhU,16,2022-10-20 15:03:18
3733," S&P 500 up about 8 tenths of a percent. So from start to the day, two key things we're watching outside of those majors, yields as well as currency swings. And we're starting on those treasury yields. They're pushing higher as well. We did see that 10-year yield briefly touching a level. We have not seen since 2008 and you see it well above the 4 percent mark right now at 4.15. Currency swings is Japanese yen and focus yet again. Remember that intervention from the BOJ about a month ago, certainly has not helped the yen's cause. We did see it briefly touch $152 right now at $149.59. A lot of investors waiting to see if the BOJ intervenes yet again there and you see at the bottom of the screen the dollar hitting that mark for the first time since 1990. We are beginning this hour though which shares of Tesla down nearly 4 percent after its latest quarterly results topping earnings estimates for the third quarter. The revenue came in below expectations as electric carmaker saw costs in Austin and Berlin way on margins. CEO Elon Musk though painting a brighter picture on demand in yesterday's earnings call. Take a listen. I can't emphasize enough. We have excellent demand for Q4 and we expect to sell every car that we make for as far into the future as we can see. For more on Waskat, what Musk had to say, let's bring in Yahoo Finance as prize, supermanian. So process interesting, you have those comments coming from Elon Musk saying that we want to reiterate demand is going to be strong for Q4 but we've also heard him talk about this gap that we're seeing between production and deliveries. That seems to be the concern that's kind of weighing on the stock today. Yeah, I feel like half the street is sort of seeing that delivery versus production sort of issue as a, oh, it's not a big deal to pick up right now. We're seeing other half saying, no, this is demand problem. And Musk's sort of saying that, hey, we're hitting a lot of issues with trucks and boats and other means of transporting their cars to customers so they can't actually recognize those as delivery. So he's sort of paying that picture but then I was saying that, oh, we're also seeing demand soften in China, Europe's getting hit by energy crisis and the US, the Fed is hitting the US economy. So he's talking about all these other things that are hurting demand. They're hurting demand. Exactly. So we can't, Q4 looking great. That's going to be a huge quarter for us. They maintain that 50% compound annual growth rate for even for this year. I mean, they got to build like 500,000 cars in Q4 alone. I mean, look, it's maybe looking back on that math. They could probably build 400,000 max maybe. I could be wrong but that's looking more likely but they said, hey, we're going to do this. We're going to hit that target around 1.4 to 1.5 million this year. Okay. The headwinds are outweighing sort of the positives that you just highlighted. Let's bring in another guest into the hour here. We've got George, a Jennifer, Rekas, a chemical originality managing director. George, let's just build on those comments from Praz. What's your sense right now on why the stock is pulled back so significantly? Is this about the street just simply saying we don't necessarily buy this story that demand is going to stay strong in Q4? Well, first thanks for having me. And I think Praz kind of nailed it. Look, it was an issue where there's a little bit of double speaker on the one hand. So the first time that I can remember and I've been looking at the stock for a long time, Elon Musk acknowledged that there was a demand issue particularly in China. And if you guys remember several years ago and someone asked about demand, he called it a boring question. Right? So this might be the first time where he actually acknowledged a little bit of a down tick. But at the same time, he said the company would grow significantly in Q4 and we think they could do about 450,000 deliveries. And then they're going to sell as many cars as they can build for the foreseeable future, which is about 50% year-rear growth as far as the I can see. And so what we did is we thought about how we can square that circle. And for us, it came up to a couple of things. First, the company has had backlog for a really long period of time and they're probably going to drain a little bit of that in Q4. There are some fleet sales. The company's like hurts that they could maybe sell in Q4 that help. And then when you look into 2023 specifically, the cyber truck comes online and that really helps to start producing more in Austin. They have Tesla semi-sales. And then beyond that, hopefully we're out of this economic bunk that they were in currently. But it's kind of like,",https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TFE9bMjrlhU,17,2022-10-20 15:07:45
3734," They start producing more in Austin. They have Tesla semi-sales. And then beyond that, hopefully we're out of this economic bump that they were in currently. And EVs, if you remember, are really, really, really small percentage of overall sales. And so that will start to help. So we think there's some method to the madness and there's logic as to why he guided them to grow significantly this year and continue their growth and connection. But I completely agree and understand there's too many breadcrumbs to that indicate that there's been a slowdown in the man and even acknowledging them yesterday's fall. Hey, Georgia, pros again. So I just wanted to talk to you about a couple of things that I sort of struck me last time the call. You mentioned the cyber truck, how they're going in the tooling phase for potential sort of, I guess, production start in mid-2023. But also you mentioned the cheaper Tesla, the kind of entry-level car that would potentially be half the cost or something like that versus the Model 3. What did you think about that? Because they actually kind of sort of confirmed that this is actually in the works. Yeah, so on the cyber truck, it's one of the things that may give the company a lot of confidence in growth in 23 and beyond. Because look, I'm pretty confident that the company won't keep the pricing that had discussed last time when they first introduced it. But remember, they had millions, according to the press, millions of orders for the cyber truck, starting in 2023. And so even if they had a lot of cancellations, that's a lot of demand. I personally would get one if my wife let me, but she told me she would be content driving it. So it's clearly an acquired taste. And a lot of people really like it. On the Robotaxi platform, it's a really interesting question. And so basically, when you think about the company's ability to bring down the cost of production for a vehicle, they've done a really, really marvelous job with the Model 3 slash Model Y platform, which cost about, somewhere in the mid $30,000 range to make. And when it comes to Robotaxi, that's another step down in production cost. Now, granted, it won't be as a big of a vehicle. There'll be a lot of nuances to it. You know, probably won't have a steering wheel and some odd stuff like that that will enable autonomous driving. But it's another platform through which the company can reduce costs and help you these proliferate the gold. George, in terms of potential for buybacks, it sort of felt like Elon Musk dangled that carrot for investors who have been a little jittery around the stock. He said, $5 to $10 billion is certainly possible. These were his words for next year. I wonder what you make of that. How much of this is about trying to get those investors to stick it out, those who have been concerned about his distractions with Twitter? And is this really the best use of capital for a company? Should that be used towards more catbacks? Just to be blunt, we don't like it. Buybacks are things that companies like newspaper company do not Tesla that has significant opportunity in front of it. We think there's better use of capital to accelerate catbacks plans, to build cars, to build the robot army that Elon Musk wants to build. It's just, in our opinion, they're just better ways to accelerate their plans around, you know, having EVs proliferate the globe. And other opportunities, including battery factories and robots. So look, I'm sure that they've done a lot of math behind it and they want to see the support the stock down here in the 200s. But we think ultimately long term, the best way to support the stock is to grow for as long as you can. George, we didn't even get to ask you about the valuation. And Elon Musk's calling for a valuation for a Tesla could equal Apple and Saudi Aramco combined. But that's for another conversation around a time here. George, you know, he gets Ken Accord, Genuity, Managing Director, our thanks to you and our thanks to Yahoo Finance's Pros Supermanian. Well, American Airlines topped Wall Street's estimates for the third quarter. Reporting record revenue of $13.5 billion as demand remains strong for travel shares of the airline, though, down nearly 3%. Let's bring in our very own Brad Smith for a look at the numbers. It's a pretty steep fall when you consider how strong the quarter was. It is a pretty steep fall in the strong quarter that we've seen for a lot of airlines at least to this point in time over the course of the year and in the season. You saw a record quarterly revenue for Delta. You saw that for.",https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TFE9bMjrlhU,18,2022-10-20 15:11:57
3735," It is a pretty steep fall in the strong quarter that we've seen for a lot of airlines at least to this point in time over the course of the Ernie season you saw a record quarterly revenue for Delta you saw that for American airlines as well that revenue coming in at 13 and a half billion dollars Which is actually a 13% increase over the same period the comparable 2019 period is that what the period that they're looking back to here and we've heard that from many of the airlines at this point because that is The last time period that really represents full capacity and that's the other side of this equation to when are you going to see more of the airlines? Actually get back to full capacity We know that United American Airlines there right around 90% of that 2019 capacity Delta lagging behind that just a little bit But it's really this effort to do so Wisely and diligently with the resources that they do have whether that be the number of pilots whether that be the hubs that That they're operating in and the number of routes that they're still flying anybody that has traveled over the last few months knows how high airline Tickets have been yes, you know, I mean airlines not the only one but sort of this offset that we're seeing with fuel costs going up But then companies charging more and when you look at where the revenue came in how much of this had to do with the higher prices They were able to charge well They had to pass through a lot of that higher costs on the fuel side Air American Airlines rather that fuel price was actually up 97% relative to years past when We had watched over the summer and many of the prices because of that demand They knew that they could pass through that that price and that cost was being absorbed by consumers It's a larger question of as those fuel prices start to come down and these are contracts that they negotiate well in advance So perhaps still working through what they had actually paid for some of the Excesses that they would been able to have to operate so many of their routes and their flights So perhaps as we work through that you'll start to see some of those prices come down for the consumers and especially going into a holiday season Where it doesn't look like demand is going to dampen we've heard that consistently throughout the quarter throughout the results from American Airlines from Delta From Alaskan Airlines even is that the man is strong right now And so it's a larger question of when the customers will actually push back on pricing But even with this capacity it seems like they're still going to see some of that strength continue to move forward as well Well, that was my my follow-up question obviously we're going into one of the busiest seasons We heard early on it is the year in the years that you know travelers were already booking flights for Q4 Right, but now we're talking about more economic headwinds Do we get any more color on the outlook and you know? Yes holiday demand is still holding up, but when do they expect it to start to slow down? You know, it's actually I think an acknowledgement that they made on the call for American Airlines just a few minutes ago And it is that they're actually going to be removing their business or their first class rather and replacing that with more business class seats And if there's anything that we can really extrapolate from that It's in the fact that with the absence of as much corporate travel demand as we had seen and more of that leisure demand really relied upon It's this bleezure customer that many of the airlines are talking about and within that customer profile How are you going to continue to be able to see some of the incremental costs not just nickel and diamond people on baggage and things of that nature But where are you going to up the experience and hopefully bring down the fuel or the the prices for those fares It's going to be in the type of ticket somebody is purchasing and then what is the add-on to that experience as well And so it's not just the fare itself, but where else within that flying experience? Can you be able to make sure that we're increasing the value that we're giving customers? Yeah, you want a slight upgrade, but not full-first class, right? Yeah, no. It terms a cost. Bratz, I'm a thanks so much for that. We'll share some AT&T on moving higher and stronger subscriber growth help propel the company to a strong quarter. The wireless carrier added 964,000 subscribers in Q3. It's well above analyst estimates while wireless revenue rose 6.6 or 5.6 percent. That marked the biggest quarterly improvement for the company in more than a decade. AT&T also reiterating its free cash flow guidance for the year despite following short of analyst expectations in a quarter. You spoke with AT&T CFO earlier today. You just want to get to say on business performance take a look. A meaningful portion of our subscriber additions in wireless come through our business relationships. And that channel has been and continues to be really efficient source of generating new subscribers. And so we're benefiting from that and we're seeing just the consistency of our offer quarter after quarter.",https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TFE9bMjrlhU,19,2022-10-20 15:16:18
3736," recovery and overall the financials were strong, right? Record EPS net income operating income, free revenue. But at the same time, we did say that the heat's coming out of the marketplace, that guidance that we gave at the beginning of the third quarter about what we thought volume would look like in the back half, we had to trim down because volume's cooling off a bit across a number of our markets. And so that was a lot of the conversation this morning. Yeah, talk to me a bit more about that, where you're seeing the pull back in volume, and where are the biggest, biggest headwinds for you right now. Yeah, it's mostly related to the consumer. So consumer oriented shipments on our railroad, that tends to be domestic intermodal, parcel, you know, a few things driven by the consumer. Those are looking like they're cooling off. The consumer has already been shifting from goods back to services, not all the way back. We recall there was a real fundamental shift towards goods during the pandemic. So it hasn't gone all the way back, but at the same time, it does appear that they're buying less. And you can see that in international intermodal boxes hitting the West Coast ports, and you can also see it in demand for truck and demand for domestic intermodal on our railroad. There are some markets though, where we're seeing strong demand, and it's not going away, it's like coal, some of the bulk commodities, grain, rock, and then a handful of our industrial segments as well. But the total picture says we're going to grow year over year in the fourth quarter. It's just not going to be as much as we thought it would. Last last time we spoke, we were talking about the labor agreements ongoing, and I saw the number here in your quarter, $140 million charge related to labor agreements. How comfortable are you with worthings stand right now on that front? Yeah, you know, I'm less comfortable than I was before the B&W E are maintenance of way employees failed ratification, but I'm not concerned. We've got six unions having ratified, we've got five in the ratification vote, and we've got more work to do now with the BMW EED. I think that vote failed to ratify for a very specific reason, the PEP, in addition to proposing wage levels, which are very attractive to our employees. They also said for about half, about 40% of that craft that does maintenance of way, we needed to adjust the travel that we would pay them to go from home to their away from home work location, and the paradigm we'd pay while they were working away from home. That negotiation happened on property, and it just closed up on UP about a week ago, a couple of weeks ago. And that was at the very tail end of the ratification vote for that contract. So I think those were connected. We're back out now working with the BMW to try to figure out a temporary agreement that can be or a tentative agreement that can be taken back out for ratification. I anticipate we're going to be able to do that. We've got status quo in place there. Other than that, we need to get through the ratification on these other five unions, and get this baby closed out by the end of the year. And I think that's still the probable outcome. So end of the year, still the timeline that you're looking at, despite some of the snacks that you've hit. Yeah, I am, you know, I guess the maintenance away employees could drag over into next year. I don't anticipate that. I think there's a path forward for us to get another tentative agreement, get it back out for vote. Lance, it's always great to have you on the show, Union Pacific CEO Lance Fritz, appreciate your time today. Thank you, Akiko. We're trying to this capital stepping up measures to stop the spread of COVID in Beijing once again. Let's bring in Yahoo Finance, Senior Health reporter, Angelie Kamalani. Angelie, it's interesting timing in all of this. Obviously, there's been a lot of focus on the party Congress. She's being sort of reiterating that he's not, zero COVID isn't going anywhere. And yet, there seems to be some rubblings about whether there could be a little loosening of the policy. There's also some discussion about what else can be done. We've seen some pushback, of course, in recent weeks that there have been some cases tied to quarantining and isolation that have resulted in negative results of 14-year-old, I believe, recently died after unclear whether or not she was taken to the center because she had COVID or was taken to the center.",https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TFE9bMjrlhU,21,2022-10-20 15:24:53
3737," Fulton negative results of 14-year-old, I believe, recently died after unclear whether or not she was taken to the center because she had COVID or was a COVID contact. So a lot of focus on the zero-COVID policy and what that means with ongoing lockdowns, residents really struggling to access food and medicine. And because of that slight up to 18 new locally transmitted cases in a day, a certain residential compounds have now been locked down again. And we've seen in recent days certain parts of the country going back into lockdown mode, we know right near the Apple Hub the other day. So a lot of mixed efforts and unclear whether or not it's actually doing anything to really pull back on the case rise because we've seen how even here, there still is a concern about rise in cases and these new transmissible variants are really going to make it hard for them to continue what has been now more than two years of this kind of lockdown. Yeah, so let's talk about what's happening here locally. I don't know, I walk out in here sitting, nobody's wearing a mask. No, they're not. Because the policy isn't there in place. Right. And we started to see the uptick in cases again. What is that saying? And that is the concern. So we've started to see a few cases, a few areas of Manhattan rising above that 20% positivity rate as an average for the last 70s. And that is a sign of more increase. We saw the same uptick in the other boroughs in the last couple of months. And so it does seem to be sort of creeping back with a rise in COVID cases, which is not unexpected. Now the thing to watch is those new Omicron variants, the BQ1, BQ1, one. That's where experts are really keeping in their eye as the BAPI have started to decline in its presence around the country. We've seen in the New York, general New York area, which the CDC includes with Puerto Rico and New Jersey has also seen an increase in those numbers for BQ1 and BQ1, 120% almost. And that's a little bit higher than the national average right now. So definitely something to keep an eye on. Also a good reminder to go out and get your booster. Yes. If you haven't already. I know you're saying that's off of that. All right, Angelique and Lonnie, thanks so much for that. Well coming up, short stay at number 10. Liz Tross Rosalind says UK Prime Minister is saying she cannot fulfill her man. And a new leadership election sets take place within a week. We're going to look at the market reaction to the chaos that is British politics. It's on the other side.",https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TFE9bMjrlhU,22,2022-10-20 15:29:20
3738," If you'd like one, click thumbs up by sharing, don't miss some of my video and ideas for upcoming videos. Yep. That's for sure.... Mr Speaker, I have been very clear that I am, that I am sorry and that I have made mistakes. But the right thing to do in those circumstances is to make changes which I have made and to get on with the job and deliver for the British people. I recognise though, given the situation, I cannot deliver the mandate on which I was elected by the Conservative Party. I have therefore spoken to his majesty the King to notify him that I am resigning as leader of the Conservative Party. What a difference a day makes. Just yesterday outgoing UK Prime Minister Liz Truss pledged to battle on defending herself in that brutal session you just saw in the House of Commons today that pressure simply became too much for her. Her resignation coming after an embarrassing budget, U-turn and high profile cabinet departures, she becomes by the way the shortest serving Prime Minister in UK history, just 44 days. A leadership contest will now take place in the next week. A general election is not scheduled for another two and a half years but it could of course come sooner. So what's the market saying about all of this? Let's bring in Yahoo finances, Jared Blyckery. And Jared Blyckery was just saying you're surprised that the market reaction wasn't more significant. I guess you could argue the expectation had been building for some time. It seems that way. And you know, they're all jokes aside. You got the head of lettuce and everything else, the head of state. Let's put that aside. I need to explain that one a bit. No, no, everybody's saying that. The British pound, okay. So the British pound has gained 6.10% on the US dollar. I would say we saw some fireworks but these were just sparklers here. You compare this to some of the volatility that we've seen over the last few months. With all due respect to a lot of the serious plans that Truss had and bringing in some of those fiscal reforms, the worst time to do the most difficult challenging time to do those is during a time when you see incredible people in the global markets. We simply don't have the liquidity to have spillover effects when these changes are large. So here's a British pound versus US dollar over the last three months. Let me just put a line chart here so you can see it a little bit better. Now we can see this is pretty close to one. You take a look at the max chart in the global financial crisis. A pound was trading at two per dollar. So much stronger. It's been cut in half since then. And this by the way is, I believe, a record low down here. But this has spilled over into their rates market. So the whole deal with her cutting taxes was you had over leverage positions in the rates market, not seated. Nobody saw that coming. And the central bank there, the Bank of England had to ring fence the entire pension system, bail them out. And that worked temporarily. But that destroys the notion that there can be these kinds of massive fiscal reforms in the face of this global financial situation that we find ourselves. So I can put a heat map of the US dollar here. Some of these are going to be inverse to the pairs that you're used to seeing here. But today only the dollar is only stronger versus the Argentine peso. And then if we take a look at a year to day chart, you can really see some of the outsized move. If you were a",https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TFE9bMjrlhU,23,2022-10-20 15:33:48

You have the Turkish Lair. Then you have the Yan Akiko. We've been talking about that recently, not necessarily today, but to finish off the top line here, we have Norway, we have Sweden, we have the British pound. All of this portans, potentially future consternation and volatility in the rates markets, which we know can spill over into our own risk markets, aka stocks here at Kiko.

3740," actually not making enough pre-tax profit to meet their interest payments or their debt payments. So it's just a matter of time before they either have to take on some very expensive additional financing if they can find it or they go bankrupt. So to what extent have we seen the number of those zombie stocks accelerate as you see, as you point out, as we've seen the Fed's tightening cycle? Yeah, I mean, I think, you know, for a while, there was no such thing as a zombie stock when there was effectively an infinite amount of liquidity out there. I mean, companies were getting funded for really no business plan at all. They could just lose money into perpetuity. And as the Fed has pivoted and decided they're no longer going to sort of continually inflate the economy that they actually need to take some air out, well, the limit to the funding available has created, you know, we think we see at least 300 zombie stocks out there in the market. And we've highlighted up to this point a list of 19 that we think are in the most imminent danger. And yeah, that number's going to only get larger, right? Because the cutoff point is 24 years of cash to sustain the cash burn. And, you know, as each month that passes, there are sort of more stocks that are coming on the list. So let's highlight those 19 that you've honed in on. A lot of familiar names, Snap, Rivian, AMC, GameStop, among others. Who's in the most dire position as far as you see it? Well, some of the ones we put on there first, like Carvana, you know, FreshPet was on the list. We took it off once the activists came in because that was basically about to go under. Snap is a good one, Robin Hood is a good one. You know, these are businesses that really aren't making any money and really have no no real potential to make money and their valuations are still really expensive as well. So it's it's almost hard to say which one is worse because none of the business models in our opinion are viable. And, you know, Peloton's another one. You know, we see, we know shortly after we wrote our zombie stock report on Peloton, the CEO and effectively came out and agreed. It is a zombie stock and they got six months to prove that they're not going to go break bankrupt. So the, you know, those are some of the highlights, but none of them are good businesses at the end of the day. And that's the sad part here is that they probably should have never gone public. And they should never have been allowed to take as much shareholder capital as they did. David, there's one name that you flag that's getting a lot of attention today and that is, of course, Tesla. I mean, you point out that you think the cash flow expectations baked into the stock price are unreasonably optimistic. A bit of a mixed message coming from Elon Musk yesterday about where that demand picture looks like moving forward. He also sort of dangled that buyback of five to ten billion dollars in there for next year. What do you see in terms of where the stock could go? You know, how much lower and do you, is this defined as one of those zombie stocks? Well, the only reason it's not a zombie stock is because Musk has raised so much money that they've got a lot of cash on hand to sustain a burden for a long time. Now, the real question for us, though, is for how long can Musk sustain the super high expectations? And look, I mean, mixed messaging, Musk is the king of mis-messaging, right? I mean, that's part of why he's not been hauled into court more often because he says, oh, yeah, we're going to have full self-driving my next year and maybe probably, you know, or if not next year, the next six months of all, you know, he's kind of constantly dithering, never making really matter of fact statements. And that's what allows his legal team to go to the regulators and say, well, yeah, he said this here, but he said something else here. It's all a bunch of God will you, right? Unfortunately, too many investors still really pay a lot of heed to it. But I feel like the tightest beginning to turn, more and more folks are sort of starting to see, hey, there's been a lot of promises made and not a lot delivered. And some of these stunts are beginning to be seen for what they are as stunts. And so, you know, this whole Twitter deal is one that's really got a lot of people scratching their head, you know, if Tesla's such a great company, then why are you spending so many billions of dollars to buy something that isn't so great? How does that fit into the bigger plan? How are you focused on making sure Tesla doesn't continue to sustain serious market share losses?

3741," focused on making sure Tesla doesn't continue to sustain serious market share losses. Now that the incumbent automakers are ramping up production, Tesla had success when there was no competition and they are not having any success. They're losing market share as the competition is coming online and that competition is set to ramp up huge. So it's going to be really difficult to make a straight face argument on the merits of the underlying business of Tesla. And I think that's why Musk spent so much time talking about periphery items because he really wants to distract people from the core issues. Well also interesting to hear Elon Musk you know address the Twitter issue head on on an earnings call for Tesla which probably points to how jittery some investors are.

Now take a look at this chart which shows that nearly one in four Latinos say they still don't know who they'd vote for. Now that's according to the latest Axios Ipsos Latino poll. Well it's too soon to tell what this means for Democrats and Republicans going into the midterms the findings underscore Latinos collect of hold on the American swing vote. And by the way if you're counting we're just over two weeks out from the midterms. Well President Biden is attempting to put downward pressure on gas prices with the decision to release more oil from the nation's strategic petroleum reserve. There's another move though the president is buying that could be even more important for all the details let's bring in Yahoo finances Rick Newman and Rick. Whatever you release you have to buy back right and we've started to hear some details about how the administration is looking at this especially considering how low the reserves are. Right this is not getting very much attention but it's but it's something new and I think it's something important so what the Biden White House said this week is that when they do start to refill the reserve which they're going to have to do the government has always what after it dries down it does replace those barrels and what it normally does is it waits for oil prices to come down and it just buys them at the market price when prices are low. What Biden says they're going to do differently is they're actually going to sign contracts with oil producers to buy oil in the future and this could be one two three years in the future at prices that are between $67 and $72 so let's call it $70 as a as a rounding number and that number seems they seem to have settled on that number because just about every producer in the United States can sell oil profitably at around $70 so what Biden is trying to do here is he's trying to give producers more incentive to add capacity today because they know that in the future they will have one big purchaser willing to pay whatever the contract and price is so if they start writing these contracts let's say the price is $70 so oil producers adding capacity today don't have to worry what if prices fall down to 50 and suddenly we've added capacity and we can't make a profit on that they will have this one very large buyer in the United States government that will be willing to buy oil from them at a price they can make a profit at so the idea is to increase oil production today and in the near term to keep prices down which is in a way kind of a backdoor subsidy to the oil industry. Yeah curious to see how big oil responds especially given just how contentious things have been between the administration and some of those companies Rick Newman as always thank you so much for that.

3742," vs FEveryone Survival GDPand remainder are sales still involving our support we're concerned some working hardstyle will us at last two metrics with tight supply. Those buyers that got in at lower rates or owners that were able to refinance, now unlikely to sell or buy a new home with current mortgage rates. Let's bring in Daniel Hell. She is realtorad.com's chief economist. Daniel, we're not looking at eight straight months of declines in terms of existing home sales. How much worse do you think things get from here? A lot depends on what happens with the Fed and with mortgage rates going forward. So mortgage rates are one of the major challenges that home shoppers in today's market are facing as they climb. They're up very close to 7% haven't quite crossed that threshold yet according to Freddie Maxx data out today, but very close to the highest levels in two decades. At the same time, home prices are high and continue to rise and that one to punch a higher prices and higher mortgage rates make it very difficult for home shoppers in today's market to find a home that fits their needs and still also is affordable within their budget because budgets are under incredible pressure right now because of the inflation that is happening economy wide. So it's home shoppers today aren't a tough spot. Yeah, I mean, you just sort of crunch the numbers and it's easy to see where the slow down is. You're looking at a 30 or fixed mortgage at what roughly 7% sometimes a little higher, sometimes a little lower. So the mortgage rates or the monthly mortgage payment is more expensive. At the same time, I've seen a lot of price cuts for homes that are listed right now and I wonder what you're seeing on the seller side of things. How much pullback are you seeing there? Those who are saying, look, I can actually make more money renting out my property than trying to sell it when you consider where the buyers are. Yeah, I think that's an excellent point. So if you look at the total number of homes that are on the market, those are compared to a year ago and that's because we've had buyers pullback a little bit, homes are taking longer to sell as you mentioned and it's difficult for buyers to navigate this market. When you think about what sellers are doing, we look at newly listed homes and those are actually down on a year-over-year basis and that's because sellers who have other options who don't need to sell right now are exploring other options either choosing to state put, maybe remodeling if they need to state put and change these their house or renting their homes out as you mentioned. So sellers or homeowners in today's environment are aware of the fact that the housing market is challenging for buyers and aren't choosing to list at the same pace as they have in health care for backup. Yeah got puddle. And that's in auto is true now. So we haven't levered",https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TFE9bMjrlhU,27,2022-10-20 15:51:27
3743," Sellers or homeowners in today's environment are aware of the fact that the housing market is challenging for buyers and aren't choosing to list at the same pace as they have in previous years staying put instead. That's keeping home prices relatively elevated because even though we have more homes for sale, we still have fewer homes for sale than most normal in the market before the pandemic. And so we have more balance than you would expect given how much of a pullback and demand we've seen in the housing market. Really quickly, Daniel, the Fed doesn't show, hasn't shown any indication they're planning to slow down the tightening soon given where inflation is right now. So when you consider that being the driving factor we find behind this housing slowdown, how much longer do you think this last minute? Are there parallels to draw from previous market pullbacks? Yeah, I think we are going to see more trades continue to climb until inflation is back under control. So it's more about what happens to inflation, what's driving the Fed to raise rates than the Fed's actual policy decisions. Once we see inflation start to move back convincingly toward that 2% target that the Fed is aiming for, then I think we'll see more good rate steady, maybe even start to decline in anticipation on the Fed's eventual pullback and monetary policy, but that could not that could take until the end of next year to happen. So I think we're in for a challenging year ahead for the housing market realtor.com chief economist Danielle Hill appreciate your time this morning. Well, Uber is now stirring up rides, foods and now adds the right sharing company unveiling advertising options that will target riders at every point during their use of the app. That could raise eyebrows and uncomfortable questions about location and privacy. Let's bring in Dan Haley who's on top of the story. Daniel, we've sort of come become accustomed to having every part of our lives tracks, whether it's an Amazon purchase or anything else. How is this different in terms of approach? Yeah, I think you touched on it right away. Keiko is the idea that this is going to be tracking where you are and where you're going. And so the idea is that, you know, if you have a destination in mind, an airport, a specific type of store, Uber would be able to serve up ads related to those destinations. Now, obviously there's issues there that consumers and users may be uncomfortable with. Obviously with the fall of Roe v Wade, there's questions about whether or not issues of reproductive rights or reproductive locations would come into question. If you're going to plan parenthood, for instance, if Uber would have that data, and then if it would sell that data, parts of this would appear in the app. You could see it from the start of the ride when you order to your actual ride and then towards the end. And I think one of the things to take into account is Uber says that they won't be selling individual data, but it will be aggregate. But as with any kind of online data, once your information is out there, it can then be put together via other data that data brokers use to create kind of a profile about you in particular. Something that other companies have warned about in the past, particularly Apple. So it'll be interesting to see how Uber rolls this out and then what kind of reaction they get from actual Uber riders. I know I already see some ads, but they're not based on my location or destination. It's more data being collected on our lives. Dan Halley. Thanks so much for that. Well, coming up roadblocks in DC, a group from Wisconsin, asked the Supreme Court to stop the implementation of President Biden's student loan forgiveness plan. And just as online applications open up, we'll delve into the story next.",https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TFE9bMjrlhU,28,2022-10-20 15:55:19
3744," Eecelbert I'm going to do a little bit more. I'm going to do a little bit more. I'm going to do a little bit more. I'm going to do a little bit more. I'm going to do a little bit more. I hope President Biden student loan forgiveness plan faces a potential challenge in the Supreme Court. A lawsuit now filed by a group out of Wisconsin, the latest legal challenge over the plan. Let's bring in Yahoo finances, Alexis Keenan, and Alexis Timiklear here. This is a taxpayer group that's asking the Supreme Court to step in and stop the plan. plan. They are called the Brown County Tax Parassociation, that's an association that advocates for tax policy around Green Bay, Wisconsin. They want the Supreme Court to step in and an emergency order, issue an emergency saying that this student don't loan debt relief has to stop. That is unlikely to happen here. They object to the idea that the president is using the 2003 Heroes Act, an act that was passed to give relief economic relief to military families who were serving in Afghanistan in Iraq, simultaneously some of them. So this objection is really based on that what law was for a different purpose. This group goes on to say in their application to the Supreme Court that if the program goes forward as planned on Sunday, then the president will unilaterally spend roughly 4% of the nation's GDP in 2021 that was approximately $23 trillion estimates go as far as saying this program will cost taxpayers a trillion or more dollars. Now the big problem though, they're going to have is the problem that all of the parties that have challenged this law have had and that is standing and that means there has to be a particularized interest in the case, meaning they will be harmed in a way that others aren't. That's a really hard argument to make when you're talking about taxpayers because that's all of the taxpayers, right? They don't have a specific enough interest in an injury that they would suffer if this law and if this relief were to go through. Okay, so it's just important to know this is kind of the first step, but a little skeptical about how much they'll actually be able to get in front of the Supreme Court. We'll do that. We'll succeed. I know you'll see on top of it. We will. We'll like to scheme and thanks so much for that. Let's do a final check of the markets before we let you go. We're seeing all three major indices still in the green holding on to their gains with a doubt up to 258 points. That does it for me in this hour. We've got much more to come here and Yachtel Finance live. Keep it right here. All right.",https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TFE9bMjrlhU,29,2022-10-20 15:59:48
3745," constantly lose hope...... The most shares are on the move after the company beat earnings and revenue estimates in the latest quarter. The higher prices offset lower demand for its products. I have the chance to speak with CEO John Mueller about the quarter. Take a listen. Strong core business. I mean, very strong top line growth. Organic sales up 7% growth in 10 out of 10 categories in almost every market. And we're dealing with the significant headwinds from the combination of commodities, foreign exchange, transportation, and warehouse. That had a 32% impact negative on earnings in the quarter. We offset 30 of those 32 points through the combination of strong top line growth and a very strong productivity focus. So I think it speaks to a very healthy business that has bright prospects going forward. Johnny, surprise a little bit by the resilience of your categories. You did push through price increases. Prices were up at each segment, but volume did not fall off cliff. That's exactly right. If you take Russia out of the equation, volume was essentially flat versus year ago. So we've held volume with what is effectively 9% price increases. The consumer is resilient. We see that also in the mix component of top line growth with mix up a point in addition to the price increases. But we're working hard, Brian, to communicate the value that our products offer in a time of stretched household budgets. If you use Cascade Platinum in an ever-star rated dishwasher, for example, you can save $130 a year on your energy bill and save 140 gallons of water per week. So helping consumers understand those benefits has enabled us to be a positive value for us in their lives. I was joking with the I will find it's team John, dawn without a cap. That is innovation. And that is stuff you pay more for. I have done so. So what other, as you look towards next year, take us through that product innovation road map. What brands are you really keen in on and what might innovation look like last year? Because as to your point, that innovation will help you push through higher prices. Again, you're absolutely right. But value is not just price. Value is found in the intersection of price, performance, and usage experience, which is what you're speaking to with the product that you've bought. And thank you for doing that. And we're bringing innovation to market across the categories, across markets. Our intent is to build our business by growing markets and not by taking business from competition. And to grow markets, you need to innovate. And so from a spending standpoint, also on innovation, we're stepping forward, not back. It's crucial that we do that in addition to.",https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TFE9bMjrlhU,30,2022-10-20 16:04:03
3746," our gets you need to innovate. And so from a spending standpoint, also on innovation, we're stepping forward, not back. It's crucial that we do that, in addition to the smart communication, et cetera, and meeting consumers where they are and having price points and value propositions that are relevant for them. How does the messaging to consumers likely to change in coming months? How do you communicate this value? And when they walk into a target store, a Walmart store, there's a lot of choices out there, and the prices are up. Are you expecting more advertising spend? Do you change the messaging at all? We move a little bit towards what we refer to as performance-based value messaging. So I gave you an example with automatic diswashing detergent. Another example is tide cold water. If you use tide cold water in cold water, so you turn the dial on your washing machine to cold, you receive better cleaning performance than the next best brand in warm water. And you save all that money in heating the water, essentially paying for the detergent itself. So another example is on Charmin, where we have advertising that talks about roll it back. Meaning you don't need to pull as much off the roll. Sometimes you do, John. Sometimes you do. I'm just going to put that out there. I said, I go there. But in terms of the markets, look, the volume did come down in all the businesses except grooming. And I guess that's the consumer. Be a little more cautious on pricing and giving everything they're dealing with in their economic and circumstances. But anything in these numbers that would suggest, we're going into a recession here in the US the next six months. Not necessarily. I don't know how to answer that question definitively, because as you're well aware, there are lots of variables that go into that. But if we look at consumer sentiment, and one measure of that is trade down to private label brands, we're seeing very little movement. So in North America, past three in six months, private label brands increased share by only 30 basis points on a 12 month basis. They're flat, same general situation in Europe. So purely from a consumer demand and willingness to spend standpoint, we wouldn't predict a recession. But again, I'm not saying there's not going to be a recession. There are many things that go into that. These currency swings are wild, John. In many respects, I haven't seen them in my career, and I'm about almost 20 years into this gig. Because of this FX volatility, do you have to raise prices even more to offset that? Really, for currency, we're focused on productivity offsets. And we had huge productivity gains in the quarter. And that's because most of our competition is internationally domiciled, think of L'Oreal, Hankel, Byerstorf, Unilever. And they don't see that negative impact from the dollar strength. So we have to find other ways to offset it, which we are. Lastly, John, I believe you're coming up on your one-year mark officially as CEO of PNG. If you look back, what is your biggest lesson that you've learned over these past 12 months? The power of people and what our organization has been able to accomplish in very challenging time is whether it's with a war, a pandemic, the highest inflation in 40 years, they're delivering. And they're focused on continuing to serve our consumers, our customers, each other, society, and shareholders.",https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TFE9bMjrlhU,31,2022-10-20 16:08:16
3747," you you you you my dream is to clear to third quarter, 2021. And frankly, for the first couple of weeks in October, we've seen that same 10% increase. Now, when you think about that spending, think about two things. One, it is still very strong at a relative basis. Even the transactions are up 6% outpaces inflation. Travel being a very growing part because coming from last year, when we had the Delta of COVID, you know, variant to this year, people are traveling. But on top of that, though, be mindful that early in the year, there's probably more like a 13%, 14% to 12% to 10%. So it's being mitigated. So I think the Fed's changes in rates, the concerns about going out there, people are slowing down a bit, but not slowing down consistent with a real slowdown in economy yet. And that's the good news. Brian, that's interesting that you're calling out 10% growth through October. And I just talked to Proctor and Gamble CEO after their earnings. They're talking about a resilient consumer. Are you surprised by the resilience we're seeing in U.S. consumers here? Well, we talked in our earnings materials about resilient consumer, frankly. And you think about that long, two or three dimensions. First is the unemployment, obviously, still very low. People working. Second is, do they have money in their bank accounts? And the money in the bank accounts of our consumers, our 35 million core households at Bank of America. At the end of September was the same as it was at the end of August. And in fact, it's multiples, multiples over where it was before the pandemic, especially for those consumers who are in the... $100,000 under income bracket. That means that they haven't spent down the stimulus and stuff. And when I say multiples, I give you an example. Consumer had about an average of $3,500 in account, pre-pandemic, now has 13,000 in account. And it's not going down, so that's good news. So one, they have money in accounts. Two, they're spending. Three, they are employed. Four, they have capacitive borrow. Our credit card borrowings are still about 12% below where they were pre-pandemic. Home equity line draws are down about 25%, 30% still. Now mortgage finance is slowed down, because rates went up, but the people have home equity lines in place or have capacitive borrow the house by...",https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TFE9bMjrlhU,32,2022-10-20 16:12:36
3748," We're down about 25, 30 percent still. Now mortgage finances slow down because rates went up, but the people have home equity lines in place or have capacitive bar, the house values are still strong. So all that bodes well. Now inflation hurts consumers, especially consumers in modern income because inflation and goods and services they spend a lot of their income on. But, you know, so we have to be careful about the overall position versus certain types of consumers. But generally, the American consumer is very resilient. Brian, a lot of your peers on the street over the past few weeks have come out and warned about a recession sometime over the next six months. So of course, that brings us into 2023. Where does Brian want to hit? Well, I don't make those projections. I have this talented research team, one of the best in the world. If not the best in the world run by Candace Browning, Platinum team. And they basically been consistent. They have this quarter, meaning past quarter, third quarter, 22 growing. Then they have the fourth quarter, the first quarter, the second quarter, the third quarter, all, and negative territories around, half percent, one to one and a half percent. So a slight shallow down, or trend, and then growing at the end of next year. They have pushed that projection for recession out a little bit into 23. But their core belief, it's a mild recession. It's coupled with unemployment. It gets up to, you know, four to half to 5%. A Fed funds rate, likewise around 5%. But inflation does get under control and we come out of that recession. That's the core projection. Now against that though, the real facts are today, the consumers are spending commercial credits and great shape, consumer credits and gate shape. Even though things like housing and stuff like that have flattened out because that's the way the Fed slows down the economy. The reality is the consumers still are employed in earning money. And so the Fed's toughest job and inflation is also the best thing about the US economy, which is a strong consumer. So our team predicts a recession, a mild recession. They've had that projection, frankly, for six months ago, they had the same projection more or less. It just pushed out a little bit. But what we're not seeing is it come to four yet. And that keeps moving it out because of that resiliency and the consumer. By all indications, Brian, the Federal Reserve is going to continue to move higher with rates over the course of its next few meetings. What does that mean for your net interest margins over the next couple quarters? Well, one of the things that people know about banking is a core way we make a half our money or more is through what they call a spread. I hear the difference between what we lend a customer money and what we pay on the deposits and the money customers give us where we can borrow in the market. And that margin had been compressed dramatically as rates fell. And so it expands back out, getting to a more normal level, which it usually is. And that has shown a rapid increase in net interest income and II improvement over the last year. As you look forward, we told our shareholders earlier this week that we'd expect another billion dollars plus increase from the third quarter to the fourth quarter. But that's driven by the great core deposit franchise we have. We have a lot of zero interest checking balances, which are transaction accounts, which money flows for all time. That will stay in zero interest no matter what the rate environment. And the rest of our deposit rates move up and along rates move up and we get back to the 2.5% spread that we have typically made a balance sheet. This is really the basic structure banking to get back to margin in those ranges as opposed to a depressed margin under 2%. We've had the last few quarters. Want to give your team a shout out here, Brian? Global markets business, up 30% in the quarter. Strongest since the third quarter of 2010, but no trading lost days in the quarter. Despite all the market volatility we've seen, how does that happen? And do you think that can continue and just be sustained over the next few quarters? Well, it happens because we have a talent team in Jimmy D'Amara that runs a business force that has been running major parts of business for a long time, took over the whole business last year and we went on, on tag, retired. And so it's a great business. It's a team that works for Jimmy's very solid, but it also comes from a decade-long focus on responsible growth. We're in a business to move and risk through the system. We're in a business of managing risk. We're in a business of helping customers achieve what they want and not taking big principal risk. And therefore, evil and market volatility team did a good job and we didn't lose money on a trading day. But by the way, if you look back across the last 10, 12 years, very rarely do we lose money.",https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TFE9bMjrlhU,33,2022-10-20 16:17:09
3749," risk and therefore, even with Mark of all tilde team did a good job when we didn't lose money on a trading day But by the way, if you look back across the last 10-12 years very rarely do we lose money? Maybe a couple of trading days of quarter when something really changes dramatically But this year what we saw is from last year to this year the investments we've made in the last couple years in the business in terms of talent, technology, even more capital, more balance sheet capacity has shown up and that our team has a consistent drive to it and a gym and a team did a great job this quarter and we expect them to do more next quarter and lots there to unpack from Bank America CEO Brian Moynihan Mikey take it away was that ox sales in October consumer spending in October up 10% so still running at double digits despite what we're seeing with inflation and the economy's going down they had a lot of new credit card accounts that they added on during the quarter as well they got into this a little bit more on the earnings call 1.3 million new credit card accounts and you know I love talking about this shift right now that we're seeing in how consumers are spending because it's so important especially as households are really looking through where their spending capacity is that's why it was diving into retail earlier on because going into this holiday season it's just going to be a huge question of how consumers are spending where they are trying to figure out okay are we in a recession are we going into a recession and what do I need to do now preemptively to prepare for that too? Well if unemployment is going to 5% at some time in late 2023 2024 they still have some time to save, to spend, to look at guess before that happens. They have this quarter meaning past quarter third quarter 22 growing then they have the fourth quarter the first quarter the second quarter the third quarter all and negative territories around half percent one to one and a half percent so a slight shallow down and we're trending and growing at the end of next year they have pushed that projection for recession out a little bit into 23 but their core belief it's a mild recession. That was Bank of America CEO Brian Moynihan speaking with our very own Brian Saasie this morning the investment bank beat the results or beat the street we should say with results on Monday benefiting in part from higher rates. Well policy tightening has been the story of 2022 along with sky high inflation both of these factors a lethal combination for stocks and therefore not exactly fertile ground for IPOs either fewer companies are looking to navigate a listing in this environment because of the high volatility and low investor appetite in part to poor returns from last year's new issues.",https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TFE9bMjrlhU,34,2022-10-20 16:21:33
3750," I'm for IPOs either. Fewer companies are looking to navigate a listing in this environment because of the high volatility and low investor appetite in part to poor returns from last year's new issues. Here to break it all down to see how this is all playing out in the IPO slowdown. We've got SMT Global's senior writer, Brian Shied. Good to talk to you today. I guess the question here is, are we starting to see a turn? Because we have seen the big, big dip in activity. We're now in October. Are things starting to look up? So thanks for having me out at Kiko. I really appreciate it. But if we're looking at 2022 compared to 2021, 2021 was really this record setting breakout year for IPOs. You know, according to S&P Global Market Intelligence data, there were more than 3,250 IPOs in 2021. In 2022, we're on track for about half that. And that's thinking that things are going to sort of keep at the same pace, which I think most people are thinking there's going to be an additional downturn. So in the US, we're on track to about half about 1-6th as many IPOs in 2022. And it's safe to say really that all momentum from that breakout year has been lost. You know, just a little more perspective on this, you know, for the first three quarters of this year's, the IPOs worldwide raised about 144 billion. Now that's 68 billion less than what was raised in the first quarter of 2021 alone. IPO activity really has slowed down to a crawl in 2022. And I'm not sure that it gets much better from here. We have heard over and over, especially with some of these highly valued tech startups that the cops are tough when trying to come to market. They have slashed valuations. Yesterday, we saw Intel looking at a lower valuation for their IPO for mobile I. I mean, how many companies you think are willing to come to market in this environment, even with a lower valuation? So obviously, each company is very different. But you look at sort of the overwhelming factor that companies, you know, they just don't think that they can raise that much cash right now through an IPO in 2022. You know, whether or not they can take that lower valuation, I think is anyone's guess. I think right now, they'll probably wait it out a little bit longer. If you look at the biggest US IPO as of 2022, we were looking at, you know, core bridge financial, that retirement and insurance company, they raised nearly 1.7 billion last month, TPG and asset management company, raised about 1.1 billion back in January. Those are really the only billion dollar US IPO's. That's it. So you compare that to last year, you know, you had Rivian, the electric vehicle maker. They raised 11.9 billion, almost $12 billion, lucid motors, EV company raising $4.6 billion. We're just not seeing anything on that scale in 2022. And with all of the different factors that play right now, you know, Fed rate, Higgs volatility, recession fears, like it was discussed, I just don't see that number jumping that much in the fourth quarter. And we're going to have, you know, this severe downturn we're seeing in 2022 and compared to last year. And that's most likely just going to continue. So what do you think is the catalyst that could turn things around? I've heard you say over and over that you don't think things are going to turn at least in the short to medium term. What are you going to be looking for that says that maybe companies are ready to come to market again? Is it about the Fed policy? You're seeing the tightening cycle, you know, wrapping up? Or I mean, what exactly is it that companies are going to be looking for? I mean, there's all these different factors, right? You have, like I said, heightened volatility, the war in Ukraine, inflation hitting levels, we haven't seen since the early 1980s. But you did mention this. So one big thing, Fed rate hikes. That's boosted borrowing costs sort of across the board for these companies. The Fed has boosted its benchmark rate by 300 basis points since March after having this, you know, ultra low, near zero rate policy for since the beginning of the pandemic. And that really fueled that IPO growth, that record breaking growth in IPOs. We saw in 2021. Now the futures market expecting another 75 basis point hike at their meeting in November, the Fed could hike, you know, I think the expectation is almost to five percent.",https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TFE9bMjrlhU,35,2022-10-20 16:25:43
3751," Now, the futures market expecting another 75 basis point hike at their meeting in November. The Fed could hike. I think the expectation is almost to 5%, so that ramp up from 0 to 5%, but by early 2023, I think at that point, you need to see some sort of Fed pivot. And I think most people, the market, you see these jump starts going on in the stock market right now. And that's sort of this hope that becomes false hope that the Fed is pivoting. And until you see a very clear sign that that Fed pivot is happening, I don't think that you're going to have much of a turnaround in this IPO and buyer. Okay, expect a little more quiet to come here. S&P Global Senior Ryder Rineshide. Get to have you on today. Well, Netflix share seeing a boost after beating estimates for the third quarter. The streaming giant saw rise and subscriber growth once again. It's now expected to add another 4.5 million subscribers in the fourth quarter. But streaming isn't the only thing on Netflix's mind as it looks to also expand into cloud gaming. Joining us now with more on Netflix's journey ahead is Gita Ranganathan, Bloomberg Intelligence Senior Media Analyst. We've also got Dave Hedger, he is Edward Jones, Senior Equity Analysts. Welcome to both of you today. Gita, let me start with you. I mean, certainly we have seen a big rally in the stock, although you could argue it's fallen so much. Expectations were pretty low coming in. They did beat on the sub numbers. What else stood out to you? Yeah, so I think definitely the one thing that stood out is that this company is clearly back on track. I mean, of course, the 3Q numbers were definitely much stronger than expected. But I think what was equally reassuring and encouraging is the 4Q guidance came in slightly higher than consensus. And remember, this was not even factoring in a huge catalyst that they have on the horizon, which is the debut of their new ad supported tier. They're going to be pricing. This is at a really aggressive $7 price point, historically, the lowest price that Netflix has ever come out with. So it should kind of open up a whole new market for them. They're reinforcing some of their financial metrics in terms of free cash flow as well as profit margins. Yeah, indeed, to that point, the company making it pretty clear they ad supported tier are not really going to be a material impact at least in this quarter because it's being introduced a little later. But I want to point to one thing that has really stood out here, and that's the FX headwinds highlighted many times.",https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TFE9bMjrlhU,36,2022-10-20 16:30:06
3752," It's not really going to be a material impact at least in this quarter because it's being introduced a little later. But I want to point to one thing that has really stood out here and that's the FX had wins highlighted many times in this report, the sequential decline in revenue. They say it's entirely because of FX. Looking through the numbers here, they estimate full your appreciation of the dollar will negatively affect full your revenue operating income by one billion roughly each. So how does the company adjust for that? Is there anything they can do in terms of the pricing or the cost structure that will allow them to have a bit more of a buffer with the dollar expected to be strong for longer? Well, I assume they can try to adjust pricing in international markets they count for the foreign exchange pressure. However, that's a fine tight rope to be walking just in terms of you don't want to increase price too much and in turn affect subscriber growth. We do think that the ad supported service should help drive subscriber growth in international markets. So I think the lower price point will be attractive in certain markets overseas. There's more ability to pay at that lower price point. So that may be where Netflix can find some balance and certainly the revenue from the advertised and could offset the lower price point and in turn also help offset some foreign exchange pressure. Gita, as you pointed out, the company highlighting that we are back on the path to reaccelerate growth. Certainly the ad tier is something a lot of analysts have been looking to, but at the end of the day, it is a content company. And they've sort of highlighted that even as the past few quarters have not been as strong in terms of their sub numbers, engagement has still been high compared to other streaming competitors. What's that next catalyst, you think, when you look at the content pipeline for this company that could push it even higher? I think we've now seen really the steady cadence of content titles. We were kind of hit by that whole COVID log jam and they did say that that's going to take a little bit of time to kind of unwind, but we've seen them deliver consistent hits obviously. Some of their biggest hitting titles being stranger things, but then they've had a lot of newer shows that have also performed really, really well. The Jeffrey Darmarshow being a great example of that. And we're seeing them kind of hold their content budget steady, but remember, we are seeing a lot of the other streamers. A lot of the competition is also dialing back on their content spend. I think that's a really important point because maybe we're going to see some of those competitive pressures ease up a little bit as some of these streamers start to understand that profitability is becoming more and more important. And I think that really gives Netflix a leg up, as they try and get more and more bang for their buck. And this is exactly what they spoke to. They said they're getting more impact for every dollar of content spend. And we're seeing that with some of the engagement metrics that they posted. The other point that I want to make here is that with some of those engagement metrics, you come out with an advertising product. I mean, this is really so attractive to advertisers knowing that they have that deep engagement, knowing that they have a captive audience, which is on their platform for about two to and a half hours every day. Advertisers are going to be willing to pay up. And they finally is the company looks to see, looks for other levers to drive revenue. We got some news from the VP of gaming there saying that Netflix is now looking at cloud gaming as a potential. We're also going to have a cloud or gaming segment within their Southern California headquarters there or their offices there. I mean, this is a very crowded space. This would be sort of a new venture for Netflix. They've been talking about it for some time. Is this something that you think Netflix can compete in just given the players that are already in the space? Certainly, the gaming space is a challenging market and a lot of competition in that market. We view that as something that might be incremental for Netflix and in particular may not drive a lot of subscriber growth, but perhaps could help in terms of subscriber retention. I think one of the challenges.",https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TFE9bMjrlhU,37,2022-10-20 16:34:20
3753," And in particular, it may not drive a lot of subscriber growth, but perhaps could help in terms of subscriber retention. That's I think one of the challenges when the content schedule is a little more uneven that when there's that content that people are urgently wanting to watch, that's where you see turn, tick up, and people cut off their service for a while, where gaming could be another way of keeping subscribers engaged and holding on to their subscription, even when it's a time period that one of their favorite shows has already debuted and they've already watched those episodes. It is about continuing to make the platform sticky with so many of these streaming companies. Appreciate your time to both of you, Gita Ranganathan, Bloomberg Intelligence, senior media analyst, and Dave Hagar, who's used Edward Jones, senior equity analyst. Absolutely. I could go on that point of the baby formula, really weighing on their nutrition line of business down 10%, and then the COVID testing still pretty a decent demand, even though a reduction from the last quarter, the company noting that there are many global trends that are weighing, including COVID, including inflation, strong dollar, but all in all, they seem to be remaining optimistic about specifically the baby formula shortage and that sort of getting over as they reopen the planned last quarter. So that's where things stand right now. Okay, let's take a deeper dive into Abbott's numbers here with Shugun Singh, he's medical devices analyst at RBC, capital markets, joining us today. Shugun, I'm looking at where the stock is trading right now, certainly down despite some of those results. I'm imagining you've got an outperform with the price target of $132 a share, so you certainly feel like there's more upside. What do you think investors are getting wrong? No, thank you so much, firstly, for having us here. I do like the stock, we think the company does have a pretty solid long-term financial profile of growth in the high single digits on the top line and double digit EPS growth on the bottom line. If we just look at Q3 numbers, the quarter was actually pretty strong. They did beat by 700 million on the top line in about 20 cents on EPS.",https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TFE9bMjrlhU,38,2022-10-20 16:38:52
3754," to look at the Q3 numbers. The quarter was actually pretty strong. They did beat by 700 million on the top line and about 20 cents on EPS. COVID-19 testing was definitely what drove the results came in at about $1.7 billion. Consensus was looking at about 540 million in sales. So really impressive despite the summer months. If you look at a full year guidance at this point, it's 7.8 billion in COVID-19 sales, which is actually ahead of what they did last year. So pretty solid revenues in terms of COVID-19. I think what the sticking point here really is the mid-single to high-single digit underlying growth. So there were factors that impacted the quarter, such as COVID, if you back out COVID-19 testing, an infant formula recall, there was also medical device supply issues that impacted the company. So if you back out all those one-time items on an underlying basis, the company delivered about mid-single to high-single digit underlying growth, which is slightly below the longer term outlook of high-single digits. But I think it's more of a reflection of Q3, which is seasonally a weaker quarter, and then the COVID-19 environment, whether recovery is occurring, but it is at a much slower pace than what we would have liked in a normal environment. Shagun, Angelie here. I want to look at some of the very specific details that they let us know about today, one being the new plant for baby formula production. And then also looking at the library tests and looking at also models that are pretty different when it comes to direct consumer and subscription models. I know there was mention of that. I wonder if I think this all plays for a company that says, large as it is, that has had quite a diverse market so far. Yeah, I think both on infant formula recall, I think it's a good step that they are planning to, they have made some leadership changes at the Michigan facility, and they're planning to move forward with plans about half a billion dollar in investments in a new U.S. nutrition facility for specialty and metabolic infant formulas. I think there is upside on diabetes as well. And honestly, if you just take a step back and look at the company, I do like the diversified portfolio that the company has. They are continuing to move forward within medical devices. Again, nutrition business, I think they did lost about 20 share points, given the recall, they gained half of it back as of September and the impact. I think this year is about 750 million, but I think this business should recover into next year. Also in terms of diabetes, there is CMS proposed coverage guidelines for CGMs. The common period of that is open till about the 19th of November, and if expanded and coverage is approved, it could really bring more eligible patients into the population, 4 million, going to about 8 million, which is another 2 billion dollar U.S. opportunity. So I do like their diversified portfolio, and I think they do have levels to pull in terms of just diabetes, medical devices, diagnostics, and nutrition coming back. Let's elaborate on that a bit. As you pointed out, some of the sentiment that's weighing on the stock today is about the decline we've seen in COVID testing, yes, we're going into what is expected to be a period of more optics in COVID cases, but the reality is we're not going to be at the peak that we haven't over the last few years. You mentioned a long list of other levers within their portfolio. What do you think is going to be the biggest driver that gets you to that $132 share price target? Yeah, and I just want to back up. I don't think it's so much about COVID testing. It's more about, like I mentioned, investors focus on the underlying growth profile of the company when you back out COVID testing, the infant formula recall, which is about a $230 million hit this quarter again, and then the medical supply issue that they faced internationally. So I think the sticking point for investors right now is really recovery. Just in terms of COVID, I think in an endemic phase, as a base case, the company is looking for about $500 million in quarterly sales. I think that's a good place.",https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TFE9bMjrlhU,39,2022-10-20 16:43:04
3755," I think in an endemic phase, as a base case, the company is looking for about $500 million in quarterly sales. I think that's a good placeholder even for next year, which does provide some upsides. So I think, again, the mid to high single digit growth profile versus the high single digit organic revenue growth that they aspire to get to on a long-term basis. I think the variance between that is really Q3 being seasonally weaker, and then the COVID-19 environment, whether recovery is occurring, but we are not in normal times. So I think that's having an impact. So I think that's more of a sticking point than COVID-19 testing. And again, just to mention, again, they are doing about $7.8 billion for the full year. Their guidance at this point was a $7.7 billion that they did last year. Q4 includes about $500 million in quarterly sales for COVID-19 testing business. And again, that does not include any additional COVID surges or government contracts. Shuguen Singh, Medical Devices Analyst at RBC Capital Markets. Appreciate your time today and our thanks to Angelique Kamlani as well. President Biden speaking from the White House earlier at this afternoon, outlined his latest plan to lower gas prices. Let's take a listen. Today I'm announcing three critical steps at my administration will take to reduce gas prices at the pump. First, the Department of Energy released another 15 million barrels from the Strategic Petroleum Reserve, extending our previously announced release through the month of December. With my announcement today, we're going to continue to stabilize markets and decrease the prices. I've told my team behind me here to be prepared to look further, look for further releases of the months of head if needed. We're calling it a ready and release plan. All right. Let's talk about what this means for the energy markets for that. I want to bring in Alan Neckman, bullsci option dot com chief market strategist. Alan, it's great to see you. So we just got this announcement from President Biden. And then we also got the data just that regarding supplies. It seems like that's really the driver in today's action with oil back above 85. I guess your reaction first to what we just heard from the president and the potential implications. Well, the president in reality cannot control the price of energy control the price of oil or gas prices. They try and pamper it because it's a big issue for the markets.",https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TFE9bMjrlhU,40,2022-10-20 16:47:25
3756," in reality, cannot control the price of energy, control the price of oil or gas prices. They try and pamper it because it's a big issue for the markets and for people in general, especially consumers. But if you look at it, we've been trading roughly between 85 and 95 in crude oil for the last three or four months. We did have a failed test to the downside and we bounced back up again. So I'm still optimistic overall that in price could move back up once again, but let's put it in perspective. We're still half of the price from 2008, if you adjust for inflation, we have to be above $200 a barrel. It's interesting. I'd love to hear what he means by if needed, because theoretically, it's only needed politically speaking. This is not to solve an emergency as the SPR usually is. He also follows that with a tweet and it says, when the cost of oil comes down, we should see the price of the pump come down as well. That's how it should work. But right now, we're fine. We're just retailers are making record profits at the expense of Americans. What does he have right? What does he have wrong? Well, it's capitalism. Again, the president does not control the price. That'd be a whole different country if the president could determine the price of energy and he can. But that's one of the strongest sectors of the market. If you look at any of the oil companies over the last year and over the last couple of weeks, we've seen a big rebound in oil and oil services company. If you've got slumber, Jay, Halle, Burton, Oxy, everybody's had a big bounce and it looks like we're making another attack on those highs. So we've been seeing that sector lead the way here and we've seen a bounce in the overall market. Let's remember that there's still a lot more upside in these oil company stocks. They had the lowest PE of around nine or 10 compared to any sector in the S&P. So there's still more upside and money to be made in these particular stocks and sector, even though it looks like the price of gas may go maybe going higher than the near term. Alan, how much higher could the price of gas go do you think? Well, it can go back up. But again, we had a pretty sharp decline. Let's talk about what's happening in your last gas diluted to it. It's all about the dollar. The dollar had a few reversal a couple weeks ago where it made new highs and that had a lower weekly close. That is destructive for the dollar. So if the dollar can decline, that's going to be very much a positive for stocks and for oil. So that's something to watch. And the key component obviously is interest rate. Interest rates are going to top out at 5% here in 2023. And then they decline after that. 2024, 2025, they all stabilize around 4% all the way out to 2030. So that's the market telling us that the rate hike cycle is going to be done. And the dollar shouldn't go up anymore. That's going to push the energy and commodity complex higher. And that's going to hurt the consumer. But like I said, there's money to be made in some of these stocks that will benefit from it. Got to push a little bit, Dan Dicker here yesterday in the program said, $120 a barrel early 23. Do you agree with that? You at least see over $100 a barrel. Yeah, I see $100 a barrel that's again, like I said, that would be half of where we were. I know it hurts psychologically. And it's a red button issue for people. But that's still half off of 2008. The Fed got what they wanted. They knocked oil prices down. They knocked about 35%. But I see that as a temporary respite here. And Pooelk is always has price pop potential. And you understand there are certain, there are a lot of people around the world that have a vested interest in a higher energy prices. And they're going to do what they're going to do because that's how they make money. And let's talk about the energy crisis in Europe. Obviously a huge story, a huge mover here throughout the energy sector. EU companies at least right now at odds just over how best to tackle the energy crisis. What's your takeaway? I think what do you think should be done at this point? I just got back from Europe and they live a different lifestyle than we do. Their inflation rate has been much higher. And I took advantage of the strong dollar, you know, being American for that trip. You know, it's always in flux. And you know, they live in, like I said, a different lifestyle than we do. Everybody was driving the little cars and it got a good chuckle. I mean, to not see a truck. I did not see a pickup truck probably for three or four days, which is, like I said, a different lifestyle and they're just used to these things. And it's a cycle that we all have to get through. And you know, prices move up, prices move down. That's what we do as traders. We take advantage of those price movements. And I think there's more pop when it comes to these energy prices.",https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TFE9bMjrlhU,41,2022-10-20 16:51:47
3757, get through and you know prices move up prices move down that's what we do as traders is we take advantage of those price movements but I think there's more pop when it comes to these energy prices especially here in the winter time get a Gucci bag a proud of bag curious to hear how you made the shoes I got shoes okay I'm curious back here the strategic prolette petroleum reserve we're talking 1984 type levels what are the implications again it's nothing but psychology you know it's psychology and sentiment and right now it's an interesting time for me as a trader I have never seen the sentiment this negative now you know let's remember where we were in 2008 and you know things were much much different we actually had a real financial crisis now we've got too many jobs and too few people and you've got corporate profits and margins at record record levels so you know it's it's a disconnect I think the the average consumer the average American is very concerned about the economy but we're 70% off the COVID lows in the S&P and 20% off the highs we made 70 some new all-time highs just last year low so yeah the market's taken a little bit of a break but if you if you do it on a PE ratio you know we right now we're at 15 think about what percentage that is off the high back in January we're 30% off the high in the PE so stocks are cheap at some people at some point people are gonna realize that I just don't know when all right let's talk housing the fed's aggressive monetary policy to get inflation under control is impacting the housing market high mortgage rates leading to a decline in demand U.S. home building felt more than expected last month housing starts dropping with an 8% in September building permits up slightly at 1.4% but one of the biggest laggards of 13% drop in multi-unit projects national association of home builders CEO Jerry Howard joins us now with more on all this data good to see us sir all this data continues to pour in showing essentially the same things were right around early 2020 levels pre-pa or right when the pandemic took hold what concerns you the most about what's to come well it's an interesting question I think what concerns me the most is the failure of public policy makers to act to stem the tide of this housing recession virtually every reason that we are currently in a housing recession is tied directly to public policy whether it's interest rates being raised and by the way those interest rates not only impact the housing consumer they impact the builder at the front end of the pipeline as the cost of capital for the builders has gone up to get the loans to acquire the land development and construct the homes,https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TFE9bMjrlhU,42,2022-10-20 16:56:01
3758," at the front end of the pipeline as the cost of capital for the builders has gone up to get the loans to acquire the land, develop it and construct the homes. It's a double whammy on the cost of capital. We're still having labor problems. We've got to get our immigration situation fixed. We're still having supply chain problems as a hangover from the pandemic. And we're still having regulatory problems, whether it's regulations involving the importation of lumber from Canada, labor regulations, environmental regulations or simply the reinstitution of the regulations that the Trump administration did away with. Right now it's a it's a perfect storm for housing. We're predicting that well this year we'll be the first year since 2011 that we built fewer houses than we did the year before. We're worried about next year not really looking for much of a turnaround until 24. That was the kitchen sink approach right there your colleague Jerry Contr, the chairman of the NHAB said quote with inflation continuing to run above an 8% annual rate since March it's truly disingenuous of President Biden to hail their progress on inflation without recognizing the cost of it. Do you agree with that sentiment and what can the president do to fix this situation? Well, in fact, we talked with the White House today. They assure us that they are taking the housing situation seriously. Obviously we'll see what actions they take. This housing recession is being caused by inflation that is a direct result of a supply shortage. The administration can do everything that I just mentioned correct all those egregious policies and make it easier to build homes that'll in the inflation. Jerry, let's start with labor. One of the things that you just cited in terms of some of the problems that you are facing. It's interesting because I was actually looking at a tweet from an economist that we've had on Yahoo Finance a number of times Diane Swank and she was saying that we could actually see job cuts from home builders because of the fact that the backlogs are declining and demands dropping. But it sounds like at least from your perspective that you still can't find the number of workers that you need. Is that right? When we are operating in a normal economic environment, we are woefully short of skilled labor. Obviously when we're in a recession and building slows down, yeah, we're not in the same boat. But remember, housing has always led the country out of every recession since World War II. If we don't have labor, if we don't have a supply of building materials that can be counted upon to get there on time, we're not going to be able to lead the country out of a recession. And I don't know what a sector of the economy can do it. None has done it since, as I said, World War II. You mentioned a conversation with the White House. How did they push back on your recommendations and will housing lead us into a recession? Well, we're already in one. Housing is clearly in a recession right now. I believe, and I think that most economists are now starting to come around that the likelihood of an overall recession is greater every day, hopefully. And right now, I think people are saying it would be a shallow and a short-lived one. But I think that, yeah, we're headed into an overall economic recession. I think the White House is very aware of what's going on. To the administration's credit, they noted that we had an affordable housing issue, and we also had a housing affordability issue, two distinct problems. They've noted that from the time they were campaigning, but I think the time to put it on the front burner. And that's what they need to do is put housing on the front burner of all the domestic policies. Jerry, is this answer right now, just in terms of what is the biggest problem facing housing industry? Is it more of a demand problem? Is it more of a supply problem? What do you see at least right now today? Right now, it's probably about 50-50, interest rates have definitely driven demand down. But we still have a major supply problem, which is why, unlike during the Great Recession, when you saw how prices completely plummet, there's sort of a buffer this time in that there's not enough of a supply for housing values to go all the way down into the tank. It's going to be a unique situation where phase-",https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TFE9bMjrlhU,43,2022-10-20 17:00:20
3759," Sort of a buffer this time in that there's not enough of a supply for housing values to go all the way down into the tank. It's going to be a unique situation we're facing right now. But Jerry, by some respects, it's still relatively healthy because we're seeing prices still increase, it's just the rate of increases cooling. Where will prices get to? Do you believe we're talking 2019 pre-pandemic levels? If they got there, that would be about as low as I think they get. In this episode of influencers, Katie Curry, former Today Show host and author of Going There. I think that people who spread it, who are quote unquote super spreaders, should be held liable for spreading disinformation, whether it's about COVID or vaccines or about Sandy Hook. I think journalism is still a really noble profession. The problem is so much of journalism has seeped into commentary. I hope that I'll be seen as somebody who did what my father told me my entire life. Do your best and that's what I've done. Hello everyone, I'm Andy Sirware and welcome to InfluentSurs. And welcome to our guest, Katie Curry, a course former host of the Today Show, CBS Evening News, co-founder of Katie Curry Media and author of the book Going There and My Former colleague at Yahoo, which we'll get to. I'm sure Katie, welcome. Great to see you. Hi Andy, great to be here. Thanks for having me. Of course. Why don't we start out before we talk about the book? I'm curious to know about Katie Curry Media and what you're up to and what's that all about. Well, I love sort of being the boss of me as our kids used to say Andy and about three and a half years ago, my husband and I saw that the media landscape was changing dramatically. I actually noticed that over the past decade or so. And instead of depending on people to give me a job, I decided I wanted to be a job creator. I wanted to try my hand at being an entrepreneur. And that I thought the brand that I had established over 30 to 40 years in media was as powerful as some of the bigger brands and would be enabled me to really personalize the news and view it from my perspective. So we decided to be pan media. We have a newsletter that goes out to well over half a million people with a very high engagement rate. We have a podcast. I'm going to be recruiting other talent to contribute. And we already have done that. We have somebody who's our book editor. We have a very vibrant relationship with Bobby Brown also used to be at Yahoo. And so we're really establishing a collective of voices. And in the meantime, I'm also developing documentaries. I have a couple of scripted projects and development. I was an executive producer of a series on Netflix called Unbelievable. And I want to realize, Andy is storytelling has changed dramatically. It's no longer siloed. You can, the dissentral mediation allows you to go direct to consumer just as brands are doing. And we now have about 35 people working at the company. And really what I'm trying to do, we also have a shop that has picks of what we think are purpose driven brands and female founded by pot founded LGBTQ plus founded companies that we're supporting and really shining a light on. So it's been really exciting because you know, it's hard working for a big lumbering bureaucratic organization at times. And I find",https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TFE9bMjrlhU,44,2022-10-20 17:04:38
3760," Well, it's been really exciting because, you know, it's hard working for a big, lumbering bureaucratic organization at times. And I find that I can be much more nimble and I can create content at the drop of a hat, a drop of a hat, or I can do longer profiles and series. And really explore topics I'm interested in that I think are worthy of a listener or reader or viewer's attention. What do you think about TV news right now, Katie? And, you know, we're seeing the emergence of streaming services like CNN plus. And what does that mean for the industry? How would you describe it? Well, I think it's just another way to provide interesting content to consumers. You know, it'll be interesting to see if people are gonna pay for those services when there is so much news everywhere. I mean, I'm just inundated with news 24-7. And a lot of it is really high quality. I was just reading a great piece this morning on Joe Manchin and the Rolling Stone that someone brought my attention to. So I think it'll be an interesting experiment to see if people are gonna want that content. Will they wanna see Chris Wallace doing interviews? I'm not sure. Maybe hardcore Chris Wallace fans will, but it seems to me that there is so much news that's so ubiquitous now that they're gonna have to provide something that is really unique. And I think they're trying to do that with sort of the model of Anthony Bourdain, which, you know, was established on CNN many years ago with Eva Longoria. You know, I just don't know at what point I guess is the content overload Andy, you know? Is there just so much to choose from? Will the cream still rise through the top? Probably, but will it be enough to sustain some of these newer business models? I'm not sure. Right, and then ubiquity is both a blessing and a curse from the consumer standpoint, because there is so much out there, but then how do you choose? And so I'm sure you're asked this question, Katie, people ask me all the time, what do you look at? What do you read? And how do you decide what to look at when there is so much stuff? Well, you know, I do rely primarily on newsletters and on Apple news. And, you know, I remember when I was at Yahoo with you, Andy, I begged for them to let me start a newsletter that would basically go straight to people's inboxes and help kind of churrate the things they needed to know. You know, they weren't interested in that at Yahoo for a variety of reasons, which we can talk about later and sort of what Yahoo's ultimate business goals were at the time. But, you know, I read a lot of newsletters. I try to read the economists. I look at Time Magazine. I read The New York Times, The Washington Post. I read various newsletters from reporters from those outlets. I read The Pointer Institute. Tom Jones does a media newsletter. The Pew Center Research Center does kind of what's going on in media. I'm interested in kind of looking at trends. I read The Information by Jessica Lesson. So I really try to get a good cross section of helpful and useful information. And sometimes I just look at Apple news and see what's trending. And if there are articles that I'm interested in. And I feel like I really get a good sense of what's going on in the world with the malcom of sources that I turn to.",https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TFE9bMjrlhU,45,2022-10-20 17:09:15

Is it early days, middle days, sometimes? I think it's you know, I think it's early days, um, but I think maybe early to middle days, Andy. You know, I think this is so important and I think it, you know, you can't just wave a magic wand. Um, it's it's there's there's so many factors I think contributing to this imbalance of power that have been entrenched in our society for decades, if not centuries. And so one of the things that I hope we can do is have honest conversations about this. I think that's so imperative. And if my book models that, and that's something I'm really pleased about. And because I think what happens is, um, you know, there, there's, there's progress and then there's a backlash. There's progress and then there's a backlash. And I think having open and honest conversations and not, you know, canceling people because they say the wrong thing or not, uh, rejecting them. And so you know, it's like, I think that's why I think it's not just a lot of things that are out of hand because of the way that they see things which and their products of their own environment. Is a really important component to leveling the playing field for everyone. You write a course about, we talked about Matt Lauer, or I mentioned him, I should say in the problems, and let's moon this. worse than other businesses, or is it just that they're more high profile? You know, it's hard for me to answer that question Andy because I haven't really been in other businesses. But having said that, I do think they're more high profile. I think there's probably a little more, you know, it's not exactly a low profile.",https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TFE9bMjrlhU,46,2022-10-20 17:13:35
3762," or high profile, I think there's probably a little more, you know, it's not exactly a low-key or low-profile industry. So I think probably the ego level, men in television in general and sort of media is probably feeds into or fed, excuse me, fed into certain behavior for many, many years. So I think that, you know, I think it was just sort of business as usual. It was sort of the status quo for this kind of behavior. I think it was not only tolerated, but in some cases encouraged in television news and especially as women were entering that industry and significant numbers, I think we forget that, you know, I graduated from college Andy in 1979 and this was when women were really entering the workplace in big numbers. And so it was male dominated for quite a while. Women were in positions that were dependent on their male bosses. So that created a dynamic that just, I think, opened up for a lot of abuses. That, and add to that kind of the culture that existed, you know, a bit of Hollywood, we're going to make you a star. I control your fate. You are subservient to me and I think that provided a recipe for that kind of really unacceptable behavior. Any of them come back or should they be allowed to come back or talk about canceling people and people paying the price? I think a lot of it depends on your response to the allegations. I think people who recognize, I think James Franco did something very interesting that we haven't seen with a lot of these men who had been, and I think that I don't know, we could have a whole conversation of the word canceled. You know, I think they were removed with cause. I think canceled sometimes suggests that a small, you know, a smaller or infraction or whatever was overly penalized. So I think James Franco talked about, you know, getting help, acknowledging his issues and trying to understand the damage that he did. And I think that other people should probably take a page from that playbook and do some serious introspection and then try to kind of contribute to, you know, be the change that we hope to see instead of kind of digping in their feels. But, you know, I think with any kind of social movement, there is bound to be some collateral damage. Right. Good point about how I use the word canceled, by the way. Well, I mean, I know I appreciate that. No, you are spot on. You are spot on. I want to switch over and get back to some of those tech companies in the platforms a little bit because they're so powerful. And, you know, they're relying on them. We're relying on them. We're one of them in a way. But Facebook, Twitter, how are you thinking about them, Katie? Are they to blame for the widespread proliferation of misinformation? Should they be held responsible? Should they be broken up? I mean, there are a thousand big questions there. But just your thousand foot take. You know, it's, I wish I were even, you probably are more of an expert on this Andy than I am. I was a co-chair of the Aspen Commission on disinformation. And obviously we took a close look at some of these platforms.

3763," We took a close look at some of these platforms. I mean, I think the problem with disinformation in our society is very multi-dimensional, but the algorithms and the way things are shared and amplified certainly I think have been fueled by the social media platforms. You know, it's also lack of trust in mainstream media or more traditional media outlets and also the democratization of information where everyone who has a digital device or an iPad or a computer can spread misinformation and disinformation and malinformation. And so I think that we really do need to look, take a close look at the liability of some of these platforms that claim they are not a publisher that they're just a platform. And Congress should get involved. I think the federal government needs to have a more unified approach because I don't think there's really a centralized policy arm of the government to deal with this. President Obama says disinformation is the biggest threat for our democracy. Certainly when you look at things like the big lie and the fact that more than 60, you know, courts and judges have said there's no merit to the argument that the election was rigged, that it was one of the fairest elections in our history, but the fact that this persists that a huge percentage of the public and particularly the Republican Party continues to believe that the election was rigged. Obviously they're getting this information and it's being reinforced over and over again. And though people gave me a hard time because when I was on Bill Mar, I talked about the need for people to be deprogrammed, which really met just kind of separating themselves from the information that they're being almost being almost brainwashed to believe through the repeated serving up of disinformation. So I think we need to take a multi-approach and and get everyone involved. And I think that people who spread it, who are quote unquote super spreaders should be held liable for spreading distance, disinformation, whether it's about COVID or vaccines or about Sandy Hook. And I think that platforms need to be more aggressive about monitoring it. Of course the problem and it's not a problem, but the sticky wicked in America is free speech. And how do you balance free speech with the need to have outright lies be removed and not see the light of day where unfortunately an audience is receptive to believing them? It's an complicated topic, is there anything? But it does go back to can you yell, fire in a crowded theater? I mean, it's also timeless, but now it's just this new way of getting the information that's sort of, it's a super spreader. Yeah, and I think the Supreme Court, the Supreme Court said you cannot yell fire and it's very sad. You're absolutely right, thank you. And similarly, I think this is the semantic version of yelling fire in a crowded theater. And I think the technology has almost outrun the ethical considerations of all this, but it's a really serious problem. I think it's shaping up to even be more serious in 2024. And so it's something that we need to pay attention to.",https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TFE9bMjrlhU,48,2022-10-20 17:22:00

So we're talking about people from all kind of socio-economic backgrounds, Andy, people from different, who've had different experiences.",https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TFE9bMjrlhU,49,2022-10-20 17:26:10

So we're talking about people from all kind of socioeconomic background zandee people from different, who've had different experiences because of their race and ethnicity. We need to be kind of this great American will, by between 44 white people will be in the minority in this country. And we just need to make sure that our journalists represent the people they're serving. Having said that, I do think we need to look at the model of journalism. And I know a lot of people are thinking about this and talking about it. How can we restore trust in the media? How can we be less polarized and speak to just one audience or the other? I think that's a really challenging question. But I think it's one that deserves a lot of attention and thought. And I think we need a lot of people, young people, smart, young people, who can maybe look at it and look at it in a different way. And are we forever going to be siloed and have our own information? My friend Nicole Seligman talks about affirmation instead of information. I think these are all big, head-e-medie topics. And we need the greatest minds in the country to focus on them. So I would encourage people, especially idealistic people to go into journalism. Great. We're almost at a time, Katie. So quickly, if you can, what do you see as your legacy? Well, I hope that I contributed to the national conversation and help people understand complicated issues. I hope that I helped show that women were capable. And that it's interesting to think about the fact that in 2006, it was such a big deal to have a woman do the evening news. And now we see the evening news is declining in terms of its influence and importance. They still have a lot of people watching, but much older demographics. And I think very few young people are watching the network evening newscast. But I hope that I helped move the ball a little bit forward for women. Was an easy, I write extensively about my experience at CBS. And I think I was met with a lot of resistance there, partially because I think, well, there are a whole lot of reasons, which I detail in the book. But I hope that I moved the ball forward for women, whether it was asking that I had a 50-50 division of labor on the today's show with Brian Gumball, or took the leap and became the first solo female anchor of an evening newscast. And I also hope that I try to explore important topics and do it honestly. And that I have the vulnerability and humility to say when there were times when I didn't get it right. I don't know any journalists who batted 1,000 for decades. And I think that I'm proud of myself that I had the courage to say maybe I could have done something differently, or why did I approach a topic this way? Or here were some of the factors that were influencing me when I was making decisions. Because when all is said and done, journalists are human beings. They're not perfect. They try, I think, to do the best job they can, mostly. And so I hope that I'll be seen as somebody who did what my father told me my entire life do your best. And that's what I've done. And sometimes it's been great. And sometimes I've fallen on my face. But to me, that's kind of a life well-lived. And the ability to admit that is, I think, takes a lot of guts. Hey, DeCork.

3766," and the ability to admit that is I think takes a lot of guts. Hey, DeCork. Thank you so much for your time. Thanks, Andy. You've been watching Influencers. I'm Andy Sirware. I'll see you next time. Welcome back to OutFine. It's I'm Brian Sousy alongside Julie Hyman and Brad Smith. You have some we will have soon surely some breaking news on existing home sales, but Julie, over to you right now we're seeing the markets off ahead of that news. Yeah, we have it and it looks like it's pretty much in line with estimates here existing home sales coming in an annual pace of 4.71 million. It is a decline month over month of about one and a half percent. We also by the way got the index of leading economic indicators down about four tenths of one percent, but there's been a lot of attention on the housing market. We also by the way just got the news from Freddie Mac about the average 30 year fixed mortgage rate rising to 6.94 percent. And it's obvious the effect that is having when you look at that existing home sales number and the declines that we are seeing there is that higher interest rates are having an effect on the ability of people to buy homes here. Eighth straight month that we saw the existing home sales number decline. That is the longest declining streak that we have seen since 2007. And obviously 2007 was when we were beginning to see the housing collapse and the beginnings of the great financial crisis. And so interesting here that we are seeing that even though most predictions are not for something similar to happen this time around because the tendrils of the housing market and the capitalization of the banks and other lenders is in a different stage now than it was at that point in time. So all of that said this does show the sort of continuation of the waning housing market partly as a result of higher rates. Yeah, I'll add too. I believe yesterday just tracking some redfin data that they reported on housing. They noted in September 60,000 deals were called off. So that was you continue to see that slow down. Redfin has reporting some very good stats on this. It's going to be a question too of where there's going to be supply that continues to come on the market, whether that's on the new homes front and actually being able to complete some of those projects. But then also on the existing side, if you have perspective sellers that are now looking at the market and saying where we're going to find buyers, then that's still going to have a contraction in the supply that's actually coming through. And so that is a particular risk in the near term as well, even as the rates are rising and compressing the amount of buyers that are prospectively out there, the sellers, the sell side of the equation, that's also still seeing its own looking across the market and saying, all right, well, why would we list our house now if there's not going to be people who are able to bid on it right now at this price? Yeah, and to your point, the number of homes for sale declined to 1.25 million in September from 1.28 million in August. So we continue to see that number go down a little bit. In the meantime, regional Fed officials outreceling some comments on Fed policy. The out-of-finance is Jen Schomburger has the details we heard from the likes of James Bollard. Good morning, that's right. Julie St. Louis Fed President James Bollard says he expects the Fed to end frontloading aggressive interest rate hikes by sometime early next year, but still maintain an aggressive policy stance. Now, Bollard who made these comments in a Bloomberg TV interview Wednesday suggested he doesn't need to see rate pushed higher than that 4.5 to 5% range currently projected by the committee. Bollard told Bloomberg, rather, he thinks next year the Fed will be closer to running what he calls, quote, ordinary monetary policy. He said the Fed is at the right level of policy rate to full inflation and can adjust as the data come in. Now, these comments coming as the Fed has said it will be appropriate at some point to slow down the pace of interest rate hikes and assess what the current rate hikes impact has already had on the economy. Elsewhere, Minneapolis Fed President Neil Cash Carrey said that the Fed could potentially pause interest rate hikes sometime next year if inflation cools. Cash Carrey Carrey told Brawler's Institute that he thinks inflation will level out over the next few months, but underscored he doesn't yet the evidence that core prices, which of course, exclude volatile food and energy costs are moderating.",https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TFE9bMjrlhU,51,2022-10-20 17:35:05
3767," out over the next few months, but underscored, he doesn't yet the evidence that core prices, which have forced exclude volatile food and energy costs, are moderating. Now, these are some of the last comments from Fed officials on monetary policy before we go into that so-called blackout period, ahead of the Fed's next interest rate policy meeting, and less than two weeks, Fed officials widely expected to raise that benchmark interest rate and the basis point again for the fourth meeting in a row, guys. Is there any inclination to or anything that we can extrapolate from Bollard's comments, especially as we were just talking about the housing market as well? Bollard seemed to be acknowledging at least of the equation there and what the housing market represents or does not represent, but is there a clear sense of how the Fed will continue to monitor housing particularly, even as they're going along in their policy pathway? Well, two points there, obviously on the housing front, that is the one that has been most sensitive to the interest rate heights and is seeing the cooling. Fed officials are still waiting for those rate heights to penetrate other sectors of the economy. So while they are seeing some progress on the housing front and other interest rate sensitive sectors, they're still waiting for that to filter through. Now, I think there was sort of an understanding from the market that perhaps the Fed could get even more hawkish on the back of an increase in the core inflation on the CPI reading that we got last week, moving up to six points that percent in September from six point three in August. But Bollard is towing the line here saying, look, I think that our interest rate projections are the correct path policy path for right now. And that's exactly what Mary Dalley told me last week as well. So perhaps that could give investors some solace that the Fed is still looking at that range of four and a half to five percent as the peak rate on the Fed funds rate. All right, go finance his own Jen Schaunberger Jen. Thanks so much for breaking this all down. The Bollard commentary and where this all sits well or not so well with the markets. Let's continue the conversation on markets with an eye to what fiscal and economic policies have worked and what hasn't in the past. Our next guest is out with a new book called a monetary fiscal history of the United States. Joining us now we've got Alan Blender, who is the Princeton University professor of economics and public affairs. Alan, great to have you here with us this morning. First, you just heard some of you. Absolutely. You just heard some of the comments from Fed Representative Bollard. James Bollard essentially saying within this policy pathway going forward from here that there could be a pivot sometime in the future but they're going to wait to see if their policy is actually taking effect. What data would you be most notably looking towards to see where that policy is actually being ingested fully by the economy? Well, I think there's no doubt that you look first at housing as you were just talking about. If you go back through the history of the Federal Reserve in recent decades, I'm not talking about the 1920s. When monetary policy tightens, it has its principal effects on spending in two places. One is new houses and the other is automobiles. So the spending on houses looks like it's behaving like it adds in previous Fed tightnings. It's very sensitive because people finance it with mortgages. The spending on automobiles is a lot trickier because as you all know, we've had this crazy cycle where people couldn't buy cars. They weren't enough cars to buy because they weren't enough chips to make cars and a lot of automakers who've got backlogs. Now, a backlog is one thing. People come back out of their intention to buy a car. But I think it's at least believable hypothesis that the impact on automobiles sales will be less than it normally has been in the past because of this backlog. Alan, it's Julie here. As you look across back at the history of monetary policy, it seems like no matter what the Fed does, there are always critics of the Fed and what it's doing. There's always this kind of backward looking. They should have done this. They should have done that. As you look at that kind of history, what lessons do you take away for the Fed today? I guess you can't entirely avoid that kind of criticism.",https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TFE9bMjrlhU,52,2022-10-20 17:39:25
3768," done that. As you look at that kind of history, what lessons do you take away for the Fed today? I guess you can't entirely avoid that kind of criticism, but maybe to lessen it. You know, the old Joe Klein was that something that they paid them to make boxwar. If you actually look at Federal Reserve salaries, you would see how lovely they are. The answer to your question is it's part of the job description. The Federal Reserve knows that it's going to get criticism from one side or the other. Often both, some people criticizing it for being too selfish, some people for being too hawkish. By the way, that's happening now. That's not that unusual. I can remember just to give you an anecdote. In 1994, when we started raising interest rates, I was vice chairman of the Fed. And that was, by the way, ended up with the perfect soft landing. The absolutely perfect soft landing, the best the Fed has ever done. But we were criticized tremendously for wrong footing in the markets and surprising them by raising interest rates, even though Greenspan had signaled that months before. So it's just part of the atmosphere. It's the air you breathe has criticism in it if you're a FFED. Alan, yesterday I spoke to Bank of America CEO Brian Moynihan and he was talking a lot about a recession. Take a listen. Love to get your reaction on the back side. Our team predicts a recession, a mild recession. They have had that projection, frankly, six months ago. They had the same projection more or less. It just pushed out a little bit. But what we're not seeing is it come to for you yet. And that keeps moving it out because of that resiliency and the consumer. Alan, do you agree that if we are going into recession, that it will be mild? I think so. Now, one never knows because all kinds of unknown things can happen. Like a big oil shock from OPEC. I don't think that will happen, but it's possible. So events on, on proceed events can upset the apple card. But I think my central prognostication, if you want to call it that, is very similar to what Mr. Moynihan was just speaking about. But the signal exception and its trivial is that a few months ago, I was not saying it would happen in 2022. It would probably happen in 2023, which is what I hear him saying. There are a number of reasons to think it will be fairly mild. I'll just take off too. One is the huge amount of liquidity that consumers have accumulated largely because of the transfer payments that were made to lessen the impact of the terrible pandemic recession. So consumers are sitting on a cash pile, depending on how you measure it of 2 trillion, 2.5 trillion. So that's going to be enabling them to bolster their spending, even if their factory incomes go down. And the second thing that's rarely discussed, but Neil Kashkary is a good example of it, you had him on a moment ago. This is a fairly dovish FOMC, Federal Open Market Committee. They vary. It's human beings that are making these decisions. And sometimes the committee has a very hawkish tilt there eager to raise rates that vary, very inflation of worse. And sometimes they're more hawkish and they're more concerned about the employment impacts. They're still trying to get inflation down. No question about that. It's a matter of degree. And I think by historical standards, this is a fairly dovish FOMC. And what that means to me is they're less likely to overdo it. Kind of piggybacking on something that you just mentioned a moment ago, Alan. I mean, we are emerging from a situation, a crisis that none of us had ever been through in our lifetimes with the coronavirus pandemic. And with that, you had seen economies around the world try to stimulate growth once again, coming out after that. But now there's the larger question of on a global front on a global picture here, where one economy's troubles may be a precursor to another's or where they may not be. And do you believe that there's anything within Europe right now that is a precursor to what the US may be heading towards? A little bit. That's easy.",https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TFE9bMjrlhU,53,2022-10-20 17:43:40
3769," And do you believe that there's anything within Europe right now that is a precursor to what the US may be heading towards? A little bit, it's easy to, you know, it's hard to put the right spin on this. I don't want to say it doesn't matter, but it's easy to exaggerate it also. Point one is that Europe is almost certainly headed for a worse recession than we are. They are more impacted by the food and especially. Looks like we've got Professor Blinders shot froze, unfortunately. We got some gremlins today. We got some gremlins today. Well, all right, nonetheless, we will continue to watch all things Fed policy. Very interesting point there, Alan Blinder, making about a potential recession next year. If anything, he's looking forward to maybe be mild. He actually, I think we got him back. Alan, do we have you back? I'm here. Can you see me? Yes, we are. I wanted to get you actually for one last question here. And that has to do with the report in the New York Times today. Gina Smilak over there. Talk to you about some comments that James Bullard made on the sidelines down in DC, while the IMF meetings were going on to a private audience of city clients. And this is a pretty rare occurrence for a Fed governor to make comments on monetary policy to a private group. I'm just wondering if you could give us your take on that. It is unusual. It's not unheard of. It is unusual. And I'm sure Jim Bullard understood. I don't know the occasion. But I mean, I was sometimes in positions like that when I was vice chairman of the Fed. And I'm sure Jim Bullard understands that after more than three people in the room, there wasn't really a provocation. It was going to leak out. And so I'd rather doubt that he would have said anything to that group that he wouldn't say on television. Makes sense. Yeah, appreciate that perspective. Alan Blinder, Princeton University professor of economics and public affairs and author of a monetary and fiscal history of United States. Always good to see Alan. We'll talk to you soon. All right, before we had to break, let's shed light on some positive comments on the retail sector from Wells Fargo, analyst, Ike Barchow. The analyst says his data shows US consumer demand continues to be stable across the mall notes barchow. It appears most companies took their medicine and set more prudent plans post their summer slowdowns. And as such, we see much less near term risk in the third quarter.

Until yesterday, there was a widely held view in her party that a leadership change should wait at least until a new economic plan is announced on October 31st to calm financial markets. But infighting within the Tory party and a realization that she will no longer be able to fulfill her promises sped up that process. The British government will hold a leadership election within the next week. And Marble or Maker, Philip Morris reported third quarter earnings before the bell this morning.

It's just beginning here, but we've already heard several executives talk about the impact the strength of the dollars head on the top and bottom lines. The dollar has been on a tear, having his best quarterly performance in seven years. But why exactly does this impact companies? And how can they hedge against it? Professor Julie Heimann is here for her debut of Yahoo! You, Julie, take it away. All right, take your seats, Jens, because class is indeed in session. We have seen this enormous strength in the dollar this year. We've been talking a lot about it. It has meant about a 14% rally for the dollar versus the likes of the euro, 30% rally versus the Japanese yen. If you look at the year to date, you've seen the dollar index versus a basket of currencies. Go higher. What does this mean in real terms? Well, let's say I had a company called Jules Tools. I saw all kinds of stuff, Square Drive or Samarice, Power Drills. What have you? Let's say I have a big business in the EU and I sell 1000 euros worth of hammer. It's in the European Union. If you go back to March, that sale, if I brought it back to profits here in the US, would be worth about $1,112.40. However, as of yesterday, it was worth less than $1,985 or so. So this tells you in real terms, when you bring those profits back to the United States, what happens? It's the inverse of you going to vacation over in Europe and having more power to spend there. So, a lot of companies have already talked about this effect. We've already heard so many during this earning season thus far from the netflix's and proctor and gambles of the world, for example. Proctor and gamble, for example, saying that it's going to take a head of $3.9 billion over the next year. I forgot that I controlled this and you don't. So here are the various companies that we're seeing here, Guy's Tesla, one of the companies also talking about the currency impact, netflix making these kinds of comments as well, that it's really costing these companies billions of dollars as we are seeing the currency effect. So, most of the currency strategies we've spoken to are same.",https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TFE9bMjrlhU,55,2022-10-20 17:52:28
3771," these kinds of comments as well that it's really costing these companies billions of dollars as we are seeing the currency effect. And most of the currency strategies we've spoken to are saying the dollar is going to continue to go up. So this is not something that's over. So what can companies do in order to try and hedge against the dollar strength? That's something we hear about frequently, this hedging activity. There's a couple things we can do. Jules Tools can pay workers in local currency. In other words, if I have workers in the European Union that are making those hammers, I can just keep the euros there and pay the workers in that currency. I don't have to bring it back to the United States. So that's one way that I can do it. Another way I can do it is issue debt in that foreign currency. So for example, I can sell corporate bonds denominated in euros and that way I don't have that currency translation effect that is hitting my bottom line. So that's another way that we can hedge potentially. But overall, this is undoubtedly going to have an effect on corporate profits here. A 2% increase in the trade-weighted dollar will subtract about a percent from earnings per share in the United States for S&P 500 companies. And according to City and JP Morgan, they estimate that if you see a 10% increase in the dollar basket, it could cut S&P earnings by 15 to 20 dollars a share. So we're talking about a substantial effect here and this is why we've been hearing about companies offsetting it in a number of different ways, including raising prices. But this is a theme that is going to stick around for a while. Yeah, it's definitely impacting companies in a big, big way, really good stuff. Julie, I think that's the debut of the Julie emoji here on Yago Fine. Yeah, I think what for you, Brad? I look at mine. It looks exactly like us. I don't know how they come up with these things. You're just always good. And I'm excited for the new Julie emoji within this, though, the impact that you're mentioning. I mean, we've already gotten into some of the tech companies, but we're just at the tip of the iceberg for some of the tech companies that are going to be reporting and talking about effect. And when you're talking about the hedging that the tech companies can do, for example, if I am a software company, most of my developers are likely in the United States. So I can't do that keeping the currency local situation quite as well to account for expenses. I got to bring that money back to pay my programmers. Top work there, my friend, Professor Hyman. Very good stuff. I very much enjoyed that. All right, coming up, we'll speak to the CFO of AT&T on the back of their third quarter earnings report. MUSIC",https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TFE9bMjrlhU,56,2022-10-20 17:57:08
3772," yes Here's a VAT&T. We're moving higher this morning after the telecom company reported third quarter earnings showing 708,000 post paid phone net ads and a 6% rise in mobility revenue year of a year. AT&T, CFO, Pescal, Deroch joins us now to discuss Pescal. Good to see you again. Three months ago we were here having a conversation at a time. Your stock was down double digits and you weren't worn on free cash flow. Now today the stock is up and there seems to be a different tone on this earnings release. Why is that the case? Look, good morning Brian, good morning everybody. Maybe let me just start. I think this journey dates back to a couple of years ago. What we've said is we were going to invest to re-energize growth in this business with a priority towards re-energizing wireless and fiber growth. For a long time we said that that investment initially would reduce earnings but over time would produce significant returns. And as late last year we said that the second half of this year earnings would start to see the benefits of all the work that's been done. So things are playing out exactly as we said. And look, overall I'd be remiss if I didn't thank my colleagues across the company for all their hard work and getting us to this point. In terms of what's different now, I think last quarter there was a bit of an overreaction by I think the marketplace and some of the media. In the end what we flagged and we tried to effort to be really transparent. What we were seeing in the marketplace. What did we see? We saw that there was a normalization of collection patterns back to pre-pandemic norms. That hasn't gotten any worse. It's pretty much the same. And in terms of overall delinquencies I've been saying this since the spring, we are probably slightly worse than pre-pandemic norms. But all of them are really strong fundamentals. The thing to keep in mind is our business has a history of performing well even in challenging economic times. And we don't expect this time to be any different. You know, that's an amazing acknowledgement here, especially as we think about the fact that within the market consumers are paying more in some of their other necessities that they have to account for as well. And so when it comes down to their telecommunications service provider, like an AT&T, in the delinquencies that you are seeing, where are you also seeing perhaps the either type of device that customers that are net ads may be opting in for? Is it on the higher tier? Is it on the mid tier? And what type of service for those devices as well? Yeah, and I would say it's a bit across the board. First and foremost, consumers as a general matter, more and more people are signing up to higher price plans because of the value that those plans provide in terms of additional bandwidth. But not everyone is taking the device promotions. In fact, a meaningful portion of our subscriber additions and wireless come through our business relationships. And that channel has been and continues to be really efficient source of generating new subscribers. And so we're benefiting from that. And we're seeing just the consistency of our offer quarter after quarter, resonating with customers. And our sales team know how to execute it. And all those things are contributing to continued improvement.",https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TFE9bMjrlhU,57,2022-10-20 18:01:09
3773," are offered quarter after quarter, resonating with customers. And our sales team know how to execute it. And all those things are contributing to continued improvement in, continue growth in subscribers, as well as higher R-PROs. You layer on top of that, a better international, more international travel, also contributing to higher roaming revenues. All those things are driving improvements in R-PRO. And we've been doing a lot of work in our cost structure, and you're starting to see some of that benefit come through to the bottom line. So we feel really good about how we're performing. Pascal, it's Julie here. So obviously a lot of attention being paid to your networking investments as you pointed out. And there have been some reports that you are in discussions to spend a lot more on the network. There was a report recently that you're working with one of the big banks to increase your fiber optic cable investment, a $10 to $15 billion investment potentially. Is there anything you can tell us about that and what it would mean for your customers and for your network? As a matter of policy, we don't talk about rumors in the press, but let me tell you, overall how we think about fiber. Fiber right now is the best technology. And as we look out the next decade or two, there is nothing under horizon that will match the effectiveness of fiber, especially in terms of the speed, the bandwidth, and importantly symmetrical speed. And we don't see anything changing that. We are the largest provider in the US. We know how to do it very well. We can do it more efficiently than others. And we are prioritizing investment fiber. If there are opportunities for us to accelerate that through different partnerships, well of course we'll look at that. As John Stake said on the call this morning, his job is to make sure we are looking at all opportunities to potentially accelerate returns to our owners. Pascal, as it pertains to your planning for 2023, two part question, one, are you planning for a recession? And the number two, are you planning for a pickup in promotions to consumers given the slowdown we might see? Here is what I would tell you. You will hear more about how we're thinking about 2023 when we report our fourth quarter earnings. Overall, what I did say on this morning's call is that, we understand, we're more than three quarters of the way through the year and we understand what sort of macro environment we're operating in now. And they even considering all the challenges that we read about, we expect to grow earnings of free cash flow next year. What we'll do, but we want to make sure we wait till the fourth quarter and have the best possible information. And at that point, we will tell you how we are thinking about more precisely how we expect the magnitude of earnings of free cash flow growth. Within that though, and as you start to think about what a potential recession might look like for the business, what does that real margin run rate actually sustain at over that period of time given the delinquencies that you were talking about a moment ago? When you look back at history, even in downturns, the telecommunications sector tends to be more resilient than most. When clearly we would be impacted like others, but not nearly to the same extent. And right now, when you look at the criticality of telecommunication, whether wireless or broadband, connectivity, that's one of the last things the consumer will turn off even in a challenging economic environment. With that said, look, they pay me to make sure that we have the opportunity in the event that we encounter difficult operating environments to identify potential offsets. And things we would look to are things like, do we moderate the pace of our investments, Ben, in capital, but all in all, the good news about where we are today is that we believe we can continue to invest meaningfully in our business, comfortably pay our dividend and still continue to deal with.",https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TFE9bMjrlhU,58,2022-10-20 18:05:21
3774," We believe we can continue to invest, meaningfully in our business, comfortably pay our dividend, and still continue to deliver over the next several years. But look, if they are really challenging economics environment that we're operating in, we will look for all the ways to offset that. They may not turn it off, but would they trade down in terms of the service that they are receiving from AT&T? And have you seen that show up in anywhere in the business here? It hasn't shown up. In fact, more consumers are opting for the higher price plan. That's part of what's driving the growth in our article that we reported. All right, we'll leave it there. AT&T, CFO, Pascal DeRose. Good to see you again. We'll talk to you soon. Good seeing you. Thank you, everyone. Appreciate it. All right, he'll have Packard Enterprise, CEO Antonio Neri is fresh off a key investor day where he shared some long term growth forecasts. Antonio will join me for a chat coming up next.

3775," 50 plus billion dollar market. And Tony, that shift to software as a service, which ultimately drives to annual recurring revenue, where are you at in that journey? Well, we have made a tremendous progress, if you recall, in 2019, I committed to make available all our offers from H2 Cloud as a service. And at the HP Discovery in June, we achieve a major milestone because not only are edge solutions are now part of our HP green lake platform, but as well as workload optimization, infrastructure as a service, as a service, and as well as data services. So we made tremendous progress. But now we are operating as a company in a cloud operating environment, where all our new offers are designed and delivered to HP Green Lake. So now is the journey continues adding and renewing those offers as we go forward. And that AIR, as we guided for the next three years, is going to grow between 35 and 45%. Also, not only on the back of a significant growth, which this year alone, we are growing a bookings in excess of 86% year to date. But the fact that we already have $7.7 billion of total contra value in the as a service business in our balance sheet. Are you seeing any red flags or areas of concern in your business? Are customers cancelling orders? Are they delaying decisions at all? Well, what is fascinated to me, Brian, is that we continue to see enduring demand for our products and our services. And Green Lake is at the top of that demand. Well, customers love about HP Green Lake. It's the fact that they get a unified cloud experience, inclusive of the public cloud, and all the services and applications they have on premises. And now they get the opportunity to extend not only into the public cloud with the same experience, but also at the edge. And that's the next big opportunity for us, because we live in a much more distributed enterprise than ever before. And also new use cases are being developed and deployed at the edge. So that's for us is a point of differentiation in my mind. And then when it comes down to momentum, again, enduring demand, but we have not seen any major of the cancellations at all. And that to us is a very positive sign that digital transformation and key top priority for our customers and IT plays now a bigger role than ever before. Antonio, some of the analysts commentary I saw this morning. A lot of them seem to be flagging the outlook for next year. A little cautious, a little below some of the estimates that were out there. Does that outlook account for a potential recession in the US? Well, that outlook as Tarek and I stated yesterday includes what we see as a potential disruption that made the market creates because of the inflation and the foreign current exchange, kind of trends we see. So we have comprehended all of that in our outlook. But we are very confident about our outlook because obviously we have a record breaking backlog with, again, enduring demand continue to be in the market. Second is that also we continue to make a significant shift in not only in our product and portfolio mix, but in a way with the liver that makes. And third also, this company generates a lot of cash. And so from my vantage point, we are very well positioned to meet or exceed that outlook. Understanding that the biggest issue unknown today is actually in my mind not so much the macro environment but more the volatility of the foreign exchange. Antonio, I'm on the Hewlett-Packard Enterprise stats page on Yahoo Finance. And I see your stock trading at under six times Ford earnings. That is more than half of the broader market. Just given the performance of the business, that's shocking how you guys performed compared to the past year. You mentioned you have a lot of cash. How are you going to deploy cash over the next 12 months to get that multiple up? Yeah, I think you just did that really well. I mean, our disappointment is on the multiple because not only we're growing revenues, we are also growing recurrent revenues, which they represent more than 1 third over total revenues. And by the way, almost 80% of our profits are recurring. OK.",https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TFE9bMjrlhU,60,2022-10-20 18:14:03
3776," With consumer confidence sticking higher in September, signs of life are coming back to the travel industry. Occupancy rates were in line with 2019 levels in September and domestic travel intent trended higher. That's according to data from STR and the conference. Of course, we got a lot of positive airline earnings as well to support that notion. Joining us now to discuss JMP Security's equity research analyst, Nick Jones, Nick, you covered the digital travel companies, the booking.coms of the world. And I imagine that the picture is similar for them. Is it sort of a rise in tide lifts all boats? Are we just seeing a kind of rosy outlook right now for the travel industry writ large? Yeah, I think that's right. The airlines have given some good commentary that trend remain resilient. Occupancy rate, as you pointed out, is back to 2019 levels in September. The conference forward is saying intent to travel is increasing average daily rates or are elevated still indicating demand is still high. So trends are really looking good into the end of the year and this is both of our early 2023. So I think near term, that's absolutely right. But longer term, we look kind of further in the next year and the probability of a recession continues to increase. If you look back over history, generally the spend on travel does start to decline in a recession. So I think in part, that's what's maybe keeping these stocks and really breaking out of kind of near term positive data points. Help us keep some of the airlines honest here. From what you're seeing in terms of the number of different flights, the routes that are available, is there actually more capacity that is increasingly being added on here? And is that translating through to better fares for customers from what you've been tracking in your own research? I mean, so far, the intent is there, the demand is there, but it does not appear that fares are really coming down yet from the kind of the checks we've done in a anecdotal. The price of flights are still pretty elevated and some are the price of hotels. So despite their still being pretty high cost, the demand of travel is still there. We have heard some commentary, particularly the hotels, that not all of the rooms are actually available today, because they don't have a staffing to make them available. So that could in part be why some of the average daily rates remain elevated. So it's got a more.",https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TFE9bMjrlhU,61,2022-10-20 18:21:02
3777," because they'll have a staffing to make them available. So that could in part be why some of, you know, the average daily rates remain elevated. So it's kind of more supply comes on. It'll be interesting to watch if the airlines and hotels actually lower prices are today kind of hold on to where prices are today is kind of input cost increase. What about those sort of international lumpiness, if you will? I mean, a booking.com, which gets more of its revenue from Europe than the others. Is that then more vulnerable? Yeah, there's kind of puts in takes there. So the US dollar strength is it could create some effects, headwinds, kind of two revenues and costs at booking, but the same time the attempt to travel from the US to foreign destinations actually increased back to 2019 level. So a strengthening US dollar can benefit a company like booking as more US is would to travel to Europe and outside of the US. Is Airbnb still in any type of growth phase from right now, from what you can see? Yeah, Airbnb is, you know, they've benefited from really making alternative accommodations, really just another accommodation. They've really normalized that type of accommodation to consumers. Their growth does appear to be moderating. We have a market for form rating on it, largely due to valuations, but what they've done is, you know, it's heroic what they've done to kind of a new accommodation class. The company still has room to add experiences to its offering. They could have promoted listing to kind of the supply started the platform that could continue to drive net revenue kind of faster than we're looking for today, but we look for more evidence before we really start making that into our models. But from what we can tell, it looks like kind of the, you know, GBV growth at Airbnb is going to be in line with kind of expedient booking in a couple of years and be a similar kind of nominal dollar growth rate. All right, good time to be a Bill's fan. See the helmet in the back of your shot there. JMP Securities Equity Research Analyst Nick Jones, joining us here today. Thanks so much, Nick. Thanks, go, Bill. Coming up, we're going to take a look at some more movers, including all states on the back of its quarterly results. That's next. Yeah.

3778," Here's the music. You know what time it is? Time to tough time. We got two stories today. One minute each. Put it on the clock here. All state issuing a warning. On its third quarter results, expecting a net loss for the quarter. Shares responded to the news by dropping sharply this morning. Coming to insurers, inflation is causing costs for payouts to jump across the board with auto and medical costs, climbing significantly this year shares down to 10% right now in trading on the best as aren't in good hands, I guess. Well, they are in good hands, but it's costing all same more, right? It's a good plan. Thanks, coming through. Yeah. Then the company asked to pay board. There was also some hurricane costs, and that also really weighed on the bottom line for all state. There's always going to be hurricanes, right? But they do a lot of modeling at the insurance companies, but I guess if your modeling is off from what actually happens with the hurricane. And then you're forced to pay a high number of claims at a higher cost, this is then the result. I'm just fascinated how these stocks are going to do as we get more focus on climate change in this country, and as these events potentially pick up over the next decade. Well, it's interesting because for all state, I imagine it's very similar to what, oh my goodness, okay, we're done with that story. We're still in good hands, though. China, we're part of the holding emergency talks. The chip makers following restrictions on important semiconductors from the U.S., that's according to Bloomberg. The meetings happen behind closed doors to assess the possible damage to China's developing semiconductor markets. We're seeing all chip stocks rise on this news, but again, a very contention situation here. Well, the rise in the stocks doesn't make a lot of sense to me, honestly. This report said in this closed-door meeting that there were as many questions as answers. So like, yeah, they met to try and figure out what to do about the issue, but they have no answers. But it's also a very one-sided conversation that's taking place especially if you still have the U.S. that is not as willing to let the chip companies hear or abroad either come into the U.S. or for some of the chip companies here go abroad, especially into China. And so that is still very one-sided, even to say, yeah, we're having these discussions on our side right now. Yeah, I think the bigger story, at least near-term for investors, is the PC slowdown over. Do we have any visibility when this might end because that is hammered stocks like AMD and Intel? Right. So close-door meeting. Close-door meeting. They're reporting earnings soon. It's open to the motto. Yes, it is. All right. Let's take a look at what stocks are doing here as we leave you because we have seen an uptick overall across the board. So really what started as a very mixed picture today is turning more uniformly positive. All three major averages are higher here. It doesn't seem like there was any particular catalyst that I could see. There's chip makers being up, doesn't hurt matters, to be sure.

Down nearly four percent after its latest quarterly results, topping earnings estimates for the third quarter the revenue came in below expectations as electric carmaker saw costs in Austin and Berlin way on margins. CEO Elon must though painting a brighter picture on demand in yesterday's earnings call. Take a listen. I can't emphasize enough. We have excellent demand for Q4 and we expect to sell every car that we make for as far into the future as we can see. For more on was that what must have to say let's bring in Yahoo Finances prize supermanian so process interesting you have those comments coming from Elon Musk saying that you know we want to reiterate demand is going to be strong for Q4 but we've also heard him talk about this gap that we're seeing between production and deliveries that seems to be the concern that's kind of weighing on the stock today. Yeah I feel like half the street is sort of seeing that delivery versus production sort of issue as a oh it's not a big deal to hiccup right now. We're still have significant loss of demand problem and must sort of saying that hey we're hitting a lot of issues with trucks and boats and our mother means a kind of transporting their cars to customers so they can't we they can't actually recognize those as delivery so he's sort of paying that picture but then also saying that oh we're also seeing demand soften in China Europe's getting hit by energy crisis and the US the Fed is hitting the US economy so he's talking about all these other things that are earning demand exactly but hey all we're going to deliver as much as we can Q4 looking great that's going to be a huge quarter for us they maintain that 50% compound annual growth rate for even for this year I mean they got to build like 500,000 cars in Q4 alone I mean look it's it's maybe look at the back of the math they could probably build 400,000 max maybe I could be wrong but that's looking more likely but they said hey we're going to do this we're going to hit that target around 1.4 1.5 million this year. Okay the headwind so outweighing sort of the positives that you just highlighted let's bring in another guest into the hour here we've got George, Jim, Rickas, a chemical originality managing director George let's just build on those comments from Praz you know what's your sense right now on why the stock is pulled back so significantly is this about the street just simply saying we don't necessarily buy this story that demand's going to stay strong in Q4. Well first thanks for having me and I think Praz kind of nailed it look it was an issue where there's a little bit of double speaker on the one hand for the first time that I can remember and I've been looking at the stock for a long time Elon Musk acknowledged that there was a demand issue particularly in China and if you guys remember several years ago when someone asked about demand he called it a boring question right so this might be the first time where you actually acknowledge a little bit of a of a down tick but at the same time he said the company would grow significantly in Q4 and we think they could do about 450,000 deliveries and then they're going to sell as many cars as they can build for the foreseeable future which is about 50% year of year growth as far as the I can see and so what we did is you know we thought about how we can square that circle and for us it came up to a couple of things first the company has had backlog for a really long period of time and they're probably going to drain a little bit of that Q4 there are some fleet sales the companies like hurts that they could maybe sell in Q4 that help and then when you look into 2023 specifically the cyber truck comes online and that really helps they start producing more in Austin they have Tesla semi sales and then beyond that hopefully we're out of this economic bump that they were in currently and EVs if you remember are really really really small percentage of overall sales and so that will start to help so we think there's some there's method to the madness and there's logic as to why you know he guided them to grow significantly this year and continue their growth and connection but I completely agree and understand there's too many breadcrumbs to that indicate that there's been a slowdown in the man and even acknowledge it in yesterday's call. Hey Georgia Prost again so I just wanted to talk to you about a couple of things that I sort of struck me last time the call you mentioned the cyber truck",https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TFE9bMjrlhU,65,2022-10-20 18:38:08
3781," and the man and even acknowledge it in yesterday's call. Hey, Georgia, I'm pros again. So I just wanted to talk to you about a couple of things that I, that sort of struck me last time the call. You mentioned the cyber truck, how they're going in the tooling phase and put for a potential sort of, I guess, production start in mid 2023. But also you mentioned the cheaper Tesla, the kind of entry level car that would potentially be half the cost or something like that versus the Model 3. What did you, what did you think about that? Because they actually kind of sort of confirmed that this is actually in the works. Yeah, so on the cyber truck, it's one of the things that may give the company a lot of confidence in growth in 23 and beyond because look, I'm pretty confident that the company won't keep the pricing that it discussed last time when they first introduced it. But remember, they had millions according to the press, millions of orders for the cyber truck, you know, starting in 2023. And so even if they have a lot of cancellations, that's a lot of demand. I personally would get one if my wife let me, but she told me she would be 10 driving it. So it's clearly an acquired taste and a lot of people really like it. You know, on the Robotaxi platform, it's a really interesting question. You know, and so basically you think about the company's ability to bring down the cost of production for a vehicle. They've done a really, really marvelous job with the Model 3 slash Model Y platform, which cost about, you know, somewhere in the mid $30,000 range to make. And when it comes to Robotaxi, that's another step down in production cost. That granted it won't be as a big of a vehicle. They'll be a lot of nuances to it. You know, probably won't have a steering wheel and some odd stuff like that that will enable autonomous driving. But it's another platform through which the company can reduce costs and help you these proliferate the gold. George, in terms of potential for buybacks, it sort of felt like Elon Musk dangle that carrot for investors who have been a little jittery around the stock. He said, five to $10 billion is certainly possible. These were his words for next year. I wonder what you make of that. How much of this is about trying to get those investors to stick it out, those who have been concerned about his distractions with Twitter. And is this really the best use of capital for a company? You know, should that be used towards more catpacks? Just to be blunt, we don't like it. You know, buybacks are things that companies like newspaper company do not Tesla that has significant opportunity in front of it. We think there's better use of capital to accelerate catpacks plans, to build cars, to build the robot army that Elon Musk wants to build. It's just, in our opinion, they're just better ways to accelerate their plans around, you know, having EVs proliferate the globe and other opportunities, including battery factories and robots. So look, I'm sure that they've done a lot of math behind it. And they want to see the support to stock down here in the 200s. But we think ultimately long term the best way to support the stock is to grow for as long as you can. George, we didn't even get to ask you about the valuation. And Elon Musk's calling for, you know, is the valuation for a Tesla could equal Apple and Saudi Aramco combined. But that's for another conversation, we're out of time here. George, you know, he gets Ken Accord, Genuity, Managing Director, our thanks to you and our thanks to Yahoo Finance's Pros Supermanian. Well, American Airlines topped Wall Street's estimates for the third quarter, reporting record revenue of $13.5 billion as demand remains strong for travel. Shares of the airline though, down nearly 3%, let's bring in our very own Brad Smith for a look at the numbers. It's a pretty steep fall when you consider how strong the quarter was. It is a pretty steep fall in the strong quarter that we've seen for a lot of airlines, at least to this point in time, over the course of the year and a season. You saw a record quarterly revenue for Delta. You saw that for American Airlines as well. That revenue coming in at $13.5 billion, which is actually a 13% increase over the same period, the comparable 2019 period is what the period that they're looking back to here. And we've heard that from many of the airlines at this point because that is the last time period that really represents full capacity. And that's the other side of this equation too. When are you going to see more of the airlines actually get back to full capacity? We know that United, American Airlines, they're right around 90% of that 2019 capacity.",https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TFE9bMjrlhU,66,2022-10-20 18:42:29
3782," This equation, too, when are you going to see more of the airlines actually get back to full capacity? We know that United American Airlines, they're right around 90 percent of that 2019 capacity, Delta lagging behind that just a little bit, but it's really this effort to do so wisely and diligently with the resources that they do have, whether that be the number of pilots, whether that be the hubs that they're operating in, and the number of routes that they're still flying. Anybody that has traveled over the last few months knows how high airline tickets have been. Yes. We've seen airlines not the only one, but sort of this offset that we're seeing with fuel costs going up, but then companies charging more. And when you look at where the revenue came in, how much of this had to do with the higher prices, they were able to charge? Well, they had to pass through a lot of that higher costs on the fuel side. American Airlines, rather, that fuel price was actually up 97 percent relative to years past when we had watched over the summer and many of the prices because of that demand, they knew that they could pass through that price and that cost was being absorbed by consumers. It's a larger question of, as those fuel prices start to come down, and these are contracts that they negotiate well in advance. So perhaps still working through what they had actually paid for some of the excesses that they would been able to have to operate so many of their routes and their flights. So perhaps as we work through that, you'll start to see some of those prices come down for the consumers, and especially going into a holiday season where it doesn't look like demand is going to dampen. We've heard that consistently throughout the quarter, throughout the results from American Airlines, from Delta, from Alaska Airlines even, is that the demand is strong right now? And so it's a larger question of when the customers will actually push back on pricing, but even with this capacity, it seems like they're still going to see some of that strength continue to move forward as well. Well, that was my follow-up question. Obviously we're going into one of the busiest seasons. When we heard early on it is the year, in the years that, you know, travelers were already booking flights for Q4. Right. But now we're talking about more economic headwinds. Do we get any more color on the outlook? And, you know, yes, holiday demand is still holding up, but when do they expect it to start to slow down? You know, it's actually, I think, an acknowledgement that they made on the call for American Airlines just a few minutes ago, and it is that they're actually going to be removing their business, or their first class, rather, and replacing that with more business class seats. And if there's anything that we can really extrapolate from that, it's in the fact that, with the absence of as much corporate travel demand as we had seen, and more of that leisure demand really relied upon. It's this bleezure customer that many of the airlines are talking about, and within that customer profile, how are you going to continue to be able to see some of the incremental costs, not just nickel and diamond people on baggage and things of that nature, but where are you going to up the experience and hopefully bring down the prices for those fares? It's going to be in the type of ticket somebody is purchasing, and then what is the add-on to that experience as well. And so it's not just the fare itself, but where else within that flying experience can you be able to make sure that we're increasing the value that we're giving customers. Yeah, you want a slight upgrade, but not full-first class, right? Yeah, no. In terms of costs. Bratz, but thanks so much for that. We'll share some AT&T on moving higher, and stronger subscriber growth help propel the company to a strong quarter. The wireless carrier added 964,000 subscribers in Q3, as well above analyst estimates while wireless revenue rose 6.6 or 5.6 percent. That marked the biggest quarterly improvement for the company in more than a decade. AT&T also reiterating its free cash flow guidance for the year, despite following short of analyst expectations in the quarter, you spoke with AT&T CFO earlier today. You're certainly going to have to say on business performance take a look. A meaningful portion of our subscriber additions in wireless come through our business relationships, and that channel has been and continues to be really efficient source of generating new subscribers. And so we're benefiting from that, and we're seeing just the consistency of our offer quarter after quarter, resonating with customers, and our sales team know how to execute it, and all those things are contributing to continued improvement in continued growth and subscribers, as well as higher all crews.",https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TFE9bMjrlhU,67,2022-10-20 18:46:48
3783," Some worker shortages to union disputes and supply chain bottlenecks that had when facing the freight industry are many union Pacific. Now trimming full your volume growth forecast, see you at Lenspress. You can be joining us on the other side. Well, let's check it on shares of union Pacific. They are pushing lower down more than 4 percent after the railroad operator reported third quarter profit and revenue that topped estimates. But it cut its outlook for car load growth and stock repurchases. Joining us now to discuss the results, union Pacific, Lenspress, Lenspress is always good to have you on. Taking a look at the quarter here, it certainly look like increased pricing as well as fuel surcharges, certainly help drive revenue higher. But looking at the stock reaction today, investors concerned about those operational efficiencies that you sort of flagged along with the inflationary pressures. How much of that have you seen accelerate in this quarter? Yeah, Kiko, thank you for hosting me this morning. The quarter was a bit noisy. The fundamental story is we made sequential improvement from second quarter to third quarter in terms of fluidity, the network and operation inefficiencies. And as we exit and head into the fourth quarter, that continues. And so we're continuing to recover the network from where we were in the middle of the second quarter. And I anticipate back to normal in the fourth quarter. That's been our story all along. We showed that progress. Perhaps not as much progress as we had anticipated, but real progress nevertheless. Inside of that, to your point, we had solid pricing gains, good fuel surcharge recovery. And overall, the financials were strong, right? Record EPS net income operating income, free revenue. But at the same time, we did say that the heat's coming out of the marketplace that guidance that we gave at the beginning of the third quarter about what we thought volume would look like in the back half. We had to trim down because volumes cooling off a bit across a number of our markets. And so that was a lot of the conversation this morning. Yeah, talk to me a bit more about that. Where you're seeing the pullback in volume. And where are the biggest biggest headwinds for you right now? Yeah, it's mostly related to the consumer. So consumer oriented shipmen",https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TFE9bMjrlhU,68,2022-10-20 18:51:08
3784," pull back in volume. And where are the biggest, biggest headwinds for you right now? Yeah, it's mostly related to the consumer. So consumer oriented shipments on our railroad, that tends to be domestic intermodal parcel, you know, a few things driven by the consumer. Those are, those are looking like they're cooling off. The consumer has already been shifting from goods back to services, not all the way back. You recall there was a real fundamental shift towards goods during the pandemic. So it hasn't gone all the way back, but at the same time, it does appear that they're buying less. And you can see that in international intermodal boxes, hitting the West Coast ports, and you can also see it in demand for truck and demand for domestic intermodal on our railroad. There are some markets though that where we're seeing strong demand, and it's not going away, things like coal, some of the bulk commodities, grain, rock, and then a handful of our industrial segments as well. But the total picture says we're going to grow year over year in the fourth quarter. It's just not going to be as much as we thought it would. Last last time we spoke, we were talking about the labor agreements ongoing, and I saw the number here in your quarter, a hundred forty million dollar charge related to labor agreements. How comfortable are you with worthing stand right now on that front? Yeah, you know, I'm less comfortable than I was before the BNWE, our maintenance of way employees failed ratification, but I'm not concerned. We've got six unions having ratified, we've got five in the ratification vote, and we've got more work to do now with the BNWED. I think that vote failed to ratify for a very specific reason, the PEP, in addition to proposing wage levels, which are very attractive to our employees. They also said for about half, about 40% of that craft that does maintenance of way, we needed to adjust the travel that we would pay them to go from home to their away from home work location, and the per diem would pay while they were working away from home. That negotiation happened on property, and it just closed up on UP about a week ago, a couple of weeks ago, and that was at the very tail end of the ratification vote for that contract. So I think those were connected. We're back out now working with the BNWE to try to figure out a temporary agreement that can be or a tentative agreement that can be taken back out for ratification. I anticipate we're going to be able to do that. We've got status quo in place there. Other than that, we need to get through the ratification on these other five unions, and get this baby closed out by the end of the year. And I think that's still the probable outcome. So end of the year, still the timeline that you're looking at, despite some of the snacks that you've hit. Yeah, I am, you know, I guess the maintenance away employees could drag over into next year. I don't anticipate that. I think there's a there's a path forward for us to get another tentative agreement, get it back out for vote. Lance, it's always great to have you on the show, union Pacific CEO Lance Fritz, appreciate your time today. Thank you, Akiko. We're trying to this capital stepping up measures to stop the spread of COVID in Beijing once again. Let's bring in Yahoo Finance, Senior Health reporter, Angelie Kamalani. Angelie, it's interesting timing in all of this. Obviously, there's been a lot of focus on the party Congress. Xi Jinping sort of reiterated that he's not, zero COVID isn't going anywhere. And yet, there seems to be some rubblings about whether there could be a little loosening of a policy. A little loosening in inbound travel and quarantining there. There's also some discussion about what else can be done. We've seen some pushback, of course, in recent weeks that there have been some cases tied to quarantining and isolation that have resulted in negative results of 14-year-old, I believe, recently died after unclear whether or not she was taken to the center because she had COVID or was a COVID contact. So a lot of focus on the zero lockdown policy and what that means with ongoing lockdowns. It residents really struggling to access food and medicine. And because of that slight up to 18 new locally transmitted cases in a day, a certain residential compounds have now been locked down again. And we've seen in recent days certain parts of the country going back into lockdown mode, we know right near the Apple Hub the other day. So a lot of mixed, you know,",https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TFE9bMjrlhU,69,2022-10-20 18:55:23
3785," days, certain parts of the country going back into lockdown mode, we know right near the Apple Hub the other day. So a lot of mixed efforts and unclear whether or not it's actually doing anything to really pull back on the case rise because we've seen how even here, there still is a concern about rise in cases and these new transmissible variants are really going to make it hard for them to continue what has been now more than two years of this kind of lockdown. Yeah, so let's talk about what's happening here locally. I don't know, I walk out in here today and nobody's wearing a mask. No, they're not because the policy isn't there in place. And we started to see the uptick in cases again. What is that saying? And that is the concern. So we've started to see a few cases, a few areas of Manhattan rising above that 20% positivity rate as an average for the last 70s. And that is a sign of more increase. We saw the same uptick in the other boroughs in the last couple of months. And so it does seem to be sort of creeping back with a rise in COVID cases, which is not unexpected. Now the thing to watch is those new Omicron variants, the BQ1, BQ1, one. That's where experts are really keeping in their eye as the BAPI have started to decline in its presence around the country. We've seen in the New York, general New York area, which the CDC includes with Puerto Rico and New Jersey has also seen an increase in those numbers for BQ1 and BQ1, 120% almost. And that's a little bit higher than the national average right now. So definitely something to keep an eye on. Also a good reminder to go out and get your booster. Yes, if you haven't already. I know you're staying up top of that. All right, Angelique and Lonnie, thanks so much for that. Well coming up, short stay at number 10.

Shona Smith alongside Dave Briggs. the Dow and Nasdaq and S&P both trading to the downside, the Dow, which was up more than 300 points at the highs of the day, giving back some of those earlier gains after the hawkish comments that we've gotten from some fed officials throughout the day. Take a look at the Nasdaq. The Nasdaq off just around 6.10% of a percent S&P, you see falling further from 3,700 trading down another 7.10% of a percent today, Russell 2000, that small cap index off just around 1.5%. Take a look at the bond market, though. Once again, we are seeing yields push higher, the 10-year yield. Up another 10 basis points today to 4.22, that's the highest level that we've seen in the 10-year since 2008, the two-year yield, also pushing those highest levels that we've seen since 2007. The dollar index pulling back just a bit today, you can see it just below 113. Take a look at the sector action here as we enter the final hour of trading. You can see communication services, energy and technology, only three sectors holding on to gains today, technology just in positive territory, utilities and consumer discretionary, the underperformance. Let's look inside some of the major averages here. This is the Nasdaq 100, you can see Tesla off just over 6.5%. We brought you those earnings after the bell yesterday, that revenue miss, weighing on the stock today, you can see it off just around 6.5% and inside the Dow, a big reason why we're not further trading to the downside. Are the gains that we're looking at in IBM, IBM beating the streets estimates yesterday after the bell, we're seeing that reaction in the stock today, with IBM up just around 5%. I'm still processing Elon, telling us he's going to be bigger than Saudi-Iranco and Apple combined in market cap. That was a doozy, man. Thank you, Shana. Let's get you up to speed now on the cooling housing sector. Mortgage rates rising again, a 30-year fixed bearing down on 7%. Now averaging 6.94, that's the highest we've seen. Since April 2002, it's up slightly from last week and more than doubling. From the 309 we saw one year ago, Sam Cotter, Freddie Mac's chief economist says rates are, quote, adversely impacting the housing market in the form of declining demand. We're seeing that in today's existing home sales, selling at the slowest pace in September 2012, with the exception of the start of the pandemic. We hear that just about every day with housing, finally sales of previously owned homes, falling for the eighth, straight, month down 1.5% from the prior month and nearly 24% down year over year. Jared? Yeah, well let's get up to speed on some of the currency moves here, checking out the British pound. Now we know the U.S. dollar has been broadly stronger this year. That has been giving global markets, risk markets, a lot of consternation, and especially over there in Great Britain, where they saw their yields market, their guilt market, kind of get out of hand. And all of this comes from trust instituting some very conservative reforms. She was advocating for tax cuts and those were not liked by the market. Here's the British pound.",https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TFE9bMjrlhU,71,2022-10-20 19:04:11
3787," from Truss instituting some very conservative reforms. She was advocating for tax cuts and those were not liked by the market. Here's a British pound. Now, on her announcement of the resignation this morning, it did spike up so it got a little bit stronger, but you can see it has given back those gains. And I gotta tell you, even when it was up here, it wasn't even up 1%. So not a huge move. It was probably somewhat telegraphed. And I wanna show you the year to date move. Now, this is British pound losing 17% versus a US dollar. I'm gonna show some candlesticks so you can see the volatile price action, a little bit hard to see there, but that's some pretty volatile price action. Volatile enough that the entire package was revisited and the tax cuts no more. And the B of E, the Bank of England, had to intervene in their markets to support their pension system. I think all of this illustrating that's very, very difficult to institute reforms in the midst of a terrible recession over there, in the midst of a terrible market sell off, you gotta have incredible political will, I guess to overcome the prospect of losing your entire pension system. Having said that, markets seem to have stabilized a little bit, at least for the time being, on the promise that some of those economic reforms will not be reintroduced here. But just goes to show you that a lot can happen, that we're not thinking about, a lot from left field, when we talk about some of the moves in response to everything that we're seeing, guys. Lasted what, four scare moochies did. He tweeted that himself. I know. My mouth's out of this new order. Order Mary. Scare moochies, but good for him. Jumped on that, Jared. Thank you. From wall on the markets, we turn to Brian Jacobson, all spring, global investments, senior investment strategist. That's right, four scare moochies, if you missed that, Brian. Let me just quickly start over there in the UK. Is it going to make our equity markets a safe haven, or will we feel that pain eventually? You know, I think that we are going to see some of that pain, but it's more in the strength of the dollar. And we're already hearing about that from corporate America. Actually, this began, I think, with Microsoft, even back in March, when they were talking about how a stronger dollar was likely going to be weighing on the revenue growth. So the US is still a safe haven, but being a safe haven doesn't mean that there isn't some cost associated with that. The stronger dollar likely to be a headwind going forward for a lot of corporate America. And it's also been a bit of a headwind for US investors overseas. So here at Allspring on my multi-acet team, when we're looking at the global landscape, something we have to consider is the outlook for the currencies. And so if you've been a US-based investor investing in the UK, it's been a double whammy. You've got the declining markets and then also their currency depreciating as well. Brian, let's talk about, I guess, focus here on the US and specifically today. Once again, we're looking at all three the major averages trading to the downside after we got more hawkish comments from the Fed, the Fed's harker saying that he expects rates to be, quote, well above 4% by the end of the year. Clearly, it doesn't seem like we're out of the woods yet. I'm curious just from your perspective, what your view of the downside risk is from here? Yeah, so we actually think that we might be, not, I mean, this isn't really a copo, it's trying to answer it, but kind of a choppy bottom here, right? We've had this significant decline with the S&P 500 already. We think that we are likely going to go into recession in the first part of 2023 and markets typically begin rebounding. The median is around about four months before recession ends. So if we do get a rather short-lived recession, we think that we could get a decent recovery in 2023. So between now and then, we think it's actually more of a micro, as opposed to a macro story. And by that, I mean, talking to Ann Molletti, our head of fundamental equities, she has said that eventually every storm runs out of rain. And we have to ask ourselves, well, it kind of with Credence Clearwater Revival, the song, right, who will stop the rain? Well, sometimes it's the companies, as far as how well they're running their businesses, but then for the bigger picture, the macro environment, it's really the Fed, it's the Fed speak. So until they actually get close to the 4.5% what we think is their terminal rate, we think that we're still in for these ups and downs. Speaking my language, no way, Shana caught the CCR reference. I didn't. Wow, okay, I just wanted to be clear. No way, but Brian, I am with you. I'm with Dave to call me on, and I do. I try to fly under the radar there, but God. I'm with you on this issue.",https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TFE9bMjrlhU,72,2022-10-20 19:08:35
3788," I didn't. Wow. Okay. I just just want to be clear. No way. But Brian, I'm with the calm. Yeah. I'm trying to fly into the radar there. But God, I'm with the on the CCR though. That is some legendary stuff. So until then, how do we position ourselves, Brian? Yeah. So until then, the way that we're doing things on our systematic edge multi-acetine is trying to take a little bit more defensive positioning, but still trying to participate in the upside. So allocating more to active managers like Anne Molletti and the fundamental equity team there. And then as far as with doing the individual security selection on the fixed income side, because we think that there's actually a tremendous amount of value that can be derived from doing the sifting and winnowing between the winners and the losers. Who is it that's going to be positioned for gathering market share here? Well, everybody else seems to be struggling. But then from that broader kind of asset allocation perspective, you know, consumer staples. It's one of our favorite places, a little bit more defensive. They already got battered down in the first quarter, especially with the inventory overbilled that a lot of them have. We think that they're working through those issues. But then investment grade fixed income. So kind of that consumer staples for some defensiveness, but participation in the equity markets. And then doing the investment grade analysis on the fixed income side to generate some of that coupon income. Brian, when it takes, I guess when you're trying to figure out what's going to lead us higher, a catalyst that's going to make it stick other than inflation, other than the Fed pulling back anything else that you think could really push equities substantially higher from here. Yeah, so I was actually talking to our head of risk analytics the other day we were recording a podcast, kind of a spooky podcast about the things that to be afraid of in the markets for Halloween. And we were talking a lot about geopolitics, right? So Russia, Ukraine, that's a big wild card. How is that going to play out and win? Because, you know, it's kind of this binary outcome. It's going to be a deep, dark winter and a rather difficult recession for Europe. Unless, of course, there is some sort of breakthrough with the Russia Ukraine situation. And then it could actually be off to the races as far as a significant revaluation with European equity markets. So some of the geopolitical issues could really be that big catalyst. But otherwise day to day, it really feels like it is the Fed speak. You know, what did Harker mean when he said significantly higher than 4% if they could operationally define these terms? I think it would give a lot of investors a little bit more clarity that we're all seeking. Yeah, one more CCR reference long as I can see the light would be a good one for this moment here. Are you seeing that light thus far in the earnings reports? You know, so far, yes. And thankfully that light coming at you is not a train barrel and down at you. It actually does look like it's the sun coming out a little bit. Or at least it's the fact that some of these businesses, right, they are able to navigate this environment. And I think that's an incredibly important thing for investors to remember is that businesses are operated by managers and employees that can adapt to a changing environment. Right. So we shouldn't just assume that the way that they operated in the 80s or the 90s is the way that they operate today. You know, they're going to be dynamic. And that's one of the big reasons why we focus a lot on understanding corporate governance. So in terms of the ES and G for ESG investing, all of those are incredibly important. And right now it's really those that have the good corporate governance and good management that seem to be really exceeding the expectations. Brian Jacobson always great to have you. Thanks so much for joining us today. All right. We are just getting started here on Yahoo Finance live coming up.

3789,"...... You data out showing that jobless claims fell again. Some of the other signs that the Fed has more work to do in that notion was echoed by Philadelphia Fed President Patrick Harker today who warned in his speech that the Fed's going to have to keep raising rates for a while giving, quote, our frankly disappointing lack of progress on curtailing inflation. Let's bring in Mark Zanney, Moody's analytics chief economist Mark, it's great to see you. So I guess just to start off here from your perspective, we're all debating how much progress the Fed has made if any. So far what's your assessment of where we stand today and how much progress they have made? They made progress. They had two goals. One is to keep inflation expectations down close to their inflation target. The second is the slow growth in the job market, wage growth moving lower to help quell the inflation. On the inflation expectations objective, they succeeded. If you look at one year or five year forwards, that's inflation a year from now on the subsequent five year period. That of the bond market, these are investors putting the money where their mouth is. It's very consistent with the Fed's target of two to two and a half percent on the consumer of price index. And with regard to growth on jobs, same progress. If you go back say six months ago, average monthly job growth was about 500,000. Now it feels like it's about 300,000. Still a lot more work to be done here. We need to get down below 100K to get unemployment from stop to stop falling and start moving a little bit north and slowing the wage growth and quelling the inflation. So still more work to be done, but I think they've made progress. It's a pretty good progress since the beginning of the year. Will they need a recession to get things back to 2 percent? I don't think so. I mean, I don't say that with a lot of confidence. Recession risks obviously are very high. This is going to be very difficult. But my sense is that there is a path forward that will allow them to soften the economy. And I do think they laid out a script for us. The federal funds rate target, which is three to three and a quarter percent. It's headed to more than half to four and three quarters by early next year. And I think that should be.",https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TFE9bMjrlhU,74,2022-10-20 19:17:35
3790," us the federal funds rate target, which is three to three and a quarter percent. It's headed to more than half to four and three quarters by early next year. And I think that should be sufficient given the tightening and financial conditions that the kind of stock market the increase in the value of the dollar, the increase in mortgage rates, the tightening and bank underwriting standards to slow the economy sufficiently to get inflation moving in the right direction. But, but it is a it's a path, but it's a narrow path and it is getting narrower as we get these inflation statistics that are definitely a disappointment. Mark, when you I guess when you expect us to start seeing in the data that CPI that inflation has significantly cooled, are we talking two months from now, four months from now? I guess what's your best prediction on that? Yeah, I think over the next six months, we should see inflation CPI inflation, let's say rounding is eight percent ish. I think by next spring, we should be four percent ish and that assumes the main assumption there is that oil prices stay 90, 95 bucks a barrel right now. There are 85 bucks that would be consistent with $4 for gallon of regular and let it if we if we can manage that oil prices can stay roughly in that range, then the arithmetic here is in our favor because of the this is all year over year and we saw some big increases in oil energy prices a year ago. So that should bring in inflation to eight to four. The hard part is going to be though getting from four to two to two and a half. That's going to be more difficult that goes to. And then we're getting some better news there, but that'll take a while in the most difficult part of this will be getting the job market to slow get wage growth moderating because that's key to service price inflation and that's the last mile and that's going to take a while probably not until early 2024. And because of that, do you think at some point the Fed calls it a win with inflation around four percent? Yeah, so what I think they'll do is they'll follow the script. They'll go to four and a half four and three quarters by by end of January. That's the meeting in early early next year. They stop the tickle look around. They know that the impact of the rate hikes will filter through the financial system and economy with a long lag. So they want to take a look around. I want to make sure job growth is slowing as I anticipate that wage growth is rolling as I anticipate that inflation has moderated as I just articulated and moving in the right direction. And if it is, then that's the end of the story that four and a half percent upon rate is the so called terminal rate, the highest rate in the cycle and they'll keep it there until for a while into 2020 for until it's obvious that we're headed back to target or close to. But that would be a scenario where we kind of sort of squeak our way through avoid a recession, although I don't want to say on two polyannish under any scenario. The next year 18 months are going to feel pretty uncomfortable. It's just a matter of how much discomfort we're going to feel. I guess when we're also trying to figure out whether or not the risk here that the Fed is going to overshoot, I know you're saying that you expect them to pause. But what do you think the risk is though that they front load too much if we get a more aggressive rate hikes in the next two meetings before the end of the year. Are you concerned at all just about the spillover effect looking ahead to 2023. The risk here are two sided. They certainly could overshoot. They may not pause as I anticipate early next year they keep on going and something breaks in the financial system. The higher rates go the faster they go the longer they stay up, something in the financial system is not going to work as anticipated. We got a taste of that over in the UK a couple of three weeks ago when the British pension funds choked on the former Prime Minister's plan, so interest rates rise and it exposed some problems and their derivatives product that they've been using to match their assets and liabilities. That's very esoteric, but that's the kind of thing that you know will happen in a highly stressed environment with interest rates at high levels for an extended period. But you know there is also the other risk that they misjudge they should continue to tighten because inflation isn't moderating sufficiently. They keep rates too low at 4.5% for too long the inflation gets entrenched and that's a stack flation scenario, which is pretty ugly, particularly because we will ultimately experience recession, but just later and it will be more deep and severe. So the risks on either side that which you know obviously makes this really tricky going forward, hopefully they can kind of calibrate things.",https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TFE9bMjrlhU,75,2022-10-20 19:21:33
3791," but just later, and it'll be more deep and severe. So the risks on either side that, which obviously makes this really tricky going forward. Hopefully they can kind of calibrate things and get it roughly right. But a lot of risk around that. Mark, that's something many fear might break is the housing sector where we are seeing some fed success. If you want to see it that way, how much pain is it had in housing? How do you quantify it? Yeah, well, housing's the most race-sensitive sector of the economy. So it's not surprising it's taking it on the chin. I mean, this is by design. The Federal Reserve is raising rates to slow the economies growth rate, the job market, to quell inflation. And so housing is going to suffer. And it really is. It's getting nailed. You saw today's existing home sales numbers that gives you a sense of the hit to the man. The net goes to high rates. The 30-year fixed mortgage rates over 7%, you multiply that by the house prices. And it's just unaffordable for most people. Potential first-time laboratories just can't afford that. And then people will own their home with a mortgage. They're kind of locked in because if they have to sell their home, and get a new mortgage to buy another home at a much higher rate, that's just not going to work economically. So it does mean that house prices are going to come in. They have to come in. They are coming in pretty fast. I've been surprised at how fast they started to fall, particularly in places like California, we're already seeing 5%, 6%, 7% declines from the peak. So we should buckle in. And this is going to happen to me. I do expect even with no recession, we'll probably get a double-digit kind of decline in house prices nationwide peak to trough. I am hopeful though that that's not the place, anything where anything breaks, because in the sense of what's going on in the system, because the underlying quality of the mortgages, the underwriting, the bars has been excellent since the financial crisis. And of course, even with these house price declines, that's after a period of very strong house price growth. All you're doing is retracing part of the increase that we've experienced since the pandemic hit. So I'm hopeful we will see some increase in mortgage defaults and foreclosure and distress sales, but I am hopeful that that's modest. And so that's not, I don't think that's the place where the system will break. Moody's chief economist, Mark Zandee, good to see you, sir. Thank you. All right, ahead, American Airlines shares falling despite reporting stellar earnings that be analyst estimates to ground to find out why.esch",https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TFE9bMjrlhU,76,2022-10-20 19:26:25
3792," Today you can buy our FHV Someone call to fix it Sorry if I have to do it It's time for triple play three stocks that we are watching in the final 30 minutes of the on its softer second quarter with today's beat. Quest looks like it will be exiting the pandemic in a stronger position. I'll bear it. Analyst Eric Coldwell writing in a note to clients that the company's base business is quote, looking good city, highlighting that that business is picking up in August and September, which of course would vote well in the current quarter of the fourth quarter. And as we head into the new year, and Josh, I bring this play up because so many people were thinking that Quest I Nostas simply would not be able to hold the momentum that we saw during the pandemic that was strictly a pandemic play because of the role that they played in COVID testing, but the strong results from their base business they're really showing that they will be around to stay and they could be a power player in this space. Absolutely, and you know, it's a stock the street hasn't really loved either. Seven buys, 10 holds on the stock. It's not a stock that many analysts have been bullish on. So I think the earnings were very important for that case. And one other thing that was interesting from the call that I wanted to point out, Hurricane Ian impacting the company. The company specifically said that they had all time testing at all time highs in Florida, and then they saw a drag about five cents on their adjusted earnings because of Hurricane Ian and the slow downing testing. Something that I thought was interesting will probably see from some other companies that also have high volume in Florida. My play though is Seasers Entertainment. Shears up today marginally about half a percent, but that says the casino giant launches a new partnership with SL Green Realty Corp to redevelop 15-15 Broadway. That's a portion of Times Square here in New York City. And Seasers is the latest casino brand to pursue one of New York's three remaining casino licenses. Now it would come with a big cost, Dave, and expected $500 million in licensing fees. But the key here is gonna be the integration of Seasers Entertainment's rewards program because what you can do with those rewards, but they wanna do with this if they get the approval. You can go to Seasers, bet, win some money on the rewards, go to Broadway and spend it there. You can go somewhere else in Times Square and spend it out of restaurant, spend it out of bar. Now you're talking about a holistic experience in Times Square, one of the top tourist locations obviously in the country in the world. I think it could be a really big play for Seasers. I think they have about 65 million people already on Seasers' rewards. Think about how many more people are gonna go because they stop by for an hour or two while they're visiting New York. Yeah, and just from a real estate perspective, how I look at things, and you're looking at a vacancy rate in your 16% in Times Square, which is massive, and that of course is because the pandemic people have just not gone back. So there's a lot of fear from the traffic standpoint, you brought up a keyword, redevelopment. It's not a new construction, and that was key to that deal, even being even considered if it was new construction and non-element, but there's also a play, a win, combination over at Hudson Yards, which is in play for one of these new gaming licenses. So definitely, I think a home run at either one. My play is AAL, American Airlines. You'd think this sock is soaring on spectacular Q3 earnings, right? Well, not so much. American is the latest domestic airline, though, to report a very strong quarter beating expectation, seeing revenue surge 50% to 13.46 billion, there's CFO, Derek Kerr saying, and we've heard this from all of them. We currently see no signs of demand slowing, or that from United, we heard it from Delta. America expects power-sprays.",https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TFE9bMjrlhU,77,2022-10-20 19:30:27
3793," in their CFO Derek Kerr saying, we've heard this from all of them. We currently see no signs of demand slowing or that from United States or from Delta. American expects Q4 revenue 11 to 13% higher than the same period in 2019 with slower than planned aircraft deliveries and a shortage of regional pilots. Potentially the downside here, hampering growth a bit. But their CEO Robert Isom said the pilot shortage could take three years to resolve. That is a massive problem across all the domestics. Perhaps that or a buy the rumor sell the new situation. Why the stock is actually down about 4% today, shockingly and 28% year to date. One further note I want to discuss with you, Josh. International first class, they plan to drop it. They say no one is buying it, which is fascinating because we're seeing on the high end of luxury spending there's been no demand destruction, surprise, they're gonna replace it with all business. I'm very surprised by that. Every other company you look at, it seems like it's a trade-up environment. When it's high end, when we're talking high end goods, people are trading up. So interesting to see them cut that. I don't know, Sean, I don't know if I want to fly all the way to Europe in business class, right? But they still have the life, the life, wow, I didn't know that you are such a bougie child. You are so long-sled. Every day, I was that. But I think it is important to point out why they are doing this. They were saying that they simply just did not see the demand from customers. People weren't willing to pay up for that first class. So they're going to replace it with business class, which people seem to be much more willing to pay for. Obviously, because it's a little bit cheaper, so it's gonna cost you a lot. So if you're not willing to go on the coach, I think it's gonna be costing you quite a bit on your next trip. It is interesting though to see the stock react the way it is today, Dave. And it's hard to make sense of it. I think maybe it rose after we saw the strong results from Delta and United over the past week and a half. So now that maybe some of the excitement has already been baked into the stock, which is why we're seeing that 3.5% dip today, but the demand. Very, very strong. It's a reported strong top to bottom. It is a very strong gap. It's kind of unbelievable when you look at the strength there of a lot of the airlines in this quarter. Right, coming up next, the Texas Attorney General filing a lawsuit against Google over. It's over. How it collects biometric and data. Love the details for you after the break.

3794," MUSIC Dexas Attorney General Ken Paxed is suing Google, accusing the tech giant of collecting biometric data from users without proper consent. Paxe and alleged Google has gathered millions of biometric identifiers, including fingerprints, voice prints, and records of face geometry through products and services like Google Photos, Google Assistant, and Nest Home Devices. In a statement, Google defends their products with spokesperson Jose Castaneda saying, in part, AG Paxed is once again mischaracterizing our products in another breathless lawsuit. We will set the record straight in court. Shares of Google parent, alphabet currently trading down just a bit, largely flat on the day. Okay, President Biden's student loan debt forgiveness plan facing a new legal challenge this time in the Supreme Court, Alexis Keenan, here with the details. What are we learning? Okay, so this is a Supreme Court challenge is the first time that one of these groups that is challenging President Biden's relief for student loan borrowers is showing up on the Supreme Court's desk, but it doesn't have the greatest chances of being granted because the court will probably never get to the merits. But let's kind of go through what's in this case. These are Wisconsin taxpayers. They're called the Brown County Taxpayers Association, their advocacy group. They want an emergency order to stop the debt relief, say no student debt relief at all. They say that President is unconstitutionally usurping the power of Congress, the power of the purse to spend the taxpayers' money. They have a big issue with the dollar amount on this, saying that up to a trillion dollars is estimated as a cost to taxpayers. So they really take issue with the president, unilaterally going in and spending that kind of money. Now, they also object to the fact that this relief is being granted under the 2003 Heroes Act, and that was a law that was invoked in 2003 to give relief for families that were serving in Iraq and Afghanistan to give them debt relief. And so they're saying that this isn't the law that should be used in order to do this. So I want to read just part of the application to you. This is what these taxpayers from Wisconsin are saying. They say the president has transformed a law designed to benefit military personnel and first responders into a warrant to transfer hundreds of billions or perhaps over a trillion dollars in debt onto taxpayers. They add that if this program goes forward as planned on Sunday, then the president will unilaterally spend roughly 4% of the nation's GDP. If you look at 2021 GDP for the year, that was approximately $23 trillion. So they may have a point there, and it is a little unsettling, right? So the estimated cost of relief has come from CBO at about 400 billion all the way up to over a trillion dollars coming from the University of Pennsylvania. Alex, is this how strong do you think this argument is? I mean, just the odds that the Supreme Court is going to be able or will give the taxpayer group what they're asking for? So the reason it's so slim is because they have a problem with what's called standing, and that means that any group that's going to come in and try to start a lawsuit, they have to have a particularized interest in the case. And what that means is they have to show that they have a concrete injury that could result if the debt relief goes through that is specific to them, that it doesn't apply to everybody. Problem here is if you're a taxpayer and you say all taxpayers are harmed, that's everybody. And you can't use the courts for that purpose. So that is the problem that all these groups are having and trying to challenge the debt relief is that they're coming in and they're not able to stand on footing that says, we're different from other groups and we're going to be harmed for a particular reason. The Supreme Court has long rejected the idea that you can come in and start a case on those grounds. So they probably will never get to the merits of this particular case. We'll be interesting to see, though, how it all plays out. Alexis, thanks so much.",https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TFE9bMjrlhU,79,2022-10-20 19:38:54
3795," that you can come in and start a case on those grounds. So they probably will never get to the merits of this particular case. We'll be interested to see how it all plays out. All right, Alexis, thanks so much. Let's stick with college. I guess into college enrollment, despite the Biden administration's push to reduce costs for students. College enrollment has declined once again. Now, data from the National Student Clearinghouse showing that college enrollment declined 1.1% this fall, which is less than 3.1% decline that we saw last fall. Graduate student enrollment also declining about 1%. Universities that are seeing upticks include historically black colleges and universities, the HBCUs, and online schools. And Dave, we talk about the high cost of school. Obviously, that's a huge, a barrier to entry to some people out there. Also, the fact that maybe the college degree, and this is up for debate, maybe it's not as valuable as it once was. People are still getting hired and getting paid very well when they don't have college degrees. And as a result of this, we're seeing people opt not to go to school and go another, maybe more untraditional around. Yeah, I think those are the two factors. And back to the cost. I mean, it's up 169%. The cost of a four-year college since 1980. That is massive far outpacing inflation needless to say. But anecdotally, you do hear more about that than you ever did prior to the pandemic. About people just weighing the overall factors and the benefits of going to these college. And maybe that's because of a cost analysis. You're just trying to figure out, does it make sense? I've heard it from my own children, which is quite frankly surprising. One interesting surprise in that report that highly selective colleges are down 5.6% the largest decline. And last year, those same colleges were up more than 10%. So that is a massive turn. And that upper tier of colleges can't exactly explain it. Maybe that is the cost. Maybe this will wear off as we do back out of the pandemic. But it is certainly a trend. Yeah, and I also thought it was interesting just in terms of the online schools, a Roman up overall, 3% from last fall. But for students aged 18 to 20, that enrollment figure was up 23.4% over the past two years since the start of the pandemic. So I think more traditionally, when people went back to school, if you were older, maybe not really in that 18 to 20 age group, and you would have maybe have opted for online just because it's easier. You have a family, you have a job. It makes more sense. And we're seeing more people in that age group 18 to 20 years old opt for that online option. So it's interesting. We should also follow just how much more competitive it could potentially be to get into some of those online programs. It is so brutal getting into college today, not like the application process we endured. All right, ahead. Existing home sales falling for the eighth, straight month to a 10 year low. We'll talk about what lies ahead for housing. Come on up. All right. All right. All right. All right. All right. All right. All right. All right.",https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TFE9bMjrlhU,80,2022-10-20 19:43:03
3796," All right. If there's one sector of the economy truly feeling the impact of dramatically higher rates from the Federal Reserve, it's housing. The mortgage rates today up to their highest level since 2002, also existing home sales at their 2012 levels. Darrell Fairweather is the chief economist at Redfin and insider contributor Darrell nice to see you. So first, how high do you think rates will climb and how do you really characterize what we're seeing right now? Because somebody just say it's kind of a cooling off, a normalization, but others feel like there's a crash coming. It's hard to say how high rates will get. They've already gone higher than I was expecting them to get. Inflation has proven to be a tougher problem for the Fed than anyone originally envisioned. And they've had to fight that with higher short-term rates, which translates to higher rates. If the Fed does send us into a recession, then rates will come down, mortgage rates will come back down. But it's hard to say like how much longer we can stay in this state with high inflation and high GDP growth and high interest rates. Darrell, when you take a look at some of the projections out there, some are saying that the national, we will see a national collapse in home values. That is very likely at this point. We have started to see the price growth come down, but we need to still compare it to the levels that we were seeing pre-pandemic. We're still substantially higher, right? So I guess in terms of the degree of this drop, what are you expecting? Well, prices have come down from how high they were earlier this year. Earlier this year, there was this mad dash to buy a home while rates still sat below 4%. And now that's gone. Activity is severely down. People aren't buying homes like they were a couple months ago because it's just not a good deal. The median mortgage payment on a home that's on the market right now is 50% higher than it would have been last year. And most people just don't have 50% extra in their housing budget. They either have to go to the rental market, or they have to figure out a situation where they're living in a much more affordable area or in a kind of home that they have to compromise on. Are you seeing Darrell things begin to level out? There's like Wells Fargo with you to note, yesterday suggesting they think things will get a lot worse in 23. So prices have stayed relatively high. They're still up about 6% from where they were last year. And they've been kind of stable over the last two months. But now the mortgage rates are close 7%. We had this extra increase in mortgage rates. I think that prices could come down to basically the same place they were last year. And as a chance that in 2023 prices will be 5% lower than they were in 2022. Now they'll still be a lot higher than they were in 2021, 2020 pre pandemic. So it's not like many homeowners are really going to feel that pain. They'll still be worth more than what they bought it for. But it is still a very different housing market than what we've been experiencing for the last couple of years where prices always go up. Darrell, what do you make of the news that we got this week from the home builder sentiment following for the 10th straight months, of course, right now in terms of I guess worry about supply, what that's going to look like when you square that off with demand. What we heard from them, I guess the fact that it hasn't been improving at all. How worrisome is that for the real estate market? The fundamental problem in the housing market is a lack of supply. And even though mortgage rates are up and demand is down, supply is down too. New listings are down about 18% from last year. New listings sales are down 30%.",https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TFE9bMjrlhU,81,2022-10-20 19:47:36
3797," Market is a lack of supply and even though mortgage rates are up and demand is down, supply is down to new listings are down about 18% from last year. Pending sales are down 30%. So there's still less demand than there is new listings with those new listings are not coming on the market. So there's still this fundamental lack of homes available if you actually are in the market right now. You're probably a bit disappointed looking around and thinking like as us all there is out there because there aren't these new homes coming from existing homeowners or from new construction builders are having to pay these higher interest rates and they're worried about demand to they don't have a lot of motivation to build right now. Although some positivity in a Bloomberg report 1.7 million housing units currently under construction that is an all time high so maybe there's a glimmer of hope on the horizon are there particular regions you see suffering a bigger decline in others and where are they? Well the Southwest is certainly off of its sugar high from the pandemic when everyone was moving there places like Austin and Phoenix they're having some of the biggest swings and prices and then Florida and it's been battling this hurricane so sales of decline even more there and it was also a previously hot market. The Midwest was pretty stable throughout the pandemic prices didn't go up all that much and as a result prices aren't really coming down very much there either and in the expensive areas demand is down because those high mortgage rates can translate to like a thousand extra dollars a month for a home in Los Angeles and Francisco or Washington DC so that's just too much costs for a lot of people in those markets to bear. When you're trying to figure out how much uglier it's going to get from here what's the number one thing that you're watching. This is just watching for what happens with inflation and our rental data we can see that for new rentals coming on the market rents rent growth is already slowed it's half of what it was earlier this year so that's a good sign that what the Fed is doing is working but it's going to take time for that really early data that we're seeing in terms of listings of translate into the cost that. Data day consumers are facing and the fed isn't going to reverse course make till they feel like they really squashed inflation out entirely so we'll see how long that takes and how high the standard the fed is going to set for when they feel like it's time to reverse course on these interest rate high. We'll write to all fair what they're always great to have you thanks so much. Coming up JP Morgan CEO Jamie Dimon describing Bitcoin as a Ponzi scheme but the bank is making a big bet on crypto we've got the details next.",https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TFE9bMjrlhU,82,2022-10-20 19:52:10
3798," So This fight Jamie Dimon's opinion on Bitcoin, JPMorgan Chase making a big hire to focus on crypto policy at the bank. And it's not the only company adding to its ranks. David Hallerith is here with the detail. We've seen two notable crypto hires in the last day or so. And it's a sign of the times, I guess, despite hiring slowdowns and major work for force cuts that we've seen from crypto companies earlier this year, there's still very much a premium to be paid for executives with a law, policy and regulation background. As you mentioned, JPMorgan Chase is hired a new head of regulation. The executive who certainly has some interesting work force or workplace stories to tell, formally came from the Celsius network and there he served as head of policy in regulatory affairs. Also Binance US, the smaller US subsidiary of the major exchange has hired former FBI agent BJ Kang. A decorated federal agent, Kang is known for having been involved in a number of high profile white collar crime cases involving insider trading and cybercrime, most notably leading to the arrests of Bernie Madoff. While JPMorgan wouldn't comment on the higher Binance US has said that this is a part of their larger effort to bolster compliance legal and regulatory affairs. And I think that speaks to what's been going on in the sector, although prices have declined. We did see a wave of financial contagion earlier over the summer and obviously we're still seeing a number of hacks this year getting to be a record. David, you're also following a court hearing around the bankruptcy of Celsius. What's the latest there? Yeah, so we didn't get a lot of takeaways today from the hearing, but the main thing going on is that the timeline for bidding procedures for the case has been set and that is hopefully going to be finalized before the end of December. So that being said, there's also sort of a dispute going on right now between whether investors and customers should be treated the same way in the case. A conclusion there remains to be seen. But the federal bankruptcy judge today did raise an interesting point, which is just the situation with the bankruptcy is that it's a bit of a melting ice cube. And there's concerns that Celsius might not have money to continue going through this chapter 11 process come January so there is definitely a timeline there and the case needs to sort of be settled before then. David Hallerith, good stuff. Appreciate that. All right, let's check out Tesla now, trading lower ahead of the clothes. The electric carmaker shares taking a hit after reporting a third quarter revenue miss Elon Musk remaining bullish despite the fact the company is saying it will miss its annual delivery target. You can see shares down more than 6% on the day. He also said the company putting the pedal to the metal come rain or shine and that they are not reducing production in any meaningful way recession or not recession. In China, we're beginning to see a few analysts come out and say quite frankly, the evaluation, the valuation just doesn't make sense. It doesn't add up. Talking, I'm on my favorite quote is Elon saying they imagine combined market cap more than Saudi ramco or Apple or combined more than four. Yeah. We get dollars. Yeah, I mean, he always has these lofty goals. Sometimes he meets them. Sometimes he doesn't.",https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TFE9bMjrlhU,83,2022-10-20 19:56:10
3799," And dogs. Yeah, I mean, he always has these lofty goals. Sometimes he meets them. Sometimes he does. It's hard to see at least right now, Tesla's surpassing that. But you mentioned some of the reaction that we've gotten from the street. Bernstein was out with the notes saying that their earnings call just simply did not sit well with them. I think there's lots of questions just about deliveries and production going forward. So many headwinds, also the fact that we're entering into a recession, certainly a time of a period of a slowdown. What that's going to do to consumer spending. And then of course, a Twitter deal. What that means for Elon Musk, how much time that's going to mean that he's a little bit distracted. And how many more shares he will have for himself as well. Yep. 48% year to date.

We are just a few minutes so go ahead and get some of the best time to do this. Let's get to it from the closing bell. It's bringing you to the market action. A lot of red on the board once again. It's not too bad. I have to tell you something. Tomorrow is op-ex. We're talking about this over the break. Eight of the last nine Fridays have been in the red. We'll have to see what comes tomorrow. Op-ex, options expiration has had a negative seasonality to it. This happens once per month. We can check for a few days. We're doing it right now. We'll have to see how much it costs to go on the board. We're going to see how much the communication services tech and energy just barely in the green. No big gains there. Utilities, industrials and consumer discretionary. Those are the biggest losers utilities off by two and a half percent. That says that yield curve in the US continues to scream higher.

3800," Taking a look at this over the break as well, is this a head and shoulders top a massive one? Remains to be seen we'd have to break down a little bit more, but in the meantime, want to leave you, as I often do, with the travel setup here, we got Expedia down about 3% American down 3 and a half percent, and Carval, that is up 4% here's a closing down. That marks another down day here for the market, Dow closing off just around 91 points, SMB off around 8% of a percent NASDAQ off 6% of a percent. You're looking at the Dow and negative territory. We actually were up over 300 points at the highs of the day to look at the sector action, communication services, energy and technology, the only sectors to close in the green this afternoon. Come on, let's bring in Reese Williams, a sprouting rock asset management, chief strategist. We also have Teddy Parish, a parish capital CEO and CIO. Teddy, let me start with you, because we certainly got a number of strong earnings reports over the last several days. It looks like the market, though, largely shrugging that off, focused on more so on what we're hearing from Fed officials, but what's your takeaway of the action that we've seen today? Well, I think the market is anticipating some downgrades in earnings. We haven't gotten much of that lately, but even if we do have a great-hired season and not much in the way of downgrades to Eston, then I think the market's still, market action is still going to hinge on the fact that the Fed is still there, waiting to push rates up and to eventually push us into a recession. So that's a black cloud that is not going to go away because inflation is still there and it's excess. So the Fed's going to be vigilant and they're going to continue to be until they see signs of inflation actually subsiding. And no signs of it yet, Riz, thematically, what are you seeing generally speaking from earnings in your expectations as we head towards big tech earnings? So in general, I would say earnings have been maybe less bad than feared. I mean, I think there's a lot of uncomfortness about how things were going to be playing out. And in general, if you came in with pretty low expectations, no matter what you reported, the stocks have gone up. Similarly, actually, if people had high expectations for if you were in a other defensive sector, some of those stocks had actually sold off. So it's been a little contrarian in terms of stock performance. But in general, I don't see any huge downgrades, I would agree, in earnings estimates for the fourth quarter, relative to expectations. I think that's more likely to come into the first quarter as the economy continues to slow. Teddy, you mentioned the fact that you expect the Fed to remain hawkish and to keep raising rates. I guess, what extent is that going to push us into a recession? And how deep could that recession potentially be? Well, we would hope that the recession is shallow, but the Fed has never been on a path of increasing rates this far so fast and not push us into a recession. So the chances of probably pretty high that you're going to continue to push rates up. And the economy's pretty healthy. Consumers pretty healthy and corporations are pretty healthy. So with that backdrop, I think that it could be a shallow recession, but to the extent that rates are not just pushed up to a point of actually stalling the economy. One of the main things that has to happen is for money supply to actually decline and we haven't had a whole lot of that. But because it's not like they can go in and actually take money out of a consumer's check-in account. So there are a lot of moving parts and some other potential issues outside of just a Fed that could make the recession more deep. So we're hoping it's shallow, but we don't know. Teddy, do you think the Fed should pause? Do you think they're over tightening? No, I think it's necessary. OK, I think it's necessary. I think that inflation is embedded in the economy. And wage inflation is very sticky. And it's on the cost of becoming secular. So in the labor pool, it's such that it can't be expanded very fast. So I think they need the addressed issue. I mean, we take that.",https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TFE9bMjrlhU,85,2022-10-20 20:04:55
3801," So in the labor pool, it's such that it can't be expanded very fast. So I think they need the address to the issue. I mean, we've had a whole generation of easy money. I mean, out of the 10 years of very easy money, you know, we had to pay the price at some point and we reached that day. What do you think, Reese, do you agree? I'll take the other side of that with respect. I think the Fed should, if not pause, at least right raise more slowly than they are. I think the consensus is they're going to go 75 and then maybe another 75 in November and December. I just think that's too much. And I think everybody's very focused on the CPI numbers, which are alarmingly high. But a lot of that is in how they calculate rent and actually rents went way up more than the CPI reflected in 2021. And actually, they're starting to kind of roll over now. So I just think there's a lot of anecdotal evidence from modern prices to what's going on in the housing market, to auto sales, that things are starting to really slow. And then that doesn't even talk about what's going on overseas because the idea that Europe will be anything but a severe recession is super unlikely. And then China is its own little drummer. And that has been the engine of growth for the last 20 years. And frankly, that's missing an action right now. And Teddy, given all the macro conditions we've talked about, how do any sectors, any names you like? Well, we're a high value growth at a reasonable price, core managers, equity managers. So we like a lot of things now. We're overweight, staples, health care, industrials, and even financials at this point. We think that a lot of the images already been done, especially in some of the higher flying areas, and there are some great values. If you look inside and that's a wonder for instance, companies have gotten slaughtered over the past year. And I think that you can shift through those companies and find some great long-term holdings and technology as well. But we like names with high dividends, high end growing dividends, great balance seats which should flow down to a better cost of capital in this higher interest rate environment. Chris, given the uncertainty out there, where are you putting money to work and I guess where are you seeing the most opportunity? Well, I think sort of one country area and opportunity right now is REITs. And that is that they've done really poorly this year because bond market has done so poorly. And I think everybody's very consumed with the fact of how far the Fed's going to go. But no matter what the Fed does in November and December, I think long rates are close to peaking. And that should be good for REITs, which basically are priced off the 10 year. So I think there's a little bit more room on the upside for the 10 year yield. But I think it goes higher than this. A mild recession turns into something worse six months from now. So I definitely think the bond market is going to start sniffing out recession and start being your friend going forward. Good stuff there. Reese Williams, Teddy Parish, thank you both. Appreciate that.

3803," Miss Sun revenue they came in with 1.13 billion. We were expecting 1.14 billion, although adjusted EPS came in at 8 cents. We were expecting a loss of 2 cents, so not bad there. They also beat on active users. They have 363 million versus an expectation of 358.7. Now they also authorized a $500 million stock buyback. The bad news comes, though, because they're not giving us any guidance as to Q4. They say it's highly likely that year of year revenue growth will decelerate as we move through the fourth quarter, due in large part to the fact that the fourth quarter has historically been relatively more dependent on brand-oriented advertising revenue, excuse me, which declined slightly on a year of year basis in the most recent quarter. So that's probably why we're seeing the stock down. It was around 20% at one point, but now we're looking at it down 17%. Big problems for SNAP. They've been facing this downturn in their stock price. It was down 77% year to date as of today. And they're dealing with the same kind of advertising issues that Facebook is, meta, rather, and other social media companies where they're seeing a pullback in advertising spending, plus they have to contend with that change that Apple made to its privacy settings in iOS. And so this is the result of that. We have to see, I guess, what we'll get out of the other social media companies as we see them report later next week. But you could see already meta-reacting to this two-degree down 4% Twitter off just slightly in Pinterest down 7% a little more. So, you know, it remains to be seen how badly this will hit the likes of meta Pinterest Twitter. But for SNAP, a really not good look going forward. Yeah, certainly a reminiscent of what we've heard in previous quarter, snapping the first of report SNAP, citing this slower advertising spending as a huge headwind and that, of course, playing out as some of the other larger tech players that have followed. So something that we, of course, will continue to watch that slower growth number in terms of revenue, 1.13 billion, Dave. The slowest growth that we have seen here for the company, but they did add new users, daily active users, 363 million estimate out there, what sort of 358.7 million. I think a lot of us have been trying to figure out what exactly the future looks like for SNAP, given its size compared to a lot of its larger competitors out there. And the fact that the company simply hasn't been too innovative recently either, just in terms of trying to differentiate their business as well. That is entirely what I was going to ask Dan Halley about it. He mentioned the 77% year to date. They're down 85% in the last 12 months. Dan, the one thing we have heard in recent months is the SNAP plus subscription service. I'm not sure if you can evaluate how successful that has been or what the talk is in terms of Shana's point. What is the catalyst? What is the innovation in the pipeline? Have you heard about anything? Yeah, I mean, look, they canceled their drone. They were supposed to be working on trying to save cash there. They had laid off about 20% of its workforce. I don't think anything really is working too well for the company right now. They do have the subscription model. That gets users access to certain different types of filters, early access to some features. But as you said, it really doesn't feel as though we're seeing too much innovation coming out of SNAP. But again, this also comes down to the advertising issues that we're seeing across the board. And we could continue to see going forward. So advertising first company right here, they're trying to diversify with that. There's scripture model. I don't know how many people are actually wanting to jump in and pay for SNAP when there's other free services out there. And oh, yeah, the 800 pound gorilla in the room that's still chomping at the heels of the lights of meta is TikTok. And that's free. And you don't have to sign up to get any special filters or anything. So, you know, it doesn't look very good for SNAP. Younger users are flocking to TikTok still using Instagram, Meta's Facebook. I mean, that's basically the rear view mirror right now as far as younger users. So SNAP, it's kind of in the middle there. So how it kind of moves forward and how we start to see it potentially turn around. I think just comes down to when we start to see that turn around in the advertising market. Yeah, the high school kids really use SNAP as a texting service as the dead of two high school kids. One million users, a SNAP plus as of August. So not a huge revenue generator.",https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TFE9bMjrlhU,88,2022-10-20 20:18:01

Yeah, not a whole lot of catalyst ahead. It looks like Shana. No, not. Everyone has a tick talk problem. Everyone has an ad environment problem. And especially if we go into a recession. Yeah, you know so they met you would have to think that this is indicative of maybe of what we'll see from some of those larger players out there. We saw a meta sliding on the news Pinterest off just over five percent. So be interesting sector to watch here in the weeks ahead. All right, new data revealing that if you want to advance in the workplace where you work matters a lot. We'll break down the findings after the break. Welcome back on today's labor market. You might not need a bachelor's degree to work your way up the ladder and land a strong job. A new index measures which companies are most likely to create economic mobility for workers without college degree joining us now. We want to bring in Matt Eagleman, he's president of the Burning Glass Institute for today's installment of career control, which is brought to you by straight talk wireless Matt. It's great to see you. So let's get into the index and what you found the American opportunity index you revealed which large companies are doing it best in terms of advancing workers in the workplace. What did you find? Well, Shana, we found is that where you work matters a lot for whether you move ahead in your career. We constructed a an index to be able to essentially create a yardstick for the American dream. A lot of us are concerned about about intergenerational mobility in the words, do you do better than your parents? If you're born in the 1940s about 90 plus percent of people were going to do better than their parents. If you're born in the 1980s that was down to the best even odds. And so what we",https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TFE9bMjrlhU,89,2022-10-20 20:22:27
3805," about 90 plus percent of people were going to do better than their parents if you're born in the 1980s that was down to at best even odds. And so what we wanted to look at is the role that companies play in facilitating mobility for their workers. We tracked three million workers of the Fortune 250 over five years in 19 sorry from 2017 to 2021 and we looked at how they progress both within their companies and beyond their company. And who are the companies that did best? Are they concentrated in particular sectors? So it was actually very interesting to see how broad spread good practices. If you look at the top companies you're looking at folks like AT&T and the one-hand AMX you're looking at Cisco but also companies like PG&E, Southwest Airlines, International Paper, across the top 50 companies in America in terms of their creating opportunity for workers. They represented 21 of the 27 industries that we tracked. Matt when you take a look at pay how critical that is transparency there what did you find in terms of that with the companies that ranked in your top 10? So we were pretty God's Mac at just how much difference there is for workers in pay. Now first of all I should say that we looked everything we looked at we looked at based upon what role you're in right you don't want to compare people who are software engineers with people who are working retail roles. But even for let's take an ad men an ad men working at a top quintile company where the company is doing best is making two and a half times an ad men at a company in the bottom quintile. Just put real dollars on that that's the difference between making $82,000 a year and $34,000 a year. Well of course your career that's a million and a half dollars. I'm just curious are those companies that are that that were employees have upward mobility are they finding more success? This matters a lot not just for workers but for companies as well. One of the metrics that we looked at was how much retention benefit there is. So ultimately for workers that matters because you got to be in it to win it if you don't stick around then it's hard to move ahead. But we found that companies that were in the top quintile of retention were twice as likely to keep workers of the span of five years. At a time when so many companies are scrambling for talent the ability to literally double the length of service that you have the length of relationship you have an employer with employee can make a profound difference from business impact. Madam curious do you see any difference or a theme at all just in terms of flexibility when it comes to work working from home versus working in the office or maybe having that hybrid schedule or did that at all play into maybe the success that some companies have in retaining that top talent? So worker flexibility is something that is really important in terms of in terms of worker opportunity and work from mobility. But I want to emphasize that it's not just something that you do because it's good for workers in the same way that helping people stick around longer is good for workers it's good for employers. When you provide flexibility it turns out that's a lot of the reason why workers stay particularly when we talk about industries like retail or industries that have big frontline workforces. Think about you know a lot of retailers have literally 150% staff turn over a year. It's just tremendous just amount of effort that it takes to feed that machine. A lot of workers at that level are leaving for reasons of schedule and they're leaving for reasons of convenience. So if you can address that upfront you can make a significant impact in terms of the kind of relationship you have with your workers on the one side and their ability to move up on the other. So when we talk about flexibility is the desire when they work or where they work? Well there's a little bit of both. Let's remember that we're talking here in the index. We focused on the kind of jobs that are open to those without college degrees. That doesn't just mean frontline workers it's also finance managers.",https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TFE9bMjrlhU,90,2022-10-20 20:26:36
3806," focused on the kind of jobs that are open to those without college degrees. That doesn't just mean frontline workers. It's also finance managers, a bunch of other jobs where some people have a degree, some people don't. But the further south you go along the level of educational attainment that someone has, the more likely they are to be working in a job where they don't have a choice. If you're stocking shelves at a big retailer, you can't work by them. If you're a philbotomist working at a big healthcare company, you can't work by Zoom. So location matters, but the ability to set shifts, the ability to have flexibility and other dimensions of work assignments makes a big difference. Alright, an important stuff right there. Matt Siegelman, thanks so much for joining us. We appreciate it. We want to follow some breaking news here from Snap. Now the stock continuing to plunge after reporting its latest quarterly results. Adjusted EPS actually coming in better than expected, eight cents, but revenue of slight mis there. It was the slowest quarterly sales growth for the company on record revenue growing just six percent. It is the first time that that has slipped into single digits since the company went public back in 2017. Also, we know, we know the fact that this that the tech sector really at large has been struggling with the fact that we have seen a slowdown in advertising, spending. So of course, that having a direct impact on Snap's business, you can see that as a big reason for that slower than expected, quarterly sales growth number. Now we're off 25 percent. Snap though far from the only tech tech player here in the red as a result you're seeing a drag. Meta off just nearly 5 percent Twitter just in the red Pinterest. So look at that off nearly eight percent. Alright, coming up liquid death, the boasting evaluation of 700 million dollars and as a partnership with Martha Stewart, how thinking outside the bottle is helping the company disrupt the water market when we come back.",https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TFE9bMjrlhU,91,2022-10-20 20:31:13
3807," Hi, I'm Martha Stewart. I recently heard about an interesting new beverage company called Liquid Death. Don't worry, it's just water. And together we teamed up to create an utterly delightful candle. Martha Stewart, just one of many celebrities endorsing this out of the box or in this case, bottle, water brand, joining me now to discuss what sets this business apart is Mike Cesario, Liquid Death Co. founder and CEO, also Yahoo Fanat's own Rook De Palma joining us as well. Mike, good to see you. This is a phenomenal story. Your latest raise values the company at $700 million. I can't help but think if you'd have walked into Shark Tank in 2019 trying to sell water in a can, how would they have reacted and what's the origin story? Yeah, I mean, I think people forget two things. One, how big the beverage industry really is. And two, how much brand actually plays a role in it. I think when you look at other industries like fashion, for example, people can understand somehow easier. Why does a Gucci t-shirt that's 100% cotton sell for $750 when the same exact t-shirt from the same exact material you can buy and target for $15.99? Same exact thing performs the same exact function, but people can clearly understand why brand can completely change the value story for a given product. It just doesn't happen as much in CPG. But yeah, essentially, we're building a brand that's bigger than just water in a can. And I think that's why we've sold last year, we did $3 million in Merch and a Perl as a beverage company, as a water company. We've got four million followers on TikTok and Instagram, which the only two brands ahead of us are basically Monster and Red Bull. So when you really are building a brand, it's a very different thing than when you're just a very functional, rational, transactional based approach to a product. So, Mike, let's break down some of those numbers there. In 2019, when you last spoke to us, you raised a $1.6 million seed funding. Recently, we raised a $70 million series day. Like Dave said, now valued at $700 million valuation here. What's the end goal and is it an IPO in the near future? Yeah, I mean, we don't have a specific goal in mind. I think we're open to all kinds of different paths for the company. I think IPO path is something we're definitely going to seriously explore and see what that looks like. There's no timeline for when that would be or if we would definitely do it or not, but something we're going to take a look at. Same thing for, you know, remaining private, same thing for potential M&A. I think where the company is just growing so fast and growth is just continuing to move even faster. And we're going to take that into consideration when we think of what the next, you know, kind of move is. And when you look at pricing, when you go to buy on your website, it actually takes you to Amazon. So we want to talk a little bit about that pricing there. It's $15 to $21 for 12 pack. The cost of non-alcoholic beverages up 0.6% month over month, 12.9% year over year. How are you keeping that price competitive to keep consumers coming back? Well, Amazon, I mean, Amazon is a tricky thing because Amazon, they, they are a wholesaler. So they buy product from liquid death. Amazon sells it and prices it. Just like they do with all the big brands, Coke Pepsi, you know, all the other brands, Amazon acts as a wholesaler. So they typically set a price that is in line with what you could buy it for in a store, which is 1499, 1599 sort of range. So that should stay intact. And yeah, at the end of the day, as long as we are.",https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TFE9bMjrlhU,92,2022-10-20 20:35:15
3808," Well, that should stay intact. And yeah, at the end of the day, as long as we are somewhere in the range of other premium products, we're gonna be fine. Is the dollar more is a dollar less. People aren't buying liquid debt because it's the best price thing. It's a brand play. And when you have a true brand, you have a little bit more pricing elasticity than when you're just a brand that's purely focused on, well, we're cheaper, so that's why we win. You mentioned the four million followers on TikTok and Instagram, two and a half million of those on TikTok. Are you able to quantify how that impacts the bottom line? And you said that's not why they're buying it. If you can, why are they buying liquid debt? You know, my question would be, why do people wear Nike instead of Adidas? Same shoe. Why do people decide to drink Jack Daniels over some other whiskey? When even in a blind taste test, there's no way they're picking it out. You know, it's like there's these emotional reasons that people do things. But I think with liquid debt, we're seeing that people appreciate a brand that feels authentic. And I think it doesn't matter what industry you're in, everybody's chasing authenticity. But people see liquid death and they know, oh, there's a real human being behind this. And in a category where people perceive everything is kind of the same. It's like, hey, I'd rather give my $1.89 to these guys and walk around with this cool can that's not a plastic bottle, aluminum's infinitely recyclable. So they feel good about that. And people get a kick out of walking around with something that looks like a beer. We have hundreds of parents who have reached out on socials saying, thank you. Finally, my nine-year-old is excited to drink water instead of soda just because of the format. And it feels like something cool or that he's not supposed to have. So I think there's a lot of different reasons why people are sort of really into the brand. We get it now. Mike Sissario, cheers to you. Brooke DiPolma, thanks for being here. Bravo on your success. Invest a look to you in the future, sir. Mike Sissario, liquid death, founder and CEO.

Now it's great to see you, so let's just first zoom out for a bit because I have to first admit I am a NAPDress where I love it. I like to say that I'm part of NAPDress Nation, but talk to us just about the explosive growth behind your brand which really started to take off during the pandemic. Absolutely, so we found at Hill House Home in 2016 and in 2019 we came out with a product called the NAPDress. And the NAPDress is a dress that's intended to be worn at any time, day or night, it's really comfortable, really pretty and it makes you feel great, I'm wearing one right now. Since our 2019 drop of our first NAPDress collection, our business has just grown significantly. We've had three consecutive years of 300% year over year growth, it's been a wild, wild ride and half of our senior executive team has had more than one baby in that time periods. It's been a busy couple of years for all of us. A very, very busy couple of years. I mentioned the fact that you guys just came out with a new line yesterday. I'm on the site right now. A number of styles have already been sold out or certainly sold out in specific sizes. When you take a look at this demand, when you're trying to plan for your future launches, I guess how much are you trying to meet that demand versus trying to fuel this sort of rush to your site? Yeah, it's super interesting. You know, when we first started selling out at our drops, I, somebody said to me, you guys are like millennial moms version of supreme. You're always very high-peed, you're constantly selling out and there are lines around the corner. It was really interesting because it had never been part of our strategy to sell out. It was truly over demand and under supply. That was just with the sheer volume of growth that we were experiencing. I think our, our kind of end goal has always been to get this product in the hands of anyone who wants it. Now that said, certain patterns, certain fabrics, certain colors, we just could never supply the level of demand that is there for those products. But we try to make sure that everybody gets something they like, even if it's not the exact pattern. So it's been an interesting couple drops for us. No, I want to talk to you about brick and mortar plans. I know you've had a couple of pop-up stores. You had a pop-up store near and tuck it over the summary of a pop-up store in New York City in the past. What do those plans look like as we approach this very critical holiday season? I'm incredibly bullish on brick and mortar. I think the past couple of years, people have been so focused on ordering online. We're all used to coming home from work or going from the living room to the bedroom and just having piles of cardboard boxes. And that unboxing experience doesn't feel very romantic anymore. It doesn't feel super exciting. I know personally I love going into stores and seeing what's new, touching, feeling it, and then trying it on. So it was amazing for us to be back in person over the summer. We popped up in NanTucket. We had over 1,000 customers in a day and it was over 70% new customers. So for a brand like us that's digitally native, direct to consumer, we don't have distribution outside of our website. That's just a huge opportunity to meet new people. We had a really great conversion rate.",https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TFE9bMjrlhU,94,2022-10-20 20:44:15
3810," that's digitally native, direct to consumer, you know, we don't have distribution outside of our website. That's just a huge opportunity to meet new people. And, you know, we had a really great conversion rate, significantly, you know, five or six points higher than we had been kind of planning for. And for us, it was just a real moment to say, how awesome that when we get this product in front of people, they love it, even if they've never heard of us before. So I'm hoping for more stories, really excited about expanding and meeting people in person. Now, you mentioned the fact that people can only get it from your site right now. They're strictly direct to consumer. Any thoughts and you plans to partner with some of those larger names out there? Yeah, absolutely. I think we'd love to have one great distribution partner on the wholesale side. I think for the first couple of years of the business, as I mentioned, we've been around since 2016. It's been all about focus, all about our direct channel. We've really benefited from having a direct line of conversation with our customers. But now that we've really built up that strong solid foundation and want to meet new people and that we're at the scale, kind of revenue wise. I think the distribution from a wholesale perspective makes a ton of sense. And it's all about finding the right partner. No, and the intro there, I mentioned the 20 million in funding that you recently announced. I'm sure some of that will be used for your brick and mortar plants. How else, though, do you plan to deploy that capital? Yeah, absolutely. So in those three consecutive years of 300% growth, for many of them, we were a team of five people. So it's been a ton of hiring has gone on in the past couple of years. I like to keep the focus on profitability. I like to keep us physically responsible, financially sustainable. So no plans to go too crazy with team building. We're now a team of 30 based in New York City. I'm coming live from our office. But build up a team, build out our vertical to a couple more categories coming and then stores. It's all about stores. Now, it's certainly a very, very competitive market that you're in. A lot of your competitors are larger. They have more capital than you do at least today. What do you attribute just the success of your brand at such an early stage and your ability to capture such a wide audience on social media? You know, I think in some of our biggest growth years, we have spent less than 5% on marketing. And I think for us, that's the greatest compliment we could ever have because it's all about the product. We call it the group chat effect. It's where a group chat, somebody's wearing an app dress and she tells her other friend on the chat, you've got to get this dress. It was so comfortable. I felt so good for this presentation. I felt so good on my first day. And then all of a sudden, we see like an influx of people to the site. And in the early days, we would say, oh, there's some group chat popping off about us right now. So we want to really keep that spirit alive despite the fact that we're a much bigger company now. Really focus on the product first, the quality, the pricing, keep the pricing super competitive and keep me think that people feel comfortable in but also great about themselves at the first time. Because that's the spirit of an app dress that it's core is about feeling comfortable but feeling good. And that's certainly how I learned about it the first time is from a group of friends and they all said, you had to try it out. And I'm very, very happy that I did know. Before we go, I want to talk to you just about supply chain issues. Number of retailers have come out saying that that has been a huge challenge for them, not only during the pandemic, but certainly heading in to the critical holiday season. Have you dealt with any challenges like that? And how are you navigating that? Absolutely. I think in the past three or four years, there hasn't been a season or a new shipment that hasn't had supply chain challenges. So for us, it's just about expecting the unexpected. I think for us, we've built these very strong relationships with our suppliers. And it's never been more clear to me that relationships are everything. And some of our factories have been with us since day one in 2016. And we really partner together. We say we hold hands at every step of the process. So in the early days of the pandemic, when they had COVID closures there, we were flexible with them about delivery dates and vice versa. I think that for us, the focus is to insulate our customers as much as possible from those shifts, really trying to understand that people have enough to worry about right now. Let's just try and focus on getting the product in their hands. If we have to shelter a little extra cost to make it happen, that's okay for now, because we have a long-term view on the happiness of our customers. Now, Diamond, we wish you all the best. Thanks so much for taking the time to see us. We really appreciate it. All right, coming up next, shares of Snap, they are plunging after I was a good dad.

The disappointment really came on the average revenue per user side of things. The RQ number down 11%, we were looking for about to down 8%, 9%. And there's a number of reasons that we can kind of go into. But as far as the reaction in terms of the stock price, I'm a little bit shocked by the magnitude of the move. Although I probably shouldn't given what we've seen in terms of the stock movement here in recent quarters. But that said, I mean, overall, I think the biggest disappointment here is kind of the trajectory of the revenue outlook. As you look into the fourth quarter, which the guy at that company did provide some guidance into, and likely indicates that going into the first quarter of 2023, you're starting at kind of a lower footprint. Angel, let's go a little bit deeper into the RQ number. The average",https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TFE9bMjrlhU,96,2022-10-20 20:52:47
3812," and likely indicates that going into the first quarter of 2023, you're starting at kind of a lower footprint. Angela, let's go a little bit deeper into the ARPOO number, the average revenue per user number that you just mentioned. They're obviously coming in a bit light in terms of forecast. How, I guess, what was the biggest factor in that? And I guess, how do you see that playing out as we look at it to this current quarter and then into 2023? Yeah, I mean, so, you know, if you kind of take a step back, actually look at the second quarter. That was actually the first quarter since the company went public back in 2017 that we actually saw a year of a year decline in ARPOO. And you kind of look at, you know, the declines kind of only intensified here in the third quarter. And we think probably we'll again into the fourth quarter. And, you know, there's a number of reasons for that one. I mean, there's going to be a less favorable mix as you kind of see outsized growth, at least on a relative basis on the VAU side of the things on the international side of things would have lower ARPOO type number. But again, you know, also probably more importantly, is the fact that listen, the ad space is clearly struggling right now, budgets are getting a lot tighter. And you are seeing kind of, you know, lower fits per action overall. And that's that's driving me kind of the lower ARPOO number specifically. Also, the first time that revenue grew in single digits since their IPO in 2017. But, Angela, when you look at the daily active users, which maybe this is just like Netflix, when we used to focus more on subs, but you're talking about a 19% year-over-year increase to $363 million. And that sense was it not so bad. So, you know, again, I think when you kind of look at the daily active users, you know, it's great to grow the installed base this much, right? And the fact that the matter is, they cater to a great installed base. And the fact that it's largely kind of a younger audience, right? I mean, 80% of their installed base is essentially kind of 35 and under. And that's a great kind of prompt to have when you kind of look at relative to, you know, the metas of the world, which kind of are struggling with a much older installed base. But when you kind of look at the DAU growth here, who are about 4% in North America, the outsized growth, about 11% in Europe, and then the real outsized performance was kind of the rest of the world, which grew 34%. And again, you're talking considerably lower R2 type numbers in those regions. They haven't been able to kind of monetize that audience yet. And that's kind of been the problem here, whereas maybe other platforms out there are actually doing a better job monetizing the platform internationally. And so when you take a look though at the advertisers cutting their spending, and this audience report, the company is saying that we expect the operating environment is going to continue to be challenging in the months ahead. You mentioned the fact that maybe some of the competitors out there do have an advantage, at least when it comes to their competition in regards to SNAP. But is this indicative, do you think, of what we would likely hear over the next couple of weeks as we do start to hear from some of those other social media companies? I think it's going to depend. I mean, listen, I think overall the space is definitely struggling right now. It's the first area to get hit when we're talking about softer macro conditions. And we clearly started seeing things rolling over in the second quarter. And it's only gotten more pronounced here and in Q3 and Q4. And we do think it likely bottoms probably sometime in the first half of the year. So it likely gets uglier before it gets better. I mean, I'd say that the news person that probably worse for meta, just given kind of the audience that they cater to and how they're kind of more exposed to the iOS ecosystem in a mobile platform, say, you know, when you think about a company like Pinterest, you know, they were able to buck the trend last quarter relative to SNAP. If you recall, they kind of pop significantly on the results. And the reason for that is because they're actually finding ways to better monetize the platform. They're actually growing our pool while a company like SNAP is seeing our pool declined because of what they're doing in areas like shopping experiences and stuff like that. So I think it's going to depend on these individual companies. And this definitely kind of drops the sentiment as we kind of go into the rest of the numbers next week. But on a case by case basis, it's going to hit. We think meta from a fundamental perspective.",https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TFE9bMjrlhU,97,2022-10-20 20:57:04
3813," sentiment as we kind of go into the rest of the numbers next week. But on a case by case basis, it's going to hit. We think meta from a fundamental perspective more than the others. Twitter obviously protected by the 5420 that Elon Musk is going to pay. And that's probably why you see that not moving much at the moment. So the question is for Snap, what is the catalyst? What does the comeback story, Evan Speagles saying today we're going to focus on three things growing our community, deepening their engagement, re-accelerating and diversifying our revenue growth. And here's my question, investing in augmented reality, how significant might that be for Snap or where else might lie the comeback story? Yeah, I mean, Atlas, and I think augmented reality is the right place for them to be and to invest in. And the reason being, I mean, is there a mobile dependent platform you kind of look at where a company like Apple is going to write? I mean, we know they're migrating towards augmented reality, what they're doing, developers out there. And what we product wise, what we expect for them to come out over the next two to three years, whether it be mid-reality, headsets, eventual AR glasses, and what have you. So Snap is trying to prepare for that evolution. But that's going to take a couple of years. I think kind of when you think about potential catalyst ahead, in our view, I think at this point in time, we're just kind of looking for some sort of signs of a bottoming process, which is really too early to be talking about, because we're probably at least two quarters away from that happening. And, you know, sentiment, you know, just completely getting washed out, which, you know, you're probably starting to get close to what we've been saying that, I think, for a couple of months now. Yeah, look at that. Shares off just around 25% after hours. Angel Azino, great to have you. Thanks so much for having on the phone for us.

Morius research director. Thanks so much. Joining us here today, appreciate it. Guys, coming up on the other side of this short break, the turning tide, question mark, a mega market cat behemoth, corded by retail and institutional investors alike. But, what could it take for Apple to turn Rotten? Maybe just one report. Sizey State is up next. Well, can Apple do anything wrong? That's the question. As the tech giant Reddy's a new update to iOS devices that promises everything from more accessible fitness to clean energy charging investors, they're waiting for an update of their own. The company is set to release earnings next week. For a closer look, let's turn to Sizey State. Size is what we find you do today. Alright, what's clean energy charging? I know. Is that mean my phone is going to charge magically? I thought it was an EV term, honestly. You might be right. Alright, let's run this down because Apple earnings are in fact coming up. So here's my little preview for your folks. Overarching theme I think of this preview is the street is really expecting some good things from Apple. First up, what Wall Street is saying into earnings. One, this quarter may not stop out concerns of a hardware slowdown. We've seen a big PC slowdown that has impacted the likes of AMD Intel Unaming in the chip space. There is some concern on that hardware slowing down. Notably as it pertains to iPad, potentially hitting Apple in this quarter. Next, the street is expecting a slight earnings beat by Apple. So maybe one to two cents. I've seen some whisper numbers out there on the street looking for a beat by Apple of about five cents. So something to keep in mind. Also to iPhone, iPad demand will help offset FX challenges. That's the vibe on the street. Maybe I would be a little concerned with the iPad just given the slowdown we have seen in the PC market. But by and large, the new iPhones have launched very, very well.",https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XTJjX90THDQ,1,2022-10-21 13:57:10
3818," FX challenges, that's the vibe on the street. Maybe I would be a little concerned with the iPad, just given the slowdown we have seen in the PC market. But by and large, the new iPhones have launched very, very well. Next up here, potential red flags, areas of concern you should be on the lookout for. And there I am holding or flying that Apple flag right there. One, December quarter guidance. It is universally the vibe out there on the street is even though Apple may have had a good quarter here, that guidance for the holiday quarter may come in pretty conservative relative to estimates, given what you see on FX, given what you see about pressure, and the Chinese economy, and of course, our own slowdown here in the US, economics slowdown, that is. Number two, China, as I just mentioned, a concern by analysts. And lastly, work from home impact on various Apple devices, notably that iPad. And I do want to call out to give a little analyst shot out here to Barclays, Claudia Gilbert Tallinn. She's noting here this, looking out to December quarter, we are unsure what guidance management will give. But we expect some conservatism, like I just mentioned, given the macro backdrop despite the extra weeks, since the December quarter has 14 weeks. So it's this district's overall, I would say, expecting for Apple to do it, have a good quarter, beat on earnings, have a conservative guidance. It might take, if Netflix positively surprised the market, dot, dot, dot, you would think Apple would step up here and post a good quarter of its own. It's just a matter of how will the stock react? If you do get, let's say, five-cent earnings be in conservative guidance. Now the argument could be made, that is priced into the stock here, which sets it up for a positive reaction on earnings day, but again, that's just like throwing darts. Yeah, I think services will outperform. Services is seen as one of those little luxuries that consumers will lean into, even as they kind of bat in the hatches on their own spending. But then on the other side, there is this question. And it could already be priced in very well to the stock, is on the demand side that they're seeing for the iPhones, where they've already, according to reports, pulled back some of the kind of iPhone Pro, or the iPhone, yeah, the iPhone Pro model pulled back some of the production on that in response to what they had been seeing on the demand front and reading through to see exactly where they were looking at a consumer that was more affluent, had more of the appetite to spend up to get the iPhone Pro Max. And so with that, you've got the higher tier that's selling better, the question that I would have going into this report though, is on what volume? And that is something why I've been paying close attention to the telecom companies this quarter, is especially what they're saying around, whether or not customers are actually trading up or trading down, and they're saying that they're trading up right now. So it leads you to believe that maybe they're opting in to that higher tier phone, it's just a question of how many of them? Right, and one, I think what we could agree on here, this will be a market-rooting report, especially in this environment, where there's a lot of macroeconomic concerns here, Apple's report next week will very much set the tone. Absolutely, we're also keeping an eye on another tech company here coming up on the other side of the short break. Snapshares, yeah, they are getting hammered to the tune of 30% lower on the back of its third quarter report. We're going to speak to Jeffrey's Brent Dale, next.

3819," [♪ Nice guitar musicㅎㅎ?] Welcome back to Yowl Finance. I'm Brian Saazi here with Brad Smith, Julie Heimann as the day off. This is our tiptoeing into the weekend as traders gear up for a big wave of earnings next week. Right now you're seeing all three major indices. I would say maybe a little bit more than tiptoeing. We're seeing the Dow up almost 335 points. Here's what else we're watching at this moment. No recession. American Express shares are under. We're under a little pressure after the company didn't raise its full year earnings guidance range. The stock is still under pressure. CO Steven's square, he tells me concerns of a recession are overblown. The dialing up in earnings beat Verizon shares are in focus after the company beat on earnings but posted weak subscriber gains. Brad Chaat with Ryzen Seal Hans Vesberg who noted that there are points of weakness in that earnings report more on that one on the Yowl Finance homepage right now. And it's time to travel. Spotlight the theme park sector following much better than expected earnings from airlines. Brad, over to you. Let's kick things off with a check of the major averages here. 32 minutes into trading on this Friday and the Dow Jones industrial average right now. We're seeing that hold on to some slight gains right now. It's up by about 1.1%. All right, so a little bit more than slight gains here on the day than that is that composite as I bring this into an intraday view just to give us a better perspective of what's taken place. Look at that sharp move higher that we've seen within the first 30 minutes of trade. We're up by about half a percent right now as clearly investors, some of the sentiment right now is saying, hey, you know what, hold my beer. We could rally into this Friday and that's what we're seeing right now is a little bit of an early session rally. The S&P 500, you're seeing that up by about 1% here. And so you take a look at the broader week that we've been watching as well. This could potentially add on to some of the net gains that we had seen, even with the declines earlier in the day. We were still up on the week by about 2% as of right now with this move. We're up by about 3% 3.3% on the S&P 500. Also want to take a look at some of the trending stocks on the Yahoo Finance homepage as well here. Yeah, it's none other than Snap, the brand of Ghost Face Chilla. Yeah, it's chilling on the day to the tune of about 30% chilling lower in a bad way here. So we're continuing to watch that as well as Twitter. You're also seeing shares of Pinterest move in constant lower by about 6.3%. So for more on this move that we've been tracking with Snap as I put that back in focus on the day down 30%. We've got Jeffrey's senior research analyst, Brent Thill Brent. Just take us into your reaction after you saw the numbers cross from Snap and what the executives had to say on the call last night. Yeah, good morning. The quarter itself was okay. It was the guy and they have obviously been experiencing decelerating growth just over a year ago. They said they could grow indefinitely for 50% and then the growth rate came into the 30s, into the teens, into the single digits and they exited at high single digit growth and then said the quarter was growing at 9% and then said the quarter would end flat because advertisers would fall off a cliff in the back half of the quarter. So I think it's more about the guide and more about it.",https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XTJjX90THDQ,3,2022-10-21 14:05:50
3820," and said the quarter would end flat because advertisers would fall off a cliff and in the back half of the quarter. So I think it's more about the guide and more about the lack of visibility. There's clearly been a lot of departures, their senior leaders and sales have left to go to Netflix. You have a concern around advertisers moving to where the wallets are, meaning, the younger audience and staff don't have the dollars. The parents have the dollars. The older generation has the dollars. So you're seeing advertisers shift up from the lower end to the higher end, which makes sense. So we're still gonna be influenced to buy household goods and items for to run our life. But that's not where we make the decisions on SNAP, right? We may make a decision on SNAP to buy the new Hawaiian shirt or buy concert ticket, but we're not gonna be influenced to go again, make some of the bigger ticket purchases. So dollars for advertisers are shifting to Google, to Amazon, to prove and spend where the wallets are and that's where the advertisers are at. We also have a competitive issue with TikTok, which is anyone that's fired up TikTok and spend five minutes with it, spends a half hour with it, it engages you, it brings you in. So advertisers naturally in them or experimental and younger audience are shifting away from SNAP over to the TikTok platform. So there's a handful of forces, changes in the team, changes in advertisers. I think overall the bigger picture too is the macro, which is we have a macro picture that's dimming. We are going into a recession in 23 per hour economists. This will start later than most economists have believed our team internally continues to believe that we are going to go into it more of a tailspin in next year that this takes time to come out into the economy. So if you think about that, if we do go into that tailspin, we advertisers naturally, the first thing they're gonna say is we're not spending, right? Adversizing can be tuned up and tuned down in a nanosecond. We described as the stereo knob in your car or at home. You can go up and down really quick. You can't do that and software, you can't do that in semis, you can't do that in other areas of technology. So right now I think investors are just like, I don't want to be in advertising if we're going into a prolonged downturn. I will be back to advertising names when we go back in the upturn. And there's safer names outside of tech. And that's what we continue to hear from our clients is just our clients want to be outside of technology. Right now they want to be in energy. If you look at the XLE, you know, up over 50% year to date, right? So the popular trade beginning of the year was short technology belong, the XLE. And you know, we've got the XLE up again today and up 54% year to date. So I don't think that the tone of technology overall and advertising and many of the other tech names that we cover is going to shift until we get into 2023. We get a lot of these companies to really reset the numbers. So I expect a tougher earnings season for the rest of tech. Brent, does the snap have to cut its expenses even further? Yes, I mean, they do. I mean, they just restructured the company. They obviously are in the process of still reducing the workforce by 20%. They may have to go deeper. And again, I think the thing we don't know is how long is this economic pullback going to last? It could last all next year. Again, our Jeffery's own economists have said this really starts later in the year versus early because it takes time for all these changes that the Fed is putting into place is going to be a way that comes in slowly. It doesn't come crashing in on you. And so the scary part of what's happening is we don't know exactly that this can be prolonged. A lot of companies are saying, oh, we're not seeing it. Some companies are saying we're seeing it.",https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XTJjX90THDQ,4,2022-10-21 14:09:58
3821," What's happening is we don't know exactly that this can be prolonged. A lot of companies are saying, oh, we're not seeing it. Some companies are saying we're seeing it. I think everyone's going to see it. I think this is going to be again, the concern, which is this could get a lot darker than we all think. That is a potential. Now, I would highlight that, look, if Elon Musk thinks that Twitter's worth $44 billion, and Snap now has a roughly $12 billion market cap, you start to ask yourself, he's trying to build the X app, which is all these things you can do. Snap has a closer version of an X app than anyone. It has the map, it has the information page, it has a messaging service, it has an ARVR, it has a gaming interface. I mean, there's many elements that investors have come back to me and said, if he wants to create an X app, which is all these things that Twitter isn't today and fire 75% of the workforce, doesn't snap how all the foundational makings of what an X app would look like. I'm like, yeah, absolutely. So at some point, you go, look, we understand they've had execution issues. Again, the visibility on the advertising industry, that's across the board. I mean, it's not like meta and Google and Amazon's ad business are accelerating. They're all decelerating, right? So they're all facing the same headwinds now. Obviously, Snap's had stronger headwinds. But at some point, you go back to everyone is so negative that ultimately, if you have a long-term horizon and you sit and look at this, and you believe, these are typically some of the best opportunities for tech investors over a three-year period, not the next three months. So depending on your duration, I think there's some credible opportunities that are being borne in this downturn that clearly, we're going to have some hazy, overcast foggy skies in the short term. But you're getting some interesting opportunities if you are a longer-term investor. Do you think there's some consolidation to be expected, given the valuations right now? 100%. M&A is going to massively spike. In M&A, there is no IPO window right now. So we have given birth to a lot of great technology companies. Many of these subsectors are overcrowded. You've already seen that. You're to date Tom O'Braw, who's one of the best software investors on the planet, is spent over $20 billion acquiring multiple companies outside in the security and technology landscape. So if you look out even outside of social media, you've seen incredible consolidation. You've seen strategic deals like Adobe buying Figma for $20 billion. No one thought any company in the beginning of a recession would pay 50 times revenue, 50, not 50. So we are going to see an incredible amount of strategic M&A, an incredible amount of private equity, led M&A. You're already seeing it. You're seeing the number of skyrocket, you're to date. You're seeing some of the best technology investors for the long haul, like Tom O'Braw will say, this is go time for software consolidation. There's no question. And this is what we need to restore the health, because we're in that cycle of we expanded dramatically. We had so many IPOs. We've had no IPOs intact this year. And so if you think about what's happening, you're going to go back to that natural consolidation phase of M&A. And we firmly believe we're seeing the signals already. We're seeing the best investors in the space talk about it. We're seeing the strategic step up and make acquisitions. You saw Adobe, you saw Microsoft in Activision. You've seen Salesforce go a little quiet. They have to go quiet in the short term. Intuitant that did MailChimp for 12 billion. You've seen an incredible amount. And so I think ultimately these valuations are going to get cheaper. This is when you want to be a choir. And if you're a strategic hero, private equity. Great perspective as always.

3822," Great perspective as always Jeffrey senior research analyst Brent they'll have a great weekend We'll talk to you soon. You do thanks All right before we head to break let's take a look at some upbeat comments on Uber and Lyft out of Deutsche Bank before each company reports earnings Analyst Benjamin Black says ride share demand backdrop for both Uber and Lyft remain strong explains black Our data comports with recent Uber management commentaries suggesting that ride share demand is beginning to follow typical seasonality Therefore we think the downside risks to ride share gross bookings for both companies is limited before we go to break though I will add this let's do a quick check of the markets here You're seeing the stocks really come out of the gate strengthen relative to the opening bell and Brad you flag this and It seems to be moving off of this the latest Nick Timrose market moving Wall Street Journal story Really I think for the first time Signally that the Fed pivot or that up time or that point where the Fed pulls back a little bit on raising rates by 75 basis points That might come in early 2023 perhaps quicker than some in the market expected yeah within this reporting Quote from Fed governor Christopher Waller from a speech earlier this month. However that Of course Fed whisperer that Nick Timrose has become that quote saying we will have a very thoughtful discussion about the pace of tightening at our next meeting here And that is really leaning further to some of this signaling even in a dendom to the Fed speak that we've gotten the signaling now That there may be some type of pivot in the markets certainly latching on to that here even that polar story can't turn around snap We'll leave it there we'll be right back You Walmart agreed to pay 215 million dollars to the state of Florida over claims that its pharmacies helped fuel the opioid epidemic in that state The retailer also agreed to give out 672,000 treatment kits to Florida first responders according to moody's Florida has now secured $3.2 billion to help fight the opioid crisis And a new report by doich bank sir says doich bank rather is laying off dozens of employees including some out of the UK That's according to voters. No concrete number was given but a person close to the matter says most of the cuts are in origination and advisory segments of its investment banking unit this as a pullback and financing deals prompted lenders to cut back on the call",https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XTJjX90THDQ,6,2022-10-21 14:18:46
3823," Most of the cuts are in origination and advisory segments of its investment banking unit. This as a pullback in financing deals prompted lenders to cut back on costs. And Pfizer says it's hiking its US COVID vaccine price to over $100 per dose. Dosis could be costing between $110 to $130 per dose before insurance. Now this will take place after the US government's current purchase program expires. Right now the government pays around $30 per dose. And Adidas is cutting its full-year guidance following weaker demand in Western markets and its exits from Russia. The company cut currency, neutral revenue expectations, and lowered its expected operating margin to 4%. Adidas also blamed slowdowns in China and inventory buildups for the cuts. Despite the sour outlook, Adidas did see sales grow. 11% in Q3. All right from record home prices to record mortgage rates. 2022 has been a wild ride for the now ice cold housing market. But could this pain be good for prospective home buyers down the road? You'll find Ceeacombs, Rig Newman is here with more so. Rick, I should be cheering these declines because maybe at some point I'll be able to buy home. Maybe a year from now or something like that, but it's getting ugly in the housing market and it's probably going to get uglier. So we just saw the eighth consecutive month of declining existing home sales. That's the worst stretch since 2007 and what was happening in 2007. That was when the housing bubble was exploding. We got the home builders index this week. That has been going down. That's now at the lowest level since the bottom of the COVID downturn. And if you don't count that, it's the lowest level since 2012. Again, close to the bottom of the housing bust back then. So we have a long way to go to get through housing. Everybody has kind of seen this coming. I mean, this has almost everything to do with rising interest rates and mortgage rates now up around 7%. But we haven't seen prices really fall over yet. They've just started to turn and they will come down for sure. But we're at the beginning of a major correction and we probably have months to go. Rick, I like Saasie. Also just want to know when it's possible to buy a house. But I guess further out down the line, what kind of changes are we really expecting for the consumer environment to look like, especially given the fact that if you have an absence of those buyers because of rates in the near term that sellers as well are going to be impacted as well. And they're going to be less listings of existing homes. Yeah, this impacts everything on both the buyer and the seller side and the builder side I should add. So we're so builders are reluctant to build. We're seeing that decline. There's a long standing problem for builders getting permits. And you're right, there's this lock-in effect. So if you happen to be a homeowner and I'm lucky enough to be one, I'm older than you guys, of course. Then you probably locked in a mortgage rate of around 3%. And you're looking at this market in St. yourself. I'm not going to sell. I'm going to go out of my way to stay where I am and keep that to keep that where it is. So as with many other things we talk about on our area every day, we need to get to the other side of the Fed's tightening cycle. I think we need to see when that the Fed is finally feels like it's gone far enough. And then we can get through this difficult period. And you know, at some point, it's reasonable to think interest rates are going to come back down again. It might take a recession to do that. I mean, I've seen some economists saying, yeah, we think the Fed will basically finish up by late this year or early next year. And then it could be cutting rates again if we actually get into a recession in 2023. So, you know, things do change in the housing market, but these are long shifts. This is not like stocks. These are long shifts. We're talking six, nine, twelve months to we get to the other side of this. Congrats here, home ownership, Rick Newman. Always good to see you. We'll talk to you soon. Hi guys. It has been a year to forget and tech. As you can see by the unfolding nest, it's snappled.

3824," This journey was almost completed. Second part is the second carriage. Now just walk through the Forest of Names. A first fermentation of 10 minutes will continue. The second worstphem is the final selection. I'm going to use a little bit of water. I'm going to use a little bit of water. I'm going to use a little bit of water. I'm going to use a little bit of water. The tech sector is firmly in the red and fraught regulation issues, layoffs and hiring freezes as inflation and market uncertainty take their toll on the sector. The tech landscape and global economic picture is six street partners. We've been talking all morning about this. The average investor understand what is happening and when will it end? I found it helpful as an investor and just for my own peace of mind to keep my eyes on the long term trends. There's a lot going on. I don't think I can add to it. There's certainly a lot of macroeconomic news. There's the announcement that we all read yesterday. I would just say this is the nature of tech. It is risky. It is growth. It is volatile. It has been on a very long trend and it was easy and fun to get used to that trend. Who knows where that's going to go in the future. But if you step way back and just look at the long term trend, I think there's very few predictions that I will make with absolute rock solid confidence. One of them is that there's going to be more software in the future than there is in the present. So long term is the same and there's a lot of ups and downs on the way. That prediction tracks Marty. Appreciate that here this morning. You also have a unique position of sitting on the board at alphabet as well. With that in mind, I just wonder what is the next transformative technology that's really going to be the changing factor for consumers and as well for some of the companies that we cover on a daily basis. So one thing that you get to say if you've been at the same thing for a long time is you live long enough to get to be considered a pioneer and so a long time ago. I was working on AI in medicine. This is back in the late 80s and the early 90s. The compute power was just way too low. And I remember back then there were people working on neural networks and we used to think, OK, that doesn't seem like that's ever going to work. Well, that has worked unbelievably well. So I many other people were just dead wrong about neural networks and what we are able to do we've all seen with neural networks is amazing. And we are just at the very, very beginning of an incredibly exciting up.",https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XTJjX90THDQ,8,2022-10-21 14:27:36
3825," And what we are able to do, we've all seen, with neural networks is amazing. We are just at the very, very beginning of an incredibly exciting upswing and what we're gonna be able to do with AI across the board, whether it's drug discovery, climate change, or at the beginning of actually being able to do amazing, really miraculous things with AI. So that's the future, but right now, you're also kind of looking at this environment where even as we were looking at snaps, earnings and really reading through where they're impacted as a result of operating system privacy changes that many social media companies have been hit by because of the changes that Apple had put forward. There is another OS that's out there, in fact there are a few other ones and one of the other major competing ones is the Android OS. Why is it that there has been more of an impact to the social media companies derivative of privacy changes from the Apple operating system than from any privacy changes because there's also a privacy push within the Android OS as well? Well, I think all companies need to step back and the regulators doing this as well and look at what privacy means, how to define it and what we actually want and to get ready for it. And there's just a whole range of outcomes. This is a huge global social, political decision that we all have to make. And there's so many moving cards I'd love to predict it but I would just say to all companies, you have to ready yourself for a large number of different regulatory outcomes. Really, the question is, and we know what is possible with AI, what does society want us to do with it? And that is a very big decision that's happening right now. There's no one route. It depends on operating systems. It depends on policies. It depends on choices that consumers and companies make and nobody knows what's going to happen. So you just have to be ready for a variety of outcomes. Already, when the market gets a sense, the Fed is done raising rates for this cycle. What will that mean for the M&A market? Well, so I have somewhat infamous for not making timing predictions and I think I don't make them because I'm terrible at them, right? So, and also causality is hard like knowing this happens and that's going to happen next and predicting the timing of it. So right there is M&A happening. There are in every economy, including the one that we currently have, there are difficult spots and there are bright spots. Again, back to AI, if you're looking at financing and in acquisitions and combinations of all kinds, in that area of AI, that is booming just like probably better than ever. Right? And so there are bright spots, green shoots even now in certain sectors and AI is certainly wonderful. Marty, we only got about 30 seconds left, but I'd love to know, especially as so many companies are making changes when it comes to diversity, equity, and inclusion, whether that be at the entry level, mid management, all the way up to the board. What is the step that a company can take right now in order to ensure that even in the midst of macroeconomic uncertainty, that they are retaining those values? Well, so the companies have the right values in that general, I don't know, I'm not gonna make a blanket statement, but really it comes down to what are you actually doing day to day in your recruitment and you're filling the pipeline in understanding connected to managing your people. And so companies are doing a much better job at the entry level, though it's still hard in reflecting the demographics of the cities and environments where they operate. Really the hard part is as people to become more senior in their careers, how do we continue to make them want to be here as opposed to some other place and how we actively manage their careers to mentorship and sponsorship? Those are the things that all companies need to be doing in a disciplined process oriented way every day through every market cycle. Sixth Street's partner and vice chairman, thanks so much for joining us. Marty Shavez, appreciate the time this morning. Pleasure, do well. Thanks. Guys, coming up, we're gonna share the full interview with Verizon Wireless CEO, Hans Vesberg on the other side of this short break-in on the back of these companies. Thank you, everybody.",https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XTJjX90THDQ,9,2022-10-21 14:31:46
3826," Here, the full interview with Verizon Wireless CEO, Hans Vesburg, on the other side of this short break-in on the back of his company's company's support. Verizon closing the books on its third quarter. It reported results before the bell and its stock currently moving lower by about 5.6% as investing in the company's support. Verizon closing the books on its third quarter. It reported results before the bell and its stock currently moving lower by about 5.6% as investors mold the report and weigh the impact of inflation on the wireless providers consumer business. I spoke to Verizon CEO Hans Vesburg earlier about the quarter. Take a listen. I think we came out from the second quarter. We had some softness in our consumer business, especially on the wireless. We took a lot of actions in the second quarter, especially around new plants, new products, but we also did some price adjustments. Coming into the third quarter and now reporting that, we can see some of that is really getting good effect. We're growing 10% or wireless revenue. Our EBITDA grew almost 3% to 12.2 billion dollars. So definitely the progress we put in place was actually working, but it's a lot more to do. We're a large company and we need to continue the hard work we're doing right now to continue to do the great cash generation we're doing. That was the highlight of the quarter. So we saw also the pre-paid market. We acquired a track fund last year, which added a really good asset when it comes to being in the value segment. We had a new product in there, a new product called Total Wireless, but Verizon. We also added home broadband to the pre-paid market. And overall our broadband had a really good quarter. 377,000 new broadband customers in the quarter across business and consumer. So that fixed wireless access business we're doing is really working. So a lot of things was working for us. We still are working on the consumer segment to be even stronger. And we're going to take more actions. It's a very agile market when it comes to consumer segment at the moment. We're going to talk a little bit more about that consumer segment as well, Hans. And from your perspective, when you think about what you had said at the end of the second quarter, mid-summer, second half challenges, you were kind of looking out into the future and saying that second half challenges, you see them as short term. Is that still the case? Or do you believe that there's some facets of the softness in the consumer, especially as they're paying more?",https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XTJjX90THDQ,10,2022-10-21 14:36:27
3827," and saying that second half challenges, you see them as short-term. Is that still the case? Or do you believe that there's some facets of the softness in the consumer, especially as they're paying more for necessities right now? And the macroeconomic climate that you believe might protrude into 2023 or even beyond? It's a little bit mixed feelings, actually. Evan, we have the highest quality custom base and the largest consumer base in the country. We see really good payment from our customers, consumers, where we are actually better than pre-COVID. So we don't see anything there. We actually see the roaming when people are traveling abroad. That movement are equally big or higher than pre-COVID. So a lot of things are moving as normal and our store traffic between Q2 to Q3, that increased with double digits. So people are actually doing movement. And then of course, we all read what's happening in the macroeconomy with higher inflation and the interest rates coming up. So it's a little bit mixed, but clearly, we are in the fundamental product. Everybody needs mobility. Everybody needs to be connected. That's so important for us. And even more important these days. So clearly, there are mixed feelings. We think we have a great product, we have a great network, and we are spanning all the consumer segment. And then don't forget our business side. That has a really good quarter with both growth. There are almost 6% in a wireless business in the business group. But not only that, I did 200,000 new, almost 200,000 new net-dads, full net-dads in the business segment. So it's a little bit mixed when you read in the market and what we're seeing in our customer base. Certainly. I want to talk a little bit more about those network investments in a moment, but before that, we know that you're one of the largest partners with Apple in terms of the iPhone, the latest edition of this consumer device and the smartphone that comes out year after year. And within that, there's even been some of the reports around where the demand might be pulling back. Are you seeing that show up in your business at all right now? Now, when we come to the iPhone 14, the ones we have seen very normal volumes, but moreover, we actually made an exclusive deal with Apple, which we have done over a long time. We're Apple 1 for only limited. It's a new offering where you have all the Apple services, Apple Plus, the gaming, et cetera. In one package together, we are only limited. Very good for us to get it with Apple. So now we're very normal. There's a little bit of mix, of course, which type of products our customers are taking, but in general, very normal levels of a launch of an iPhone. If you were coming back to the network infrastructure investments that you're making as well, if we were to see any kind of recessionary concerns really permeate over into the next year, what would that mean in terms of the moderation of the level of network investments that you might be making? And perhaps on the other end, where are you full steam ahead? I think that the last six, seven years, we have the plan exactly how we're going to invest in the network. This is our peak year. We're going to do some somewhere between around 22 billion in Capex, that's our guidance. And that's one portion is our business as usual. And then the other is that the new spectrum we bought last year is actually coming to execution right now. And we're doing that as fast as we can. And next year, that will come down. But we have invested in fiber. We're investing in the C band, the spectrum we bought. We're going to pass 200 million pop in the first quarter on our C band. And the important with the C band, that's a five-d spectrum that we're using. We see good growth on that. So where we launch a market with the C band, we see mobility, business growing, we see fixed-wise access growing. And for the viewers, important, we bought that spectrum. But we get it all the time as those satellite companies are releasing it. And the last piece of that spectrum, we will get at the end of 2023. But basically, it's nationwide 160 megahertz, which is a lot of spectrum. And we're only deploying pieces of it right now. But by year and 2023, we'll have all. So we have a clear process of how we implement and execute in our network. And that's our number one capital priority as well. So we will do what is needed for a network. We already have the best network. And it's just getting back.",https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XTJjX90THDQ,11,2022-10-21 14:40:23
3828," implement and execute in our network. And that's on number one capital priority as well. So we will do what is needed for the network. We already have the best network. And it's just getting better. So just lastly, while we have you here, I got a hustle to my finish here. But I'm taking a look at the stock price. Investors clearly reaction to this morning's earnings report. And perhaps they may be paying attention to some of the churn in end users or subscribers. But they also may be paying close attention to the margins as related to some of the capex that's going to be set forth and continues to be earmarked to the tune of $22 billion that you just mentioned. When do you believe either some of the churn will start to alleviate? And then on the other side, when you can start to adequately wind down perhaps some of the spending so that the margins aren't as compressed. So when it comes to our churn in the third quarter, that was expected. We took a deliberate decision in the second quarter to do price adjustment in certain consumer segments. And we knew that we would have a churn bubble. So that was sort of an expected and very deliberate decision we took. And it was important for us to also do that because our industry has not done price adjustments on wireless ever. So this was the time to do it. We did it for certain segments. So that will ease over over time. So I think that's a very important message. And when it comes to the capex, we have a clear plan. We will come back, of course, with exact guidance for 23. But we have a very clear plan how we are on the peak level of spending right now. And then it will come down as we are spending as fast as we can and deploying the C band spectrum that we bought a year ago. All right. The Supreme Court has rejected a request made to block the Biden administration's program for student debt relief as has a district court. Yowell, fine, says legal correspondent Lexus Keenan has the latest Lexus. Hi, Brian. Yes. So two courts yesterday rejecting the request for emergency relief that would cancel the implementation of Biden's student loan forgiveness plan. Now, one was the Supreme Court request showed up there from a group of Wisconsin taxpayers. Associate Justice Amy Coney Barrett, she denied that request, not even taking up the matter on the merits at all. The other one came from a district court in Missouri. The Missouri case was brought by six Republican led states. They argued that Biden used Serpent Congress's authority to spend the taxpayers money. They also said that the relief plan jeopardizes the state's tax revenues, particularly revenue from the state run loan servicers that a lot of different states have across the country. The Wisconsin case for its taxpayers, it was brought by Brown County taxpayers near Green Bay, Wisconsin. That's the area. They made similar argument about Congress's spending power saying that Biden overstepped his bounds here. They also said that the president improperly invoked the 2003 Heroes Act that's really meant to give student debt relief to military members and their families. Now, the reason, though, that the state plaintiffs were denied this relief is because the court said they lacked standing as for the Wisconsin taxpayers and the Supreme Court's decision, we don't know the basis on which they denied this relief. It's because it's part of the Supreme Court's so-called shadow docket where it doesn't really go through the full briefing and hearing process that's given to those formal opinions that we've all been accustomed to. Now, there's a good chance, though, that standing was lurking behind the Supreme Court's decision. It's been a problem for all of the litigants that have tried to come forward to block this student loan relief. But I just want to give you a little lesson in what standing is. I think we have a full screen to show you what the plaintiffs have to the come to the table with in court is. They have to have a concrete injury. They have to have a injury that's very particular to them. It can't be an injury that's general to all. It can't be all taxpayers, for example. Also, that injury has to be an actual or imminent injury. It has to be happening right now. It can't be one that's hypothetical out in the future. Also, the injury has to be traceable to the action of the defendant named in the lawsuit. And also, it has to be something that the court can actually address, give redress to these so-called grieved plaintiffs. So the court saying here, both of these courts, all of the courts at this point saying, no plaintiffs, you do not have standing. We do not even have jurisdiction to hear this case. So what's next for the Republican states, they say that they're going to appeal the district court's decision for the-",https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XTJjX90THDQ,12,2022-10-21 14:44:43
3829," do not even have jurisdiction to hear this case. So what's next? For the Republican states, they say that they're going to appeal the district court's decision for the Wisconsin taxpayers. They too are trying to appeal the seventh circuits, toss out of their lawsuit. So we'll be watching for that. Alexis King, thanks for breaking it all down for us. Appreciate it. All right, with airline earnings coming in hot, the theme park space may be worth another both fine investors more on this straight ahead. Yeah. The theme parks have had a rocky year as they look to bounce back from the lows of COVID-19. And our next guest says, estimate need to come down to a better reflect the challenges ahead. City Research Director James Hartman joins us now. James, good to see you again. We're right in the middle of a fright fest for six flags. And it's been a very frightful year for that company. They have really been struggling. How do you think this quarter shaped up? Yeah, I mean, and you're right. It has been a tough year for these guys. They had a new strategy where they're essentially aiming to have fewer customers, right? But the strategy that we know. That's not a good strategy. Here, please. We don't want to let you in. But take less business. We're okay with that. That's right. Well, we dubbed the Jerry McGuire strategy. You were customers more profits, better service. That may have made more sense come into this year. It's been a tough sell as some of these macro pressures have mounted. And so to answer your question, I do think it's a tough third. It was a tough third quarter for these guys. I think estimates probably are too high. I think attendance of anything. It was pretty bad in the second quarter. Anything there's a good chance that that got worse here in 3Q. James, for the lay person following this six-fledged story. And the CEO made some bizarre comments on that last earnings call. Push that aside. What is wrong with six flags? Is it the stands where they get the food? Are the rides not cool enough? Is it a combination of all that? Or is it just too expensive to go to these parks? Yeah, I think it's a combination of all of those things relative to other theme parks. Six flags has historically not been able to get the pricing that those others have and that they would hope to, particularly since they cater to some of the biggest cities in the US with some of the best disposable income. It tends to be a lot more teenager oriented as opposed to.",https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XTJjX90THDQ,13,2022-10-21 14:49:16
3830," You know, some of the biggest cities in the US with some of the best disposable income. It tends to be a lot more teenager oriented as opposed to family oriented. And I think that plays a role in terms of the pricing that they're able to get. You know, there's an argument to be made that they haven't invested enough in their parks over the years. And that has also led to this sort of lower quality experience, at least that being the perception. And so I think that's all what predated this new concept that they ultimately had. They didn't put it this way, but that they fired their customers in a lot of ways. And you got to be real careful with that suffice at the second. That's bad news for the Dippin' Dot Barometer, James. When we think about some of the other major theme parks that are out there, I mean, what is going to be vastly different between this year and next year? This was supposed to be that travel demand boom year, that revenge experiential economy year. If not this year, then what does that shape up for next year for the theme parks? Yeah, it's such a great point. I mean, we were believers that there was this pent-up demand as we exited the pandemic for exactly these types of experiences. Unfortunately, there isn't a whole lot of daylight between the post-pandemic phase or story and the pre-recession or recession story. And I think that's those two things ultimately, but it up against each other here in the summer of 22. I've got numbers lower for next year. We have seen pretty consistently over the course of the summer, slowing demand trends for the theme parks. Now, the good news is I do think that these companies, these businesses tend to hold in better, better than some of the other discretionary names that I follow. Right? And so they're going to feel it. I think attendance is likely to be down. Sales are likely to be down. But they generally hold in pretty well. And the reason for that is they tend to be trained down beneficiaries. Right? As opposed, once travel turns over, if in fact it does, these tend to be cheaper alternatives than going to Orlando or Mexico or Europe. James, what you often see in a lot of these theme park parking lots is when a Begos family take these when a Begos and they go to the theme parks. Now, that is the stock you cover. This company just reported earnings. Take us through their inventory situation. Are they able to get the semiconductors and the supplies they need to get these trucks or these mobile homes out of the showrooms and into the front porches or the dryways of customers? Yeah, I mean, so that was the narrative for so much of 2021 in the early part of 2022. Could they get this supply out there because there was very much to believe that true demand was better than these reported retail numbers? IE, if you had more product, you could sell more product. I think that narrative has changed over the past three months and, and oh, by the way, I don't think it's just for Arby's. I think the ability to stock showroom floors has improved dramatically. And if you want to get one of these, you can get one of these right now. I think that the it's a double head sword now though. The concern is that these manufacturers will pump up the channel too much with some of these inventories. And that would ultimately turn make a bad situation worse as we think about a potential recession. And again, it's not just Arby's. I think this whole debate as to are we are aren't we heading towards a recession? In what I cover, right, big ticket discretionary. In a lot of ways, it feels like we're there or or fastly quickly approaching that place. It does seem like over the past few months. Supply has improved, but the man has not. All right. Well, for those of us brining myself included who are priced out of the housing market. The RVs are looking to be good. I'm Neil Baby. City Research Director James Hardman, thanks for taking the time here today. Have a great weekend. Thanks, guys. Guys, coming up, we're going to do a roundup of the top things that we've heard this week from some key business leaders, from everything from our all-market summit to kick off the week through to, yeah, today's conversations with some big CEOs as well. That's next.",https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XTJjX90THDQ,14,2022-10-21 14:53:19
3831," We will begin the beetle method. Welcome back to Yahoo Finance, everyone. It was an energizer bunny type of week here for us here on the morning show as we spoke with a numerous amount of executives, including CEOs from Bank of America. We had proctor and gamble, target or tarjet, and Hilton all seeming to be optimistic surrounding recession chances, and the current state of the consumer here's what they had to say. They have pushed that projection for recession out a little bit into 23, but their core belief is a mild recession. So purely from a consumer demand and willingness to span the standpoint, we wouldn't predict a recession. The hope is, it allows the Fed, at some point over the next six or 12 months, to sort of stabilize having done their job with inflation, more in a control, and allow the economy to get its footing again and start a process of re-acceleration. They continue to say they want to celebrate the holidays, and we know they're out on the streets of New York, they're in restaurants, they're in our stores, so right now we're seeing a stable environment. So there was a ton to really be extrapolated from those conversations, whether it was during our all market summit to kick off the week, or even later on as we moved through Ernie season, but particularly one of the threads was where the Fed policy is going to continue to actually impact the consumer in this near term, and what that actually does for the economy to change the demand profile or the demand cycle that we find ourselves in as relates to these companies' financial performance. Yeah, we talked about it earlier, Brad. I think we got a taste to that in that really major profit warming for a whirlpool. Again, those are big ticket purchases that you put on credit cards, heard it from Generak earlier in the week, but what is interesting, I'll just call up Target as well, Brian Cornell, Chairman and CEO, telling us he's a stable business, but how stable is it next year? Let's say there's a Target store next to Snap headquarters or where Snap employees work. They just missed their quarter because of pressure on online spending because the economy is slowing down. That person now lost their job. Are they still spending at the same rate after this holiday season at a target that they were this year? Unclear, which speaks to the bigger thing, this is a very challenging Ernie season. It is really hard to truly understand what is going on inside corporate America. It's a hard Ernie season, but at the same time for us and the conversations, I mean, the questions that we're asking are definitely trying to just get a different sense of...",https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XTJjX90THDQ,15,2022-10-21 14:57:58
3832," It's a hard earnings season, but at the same time for us and the conversations, I mean, the questions that we're asking are definitely trying to just get a different sense of where there actually is some of that vulnerability, how they're managing through that, and then on the other side of that, what kind of company is emerging on the other side of that economic downturn or macroeconomic challenge that continues to be cited here? More big convose to come next week. Well, that is it for myself and Brad. Coming up, Akiko Pajito will speak with two analysts about the state of the semiconductor sector. You won't want to miss it. Thank you. Welcome to Yahoo Finance Live. And happy Friday to all of you. It's 11am here in New York City. I'm Akiko Fujita. Here's what I'm watching at this hour. Snap, crackle, flop. Shares of the social media company plummet. As declining ad revenue and widening losses weigh on investors, we're going to discuss the numbers and implications for wider tech. Musk underscrew me. The Biden administration reportedly considers national security reviews for the Tesla CEO as questions swirl around foreign investors involved with the Twitter buyout. Ship disruption, new US tech controls threatened to shake up the global semiconductor industry. As companies scramble to be in compliance, we've got a paddle standing by for you to discuss the implications. First though, let's check in on the market action. We are 90 minutes into the trading day, of course, trying to round out the week here on a positive note. We've got the Dow up 151 points. The S&P 500 up nine. The Nasak, the only one in the red. The yield on the 10 year treasury note, one to really note today, climbing to a level we have not seen in 14 years.",https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XTJjX90THDQ,16,2022-10-21 15:02:14
3833, 100 up 9 the Nasdaq the only one in the red the yield on the T tenure treasury note want to really note today climbing to a level we have not seen in 14 years we also saw a big jump in the 30 year yield but we've seen a bit of a pullback off the highs in part because of some of the comments that we have gotten from Fed officials there's that Wall Street Journal report that came out that pointed to potential concerns within our monk Fed officials about over tightening and how aggressively they're moving that could be partly what we're seeing the levels right now but the tenure yield still at 4.24% moving on to our top story of the hour it is all about snap and take a look at where shares are trading right now down more than 30% following its miss on revenue estimates for the third quarter the social media company citing continued deceleration of revenue growth as a result of ongoing challenges that include platform policy changes macro economic had wins and increased competition joining us now for a snapshot of the path ahead for staff we got Jason healthstein up in high-mer managing director and head of internet research Jason you know this certainly was not a great quarter but this is a steep fall for this company shares are down more than 30% how much of this you think is overdone I think the challenges investors are kind of estimates I'll do they want to support this company longer term I think one of the questions we get from investors is you know will they ever put ads in messaging I think it's pretty well known we all know we use all of us use messaging products right and we generally don't see ads and messaging products and so and a lot of this company's use case is at the messaging tool right when they do then try to take that activity and get you to spend time using spotlight and using discover but they're also seeing a kind of competition there from TikTok and others and so when you couple together the 5% decline in U.S. time spent with kind of revenue that was below expectations and and currently trend that investors are having a really hard time to cybery you know I think you're having investors trying to decide do they want to underwrite the stock longer the company longer term Jason there are two key issues that have really persisted from quarter to quarter this year one is of course that the slowdown that we've seen in ad spending to the point you just made also the other one is about this company being able to navigate these changes that have taken part as a new as a result of the privacy guardrails that are now in place through apples I.O.S. I mean this is not these are not new problems that came up during this quarter and I wonder if you think we've taken away anything more based on that earnings call yesterday about how much worse things are about to get particularly for snap yeah we think kind of the apple privacy is is is a good excuse but not the main reason that really only affects for the most part app downloads or advertisers trying to drop downloads the bulk of snapchats advertising is brand advertising and and that's what's been bouncing around kind of month a month in kind of an unpredictable way so and they're telling you that they they expect their brand advertising to slow as they move through the quarter right and so I just that is that is the kind of the issue and then they're also telling you that effectively competition is still a threat to time spent and so this quarter you saw impressions slowed not a ton they were up 8% item of ads sold versus nine for the last quarter but then price brand was down three versus up four in the second quarter and they're kind of telling you that they think those metrics will slow right expecting basically flat revenue growth in the back half and you know it's not the fourth quarter and it's not all currency currency was about two points of headwind so there's definitely you know I'd say more companies specific factors obviously will know more next week when alphabet and metta report but we don't expect kind of as bad of an outlook from metta because they will be comparing against what was a challenging period last year well and let's pick about that point because when you look at the other social media stocks they are following today in tandem with snap not to the levels that we're seeing,https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XTJjX90THDQ,17,2022-10-21 15:06:20
3834," Following today in tandem with snap not to the levels that we're seeing in terms of declines in the snap stock But alphabet you mentioned meta Pinterest another one that's been coming down as well We've learned in the last quarter that you know it this is this isn't snap isn't always a bellweather partly because these other names Are a little more diversified. I mean what's your expectation when you look at some of these names on the screen? Who's best position to write out the macro headwinds? Yeah, I mean to to your point, you know, we do think that the whole sector is getting penalized Obviously not not as bad as a snap is but kind of down, you know four or five six percent depending on the company We actually do like meta the best right now For playing digital advertising within large cap in front of the quarter Mostly because they already took their longs a year ago, right? So they were the most impacted by Apple privacy changes They call that a 10 percentage point kind of impact to them They also benefited the most during the pandemic from the poll forward in e-commerce spending and e-commerce advertising and that has unwound as we As the economy is reopened if you look at the monthly data on retail sales e-commerce isn't growing any faster than overall retail sales So that's kind of telling you that they're still kind of like a hangover there And so we think as that starts to obey and you've easier calms we think the setup is is pretty good for meta And then the last thing is we are waiting for Apple to kind of update. It's called SCAD Network 4.0. It's the next technology tool to improve Tracking of ads and and performance data and we think meta is the best position company to take advantage of that for their advertiser So we are optimistic on meta in front of the quarter Okay, well, we're watching for those numbers when they come out next week Jason healthstein Oppenheimer managing director and head of internet research appreciate the time Thank you Well, let's not turn to the broader markets. We've got fed officials now moving forward towards another rate hike of point 75 percentage points at the November meeting We've got Yahoo Finance as Jared liqueur is always on top of this and yield certainly been the focus of the week But yet again today we're talking about a level we haven't seen in 14 years Yes, and let's go to the Wi-Fi interactive. I'm plotting the US dollar index We're going to circle around the currencies in a second because what we're talking about in terms of bonds very closely link with currencies And there are spillover effects into equities everything is linked here So here's a US dollar index appreciated 17% versus this basket of currencies Mainly weighted towards a euro, but very illustrative of what's been going on here Here's a 10 year Tino yield it looks very similar to that US dollar chart In fact, they're very correlated hitting 4.22 percent now it has backed off a little bit higher number than that But as you said at Keiko most of these bond yields we have not seen since 2007 through 2011 I can put you I can show the five year That's down nine basis points a 30 year that is up base eight basis points So we have a lot that's happening with the yield curve right now and essentially it has been flattening And let me just point you I'm going to put up the US dollar one more time here and I have some comments from Nordia that I want to go over because we are caught in an effects Loop here and this has to do with respect This has to do with the Bank of Japan now Nordia is taking a look at this countries are saying do not have an endless amount of US dollars at disposal to sell Meaning that effects intervention will fail when the US dollar coffers run dry This is from the perspective of these central bankers over in Japan They have amassed a war chest of US dollars. They also hold 1.2 trillion dollars in US treasuries very important here So Nordia going on to say more over effects intervention involves selling US treasuries That's to get US dollars which adds upward pressure on US rates That's because rates are inverse to bond prices stick with me one more second here This leads to a stronger US dollar in isolation this affects intervention intervention US US dollar doom loop doom loop illustrated here I'll show you the picture in a second could lead to dollar overshooting especially when central banks are enforcing the loop So here we go weaker yen sales of US treasuries higher US dollar rates weaker yen and the cycle continues And that's what we've been seeing here And this the spillover effects as I mentioned with respect to equities These de leveraging actions right here. We're not going to see a bit on equities until all of this is done",https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XTJjX90THDQ,18,2022-10-21 15:10:42
3835," And this, the spillover effects, as I mentioned with respect to equities, these leveraging actions right here, we're not going to see a bit on equities until all of this is done. And the central bankers have been very flat-footed about the response so far. Yeah, the BOJ in even tougher position given the data we got today, right? Eight-year high inflation, not at the level that we're seeing in the US, but still, they've got a very dovish policy in place. They've got the yen continuing to weaken against the dollar, and then now that they're looking at we didn't get to it, but the yen very volatile today, maybe an intervention that we don't know about going on right now. Okay, something to watch, thanks so much for that, Jared. Well, at the time now for our trending ticker, and we are seeing weaker than expected subscriber numbers weighing on shares of Verizon. That stock is down more than 6% hitting a 52-week low today. The largest wireless carrier added just 8,000 monthly subscribers in the most recent quarter. As competitors offered aggressive promotions to take away market share, that prompted Verizon to offer its own discount and introduce low-cost mobile phone service and internet plans. There's what CEO Hans Westberg had to say on customer terms this morning. We took a deliberate decision in a second quarter to do price adjustment in certain consumer segments, and we knew that we would have a show in Bobbill. So that was sort of an expected and very deliberate decision we took, and it was important for us to also do that because our industry has not done price adjustments on wireless ever. So this was the time to do it. We did it for certain segments, so that will ease over all the time. So I think that's a very important message. Broadband proved to be a bright spot for the quarter for Verizon. The company added another 342,000 wireless home internet customers in the quarter. Well, coming up, the result season is stealing the headlines this week, but investors keeping a very close watch on the bond market as the 10-year treasury yield hits levels we haven't seen in 14 years. We're going to talk to market strategy on the other side.",https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XTJjX90THDQ,19,2022-10-21 15:15:22
3836," [♪ OUTRO MUSIC PLAYING [♪ Philadelphia Fed President Patrick Carker says the Central Bank is not quite finished raising its target rate as inflation remains stubbornly high. Meanwhile, a fresh report in the Wall Street Journal this morning suggests some Fed officials are signaling unease with big rate rises. So is this the first sign of the long-awaited pivot? Do you want to guess the discusses Emily Roland Co. Chief Investments for as just a John Hancock investment management? Emily, I'd be curious to get your thoughts on this report that came out from the journal today about the debate that's happening in whether you in fact think that the data that we have gotten, the latest data points to the need for at least a pause in the hikes. Yeah, the volatility in the rate market today has been nothing short of astonishing. You know, we woke up to this continued backup and interest rates have been playing out over the last few days and then this, you know, journal article comes out suggesting that potentially the Fed is going to be leaning towards 50 basis points in December instead of 75 or at least discussing that at the November Fed meeting here. So, you know, we think that that it's right to consider a pause and you even heard Lail Brainerd earlier about a week ago talking about the fact that, you know, maybe we are a pause is potentially warranted here as some of the monetary policy decisions start to really work their way into the economy and it's important to recognize that Fed policy works the long and variable lag. The Fed just started tightening in March of this year and they've implemented the most aggressive amount of tightening that we've seen in the generation in a really, really short amount of time. We want to watch to see how that actually filters into the economy before the Fed just continues down this path of aggressive tightening. How much of that have we actually seen filter through the economy based on what you've seen? Well, we look at the leading economic indicators and we just saw another negative readings. We've had three negative readings in a row here for the leading indicators and that's the gest that we are in a significantly decelerating economic growth climate. The challenges is that the Fed uses by nature of their mandates lagging economic data. So, they're looking at the fact that the unemployment rate is at 3.5 percent near a 50 or low. They're looking at CPI data which just continues to be and they're a big component of that of course is the housing market shelter which tends to be a very sticky component of inflation. It takes time to show up in the data and the Fed is marching down this path of dampening inflation really at any cost but that's the key question at what cost and they're looking like they're going to keep going until something breaks. I mean the other big challenge of course comes down to messaging and that's been a bit tricky when you think about how things played out over the summer. Now we know that the Fed officials didn't feel like the markets were simply getting the message. We got that very strong message at Jackson Hole. Since then it's sort of been we're going to continue to hike rates until inflation comes down. How do you think they told the line here? If in fact there is some kind of pause to at least message to the markets this doesn't mean a pivot. This is just a slowdown. It's such a great question because the messaging and the forward guidance is so critical and one of the things we learned from the journal article this morning was that the Fed wants to be careful in avoiding a big upside move in markets based on this perceived Fed pivot. So I think if they do decide to go with 50 in December it's going to be well telegraphed whether it's through the Wall Street Journal or some other mechanism because we saw that incredible rallying soft to play it out from mid-June to mid-August for your point there and it was based on this false hope that the Fed was going to reverse course in quick fashion and clearly that's not the case and they've made it quite clear that they're going to keep the gloves off and the fight against inflation until the fight is done. Bottom line Emily as we look ahead to the next few months and what does that mean from an investment standpoint does this change at all in terms of your thesis on",https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XTJjX90THDQ,20,2022-10-21 15:19:21
3837," Emily, as we look ahead to the next few months, and what does that mean from an investment standpoint? Does this change at all in terms of your thesis on where things are headed? Or is this also a time to maybe pause and wait to see where the economic debt elites? Yeah, I mean, investors are feeling really specific right now as this volatility picked up, and we're suggesting to them that they should focus on the horizon, which to us really means looking at the income on high-quality bonds as something that's pretty competitive versus the other alternatives out there. We used to talk about China. There's no alternative. And what we meant a couple years ago that given the fact that bond yields were so low, there was no other alternative but to buy stocks. And we would argue today that there is no alternative to bond. Yes, price pressures are there, but the fact that you can get five, six percent income on high-quality bonds right now, we think it's awfully competitive. You look at the dividend yield on the S&T 500, which is less than 2%. So we want to move up the capital structure. We want to get paid income as we wait out this more challenging macro backdrop. Some good takeaways there. Emily Roland, Co-Chief Investment Stragist at John Hancock Investment Management. Good to talk to you today. Thank you. Well, there's even more trouble for Elon Musk ahead. The US government reportedly considering whether it should review Musk's newfound empire. That includes his ongoing deal for social media site Twitter and SpaceX's satellite network. Let's bring, we should report, is according to Bloomberg. Let's bring in Yahoo Finance, is Alexis Keenan, who's tracking this. Alexis, let's start with what's happening with Twitter because this is an interesting one given that the concern is really about who's part of this investment group for Twitter, that there are foreign players in here that could potentially signal a conflict. Right. So what Bloomberg is reporting is that US officials in the Abadan administration are concerned about the Twitter deal to the extent that it has foreign investors, including the Saudi Arabian prince Al Wali Bintalal, as well as Binance, which has a Chinese founder and has backing from Cutters' sovereign wealth fund. So that's where they're saying that according to sources, there are maybe some concerns. Now, they also go on to say that it's not really clear which agency would originate this kind of inquiry, but one of the usual suspects is CIFIAS, that's the Committee on Foreign Investment in the United States. That committee in 2018 was given a lot of expanded authority to conduct these types of threat assessments over possible security concerns that arise from foreign investment in US companies. And they even got expanded authority to look at those multi-national deals that result in less than foreign control, which was the former case for the agency, especially they got some authority to look at investments that involve companies that are engaged in technology and personal data. Of course, the Twitter deal would qualify, I would think, perhaps, under that standard. Now, the idea that the security review of a security review at all based on national security concerns, it's been raised previously with respect to Tesla, with respect to SpaceX's Starlink satellite network. But it's the first time we're hearing about it, raised with respect to the Twitter deal, that's certainly sparking a lot of questions about the, whether the government could end up derailing this deal and certainly part of that contract for the merger between the two companies. It does require that it surpass any regulatory and government review. So that's getting a lot of talk here. Elon Musk already tweeting that in response to this Bloomberg piece saying commenting on a Twitter post that said it would be hilarious if the government ended being the one to derail this tie up between Twitter and Musk's companies that he's formed in order to effectuate this merger. Really quickly, Alexis, any of us who've followed these syphias reviews in the past know that this is never a quick turnaround. And we are talking months and months and months of review. If in fact that's triggered, what does that mean for the deal? Well, Akiko, syphias can take a look at transactions that are already, that are.",https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XTJjX90THDQ,21,2022-10-21 15:23:42
3838," view. If in fact that's triggered, what does that mean for the deal? Well, Akiko Sifius can take a look at transactions that are already that have already happened. So they can go back and try to get some agreements from companies that have already done the deal. So it doesn't necessarily stop the deal from going forward, but the government could also intervene and say we would like to have some things ironed out before it does commence. So we'll certainly be watching the deadline that the court has put on the deal, which is October 28th next Friday, one week from today. But look, yes, it could go on for a very long time, these types of inquiries, but it doesn't mean that it just stops the deal and it's tracks. Okay, thanks getting a little more complicated there. Alexis Keenan, thanks so much for that. Well, coming up, upscale electricity. If you like trucks and want something like a hummer, then not exactly a hummerable GMC might have the thing for you. Yacht Finance is probably supermanium is going to have the story for us on the other side. The competition in the EV space is revving up. General Motors unveiled its latest electric truck yesterday, the 2024 GMC Sierra EV. It's now taking reservations for the $107,000 fully loaded version called the Sierra EV Denali Edition. Thankfully, we've got a supermanium to break down all the details for us. That is a hefty price tag, but it's not the only truck on the market. That's an EV. How does it compare? Well, you know, it's, it's twin is basically the silver auto, the Chevy Silverado, which I find to have a design that's more adventure lifestyle truck. Whereas if you look at the the new Sierra EV over here, it's more traditional truck like, looks like a work truck. I think it might have peeled to a broader set of people. Power.",https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XTJjX90THDQ,22,2022-10-21 15:28:15
3839," or lifestyle truck whereas if you look at the new Sierra EV over here it's more traditional truck like, looks like a work truck, I think it might have peeled to a broader set of people. Power wise it actually has more power than the top of Lancelot Brado, it has around 750 horsepower, 400 miles of range in that top trim, so that's pretty competitive. But you did mention that price, $107,000 for that top tier, it's very pricey, very high and very premium I would say. But I did get a chance to speak to the chief engineer, Nicole Crats about lower trim levels that are actually going to compete against the Ford Lightning Pro. Here's what you'd say. $2000 model for the Sierra EV is an elevation, it's an elevation trim so it's not a work truck in the in the standpoint of a model named a work truck or a fleet truck if you will. We're bringing some really compelling capability from a basic perspective on the Sierra EV into all price points. The trucks are capable of different ranges and different option contents. So the Sierra EV Denali that we're talking about for 2024 with our edition one is a fully loaded full all of the technology that we can possibly imagine. And then in the future, you know, many of these things become options and then various range picks as well available. So it really brings an EV pickup for everyone. I mean, we talk about that and people kind of think that's a little cliche perhaps, but we are really committed to bringing folks into our EVs, specifically in the EV pickup truck segment. And by offering them, you know, all of the capability and all of the technology that they desire, we can, you know, establish to these various ranges of our price points as well. So we don't have the spexy up for that elevation from that base model, but we do know that the Sierra Denali EV one that high end one is going to come out in 2024 with the lower terms coming out in 2025. So how does this compare to the gas powered Sears? And is that the exact target they're going for in terms of who's likely to switch over? Well, I think with the lower terms, they're going to know if they do stick with that $50,000 price set, which is, as you know, these things have been changing, that would be comparable to a Sierra work, elevation work truck at that, I shouldn't say, workshop at that trim level, it would be comparable price wise, and even have a bit more power. But the question is, are you going to be able to convince these guys who drive traditional trucks? I want to, I want to EV with potentially less than 400 miles of range. And then I'm going to take the job site, is that going to be as, as capable and sturdy as my traditional gas power can go anywhere sort of thing. So I think that's the big sort of question that GM is trying to answer or how their clients or customers answer. Yeah, still a lot of concerns about range, about infrastructure, charging stations, making sure that's all in place. Right, right. So they can drive it just like they would know normal. Right. I do want to add one thing that it does have the GM, kind of like the ability to power a work site, power your home, and also power the grid, potentially with their GM energy products. So that will work with that with the ultimate battery pack. So they do have that additional capability that you might not find in like a ravine, for example. Yeah, and that would benefit there. All right. Thanks so much for that, Pras. Well, coming up the eternal push and pull, it's been another choppy week for crude oil, prices, which in higher now is recession fear, take a back seat to hope over renewed finance demand that conversation is going up next. So tools now",https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XTJjX90THDQ,23,2022-10-21 15:32:36
3840," Nothing. What we are seeing crude setting to finish off what has been a very choppy week. His investors look ahead to earnings from the oil majors, given growing suppliers in places like Libyan recession fears, though, question is where prices headed. For more on that, let's bring in Mohammad Darwazah. He's senior analyst of macro energy at energy aspects. I'm Mohammad, good to talk to you today. I want to start with the demand that we've been looking at over in China. Of course, we started off the week at the party congress that's now wrapping up and the expectation was maybe we'd get some signaling on whether in fact China would sort of back off on the zero-COVID policy, which has led to a lot of concerns about the demand coming out of there. What do you see in terms of how things are likely to shape up in the next few months? Yeah, thank you for having me. I think you're absolutely right. There may be had been some expectations building up that post party congress, China would start moving away from zero-COVID. I think what has been clear is that actually a lot of these lockdowns have come into effect ahead of the party congress in anticipation or sort of expectation that policy will begin to shift over the next sort of three to six months. I think the market has now kind of caught up with the view that this is unlikely to change imminently, but I think going forward, there is an expectation that COVID rules are going to begin to be relaxed. China has been somewhat absent from the buying cycle, include markets over the past year or so, and I think once China does come back, this is going to be certainly a bullish factor. The next marker, a lot of investors certainly looking ahead to, is in December when we see those sanctions come down on Russian oil, we're looking at where prices are tracking today. It certainly looks like at least some of those recession fears have subsided a little. How are you looking at where things are right now for talking Brent Critt at 92.88 in the context of what's to come? Yeah, absolutely. I think obviously a lot of uncertainty going into your end, and this is kind of cast sort of a cloud over the market. The EU embargo on Russian crude and products that set to come in in December of this year and in February of next year, I think ultimately will have a significant impact on Russian production. We expect Russian production to drop by an average of about a million barrels a day, sort of by the end of Q1 of next year. More generally, I think prices will be kept going forward because of demand fears, because of concerns around recession. We are expecting quite a deep recession in Europe, a much shorter and a shallow one in the United States. And I think ultimately, the X factor here is really China. So much of the concern in the oil markets have been shaped around the supply concern. You mentioned demand concern.

3841," So much of the concern in the oil markets have been shaped around the supply concern. You mentioned demand concern. Is that what's going to be driving prices going into year end? And what are some of those risks that we're overlooking? Yeah, I mean supply, I think the market does spend a lot of time looking at supply. Supply is constrained. This is a structural issue. I think people are coming around to that view. And I would say it's a lot more sort of divergence in the market in terms of expectations. And in times of recession, we tend to see commodities and late cycle sort of sell off. And this is no different. But when we look at sort of the highs of the year, we have come off and we're about 20 ish percent from this year's highs. Okay. We'll be watching a lot of people watching to see where those prices track. Mohammed Darwaza, senior analyst of macro energy at energy aspects. Thanks so much. Thank you for your time. Well, the cost of Pfizer's COVID vaccine is going to quadruple after the current purchase program expires in the U.S. Earlier this week, Julie Heimins spoke to the company CEO Albert Borla about pricing. Here's what we have to say. The vaccines will be priced based on their cost effectiveness. And the cost effectiveness is multiple of what it is right now. The price when we give to the governments in the pandemic. We have the finance senior health reporter, Anjali Kamlani here, to break it all down for us. How big of a surprise is this sort of an expected thing? This is an expected thing. The number is the part that's new. So 110 to 130. That's what the news that we just found out. And that's from an analyst call yesterday that Pfizer had. And I want to dig down into the details because it is important to understand what's baked in to this pricing. It's things like the cost of a single dose vaccine packaging. It's the fact that they're now going to be distributing through multiple sources rather than just through the government and through that single channel of the distributor and the mailing and delivery service and transportation. That all goes away once the government contract ends. And so what they're looking at is early Q1, or sorry, late Q1, a so earlier next year is when they're looking to really transition more into this commercial environment that also includes, by the way, the discussion about the cost and whose paying for it. It's going to be borne by insurers. And so most Americans won't really be impacted by this price shift. But it's important to point out that Pfizer did note that the uninsured are going to be taken care of in a quote. They said, eligible UL residents without insurance will be able to access the COVID-19 vaccine for free. So that stays in place as well through their current programs, that assistance programs for patients. So all that put together really, you know, paints a picture of an expected commercial market, the price itself is not outrageous. We do know that there are vaccines within that price range over $100. So like you said, not really unexpected. Okay. Speaking of COVID, there are reports of more lockdowns in China. I'm just looking at this number here in terms of where things have stood since March. China is partially or fully locked down 152 cities. Yes. Since March. Effecting 280 million people. So what's the very latest? Taking down even further, 114 of those have been since August alone. So let's talk about what we've really talked about this week. We know that Beijing announced select lockdowns in the major city Thursday, Genjo on Monday. And then we also know, Shionn, today, got some more lockdowns in those areas. So really some key metropolis that are being affected right now. That's why we're hearing a little bit more about this. But it's important to note that it's not entire lockdowns for the most part. And that's what's different this time around. We know that previously we'd seen really major district wide, city wide lockdowns. But the impact has been, you know, that we've seen a struggle for the country in terms of being able to plan. They've been switching announcements. So for example, in the Genjo area, they didn't necessarily impact the Foxconn plan or that Apple plan, the iPhone manufacturing plan. But the company itself did put in restrictions for a dining area. So we're seeing some of that movement, Macau, for example. That's another thing that's being hit, right? We know that there has been some impact from what the overall China lockdowns have had. So Macau has seen a decline almost 50% slow gaming revenue in September. So all of this like broader impacts of just these.",https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XTJjX90THDQ,25,2022-10-21 15:41:06
3842," China lockdowns have had. So Macau has seen a decline, almost 50 percent slow gaming revenue in September. So all of this, like broader impacts of just these select targeted lockdowns. And I mean, you know better than I do about what this means for the party and just what the future means for what it means for. I mean, you wonder if China is now sort of taking this approach of being a little more selective on how or where aggressively they move largely because the impact it's had on the economy. We're talking about what anywhere from high to 3 percent growth this year, as well below the target. You get the sense from the party congress, they sort of accepted the slow growth, but any further slowdown, you'd imagine would still be a big concern. It would be, I mean, this is impacting poor cities, this is impacting transportation. It's all going back to the question of where does the world's maker, right, manufacturing hub, stand when it comes to continuing this many years later. We've seen, you know, here in the US, of course, is a bad comparison, but complete opposite, right? We've let go of so many mitigation measures. And by comparison to what they had early on in the strict lockdowns, this is definitely more targeted and that requires more focus on the local government. So the party has really left it up to the local governments to decide, but it is still part of that zero-covid policy or dynamic zero policy. Well, into your point worth noting because there is a trickle effect, whether it's in, you know, devices being manufactured, they're a pair of makers. I mean, it really is the hub, and that has an impact in the US, in Europe all over. So, story that I know you're going to see on top of coming up on the other side, the next battleground. Semmy conductors have been described as the new oil, but we'll have the firmest grip on the market. I'm going to go in fight to secure production. Our panel is going to take a look at it from all sides after this short break.",https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XTJjX90THDQ,26,2022-10-21 15:45:41
3843," What is time now for today's chart of the day and we're focusing on semi-conductors as a key indicator of economic trouble ahead. This chart from Bloomberg compares the performance of the beaten down semi-conductor sector with another one on a downward trend and that's ISM new orders. The analyst behind the chart suggests the correlation doesn't necessarily mean a deep recession is imminent but the two trending in the same direction makes the compelling case for a downtrend. The semi-sector is down more than 40% this year outpacing the S&P's 20% decline. Well, China's Ministry of Industry and Information Technology reportedly met with leading semi-conductor companies over the past week seeking to assess the fallout for the Biden administration's chip restrictions on China. The administration now also reportedly exploring the possibility of new export controls to limit China's access to emerging computing technologies. What could all this mean for the path forward in the semi-sector? Let's bring in Daniel Newman, his future on research principle analyst. We both have got Edith Young, race capital general partner here to break it all down for us. Edith, I want to start with you because I think it's worth noting an interesting set that you have put out here in terms of what this exactly means. When you look at it, China consumes more than 75% of the semi-conductors globally but produces only about 15%. We have heard so many reports since the administration came down with these tech controls about not just panic but just full-on reassessment happening. What are you hearing from those on the ground? I think right now what China is trying to ask sex is if the intent from the US government is to make sure that China cannot even buy or produce or even maintain what does that mean and this actually could impact many, many industry. We're not just talking about computer or smartphone, EV. There's all sort of industry actually really need this chipset to continue to run. I don't think there is a conclusion yet but what I'm worried about that if China really wants to be as aggressive as the US and retaliate, there could be a lot of impact for all the other companies in the US and I think this is beyond just impact in terms of revenue for Intel or Qualcomm or Nvidia or of course we need to watch out for TSMC but if they retaliate in other industries this is going to be disastrous. And we'll get to the impact on some of those companies in just a bit but really follow up here, Eda, what's the capability of these Chinese companies to be able to be self-sufficient when you're talking about advanced chips? So for the fast few years President Xi is trying very hard to make sure that China as a country can be independent from buying from Nvidia, Intel or Qualcomm but I think personally I think it's still very far away to get to that level. I don't think China is self-sufficient yet even though the TSMC, SMIC is sort of the TSMC for China but they're still far ahead in terms of what is being produced locally. Daniel Zediff highlighted, I mean these as in the companies in China are major customers for American chip designers, chip makers too. There's an interesting report that BCG put out a few years ago that said that full tech control as in a complete ban could lead to upwards of 40% drop in revenue for some of these big names in the US. How are you assessing that impact right now? Yeah I think we got to look at the more broad economic story of what's going on here. I think President Xi Jinping has been very declarative about the intention of China to be the leading designer and manufacturer of leading edge semiconductors. The US has put a massive investments with the CHIPS Act to take more control of its own fate and its supply chain. We have a lot of microaggressions.",https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XTJjX90THDQ,27,2022-10-21 15:49:39
3844," US has put a massive investments with the CHIP's act to take more control of its own fate and its supply chain. We have a lot of micro-aggressions going on in the South China Sea. And right now, this is one of the things China is very dependent on US intellectual property and engineering capabilities in order to manufacture these leading edge chips. So a lot of this is focused on things like AI, high performance computing, which are going to not only enable innovation in, as our other guests said, in smartphones and EVs, but in biotechnology and financial services and money laundering and fraud and things that need a lot of compute power. And so the US right now is looking at the opportunity to sort of control the fate of the development of leading edge technologies, chipsets. And of course, this puts strain on both sides. It puts strains on US manufacturers and designers of semiconductors. It also puts strain on equipment makers, because part of this ban is also the shipping of equipment, the export of equipment that China needs in order to build more leading edge capacity. So as I see it, it's a very interesting moment because it's not only macroeconomic, it's also about their economic policy and national defense and security. But if we're talking strictly, Daniel, what it means for businesses, I mean, if China consumes more than 75% of this, and that market is effectively blocked off, you know, it's the Biden administration really does put these controls in place and cracks down. What does that mean for these companies in terms of revenue? Well, right now it's only very specific chips and everybody's been assessing this. It's not the whole portfolio of semiconductors. Folks, I've listened to, you know, Justin Wong and Nvidia, they're already accounting for what they think are going to be components of their portfolio and the impact that it might have on revenue. And of course, we've seen the early warnings coming out from these companies. There's certainly a chance that this could have a much bigger waterfall effect. But I think these companies have already looked at the situation they're assessing it. And in this sort of tough macro and tough economic period, they're starting to put those warnings out about what it could mean. I'm not overly alarmed that it's going to be the whole portfolio of all chips, lagging edge that are used to manufacture our frigerators and air conditioning systems. I think this is about leading the arms race for the next generation of technology in areas like supercomputing, high performance compute and artificial intelligence.

Well, coming up, we take a closer look at TikToks move to introduce an adult's only option for live streamers.

The social media giant saying on Twitter that its app has never been used to target American government, activists, public figures, or journalists. This is a response to a report in Forbes that data would have been accessed without users knowledge or consent. Forbes reporting that Tiktok's parent company started a monitoring project to investigate misconduct by employees. It's unclear whether American citizens' data was ever collected, but the report says there had been a plan to obtain location data from U.S. users' devices. Well, Tiktok is also out with some other news this week on its plan to grow with its consumers and thus making the move to introduce an adult's only option for live streamers on the platform. Let me want to restrict their viewership to those 18 and older. Let's bring in Yahoo Finance's Kelsey Barbario who is following this for us. Let's define adults only. People heard this and thought, whoa, where is Tiktok going? I know they're like, is this going to be the new only fans? I don't think that that is the intention whatsoever. Tiktok is actually quite buttoned up with what they allow on their platform. What I think that the big takeaway here is that they are moving their live streams from right now, 16-year-olds and older. With a minimum of 1,000 followers, they're the ones that are eligible to live stream. They're just bumping that up to 18. That's going to be on November 23rd. But outside of that, people are going to be allowed to kind of clarify what audience might be the best suited for their live stream. So say you've got like a comedy show that you're going to do on a live show or live stream, excuse me. And it's a little inappropriate for younger people, you could mark that in flag it as being for adults. So that way the people under 18 are not seeing it. So part of this is about the maturation of their users that they are going to be 18 and older when you think about sort of the demographic. Tiktok also implementing further restrictions to the type of content they're going to be allowing there. What more do we know about that? Yeah, so outside of the live streams, I think that they're looking into more safety practices overall. So for example, they have three different things that they're specifically honing in on. That's going to be hateful ideology is eating disorders, endangering acts and challenges. And I think that last one is most specifically targeted for children. Because think about things like the tide pod challenge from a million years ago or most specifically recently the cooking chicken and naikwool. That's the sort of stuff that they do not want to be affiliated with Tiktok. And so they're really working on making sure that those practices absolutely are not allowed on the platform. How much of this is about what they've seen with the other platforms and getting out on the head with competitors like Instagram. I feel like there is a whole lot to do with that. I mean, you know, Congress has really been cracking down on social media platforms recently. And I think that they're just trying to get ahead of things before something might come on for them as well. Okay. Kelsey is always not just on Tiktok, but our Tiktok expert. Thanks so much for that. And let's do a final market check before we let you go. And we are so agree across the board here. The game's sort of accelerating as we count down to the weekend, the Dow is up nearly 400 points, the S&P 500, up about 40 points and the NASDAQ up 82 points there. Certainly earnings and focused yet again today. The one big mover we've been tracking very closely is SNAP along with some of these other social media stocks as concerns about declining ad revenue there, take hold as well. And yield also in focus we should point out as we look ahead to that next FOMC meeting. And those reports out today that potentially fed officials are considering slowing down some of those rate hikes because of the concerns of how they've taken hold in the economy. And that does it for me in this hour. We've got much more to come here in the Yakku finance live. We're out there right here.",https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XTJjX90THDQ,29,2022-10-21 15:58:41

3847," would actually perhaps dampen demand because of the interest rates also impacting the way that consumers or customers might be able to finance these vehicles in the futures too. That's another major consideration for a company in Tesla. And that particularly directly correlates with some of the demand or some of the forecasts that they're even talking about here. 50% a year in terms of production sales deliveries that they're trying to grow towards in the near future. Yeah, I mean, he sort of acknowledged maybe a softening in demand, right? But overall, the narrative continues to be at Tesla. Demands fine. Demands okay. We are not able to get as many cars as we produce into people's hands. And that really accounts for the gap here that we're seeing that the company is not going to necessarily meet its production and delivery targets for 2022. So, the other deliveries should be 50%. That's the long-term annual target. They're not going to make that this year. And that was the big news that came out last night. But even in the meantime, because of supply chain issues affecting that, supply chain and delivery issues are also affecting the cars they can make, getting to people, shipping costs are going up, having trouble getting space. And then, when ships, for example, that they need, that's what they're talking about. All of this affecting the automotive gross margin, the quarter 27.9%, which is short of estimate. So, that's why we're seeing the shares down this morning. Maybe a little bit of feed-through in concerns about demand. But the company's line continues to be blaming it on supply chain, blaming it on shipping, et cetera. So, like before we bring our guests here on this one, a lot of chatter out there on the street this morning about a potential China slowdown over on Tesla. I'm looking at a good note by the Guggenheim team, noting potential price cuts on Tesla vehicles. One of you heard that before coming out of China potentially, this fourth quarter, they're calling out rising competition. Look, we've talked to X-Pung, Leonardo, a lot of folks. There's a lot more EVs, players in that key market. And Tesla might be losing market share in its second most important market. Yeah, China, of course, and the Shanghai Gigafactory and ramping up production deliveries. They talked about that on the call, experiencing a reverse recession of sorts, which was interesting to hear. Property market related, property market mostly is what Elon said there. And then Europe, especially with Gigafactory Berlin, they address that on the call too. We've got much more on Tesla here. Let's bring in Wells Fargo equity analyst Colin Langen and New Street Research Managing Partner Pierre Fargo. Great to have you here with us this morning. Colin, first, I want to go to you because you had actually been able to get a question in on the call yesterday. And particularly as we think through full self driving some of what Tesla is selling potential buyers on in the future, do you believe that the demand is going to be able to sustain itself to some of the targets that Tesla is putting forward? In terms of full self driving, I think their timeline is a bit optimistic. I mean, I think particularly when you define full self driving and I think on the call of the question, my question. He described really isn't what most experts would call level four level five full self driving. It's so it still has to monitor the vehicle. That would be an advanced like level two plus type system, which could be very impressive, but not the definition where you could actually remove the person from the car. And San Francisco and the cruise vehicle that's full self driving. There's no one in the driver's seat in the car was driving itself. I think that's kind of what he has promised in the past. And so it seems like it'll be falling short of that. And from the experts that I talked to quite frankly, I don't know without a LiDAR without all the sensors. It's possible. It's going to take I think a very, very long time to get to true level four. So I'm bit skeptical about what full self driving really piece. I'm sure you just heard us talking or highlighting some concerns out of China. What are you seeing in that China market for Tesla? Are they losing market share and how much might they cut prices this quarter? So yeah, it's a good question. What's happening in China today is the way I would characterize it is that we are entering into a phase of like slowing, sustaining and demand. And of course, everybody in China is adapting to that to that circumstances, but you have to keep in mind the context, which is that broadly overall for electric cars in China and everywhere in the world. And supply is still below demand. Jim and still exceeding supply. When you see market share movements, most of the time it's.",https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XTJjX90THDQ,31,2022-10-21 16:07:09
3848," China and everywhere in the world supply is still below demand, demand is still exceeding supply. When you see market share movements, most of the time it's just going to be about who is capable of bringing in cars to the markets. So what is going to drive market share going forward and what has been driving market share so far is much more and I'm talking about cars that can be compared like not like a 15,000 of cars with a 50,000 car of course. What is going to drive market share is actually supply. How many cars can you produce is going to drive your market share? That's what has been driving market share so far. When you look at price cuts, don't necessarily look at it as a reaction to the local market. Think about it more as for Tesla a way to manage the delivery of their cars. At a moment they are shipping a lot of cars outside of China towards other markets. You'll see prices in China holding very high and if at some point Tesla is producing a lot of cars and needs to get these cars into the hand of drivers fast in the Chinese market, they're going to lower their prices. So these movements are actually very tactical. They're always interpreted as more like strategic and long term reaction to a softening of demand. I think it's a mistake. My experience of that surprising price in strategy is actually to be very tactical and play on where they want the gas to be delivered. So let's play off of that a little bit Colin. So do you think there are any longer term implications of what we heard from Tesla in terms of the overall demand picture? I do think as we go into next year's demand is just going to be mathematically tough to do. So if you go back historically and you look at the best selling ever sedan, best selling ever SUV, it's the RAV4 and the Corolla back in 2019 both happened to be the same year. They sold 2.3 million units. The 50% Kager would put you at 2 million units which would be needed almost all would be Model 3 and Model Y. It would probably be almost twice, you know, not quite twice the price point of those vehicles. So that's a very very high threshold at the price point we're talking about. So I do think something has to happen into next year. I think, you know, Q4 is probably okay. I mean they already have orders. They're going to deliver those orders. They've taken good pricing on those orders. I think as you get into next year and you have this very high target and a very high price point, I think something's going to have to give. I don't know that that's even special to Tesla to be honest with you. I think the whole industry is going to have pricing issues but I do think those are some concerns as I go into next year. Pierre, on the call, they were talking about an Elon specifically. What was talking about China, was talking about Europe and the US and all of those with regard to where they may sit within a recession going into one or staring down one in the future or actually actively in one. And so from your perspective, how much might that actually impact some of the demand that Tesla is hoping to lock in? Yeah, it's a great good question, Brad. Look at it from two separate angles. One is a secular angle. One is a specific angle. On a secular angle, as I said, everything indicates there is more demand for electric cars than they supply. It's probably going to remain so the same way. I know it's kind of disturbing for if you look at the industry, the kind industry in your career mirror, you've never seen cars that have had the success of the Tesla car, but look at these cars, they sell for 30 percent growth margins. They've gone through an exceptional unprecedented ramp in terms of manufacturing and they've been accepted in the markets that way. So they are probably going to blow away the kind of demand being by model in the history of the industry. That being said, next year, you have interest rates going up, you have an economic slowdown. Biden's a big deal, and it's very easy for consumers to enter into a mood of postponing the acquisition of a car because interest rates are too high because the economic environment is not good, not good, because the job is at risk. So if there is an economic slowdown, Tesla is going to be heard exactly the same way as other car manufacturers. And as Pauline mentioned, the first impact really is pricing, because when you're manufacturing, you need to get rid of that. They get out of your factory, you need to say that. So the first thing, car manufacturers we do.",https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XTJjX90THDQ,32,2022-10-21 16:11:27
3849, mention the first impact really is pricing because when you're manufacturing guy you need to get rid of that they get out of your factory you need to say that so the first thing how many factors we do in an economic slowdown is lowering prices everybody will do that it's going to be very painful for everybody of course they slept with 30 person gross margins has a lot of room for man over to lower their pricey that's the reason why the team's like an Elon yesterday I said we can go very very very deep before we bear money before we start thinking so in our expansion plan so they are not worried about a recession not because they are not worried about demand they see that demand is at risk next year but if demand is at risk next year they're going to get prices they're going to keep growing the business and they're going to do fine the panel might look very very bad very very challenged no doubt that is but the trajectory of the side I think is not at risk you can we have to ask you this because we get questions like this on Twitter you know musk floating out there potential four trillion dollar valuation some would say he's joking around but still it's a number that he put out there yesterday is there anything in your modeling when you think about the next 10 to 15 years for this company that that might be the valuation they can get to I mean that seems quite a bit of a stretch I think it's comments you've been said there's a narrow path to that you'd have to give them full credit for all of these you know factors that I consider more like long-term optionality issues things like whether you could get true level for full self-driving whether there's actually some value in the Optimus spot and and Dojo and these sort of future projects I think from a pure auto-paker side that's going to be extremely difficult to do and Collin just quickly here must talking about the company board things generally good idea to buy back stock there's also the specter of him potentially personally selling more stock to continue to fund his Twitter purchase do you think one or both of those things does end up happening I think it's almost very likely that both will happen I mean you didn't say that the board was in support of the five to ten billion so I feel like that's almost a soft announcement of the buyback that would still only be one percent of the market cap so it's still fairly small despite the size yeah and I think from the stock sale I mean in the math is you know I think the original deal was that he had 21 billion of financial commitments with equity partners I think the the margin loan for my understanding of 13 to 12.5 is gone so there could be up to 33.5 of total equity commitments needed between him and whatever equity partners he has 15 billion of stock has been sold so there's still multiples of billions of potential of stock that might you might need to sell in order to close the Twitter deal all right we'll be on the lookout for both of those announcements potentially thanks guys appreciate it Collin Langan of Wells Bargo and Pierre-Fierreux Guru of New Street Research thanks to you both appreciate it,https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XTJjX90THDQ,33,2022-10-21 16:15:57
3850," you Think by 2025. What is that market opportunity? Well, good morning, Brian. Thank you for having me today. It's a big market opportunity because not only the market is expanding, but we are entering new segments of the market with new offers as a part of our age-to-class strategy. And those new offers are in the private 5G, in the IoT, and in the data switching portfolio in the connectivity space as well as security in the sassy space together with our flagship product, the SD1, and as well, increasing number of offers as a part of our HP Green Lake platform and new data services. So a combination of cable growth of the time and new segments that give us the opportunity to play over the next three years in that 250-plus billion dollar market. And Tony, that shift to software as a service which ultimately drives to annual recurring revenue, where are you at in that journey? Well, we have made a tremendous progress, if you recall, in 2019, I committed to make available all our offers from age-to-cloud as a service. And at the HP Discovery in June, we achieve a major milestone because not only are age solutions are now part of our HP Green Lake platform, but as well as workload optimization, infrastructure as a services, as a service, and as well as data services. So we made tremendous progress, but now we are operating as a company in a cloud-operating environment, where all our new offers are designed and delivered to HP Green Lake. So now is the journey on continuous adding and renewing those offers as we go forward. And that AIR, as we guided for the next three years, is going to grow between 35 and 45 percent, also not only on the back of a significant growth, which this year alone, we are growing a bookings in excess of 86 percent year to date. But the fact that we already have $7.7 billion of total control value in the Azure Service business in our balance sheet. Are you seeing any red flags or areas of concern in your business? Are customers cancelling orders, are they delaying decisions at all? Well, what is fascinating to me, Brian, is that we continue to see enduring demand for our products and our services. And Green Lake is at the top of that demand. Well, customers love about HP Green Lake. It's the fact that they get a unified cloud experience, inclusive of the public cloud, and all the services and applications they have on premises. And now they get the opportunity to extend not only into the public cloud, with the same experience, but also at the edge. And that's the next big opportunity for us, because we live in a much more distributed enterprise than ever before. And also new use cases are being developed and deployed at the edge. So that's for us is a point of differentiation in my mind. And then when it comes down to momentum, again, enduring demand, but we have not seen any major of the cancellations at all. And that to us is a very positive sign that digital transformation and a key top priority for our customers, and IT plays now a bigger role than ever before. Antonio, some of the analysts commentary I saw this morning. A lot of them see it be flagging the outlook for next year. A little cautious, a little below some of the estimates that were out there. Does that outlook okay?",https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XTJjX90THDQ,34,2022-10-21 16:20:11
3851," So this morning, a lot of them see it be flagging the outlook for next year. A little cautious, a little below some of the estimates that were out there. Does that outlook account for a potential recession in the US? Well, that outlook as Tarek and I stated yesterday includes what we see as a potential disruption that made the market creates because of the inflation and the foreign current exchange, you know, kind of trends we see. So we have comprehended all of that in our outlook. But we are very confident about our outlook because obviously we have a record breaking backlog with again, enduring the amount continued to be in the market. Second is that also we continue to make a significant shift in not only in our product and portfolio mix, but in a way with the liver that makes. And third also, this company generates a lot of cash. And so from my vantage point, we are very well positioned to meet or exceed that outlook. Understanding that the biggest issue unknown today is actually in my mind not so much the macro environment, but more the volatility of the foreign exchange. Antonio, I'm on the the Hula Packard Enterprise stats page on Yahoo Finance and I see your stock trading at under six times four earnings. That is more than half of the broader market. Just given the performance of the business, I mean, that is shocking how you guys performed compared to the past year. You mentioned you have a lot of cash. How are you going to deploy cash over the next 12 months to get that multiple up? Yeah, I think you just said that really well. I mean, our disappointment is on the multiple because not only we're growing revenues, we are also growing recurrent revenues, which they represent more than one third over total revenues. And by the way, almost 80% of our profits are recurring. Okay. I think the market still want to see ongoing what I call performance on a free cash flow, which obviously has been a little bit losing through the separation and spin-offs and the restriction we had to do to rise size the company, which we are now. And our guidance on free cash flow now is at the midpoint two billion dollars. What you're going to see is the convergence of our non-GAP EPS to free cash flow. And that free cash flow is deploying in a balance way. Obviously, we are super committed to dividends, which today at the current stock price are represented almost at 4% yield, probably one of the highest in my mind in the tech sector. So we're going to continue to aggressively buy shares back obviously because the share price is depressed. But at the same time, we have to continue to invest in the business. Because ultimately, we've got to bring breakthrough innovation for our customers. But that investment in the business has a significant discipline around it, or return to invest the capital. And obviously, gear to higher margins and higher areas of growth, but all delivered through HP Green Lake, which drives that record and revenue. And obviously, over time, that will help our multiples as well. All right, we'll get some rest. I know it's been a long week for you. Antonio and Ari, he'll pack an enterprise CEO. Always good to get some time with you. I'll talk to you soon. Catch you on Twitter. Thank you, Brian.",https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XTJjX90THDQ,35,2022-10-21 16:24:42
3852," you Yeah. They're moving higher this morning after the tight reduction into the same, okay? Audio reopening. of AT&T are moving higher this morning after the telecom company reported third quarter earnings showing 708,000 post paid phone net ads and a 6% rise in mobility revenue year over year. AT&T CFO Pescao, Deroch joins us now discuss Pescao. Good to see you again. Three months ago we were here having a conversation at a time your stock was down double digits and you weren't worn on free cash flow. Now today the stock is up and there seems to be a different tone on this earnings release. Why is that the case? Look, first good morning Brian. Good morning everybody. You know, maybe let me just start. I think this journey dates back to a couple of years ago. What we've said is we we were going to invest to reaneritize growth in this business with a priority towards reaneritizing wireless and fiber growth. And for a long time we said that that investment initially would reduce earnings but over time would produce significant returns. And as late last year we said at the second half of this year earnings would start to see the benefits of all the work that's been done. So things are playing out exactly as we said. And look, overall I'd be remiss if I didn't thank my colleagues across the company for all their hard work and getting us to this point. In terms of what's different now I think last quarter there was a there was a bit of an overreaction by I think the marketplace and some of the media. In the end what we flagged and we tried to we tried to every quarter to be really transparent what we were seeing in the marketplace. What did we see? We saw that there was a normalization of collection patterns back to pre pandemic norms. That hasn't gotten any worse. It's pretty much the same. And you know in terms of overall delinquencies I've been saying this since the spring we are probably slightly worse than pre pandemic norms. But all of all really strong fundamentals. The thing to keep in mind is our business has a history of performing well even in challenging economic times. And we don't expect this time to be any different. You know that's an amazing acknowledgement here especially as we think about the fact that within the market consumers are paying more in some of their other necessities that they have to account for as well. And so when it comes down to their telecommunications service provider like an AT&T and the delinquencies that you are seeing where are you also seeing perhaps the either type of device that customers that are net ads may be opting in for is it on the higher tier is it on a mid tier and what type of service for those devices as well. Yeah and I would say it's a bit across the board. First and foremost consumers as a general matter more and more people are signing up to higher price plans because of the value that those plans provide in terms of additional bandwidth. But not everyone is taking the device promotions. In fact a meaningful portion of our subscriber additions in wireless come through our business relationships and that channel it has been and continues to be really efficient source of generating new subscribers and so we're benefiting from that and we're seeing just the consistency of our offer quarter after quarter resonating with customers and our sales team know how to execute it and all those.",https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XTJjX90THDQ,36,2022-10-21 16:29:02
3853," And we're seeing just the consistency of our offer quarter after quarter, resonating with customers. And our sales team know how to execute it. And all those things are contributing to continued improvement in subscribers, as well as higher R-POOs. You layer on top of that a better international, more international travel also contributing to higher roaming revenues. All those things are driving improvements in R-POO. And we've been doing a lot of work in our cost structure, and you're starting to see some of that benefit come through to the bottom line. So we feel really good about how we're performing. Pascal, it's Julie here. So obviously a lot of attention being paid to your networking investments as you pointed out. And there have been some reports that you are in discussions to spend a lot more on the network. There was a report recently that you're working with one of the big banks to increase your fiber optic cable investment, a $10 to $15 billion investment potentially. Is there anything you can tell us about that and what it would mean for your customers and for your network? As a matter of policy, we don't talk about rumors in the press, but let me tell you overall how we think about fiber. Fiber right now is the best technology, and as we look out the next decade or two, there is nothing under horizon that will match the effectiveness of fiber, especially in terms of the speed, the bandwidth, and importantly symmetrical speed. And we don't see anything changing that. We are the largest provider in the US. We know how to do it very well. We can do it more efficiently than others. And we are prioritizing investment fiber. If there are opportunities for us to accelerate that through different partnerships, well, of course we'll look at that. As John Stake said on the call this morning, his job is to make sure we are looking at all opportunities to potentially accelerate returns to our owners. Pascal, as pertains to your planning for 2023, two part question. One, are you planning for a recession? And the number two, are you planning for a pickup in promotions to consumers? Given the slowdown we might see. Here is what I would tell you. You will hear more about how we're thinking about 2023 when we report our fourth quarter earnings. Overall, what I did say on this morning's call is that, we understand, we're more than three quarters of the way through the year, and we understand what sort of macro-environment we're operating in now. And even considering all the challenges that we read about, we expect to grow earnings of free cash flow next year. What we'll do, but we want to make sure we wait till the fourth quarter and have the best possible information. And at that point, we will tell you how we are thinking about more precisely, how we expect the magnitude of earnings of free cash flow growth. Within that, though, and as you start to think about what a potential recession might look like, for the business, what does that real margin run rate actually sustain at over that period of time, given the delinquencies that you were talking about a moment ago? When you look back at history, even in downturns, the telecommunications sector tends to be more resilient than most. Clearly, we would be impacted like others, but not nearly to the same extent. And right now, when you look at the criticality of telecommunications, whether wireless or broadband connectivity, that's one of the last things the consumer will turn off, even in a challenging economic environment. With that said, look, they pay me to make sure that we have the opportunity in the event that we encounter difficult and operating environments to identify potential offsets and things we would look to or things like, do we moderate the pace of our investments then in capital, but all in all, the good news about where we are today is that we believe we can continue to invest meaningfully in our business, comfortably pay our dividend.",https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XTJjX90THDQ,37,2022-10-21 16:33:08
3854," Our today is that we believe we can continue to invest meaningfully in our business, comfortably pay our dividend and still continue to deliver over the next several years. But look, if they are really challenging economics environment that we're operating in, we will look for all the ways to offset that. They may not turn it off, but would they trade down in terms of the service that they are receiving from AT&T? And have you seen that show up in anywhere in the business? It hasn't shown up. In fact, more consumers are opting for the higher price plan. That's part of what's driving the growth in our article that we reported. All right, we'll leave it there. AT&T, CFO, Pascal DeRroge. Good to see you again. We'll talk to you soon. Good seeing you. Thank you, everyone. Bye. Hi, everyone. We're going to make a great start to the $2,030 Let's just bring in another guest into the hour here. We've got George, a Kennacore genuity, managing director. George, let's just build on those comments from Praz. What's your sense right now on why the stock is pulled back so significantly? Is this about the street just simply saying, we don't necessarily buy this story that demand's going to stay strong in Q4. Well, first thanks for having me. I can't remember and I've been looking at the stock for a long time. Elon Musk acknowledged that there was a demand issue, particularly in China. And if you guys remember several years ago and someone asked about demand, he called it a boring question, right? So this might be the first time we actually acknowledge a little bit of a of a down tick. But at the same time, he said the company would grow significantly in Q4 and we think they could do about 450,000 deliveries. And then they're going to sell as many cars as they can build for the foreseeable future, which is about 50% year of year growth as far as the I can see. And so what we did is, you know, we thought about how we can square that circle. And for us, it came up to a couple of things. First, the company has had backlog for a really long period of time and they're probably going to drain a little bit of that Q4. There are some fleet sales to companies like hurts that they could maybe sell in Q4 that help. And then when you look into 2023 specifically, the cyber truck comes online and that really helps, they start producing more in Austin, they have Tesla, send me sales and then beyond that, hopefully we're out of this.",https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XTJjX90THDQ,38,2022-10-21 16:37:42
3855," truck comes online and that really helps. They start producing more in Austin. They have Tesla semi sales and then beyond that, hopefully we're out of this economic bump that they were in currently and EVs, if you remember, are really, really, really small percentage of overall sales. And so that will start to help. So we think there's some, there's method to the madness and there's logic as to why he guided them to grow significantly this year and continue their growth into next year. But I completely agree and understand there's too many bread crumbs that indicate that there's been a slowdown in the man and even acknowledge it when the yesterday's fall. Hey, Georgia, pros again. So I just wanted to talk to you about a couple of things that I sort of struck me last time the call. You mentioned the cyber truck, how they're going in the tooling phase and put for potential sort of, I guess, production start in mid 2023. But also you mentioned the cheaper Tesla, the kind of entry-level car that would potentially be half the cost or something like that versus the mile three. What did you think about that? Because they actually kind of sort of confirm that this is actually in the works. Yeah, so on the cyber truck, it's one of the things that may give the company a lot of confidence in growth in 23 and beyond. Because look, I'm pretty confident that the company won't keep the pricing that had discussed last time when they first introduced it. But remember, they had millions according to the press, millions of orders for the cyber truck, starting in 2023. And so even if they had a lot of cancellations, that's a lot of demand. I personally would get one if my wife let me, but she told me she would be content driving it. So it's clearly an acquired taste and a lot of people really like it. On the Robotaxi platform, it's a really interesting question. So basically, you think about the company's ability to bring down the cost of production for a vehicle. They've done a really, really marvelous job with the Model 3 slash Model Y platform, which costs about somewhere in the mid $30,000 range to make. And when it comes to Robotaxi, that's another step down in production. Cost out branded. It won't be as a big of a vehicle. It'll be a lot of nuances to it. Probably won't have a steering wheel and some odd stuff like that that will enable autonomous driving. But it's another platform through which the company can reduce costs and help e.d.s proliferate the gold. George, in terms of potential for buybacks, it sort of felt like Elon Musk dangled that carrot for investors who have been a little jittery around the stock. He said $5 to $10 billion is certainly possible. These were his words for next year. I wonder what you make of that. How much of this is about trying to get those investors to stick it out, those who have been concerned about his distractions with Twitter? And is this really the best use of capital for a company? Should that be used towards more CapEx? Just to be blunt, we don't like it. You know, buybacks are things that companies like Newspaper Company do not Tesla that has significant opportunity in front of it. We think there's better use of capital to accelerate CapEx plans, to build cars, to build the robot army that Elon Musk wants to build. It's just, in our opinion, there are just better ways to accelerate their plans around having EVs proliferate the globe. And other opportunities, including battery factories and robots. So look, I'm sure that they've done a lot of math behind it. And they want to see the support to stock down here in the 200s. But we think ultimately long term the best way to support the stock is to grow for as long as you can. George, we didn't even get to ask you about the valuation. And Elon Musk calling for a valuation for a Tesla could equal Apple and Saudi Aramco combined. But that's for another conversation around a time here. George, you know, because Ken Accord, Genuity, Managing Director are thanks to you and our thanks to Yahoo Finance's Pros Supermanion.",https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XTJjX90THDQ,39,2022-10-21 16:41:53
3856, you you you you you you you you you,https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XTJjX90THDQ,40,2022-10-21 16:45:46
3857," And so that was a lot of the conversation this morning. Yeah, talk to me a bit more about that where you're seeing the pullback and volume and where are the biggest biggest headwinds for you right now. Yeah, it's mostly related to the consumer. So consumer oriented shipments on our railroad that tends to be domestic intermodal parcel. You know, a few things driven by the consumer. Those are those are looking like they're cooling off. The consumer has already been shifting from goods back to services, not all the way back. You recall there was a real fundamental shift towards goods during the pandemic. So it hasn't gone all the way back, but at the same time, it does appear that they're buying less and you can see that in international intermodal boxes hitting the west coast ports. And you can also see it in demand for truck and demand for domestic intermodal on our railroad. There are some markets though that where we're seeing strong demand and it's not going away. Things like coal, some of the other things like that. The amount of gas that we're looking at right now is like, we're looking at the spot, we're looking at the properties. We're looking at the amount of the robot utilities, grain, rock and then a handful of our industrial segments as well. But the total picture says we're going to grow year-over-year in the fourth quarter. It's just not going to be as much as we thought it would. Lans, last time we spoke, we were talking about the labor agreements ongoing. And I saw the number here in your quarter, $140 million Now, you know, I'm less comfortable than I was before the B&W E are maintenance of way employees failed ratification, but I'm not concerned. We've got six unions having ratified. We've got five in the ratification vote, and we've got more work to do now with the BMW EED. I think that vote failed to ratify for a very specific reason, the PEP, in addition to proposing wage levels, which are very attractive to our employees. They also said for about half, about 40% of that craft that does maintenance of way, we needed to adjust the travel that we would pay them to go from home to their away from home work location, and the per dime we'd pay while they were working away from home. That negotiation happened on property, and it just closed up on UP about a week ago, a couple of weeks ago. And that was at the very tail end of the ratification vote for that contract. So I think those were connected. We're back out now working with the BMW EED to try to figure out a temporary agreement that can be or a tentative agreement that can be taken back out for ratification. I anticipate we're going to be able to do that. We've got status quo in place there. Other than that, we need to get through the ratification on these other five unions, and get this baby closed out by the end of the year. And I think that's still the probable outcome. So end of the year, still the timeline that you're looking at, despite some of the snacks that you've hit. Yeah, I am. I guess the maintenance away employees could drag over into next year. I don't anticipate that. I think there's a path forward for us to get another tentative agreement, get it back out for vote. Lance, it's always great to have you on the show, Union Pacific CEO Lance Fritz. Appreciate your time today.",https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XTJjX90THDQ,41,2022-10-21 16:50:47
3858," you you you you talking it wage growth moving lower to help quell the inflation. On the inflation expectations objective, they've succeeded. If you look at one year, five year forwards, that's inflation a year from now and the subsequent five year period this comes out of the bond market. These are investors putting the money where their mouth is. It's very consistent with the Fed's target of two to two and a half percent on the consumer price index. And with regard to growth on jobs, same progress. If you go back say six months ago, average monthly job growth was about 500,000. Now it feels like it's about 300,000. Still a lot more work to be done here. We need to get down below 100K to get unemployment from stop to stop falling and start moving a little bit north and slowing the wage growth and quelling the inflation. So still more work to be done, but I think they've made progress. It's a pretty good progress since the beginning of the year. Will they need a recession to get things back to 2 percent? I don't think so. I mean, I don't say that with a lot of confidence. Recession risks obviously are very high and this is going to be very difficult. But my sense is that there is a path forward that will allow them to solve land in the economy. And I do think they've laid out a script for us. The federal funds rate target, which is three to three and a quarter percent. It's headed to more than half to four and three quarters by early next year. And I think that should be sufficient given the tightening and financial conditions that to kind of stock market the increase in the value of the dollar, the increase in mortgage rates, the tightening and bank underwriting standards, to slow the economy sufficiently to get inflation moving in the right direction. But it is a path, but it's a narrow path. And it is getting narrower as we get these inflation statistics that are definitely a disappointment. Mark, when do you expect us to start seeing in the data that CPI, that inflation has significantly cooled? Are we talking two months from now, four months from now? I guess what's your best prediction on that? Yeah, I think over the next six months, we should see inflation.",https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XTJjX90THDQ,42,2022-10-21 16:54:51
3859," CPI that inflation has significantly cooled. Are we talking two months from now, four months from now? I guess what's your best prediction on that? Yeah, I think over the next six months we should see inflation CPI inflation. Let's say rounding is 8% ish. I think by next spring we should be 4% ish and that assumes the main assumption there is that oil prices stay 90 95 bucks a barrel right now there are 85 bucks that would be consistent with you know $4 for a gallon of regular and let it if we if we can manage that if oil prices can stay roughly in that range then The arithmetic here is in our favor because of the this is all year over year and we saw some big increases in oil energy prices a year ago So that should bring in inflation to 8 to 4 The hard part is going to be though getting from 4 to 2 2 and a half That's going to be more difficult that goes to Rent growth and the cost of housing we're getting some better news there But that'll take a while in the most difficult part of this will be getting the job market to slow Get wage growth moderating because that's key to service price inflation And that's the last mile and that's going to take a while probably not until early 2024 and because of that do you think at some point the Fed calls it a win with inflation around 4% Yeah, so what I think they'll do is they'll follow the script they'll go to 4 and a half 4 and 3 quarters by By end of January that's the the meeting in early early next year They stop they take a look around they know that the impact of the rate hikes will filter through The financial system in economy with a long lag so they want to take a look around I want to make sure job growth is slowing as I anticipate that wage growth is rolling as I anticipate that inflation has moderated as I Just articulated and moving in the right direction And if if it is then that's the end of the story The 4.5% of underrated is the so-called terminal rate the highest rate in cycle and well keep it there Until for a while into 2024 until it's obvious that we're headed back to target or close to But that would be a scenario where we kind of sort of squeak our way through avoid a recession Although I don't want to sound too polyannish under any scenario Uh the next year 18 months are going to feel pretty uncomfortable. It's just a matter of how much discomfort we're going to feel Mark I guess when we're also trying to figure out whether or not the risk here that the Fed is going to overshoot I know you're saying that you expect them to pause But what do you think the risk is though that they front load too much if we get a more aggressive Rate hikes in the next two meetings before the end of the year? Are you concerned at all just about the spillover effect looking ahead to 2023? Well the risk here are two-sided They certainly could overshoot. You know, they may not pause as I anticipate early next year they keep on going Uh, and something breaks, you know in the financial system I you know The higher rates go the faster they go the longer they stay up Something in the financial system is not going to work as anticipated. We got a taste of that over in the UK a couple three weeks ago Oh when the British pension funds choked on the former prime minister's plan saw interest rates rise and it exposed some problems and their derivatives Product that they've been using to match their assets and liabilities. That's very esoteric But that's the kind of thing that you know will happen in a you know highly stressed environment with interest rates At high levels for an extended period But you know there is also the other risk that they Uh, misjudge they they should continue to tighten because inflation isn't moderating sufficiently They keep rates too low at 4.5% for too long the inflation gets entrenched and that's a stack flation scenario Which is pretty ugly particularly because we will ultimately experience recession But just later and it'll be more deep and severe. So the risks on either side that which you know Obviously makes it's you know really tricky going forward. Hopefully they can kind of calibrate things and get it roughly right But a lot of obviously a lot of risk around that mark that something many fear might break is the housing sector where we are seeing some fed success If you want to see it that way how much pain is it head in housing? How do you quantify it? Yeah, well housing's the most race-sensitive sector of the economy So it's not surprising. It's taking it on the chin. I mean this is this is by design the Federal Reserve is raising race to slow the Economies growth rate the job market to Quell inflation and so housing is going to suffer and it really is you know, it's taking it's getting nailed You know you saw today's existing home sales numbers that gives you",https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XTJjX90THDQ,43,2022-10-21 16:59:12
3860," and so housing is gonna suffer and it really is. You know, it's getting nailed. You saw today's existing home sales numbers that gives you a sense of the hit to the man. The net goes to high rates, 30 year fixed mortgage rates over 700%. You multiply that by the house prices and it's just unaffordable for most people, potential for some of buyers just can't afford that. And then people will own their home with a mortgage. They're kind of locked in because if they have to sell their home and get a new mortgage to buy another home at a much higher rate, that's just not gonna work economically. So it does mean that house prices are gonna come in. They have to come in. They are coming in pretty fast. I've been surprised at how fast they started to fall, particularly in places like California where we're already seeing kind of five, six, seven percent declines from the peak. So we should buckle in. This is gonna happen to me. I do expect even with no recession, we'll probably get a double digit kind of decline in house prices nationwide peak to trough. I am hopeful though that that's not the place anything where anything breaks because in the sense of what's going on in the system because the underlying quality of the mortgages, the underwriting, the bars has been excellent since the financial crisis. And of course, even with these house price declines, that's after a period of very strong house price growth. So all you're doing is retracing part of the increase that we've experienced since the pandemic hit. So I'm hopeful we will see some increase in mortgage defaults and foreclosure and distress sales, but I am hopeful that that's modest. And so that's not, I don't think that's the place where the system will break. Moody's chief economist, Mark Zandee, good to see you, sir. Thank you. In this episode of influencers, data scientist and Facebook whistleblower, Francis Hogan. I think unless Facebook changes a lot of people are going to die. And the reality is a lot of people do get wiped out by the stock slide. Facebook has a series of whistleblowers. Like, I am not the only whistleblower. There's like a new one every two weeks. And when Facebook misleads people about the value of the company, and when you lie about material issues, you are lying about the value of the company. Hello, everyone, and welcome to influencers I'm Andy Sherwer. And welcome to our guest, Francis Hogan, former product manager at Facebook, Metta, who recently blew the whistle about companies practices by leaking thousands of internal documents. Francis, great to see you. Thank you for inviting me. So first of all, why did you do it? And what is your life like now? I came forward because I saw that the information that Facebook was withholding from the public was critical to the public safety, that people needed to know in order to make responsible choices. And that Facebook was consistently resolving tradeoffs in a way that was in their own interests and not in the interests of public safety. They were putting profits over people. More so than say any other company, like an oil company or a retailer. I think an oil company is a great company to contrast Facebook with, which is oil companies are radically more transparent, because we can literally go and put sensors around an oil fill. You can measure the pollution. They satellites to see, are they capping the methane leaks? There are all these things where we can be accountable, or that company knows it is accountable in some way. Facebook knows that no matter what activists bring forward, they can just deny that it exists. And one of the things that happened over and over again after I came out was activists would reach out to me and say, I brought this up five years ago. I've been giving the evidence of human trafficking on the platform for years, and they always tell me, this is just anecdotal. It's not a real trend. It's not actually a big problem. But the documents show they knew it was a big problem. Was that was the difference because people have been complaining and pointing fingers to this company for a long time, but it's the actual physical proof of those documents, right? Exactly. That's what changed. We now have evidence that these things that have been raised for years, like people who have been laying the groundwork, activists have been doing tons of work, and now we have the proof.",https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XTJjX90THDQ,44,2022-10-21 17:03:31
3861," Okay, that's right. Exactly. That's what changed. We now have evidence that these things that have been raised for years, like people have been laying the groundwork activists have been doing tons of work. And now we have the proof that Facebook knew and didn't resolve these problems. And what about this point of your life and how that's changed? I was in Portugal at the Web Summit. There were thousands of people who are hanging on your every word. I have to say like so my life in general has not changed that much. So one of the few blessings of COVID is like we didn't go out and socialize a lot before. And after I came out we didn't go on socialize again. Like I have I have I have silly acts so we most of our meals at home. And so the day-to-day life is not really changed. But things like Web Summit, I really don't like being the center of attention. Like it gives me a huge amount of anxiety. And I remember going in Web Summit and thinking to myself, I am so grateful that I am not someone who like gets buzzed off of being the center of attention. Because I could totally imagine that experience being addictive. And instead it was just terrifying. Because like there are like 12,000 people there. It's a lot of people. What about Washington DC, Francis? This is a big question. And you've got both sides of the aisle that are concerned about big tech and Facebook in particular. And yet they disagree about what the problem is, never mind what the solution is. One of the things I've been trying to do is kind of shift the conversation. Because Facebook knows that as long as we think the argument is about censorship, you know, is it too much censorship? Is it not enough censorship? As long as we focus on that as the conflict we will never resolve it. But what Facebook knows is that there's lots of solutions that don't involve content. Right? They involve the dynamics of the algorithm. They involve product choices. Like should you have a multi-picker that lets you spam out to 10 groups at the same time, the same piece of content. Facebook knows they have all these solutions that aren't about content. And as long as we're arguing about censorship, we're not going to hold them accountable on these other things. And so the main thing that I think there's a point of common ground is, you know, people on the left on the right believe that people have the right to make informed choices. Right? That you only really can consent or like voluntarily choose to do something if you have enough information to make that choice. And so I've been pushing for what I call like nutrition labels. So like, you know, the government doesn't tell us what to put in our mouths. But it does say, hey, if you claim this is in your food and used to be in your food. And you need to listen to much trans fats in it. And if you'll notice, the government never banned trans fats. But as soon as it couldn't consumers had that information, it disappeared from all of our products. We don't have a nutritional label for TikTok. We don't have a nutritional label for Facebook. But the public has a right to have real data, not Facebook or artistic data, but like real data on how these platforms work so they can make choices. We're calling it Facebook, but the companies renamed itself meta. So should we be calling it meta or Facebook Francis? I am trying to train myself to say meta because I know a big part about why they made this shift is they want to run away from the conflict. And the reality is that people are dying. Children are dying, right? They're going to be women walking around this country of brittle bones in 60 years because Facebook made choices to not stop its algorithms from driving women towards the inter-executive content. Right? This is a crisis and Facebook thinks they can change its name and just focus on video games and that it will all go away. And so I that's one of my goals in 2022. It's to be able to say meta and Facebook in the same sentence because we can't let them run away from the damage that they're doing. How would you say that in the same sense? Like you could say meta's Facebook or I could say meta Facebook, but we need to make sure that you know one of the reasons they did it was they know their employees feel ashamed to admit they work at Facebook and now they can say they work at meta. I have a backpack from when I worked there and in tech, tech companies love giving you swag. You know a t-shirt this is Google, a backpack that says snapchat. My Facebook backpack had the Facebook logo on the inside. I never received a single shirt hoodie whatever a Facebook that said Facebook. You mean they were concerned even at that point.",https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XTJjX90THDQ,45,2022-10-21 17:07:52
3862," Inside. I never received a single shirt hoodie, whatever, a Facebook that said Facebook. You mean they were concerned even at that point about their branding and the backlash that it might produce if you were wearing a public? Yeah, exactly. And I think that's a giant red flag. Like, part of my mission and what motivates me every day is I know that people are suffering inside the company. Right? Like, not being willing to admit reality and the present is really hard. That cognitive dissonance is really hard. And I know that Mark Zuckerberg is suffering and that like every time you go in a restaurant and having people give you dirty looks, it has to be hard. And so we need to hold the company accountable and help it grow towards long-term success because the current impasse in hurts everyone. So what about Mark Zuckerberg, Francis? Is he a bad guy? Does he have evil intentions? How would you characterize him? So I never, in willing to call Mark, evil, it's funny. When I appeared in front of the UK parliament, there was a member of parliament that was very insistent. They're like, but is this evil? Is this evil? And I think it's really important to remember that Facebook is full of very well-intentioned people. And I think it is a problem about incentives. And some of those incentives, you know, Facebook has a fiduciary duty to act in the interests of shareholders. And I think it's a lot harder to prove long-term harms and short-term harms. And so Facebook has been stuck in the cycle where when they are faced with these conflicts where it's like, you know, you have to be 0.1% less profitable, where you have 10% less misinformation. Because there is no mandated transparency, it's very hard to make the business case that you don't choose that 0.1% of profit. So mandated transparency gives another center of mass that gives space for people inside the company to do the right quo. you you you you",https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XTJjX90THDQ,46,2022-10-21 17:12:01
3863," you You How close were you to Mark Zuckerberg? Did you have any direct contact with them? As they like to say, I was a low-level employee that I never sat in a seat meeting. I'm a data scientist. I worked on civic misinformation and later counter-espionage. You don't become an algorithmic expert if you like being the center of attention. It's an invisible thing behind the scenes. But the reality is, in Facebook's own documents, I saw the magnitude of the problem. And just surveying, operationally and organizationally, how Facebook worked. I have an MBA from Harvard. There's a lot of things where in Silicon Valley, we undervalue the role of leadership. And we undervalue the role of organizational health. And I think I had an opportunity to assess, like, what was the feasibility of change in a way that was different than a lot of people because I had had that opportunity for that education. And I don't think there's a path to change inside of Facebook without the help of the public. You wouldn't necessarily need to have access to those people to understand that there were problems there. In fact, my experience there is when you get close to that, there's an echo channel there. Oh, yeah. So I want to ask, I've spent a bunch of time in Menlo Park, obviously, not as much as you have on the campus. What was it like? Oh, the Facebook campus is so fascinating to me as an architectural object. So mostly, I'm unaware, but Facebook has the largest open floor plan office in the world. It is a quarter of a mile long. It's 5,000 people. It is such an amazing, you know, medieval societies built cathedrals because they were societies that were oriented around God. Right, like you have these gothic arches that lead your eye upwards like to the heavens, right? Facebook's campus is a physical manifestation of their obsession with flatness. Like the idea that we are all on the same level that, you know, their leadership style is we have metrics. And people can do whatever they want to move those metrics, like we embrace the freedom of individual employees. But when you don't acknowledge that power differentials exist, you actually reinforce those powered dynamics. And I think there are things around, you know, a situation where flatness is obsessed over means there's actually not a lot of space for single leaders to come forward to say there is a problem. Or we need to make a short term sacrifice for a long term gain. I think it was Orwell who said everyone's equal except some are more equal than others. And then that's not even acknowledged. Yeah. That's a fascinating, fascinating point. I want to ask you about this question about whether Facebook... Actually, can I give you a little bit more of a little bit of this one? Sure, please. To give you a sense of how absurd this space is. So Facebook is obsessed with 15 and 30 minute meetings. So like they're very efficient. They're obsessed with the word crisp, like are your documents crisp? Is your explanation crisp? The space is so large that I would regularly walk 15 minutes, 10, 15 minutes to go to a 30 minute meeting. And so even that level of absurdity that is more important for the building to be flat than to be functional for us to go to our meetings. It just kind of shows you the blindness of that religion. And you've worked at other big tech companies. You've mentioned Google, for instance.",https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XTJjX90THDQ,47,2022-10-21 17:16:28
3864," or meetings. That it just kind of shows you the blindness of that religion. And you've worked at other big tech companies. You've mentioned Google, for instance. How is Facebook different from these other companies? And is it better or worse? Yeah. So I feel like there was more of an acknowledgement of users as equal stakeholders at other companies I worked at. So like Google, I don't know if people are aware of this. But Google is able to support thousands of languages, partially because they built tools that allowed individual communities to move Google into their language. But they said linguistic diversity matters at that level. And even back in the mid-2000s, I worked on internationalization on Google Books. And there was a real authentic commitment to how do we get into the most languages and adequately support them. Imagine if Facebook took the same attitude on safety. Right? If they came in and said, do we live in a linguistic diverse world? Let's make sure all of the dialects in Ethiopia are covered. There's 100 million people in Ethiopia. They're having a civil war right now that is being amplified by Facebook. They have 100 dialects, six major language families. Imagine if Facebook instead of being so closed. So Facebook has full control of their platform. The only one that you can see inside is full closed. Imagine if they said, we're going to take a page from the Google Playbook. And I, and make tools that allow Ethiopians to actually make all the safety systems working all their languages. They'd be a very different world. And so there's little details like that where I think there's an opportunity to open up Facebook and say, you are the internet in most countries. 80 or 90% of the content in most languages in the world is on Facebook. Imagine if they came and said, we actually acknowledge that power that we have. And we invite you to collaborate with us. We'd have a very different conversation right now. Do you think this company meta Facebook is in decline? I mean, part of the reason why the stock went down is because they had a decline in DEA use. First time. They've never had one. So what does that tell you about the future of this company? Yeah. So I've said repeatedly, I view the work that I'm doing as in the best interests of Facebook. Like, it might not feel that way today. But Facebook needs help to make long-term successful choices instead of optimizing so hard on the short term. And like having an environment where people like being on the platform, where they feel safe, where they feel like they're getting high quality information, that is a path to long-term success. Until Facebook takes responsibility and is just honest with people until they change their relationship with the public, I think they're going to keep seeing users live. Have you been in contact or have top executives at Facebook been in contact with you or have any executives been in contact with you? A director level, but not above that. There's a lot of really good people inside of Facebook. And one of the things that I hope comes out of the work I'm doing is that they have more space to be able to act. The company has already said that they are going to invest some more money. I don't think it's enough. Did you know that they're doing $75 billion of buybacks? Is that crazy? Crazy. And when they say they're going to invest $5 billion in safety in the next year, it's like, yeah, but you little on fire $75 billion. I mean, could you have done $10 billion in safety? But my actions do open up space inside the company for those good people to be able to make progress. And so that's always my hope. And what about the future of the internet? Francis, big question. I love that question. It looks right now. For instance, simplistically, the United States, China, Europe. Is that going to be the future going forward that there are at least three sort of geographies and distinct internet increasingly? So I think you're totally right that Europe is taking a different regulatory perspective. But in terms of networks, I believe if you look at it, I don't think Europe and the United States are going to isolate. So when you say China, China does have a closed internet. And the thing that I'm scared about is Russia.",https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XTJjX90THDQ,48,2022-10-21 17:20:51
3865," I don't think Europe and the United States are going to isolate. So when you say China, China does have a closed internet. And the thing that I'm scared about is Russia and China have made indications that they may kind of merge their closed internet. Like they're talking about building their own closed financial system. They're talking about having their own closed internet. And I think once you start separating the internet and separating the financial systems, that's where things start to get dangerous. Because once you begin operating so independently, then you have opportunities for conflict. I think there's some really interesting conversations happening right now around the role of decentralization. So you might have heard of DeFi. You might have heard of Web3 or like crypto-based networks. And those are going to open some really interesting conversations. Because this is software that doesn't run in the United States or run in Europe or run in Africa. It runs everywhere simultaneously. It's applications. Then instead of running in a data center, they're all running in little kind of pockets everywhere on these decentralized networks. And so I think there's going to be unquestionably sometime in the next five years, probably, a social network where no one is responsible for it. Is that good or bad? It's a really interesting conversation, depends how it's designed. There's ways of designing these networks where you do safety not based on content, but you do it based on the dynamics of the network. And if they make those kinds of decisions, whether or like, oh, interesting, we're going to cut reshare chains at two. So that means allisrate something. Bob reshairs it. Carol reshairs it. And lands and dance moves. Imagine if Dan had a copy and paste that content in order to share it. So he had to hit a button. He has to copy and paste it. That change has the same impact as the whole third party fact checking program today.",https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XTJjX90THDQ,49,2022-10-21 17:25:26
3866, you you so it sounds sort of like a social network kind of based on blockchain in a way it could be yeah I think there's going to be a one at some point I mean I know you're a big if correct me if I'm wrong crypto fan or I do believe in in the power of crypto right right yeah talk about I mean I don't want to go way down that rabbit hole we don't have too much time but tell us why you're a collaborative crypto and so I'm a big proponent of I'm not I always try not to give investment advice because people do ask this question I do think there are interesting opportunities though around you know we're getting new models of how to run finance systems like the defy networks you know the rules are transparent we all see exactly how they operate and I think they're interesting conversations are on governance that a lot of these crypto projects are experimenting with new ways of doing corporate governance right in terms of who gets to influence what decisions and how and as someone who really values organizational design and organizational health I'm intrigued to see where they go but beyond that I don't think I have an effects for teased to envision the future I want to ask you about your background you said you went to Harvard I knew you went to all and undergraduate grew up in Iowa City is there anything about your background upbringing you think that informed you in terms of decisions you made so I'm extremely grateful so I attended the Franklin W. Olin College of Engineering it's in the Western suburbs in Massachusetts near Wellesley and it's a very small college you know it's 75 students a year but they believe that in order to be an impactful engineer and a responsible engineer you have to have more context and so all in intentionally incorporates more humanities into their curriculum than most engineering programs and they also incorporate design and entrepreneurship and it's based on the idea that engineers that can go found successful companies are ones both understand that dynamics of entrepreneurship but they also understand people because really good leaders are people who understand what drives human beings and so I think the fact that I had the opportunity to go to Olin gave me more context I think the fact that I did high school debate and I coached high school debate you know like I've I've had to sit there and and you know wrestle with 14 year olds on like how should society be structured so like think of think of your 14 year old being like that's not fair and imagine having to teach them how to unpack that and be like how do I have a conversation about why is it not fair tell me more I think those things made me care more about democracy and like what is the role of a technology just in a democracy and so I don't know I think all those things influence me and final question Francis what's next for you and what do you see as your legacy if it's not too really asked that I love five months into my whistle blow so I what's your legacy so I'm my big focus in 2022 is around helping to plant a decentralized youth led movement around social media a decentralized I'm sorry a decentralized youth led movement around transparency and accountability for technology and so we have started college tour the spring and the goals are on giving tools to young people,https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XTJjX90THDQ,50,2022-10-21 17:29:23
3867," transparency and accountability for technology. And so we started a college tour this spring, and the goals are on giving tools to young people, like basically education on saying like, here are levers that we believe exists to either put pressure on Facebook, or ways that you can build networks of resiliency. Because young people are dying, right? And until we can get Facebook to do the responsible thing, young people can make a difference by caring for each other. And so that's my big focus that I'm working right now. And that is going to live under a nonprofit that we're in the process of founding. And the nonprofit is going to have two main focuses initially. One is plant that movement, which will eventually get spun off. And the second is something called open source integrity. So open source integrity is the idea that we the public need tools, assets, that allow us to hold Facebook accountable. So that means our own data, right? Our own ways of analyzing these things, simulated social networks. Because right now you can't get a master's degree in these safety systems, right? And we as a civilization need 10,000 more of these people minted every year. And so I want to figure out the tooling where we can have that feature. Francis Hagen, thank you so much for your time. Thank you so much for inviting me. This is great. You've been watching the influencers. I'm Andy Surwer. We'll see you next time. Welcome back to Yowl Finance. I'm Brian Saazi here with Brad Smith, Julie Heimann as the day off. Markets are tiptoeing into the weekend as traders gear up for a big wave of earnings next week. Right now you're seeing all three major indices. I would say maybe a little bit more than tiptoeing. We're seeing the Dow up almost 335 points. Here's what else we're watching at this moment. No recession. American Express shares are under. We're under a little pressure after the company. It didn't raise its full year earnings guidance range. The stock is still under pressure. CEO Steven Squarry tells me concerns of a recession are overblown and dialing up in earnings. Be Verizon shares are in focus after the company. Be it on earnings, the posted week, subscriber gains, Brad Chaat, Verizon, CEO Hans Vesberg who noted that there are points of a couple points of weakness in that earnings report. More on that one on the Yowl Finance homepage right now. And it's time to travel. Spotlight the theme park sector following much better than expected earnings from airlines. Brad, over to you. All right, let's kick things off with a check of the major averages here. 32 minutes into trading on this Friday. And the Dow Jones industrial average right now. You're seeing that hold on to some slight gains right now. It's up by about 1.1%. All right, so a little bit more than slight gains here on the day. The NASDAQ composite as I bring this into an intraday view just to give us a better perspective of what's taking place. Look at that sharp move higher that we've seen within the first.",https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XTJjX90THDQ,51,2022-10-21 17:33:57
3868," like gains here on the day, the Nasdaq composite, as I bring this into an intra-day view just to give us a better perspective of what's taking place. Look at that sharp move higher that we've seen within the first 30 minutes of trade. We're up by about half a percent right now. As clearly investors, some of the sentiment right now is saying, hey, you know what, hold my beer. We could rally into this Friday, and that's what we're seeing right now is a little bit of an early session rally. The S&P 500, you're seeing that up by about 1% here. And so you take a look at the broader week that we've been watching as well. This could potentially add on to some of the net gains that we had seen, even with the declines earlier in the day, we were still up on the week by about 2% as of right now with this move. We're up by about 3%, 3.3% on the S&P 500. Also, I want to take a look at some of the trending stocks on the Yahoo Finance homepage as well here. And yeah, it's none other than snapped. The brand of Ghost Face Chilla. Yeah, it's chilling on the day to the tune of about 30% of Chillin Lower in a bad way here. So we're continuing to watch that as well as Twitter. You're also seeing shares of Pinterest move in concert lower by about 6.3%. So for more on this move that we've been tracking with Snap as I put that back in focus on the day, down 30%. We've got Jeffrey's Senior Research Analyst, Brent Thill. Brent, just take us into your reaction after you saw the numbers cross from Snap and what the executives had to say on the call last night. Yeah, good morning. The quarter itself was OK. It was the guy. And they have obviously been experiencing decelerating growth just over a year ago. They said they could grow indefinitely for 50% and then the growth rate came into the 30s, into the teens, into the single digits. And they exited at high single digit growth and then said the quarter was growing at 9%. And then said the quarter would end flat because advertisers would fall off a cliff in the back half of the quarter. So I think it's more about the guide and more about the lack of visibility. There's clearly been a lot of departures there, senior leaders and sales have left to go to Netflix. You have a concern around advertisers moving to where the wallets are, meaning the younger audience and Snap don't have the dollars. The parents have the dollars. The older generation has the dollars. So you're seeing advertisers shift up from the lower end to the higher end, which makes sense. So we're still going to be influenced to buy household goods and items for to run our life. But that's not where we make the decisions on Snap, right? We may make a decision on Snap to buy the new Hawaiian shirt or buy concert ticket, but we're not going to be influenced to go. Again, make some of the bigger ticket purchases. So dollars for advertisers are shifting to Google, to Amazon, to prove and spend where the wallets are. And that's where the advertisers are at. We also have a competitive issue with TikTok, which is anyone that's fired up TikTok and spend five minutes with it, spends a half hour with it. It engages you. It brings you in. So advertisers naturally in the more experimental and younger audience are shifting away from Snap over to the TikTok platform. So there's a handful of forces. Change is in the team. Change is in advertisers. I think overall, the bigger picture, too, is the macro, which is we have a macro picture that's dimming. We are going into a recession in 23 per hour economists. This will start later than most economists have believed our team internally continues to believe that we are going to go into it more of a tailspin in next year that this takes time to come out into the economy. So if you think about that, if we do go into that tailspin, we advertisers naturally, the first thing they're going to say is we're not spending. Advertising can be tuned up and tuned down in a nanosecond. We described as the stereo knob in your car or at home. You can go up and down really quick. You can't do that in software. You can't do that in semis. You can't do that in other areas of technology. So right now, I think investors are just like, I don't want to be in advertising if we're going into a pro long in from 0.80% to 0. volunteerization. worse for working for our journey.",https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XTJjX90THDQ,52,2022-10-21 17:38:22
3869," for you can't do that in semis, you can't do that in other areas of technology. So right now, I think investors are just like, I don't want to be in advertising if we're going into a prolonged downturn. I will be back to advertising names when we go back in the upturn. And there's, you know, safer names outside of tech. And that's what we continue to hear from our clients. It's just our clients want to be outside of technology. Right now, they want to be in energy. If you look at the the XLE, you know, up over 50% year to date, right? So the popular trade beginning of the year was short technology belong the XLE. And, you know, we've got the XLE up again today and up 54% year to date. So I don't think that the tone of technology overall and advertising and many of the other tech names that we cover is going to shift until we get into 2023 and we get a lot of these companies to really reset the numbers. So I expect a tougher, a tougher earnings season for the rest of tech. Brent, does the snap have to cut its expenses even further? Yes. I mean, they do. I mean, they just restructured the company. They obviously are in the process of still reducing the workforce by 20%. They may have to go deeper. And again, I think the thing we don't know is how long is this, this economic, you know, pullback going to last. It could last all next year. Again, our Jeffery's own economists have said this really starts later in the year versus early because it takes time for all these changes that the Fed is putting into place is going to be a way that comes in slowly. It doesn't come crashing in on you. And so the scary part of what's happening is we don't know exactly that this can be prolonged. A lot of companies are saying, oh, we're not seeing it. Some companies are saying we're seeing it. I think everyone's going to see it. And I think this is going to be, again, the concern, which is, you know, this could, this could get a lot darker than we all think. And that is a potential. Now, I would highlight that, look, if Elon Musk thinks that Twitter's worth $44 billion and Snap now has a, you know, roughly $12 billion market cap, you start to ask yourself, he's trying to build the X app, which is all these things you can do. Snap has a closer version of an X app than anyone. It has the map. It has the information page. It has a messaging service. It has ARVR. It has a gaming interface. I mean, there's, there's, there's many elements that investors have come back to me and said, well, Bren, if you want to create an X app, which is all these things that Twitter isn't today and fire 75% of the workforce, doesn't snap have all the, the foundational makings of what an X app would look like. And I'm like, yeah, absolutely. So at some point, you kind of go, look, we understand they've had execution issues. Again, the visibility on the advertising industry, that's across the board. I mean, it's not like meta and Google and Amazon's ad business or accelerating. They're all decelerating, right? So they're all facing the same headwinds now. Obviously, Snap's had stronger headwinds. But at some point, you go back to everyone is so negative that ultimately, if you have a long-term horizon and you sit and look at this and you believe, you know, these are typically some of the best opportunities for tech investors over a three-year period, not the next three months. So depending on your duration, I think there's some credible opportunities that are being born in this downturn that clearly, you know, we're going to have some hazy, overcast, foggy skies in the short term. But you're getting some interesting opportunities if you are a longer-term investor. Do you think there's some consolidation to be expected given the valuations right now? 100%. M&A is going to get a massively spike. M&A, there is no IPO window right now. So we have given birth to a lot of great technology companies. Many of these subsectors are overcrowded. You've already seen that.",https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XTJjX90THDQ,53,2022-10-21 17:42:31
3870," Many of these sub-sectors are overcrowded. You've already seen that your to date, Tomo Verado, who's one of the best software investors in the planet, has spent over $20 billion acquiring multiple companies outside in the security and technology landscape. So if you look out even outside of social media, you've seen incredible consolidation. You've seen strategic deals like Adobe buying Figma for $20 billion. No one thought any company in the beginning of a recession would pay 50 times revenue, 5.0, and not 5.50. So we are going to see an incredible amount of strategic M&A, an incredible amount of private equity, let M&A. You're already seeing it. You're seeing the number of skyrocket, you're to date. You're seeing some of the best technology investors for the long haul. Like Tomo Verado, we'll say, this is go time for software consolidation. There's no question. And this is what we need to restore the health, because we're in that cycle of we expanded dramatically. We had so many IPOs. We've had no IPOs in tech this year. And so if you think about what's happening, you're going to go back to that natural consolidation phase of M&A. And we firmly believe we're seeing the signals already. We're seeing the best investors in the space talk about it. We're seeing the strategic step up and make acquisitions. You saw Adobe, you saw Microsoft in Activision. You've seen Salesforce go a little quiet. They have to go quiet in the short term, into it that did MailChimp for 12 billion. You've seen an incredible amount. And so I think ultimately these valuations are going to get cheaper. This is when you want to be acquiring if you're a strategic hero private equity. Great perspective, as always. Jeffrey, senior research analyst Brent, they'll have a great weekend. We'll talk to you soon. You do. Thanks. All right, before we head to break, let's take a look at some upbeat comments. On Uber and Lyft out of Deutsche Bank, before each company reports earnings, analyst Benjamin Black says, ride share demand backdrop for both Uber and Lyft remain strong, explains Black. Our data comports with recent Uber management commentary suggesting that ride share demand is beginning to follow typical seasonality. Therefore, we think the downside risk to ride share gross bookings for both companies is limited. Before we go to break, though, I will add this. Let's do a quick check of the markets here. You're seeing the stocks really come out of the gate. Strengthened, relative to the opening bell. And Brad, you flag this, and it seems to be moving off of this. The latest Nick Timmeros market moving, Wall Street Journal story. Really, I think for the first time, signaling that the Fed pivot or that time, or that point where the Fed pulls back a little bit on raising rates by 75 basis points, that might come in early 2023, perhaps quicker than some of the market expected. Yeah, within this reporting, a quote from Fed Governor Christopher Waller. From a speech earlier this month, however, that, of course, Fed whisperer that Nick Timmeros has become, that quote saying, we will have a very thoughtful discussion about the pace of tightening at our next meeting here. And that is really leaning further to some of this signaling, even in addendum to the Fed speak that we've gotten, the signaling now that there may be some type of pivot in the markets, certainly latching onto that here. Even that polar story can't turn around snap. We'll leave it there. I'll talk to you later.",https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XTJjX90THDQ,54,2022-10-21 17:47:03
3871," Merit The Walmart agreed to pay $215 million to the state of Florida over claims that its pharmacies helped fuel the opioid epidemic in that state. The retailer also agreed to give out $672,000 treatment kits to Florida first responders. According to Moody's, Florida has now secured $3.2 billion to help fight the opioid crisis. In a new report by Doach Bank, says Doach Bank is laying off dozens of employees, including some out of the UK, that's according to voters. No concrete number was given, but a person close to the matter says most of the cuts are in origination and advisory segments of its investment banking unit. This says a pullback in financing deals prompted lenders to cut back on costs. And Pfizer says it's hiking its US COVID vaccine price to over $100 per dose. Doach's could be costing between $110 to $130 per dose before insurance. Now this will take place after the US government's current purchase program expires. Right now the government pays around $30 per dose. And Adidas is cutting its full year guidance following weaker demand in Western markets and its exits from Russia. The company cut currency, neutral revenue expectations and lowered its expected operating margin to 4%. Adidas also blamed slowdowns in China and inventory buildups for the cuts. Despite the sour outlook, Adidas did see sales grow. 11% in Q3. Sawas? All right, from record home prices to record mortgage rates, 2022 has been a wild ride for the now ice cold housing market. But could this pain be good for prospective home buyers down the road? Y'all find it's a commoners for Newman is here with more so Rick, I should be cheering these declines because maybe at some point I'll be able to buy home. Maybe a year from now or something like that, but it's getting ugly in the housing market and it's probably going to get uglier. So we just saw the eighth consecutive month of declining existing home sales. That's the worst stretch since 2007 and what was happening in 2007. That was when the housing bubble was exploding. We got the home builders index this week. That has been going down. That's now at the lowest level since the bottom of the COVID downturn. And if you don't count that, it's the lowest level since 2012 again close to the bottom of the housing bust back then. So we have a long way to go to get through housing. Everybody has kind of seen this coming. I mean, this has almost everything to do with rising interest rates and mortgage rates now up around 7%. But we haven't seen prices really fall over yet. They've just started to turn and they will come down for sure. But we're at the beginning of a major correction and we probably have months to go. Rick, I like Sausie. Also just want to know when it's possible to buy a house. I guess further out down the line, what kind of changes are we really expecting for the consumer environment to look like, especially given the fact that if you have an absence of those buyers because of rates in the near term that sellers as well are going to be impacted as well and they're going to be less listings of existing homes. Yeah, this impacts everything on both the buyer and the seller side and the builders.",https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XTJjX90THDQ,55,2022-10-21 17:51:21
3872," Sellers as well are going to be impacted as well and they're going to be less listings of existing homes. Yeah, this impacts everything on both the buyer and the seller side and the builder side I should add. So we're so builders are reluctant to build. We're seeing that decline. There's a long standing problem for builders getting permits. And you're right. There's this lock-in effect. So if you happen to be a homeowner and I'm lucky enough to be one, I'm older than you guys, of course. Then you probably locked in a mortgage rate of around 3% and you're looking at this market and saying yourself, I'm not going to sell. I'm going to go out of my way to stay where I am and keep that keep that where it is. So as with many other things we talk about on our area every day, we need to get to the other side of the feds tightening cycle. I think we need to see when that the fed is finally feels like it's it's gone far enough. And then we can get through through this difficult period. And you know, at some point it's reasonable to think interest rates are going to come back down again. It might take a recession to do that. I mean, I've seen some economists saying, yeah, we think the fed will basically finish up by late this year or early next year. And then it could be cutting rates again if we actually get into a recession in 2023. So, you know, things do change in the housing market, but these are long shifts. This is not like stocks. These are long shifts. We're talking six, nine, 12 months to get to the other side of this. Congrats here at Home Ownership, Rick Newman. Always good to see you. We'll talk to you soon. Hi guys. It has been a year to forget and tech as you can see by the unfolding nest. It's snap. We'll dive more into the space with Alphabet Board Member and former Goldman Sachs top executive Marty Schveznext. The tech sector is firmly in the red and fraught regulation issues layoffs and hiring freezes as inflation and market uncertainty take their toll on the sector. Here to make sense of the tech landscape and the surrounding global economic picture is six street partners vice chairman Marty Chavez. Marty, good to see you again. Look, we've been talking all morning long about this sell off in social media stocks. Of course, snap top of mind there. Help the average investor understand what is happening and when am I at end? Well, I found it helpful as an investor and just around peace of mind to keep my eyes on the long term trends. There's a lot going on. I don't think I can add to it. There's certainly a lot of macroeconomic issues.",https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XTJjX90THDQ,56,2022-10-21 17:55:45
3873," as an investor and just for my own peace of mind to keep my eyes on the long-term trends. And there's a lot going on. I don't think I can add to it. There's certainly a lot of macroeconomic news. And there's the announcement that we all read yesterday. I would just say this is the nature of tech. It is risky. It is growth. It is volatile. It has been on a very long trend. And it was easy and fun to get used to that trend. Who knows where that's going to go in the future. But if you step way back and just look at the long-term trend, I think there's very few predictions that I will make with absolute rock solid confidence. And one of them is that there's going to be more software in the future than there is in the present. And so long-term, it's the same. And there's a lot of ups and downs on the way. That prediction tracks Marty. I appreciate that here this morning. You also have a unique position of sitting on the board at alphabet as well. With that in mind, I just wonder what is the next transformative technology that's really going to be the changing factor for consumers as well for some of the companies that we cover on a daily basis. So one thing that you get to say if you've been at the same thing for a long time is you live long enough to get to be considered a pioneer. And so a long time ago, I was working on AI in medicine. This is back in the late 80s and the early 90s. The compute power was just way too low. And I remember back then there were people working on neural networks. And we used to think, okay, that doesn't seem like that's ever going to work. Well, that has worked unbelievably well. So I, many other people were just dead wrong about neural networks. And what we are able to do, we've all seen with neural networks is amazing. We are just at the very, very beginning of an incredibly exciting upsling. And what we're going to be able to do with AI across the board, whether it's drug discovery, climate change, or at the beginning of actually being able to do amazing, really miraculous things with AI. So that's the future. But right now, you're also kind of looking at this environment where even as we were looking at snaps, earnings, and really reading through where they're impacted as a result of operating system privacy changes that many social media companies have been hit by because of the changes that Apple had put forward. There is another OS that's out there. In fact, there are a few other ones. And one of the other major competing ones is the Android OS. Why is it that there has been more of an impact to the social media companies derivative of privacy changes from the Apple operating system than from any privacy changes because there's also a privacy push within the Android OS as well? Well, I think all companies need to step back and the regulators doing this as well. And look at what privacy means, how to define it, and what we actually want, and to get ready for it. And there's just a whole range of outcomes. This is a huge global social, political decision that we all have to make. And there's so many moving cards. I'd love to predict it, but I would just say to all companies, you have to ready yourself for a large number of different regulatory outcomes. Really, the question is, we know what is possible with AI. What will what does society want us to do with it? And that is a very big decision that's happening right now. There's no one route. It depends on operating systems. It depends on policies. It depends on choices that consumers and companies make. And nobody knows what's going to happen. So you just have to be ready for a variety of outcomes. Already, when the market gets a sense, the Fed is done raising rates for this cycle. What will that mean for the M&A market? Well, so I have somewhat infamous for not making timing predictions. And I think I don't make them because I'm terrible at them. And also causality is hard like knowing this happens. And that's going to happen next and predicting the timing of it. Who knows? Right there. There is M&A happening. There are in every economy, including the one that we currently have, there are difficult spots and there are bright spots. Again, back to AI, if you're looking at financing and in acquisitions and combinations.",https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XTJjX90THDQ,57,2022-10-21 17:59:53
3874," currently have their difficult spots and their bright spots. Again, back to AI, if you're looking at financing and in acquisitions and combinations of all kinds, in that area of AI, that is booming, just like probably better than ever. And so there are bright spot screenshots even now in certain sectors and AI is certainly one of them. Marty, we only got about 30 seconds left, but I'd love to know, especially as so many companies are making changes when it comes to diversity, equity and inclusion, whether that be at the entry level, mid management, all the way up to the board. What is the step that a company can take right now in order to ensure that even in the midst of macroeconomic uncertainty, that they are retaining those values? Well, so the companies have the right values in that in general. I'm not going to make a blanket statement, but really it comes down to what are you actually doing day to day in your recruitment and you're filling the pipeline in understanding connected to managing your people. And so companies are doing a much better job at the entry level, though it's still hard, in reflecting the demographics of the cities and environments where they operate. Really, the hard part is as people become more senior in their careers. How do we continue to make them want to be here as opposed to some other place and how we actively manage their careers to mentorship and sponsorship? Those are the things that all companies need to be doing in a disciplined process-oriented way every day through every market cycle. Sixth Street's partner and vice chairman, thanks so much for joining us. Marty Shavez, appreciate the time this morning. Pleasure, do well. Thanks. You guys coming up, we're going to share the full interview with Verizon Wireless CEO, Hans Vestberg on the other side of this short break-in on the back of his company's company's $1,000,000. Verizon closing the books on its third quarter. It reported results before the bell and its stock currently moving lower by about 5.6% as investors mold the report and weigh the impact of inflation on the wireless providers consumer business. I spoke to Verizon CEO, Hans Vestberg, earlier about the quarter. Take a listen. I think we came out from the second quarter, we had some softness in our consumer.",https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XTJjX90THDQ,58,2022-10-21 18:04:21
3875," I spoke to Verizon CEO Hans Vesper earlier about the quarter. Take a listen. I think we came out from the second quarter. We had some softness in our consumer business, especially on the wireless. We took a lot of actions in the second quarter, especially around new plants, new products, but we also did some price adjustments. Coming into the third quarter and now reporting that, we can see some of that is really getting good effect. We're growing 10% or wireless revenue or EBITA grew 3%, almost 3%, 12.2 billion dollars. Definitely the progress we put in place was actually working, but it's a lot more to do. We're a large company and we need to continue the hard work we're doing right now to continue to do the great cash generation we're doing. That was the highlight of the quarter. We saw also the prepaid market. We acquired a track fund last year, which added a really good asset when it comes to being in the value segment. We had a new product in there, a new product called Total Wireless, but Verizon. We also added home broadband to the prepaid market. Overall, our broadband had a really good quarter. 377,000 new broadband customers in the quarter across business and consumer. That fixed wireless access business we're doing is really working. A lot of things was working for us. We still are working on the consumer segment to be even stronger. We're going to take more actions. It's a very agile market when it comes to consumer segment at the moment. I want to talk a little bit more about that consumer segment as well, Hans. From your perspective, when you think about what you said at the end of the second quarter, mid-summer, second half challenges, you were looking out into the future and saying that second half challenges, you see them as short-term. Is that still the case? Or do you believe that there's some facets of the softness in the consumer, especially as they're paying more for necessities right now, and the macroeconomic climate that you believe might protrude into 2023 or even beyond? It's a little bit mixed feelings, actually. We have the highest quality customer base and the largest consumer base in the country. We see really good payment from our customers, consumers, where we are actually better than pre-COVID. So we don't see anything there. We actually see the roaming when people are traveling abroad. That movements are equally big or higher than pre-COVID. So a lot of things are moving as normal and are store traffic between Q2 to Q3. That increased with double digits. So people are actually doing movement. Then of course, we all read what's happening in the macroeconomy with higher inflation and the interest rate is coming up. So it's a little bit mixed, but clearly we are in the fundamental product. Everybody needs mobility. Everybody needs to be connected. That's so important for us and even more important these days. So clearly, there are mixed feelings. We think we have a great product, we have a great network, and we are spanning all the consumer segments. And then not forget our business side. That has a really good quarter with both growth. There are almost 6% in a wireless business in the business group. But not only that. I did 200,000 new, almost 200,000 new net-dads, full net-dads in the business segment. So it's a little bit mixed when you read in the market and what we're seeing in our customer base. Certainly. I want to talk a little bit more about those network investments in a moment. But before that, we know that you're one of the largest partners with Apple in terms of the iPhone, the latest edition of this consumer device and the smartphone that comes out year after year. And within that, there's even been some of the reports around where the demand might be pulling back. Are you seeing that show up in your business at all right now? Now, when we come to the iPhone 14 launch, we have seen very normal volumes. But moreover, we actually made an exclusive deal with Apple, which we have done over a long time. We're Apple 1 for our unlimited. It's a new offering where you have all the Apple services, Apple Plus, the gaming, etc. In one package together with our unlimited. Very good for us to get the with Apple. So now we're very normal. There's a little bit of mix, of course, which type of products our customers are taking. But in general, very normal levels of a launch of an iPhone. It's...",https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XTJjX90THDQ,59,2022-10-21 18:08:35
3876," Very normal. There is a little bit of mix of course which type of products our customers are taking but in general very normal Levels over over lunch of an iPhone if you were coming back to the the network infrastructure investments that you're making as well If we were to see any kind of recessionary concerns Really permeate over into the next year What would that mean in terms of the moderation of the level of network investments that you might be making and and perhaps on the other and where your full steam ahead? I think that the last six seven years we have at the plan exactly how we're going to invest in the network This is our peak year. We're going to do some somewhere between around 22 billion in Capex that's our guidance And that's one portion is our business as usual and then the other is that the new spectrum we bought last year Is actually coming to execution right now and we're doing that as fast as we can and next year that will will come down So but we have invested in fiber. We are investing in the CBAN the spectrum we bought We're going to pass 200 million pop in the first quarter on our CBAN and the important with the CBAN That's a five-despictrum that we're using we see good growth on that so where we launch a market with the CBAN We see mobility Business growing we see fixed-wise access growing and for the viewers Important we we bought that spectrum but we get it all the time as the satellite companies are releasing it and the last piece of that spectrum We will get at the end of 2023, but basically it's nationwide 160 megahertz which is a lot of spectrum and we're only deploying a piece is over right now But by year and 2023 will have also we have a clear process of how we implement and execute in our in our network And that's on number one capital priority as well. So we will do what is needed for a network We're already have the best network and it's just getting better So just lastly while we have you here I got a hustle to my finish here But I'm taking a look at the stock price investors clearly reaction to this morning's earnings report and perhaps they may be paying Attention to some of the churn in end users or subscribers But they also may be paying close attention to the margins as related to some of the cap ex that's going to be Set forth and continues to be earmarked to the tune of 2020 22 billion dollars that you just mentioned When do you believe either some of the churn will start to alleviate and then on the other side when you can start to Adequately wind down perhaps some of the spending so that the margins aren't as compressed So when it comes to our shurn in the in the third quarter that was expected We took a deliberate decision in a second quarter to do price adjustment in certain consumer segments And we knew that we would have a shurn bubble so so that that was sort of an expected and very deliberate decision We took and it was important for us to also do that because our industry has not done price adjustments on wireless ever So this was the time to do it we did it for certain segments So that will ease over over time So I think that's a very important message and when it comes to the the the cap ex we have a clear plan We will come back of course with exact guidance for 23 but we're very clear plan how we are on the peak level of spending right now and then it will come down as we are Spending as fast as we can and deploying the C band Spectrum that we bought a year ago All right, the Supreme Court has rejected a request made to block the Biden administration's program for student debt relief As has a district court yellow finances legal correspondent Lexus Keenan has the latest Lexus Hi, Brian. Yes, so two courts yesterday rejecting The request for emergency relief that would cancel the Implementation of Biden's student loan forgiveness plan now one was the supreme court Request showed up there from a group of Wisconsin taxpayers Associate Justice Amy Coney Barrett she denied that request not even taking up the matter on the merits at all The other one came from a district court in Missouri The Missouri case was brought by six Republican led states They argued that Biden you served Congress's authority to spend the taxpayers money They also said that the relief plan jeopardizes the state's tax revenues particularly Revenue from the state run loan servicers that a lot of different states have across the country the Wisconsin case for its Taxpayers it was brought by Brown County taxpayers Near Green Bay, Wisconsin.

3877," Alright, our line earnings coming in hot, the theme park space may be worth another little bit of fine investors more on this straight ahead. Theme parks have had a rocky year as they look to bounce back from the lows of COVID-19 and our next guest says estimate need to come down to a better reflect the challenges ahead. City Research Director James Hartman joins us now James good to see you again right in the middle of a fright fest for six flags and it's been a very frightful year for that company they have really been struggling how do you think this quarter shaped up? Yeah I mean and you're right it has been a tough year for these guys they had a new strategy where they're essentially aiming to have fewer customers right but the strategy that we know that's not a good strategy here we don't want to let you in but take less business we're okay with that. That's right is that we'll we dove the Jeremy Wires strategy. You were more more profits better service that may have made more sense come into this year it's been I think it's been a tough sell as some of these macro pressures have mounted and so to answer your question I do think it's a tough third it was a tough third quarter for these guys I think estimates probably are too high I think attendance if anything it was pretty pretty bad in the second quarter anything there's a good chance that I got worse here in 3Q James for the lay person following this six-flets story and the CEO made some just bizarre comments on that last earnings call but push out its side what is wrong with six flags is it the the stands where they get the food are the rides not cool enough is it a combination of all that or is it just too expensive to go to these parks? Yeah I think it's a it's a combination of all of those things relative to other theme parks six flags has historically not been able to get the pricing that that those others have in that they would hope to particularly since they cater to you know some of the the biggest cities in the US with some of the best disposable income it tends to be a lot more teenager oriented as opposed to family oriented and I think that plays a role in terms of the pricing that they're able to get you know there's an argument to be made that they haven't invested enough in their parks over the years and that has also led to this sort of lower quality experience at least that being the perception and so",https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XTJjX90THDQ,61,2022-10-21 18:19:31
3878," over the years and that has also led to this sort of lower quality experience, at least that being the perception. And so I think that's all what predated this new concept that they ultimately had. They didn't put it this way, but that they fired their customers in a lot of ways. And you got to be real careful with that, suffice it to say. That's bad news for the Dippin' Dot Barometer, James. When we think about some of the other major theme parks that are out there, I mean, what is going to be vastly different between this year and next year? This was supposed to be that travel-demand boom year, that revenge-experience-show-economy year. If not this year, then what does that shape up for next year for the theme parks? Yeah, it's such a great point. I mean, we were believers that there was this pent-up demand as we exited the pandemic for exactly these types of experiences. Unfortunately, there isn't a whole lot of daylight between the post-pandemic phase or story and the pre-recession or recession story. And I think that's those two things ultimately pointed up against each other here in the summer of 22. I've got numbers lower for next year. We have seen pretty consistently over the course of the summer slowing demand trends for the theme parks. Now, the good news is I do think that these companies, these businesses tend to hold in better than some of the other discretionary names that I follow. And so they're going to feel it. I think attendance is likely to be down. Sales are likely to be down. But they generally hold in pretty well. And the reason for that is they tend to be trained down beneficiaries. As opposed, once travel turns over, if in fact it does, these tend to be cheaper alternatives than going to Orlando or Mexico or Europe. James, what you often see in a lot of these theme park parking lots is when a bigos family take these when a bigos and they go to the theme parks. Now, that is the stock you cover. This company just reported earnings. Take us through their inventory situation. Are they able to get the semiconductors and the supplies they need to get these trucks or these mobile homes out of the showrooms and into the front porches or the dryways of customers? Yeah, I mean, so that was the narrative for so much of 2021 in the early part of 2022. But they get the supply out there because there was very much to believe that true demand was better than these reported retail numbers. IE, if you had more product, you could sell more product. I think that narrative has changed over the past three months and, and oh, by the way, I don't think it's just for RVs. I think the ability to stock showroom floors has improved dramatically. And if you want to get one of these, you can get one of these right now. I think that the, it's a double head sword now, though. The concern is that these manufacturers will pump up the channel too much with some of these inventories. And that would ultimately turn make a bad situation worse as we think about a potential recession. And again, it's not just RVs. I think this whole debate as to are we are aren't we heading towards a recession? In what I cover, right, big ticket discretionary. In a lot of ways, it feels like we're there or, or vastly quickly approaching that place. It does seem like over the past few months, supply has improved, but the demand has not. All right. Well, for those of us brining myself included who are priced out of the housing market, the RVs are looking to be good. I'm Neil Baby. Yeah. City Research Director James Hardman, thanks for taking the time here today. Have a great weekend. Thanks, guys. Guys, coming up, we're going to do a roundup of the top things that we've heard this week from some key business leaders, from everything from our all market summit to kick off the week through to, yeah, today's conversations with some big CEOs as well. It's next. All right, bro.",https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XTJjX90THDQ,62,2022-10-21 18:23:59
3879," 🎵 to Yahoo Finance, everyone. It was an energizer-bundet type of week here for us here on the morning show as we spoke with a numerous amount of executives, including CEOs from Bank of America. We had Proctor and Gamble, Target, or Tarje, and Hilton all seeming to be optimistic surrounding recession chances, and the current state of the consumer. Here's what they had to say. They have pushed that projection for recession out a little bit into 23, but their core belief it's a mild recession. So purely from a consumer demand and willingness to spend the standpoint, we wouldn't predict a recession. The hope is, it allows the Fed, at some point, over the next six or 12 months, to sort of stabilize, having done their job with inflation more in control, and allow the economy to get its footing again and start a process of re-acceleration. They continue to say they want to celebrate the holidays, and we know they're out on the streets of New York, they're in restaurants, they're in our stores. So right now, we're seeing a stable environment. So there was a ton to really be extrapolated from those conversations, whether it was during our all market summit to kick off the week, or even later on as we move through early season, but particularly one of the threads was where the Fed policy is going to continue to actually impact the consumer in this near term, and what that actually does for the economy to change the demand profile or the demand cycle that we find ourselves in as relates to these companies' financial performance. Yeah, we talked about it earlier, Brad. I think we got a taste to that in that really major profit warming for a whirlpool. Again, those are big ticket purchases that you put on credit cards, heard it from Gen. Rack, earlier in the week, but what is interesting, I'll just call up Target as well, Brian Cornell, Chairman and CEO, telling us he's a stable business, but how stable is it next year? Let's say there's a Target store next to Snap headquarters or where Snap employees work. They just missed their quarter because of pressure on online spending because the economy is slowing down. That person now lost their job. Are they still spending at the same rate after this holiday season at Target that they were this year unclear, which speaks to the bigger thing. This is a very challenging earning season. It is really hard to truly understand what is going on inside corporate America. It's a hard earning season, but at the same time for us and the conversations, I mean, the questions that we're asking are definitely trying to just get a different sense of where there actually is some of that vulnerability, how they're managing through that, and then on the other side of that, what kind of company is emerging on the other side of that economic downturn or macroeconomic challenge that continues to be cited here?

3880," or economic challenge that continues to be cited here. More big convos to come next week. Well, that is it for myself and Brad. Coming up, the Kiko Fujita will speak with two analysts about the state of the semiconductor sector. You won't want to miss it. Have a great weekend. Thanks for your time. Welcome to Yahoo Finance Live. And happy Friday to all of you. It's 11 am here in New York City. I'm a Kiko Fujita. Here's what I'm watching at this hour. Snap, crackle, flop. Shares of the social media company plummet. As declining ad revenue and widening losses way on investors, we're going to discuss the numbers and implications for wider tech. Musk under scrutiny. The Biden administration reportedly considers national security reviews for the Tesla CEO as questions swirl around foreign investors involved with the Twitter buyout. And chip disruption. New US tech controls threatened to shake up the global semiconductor industry. As companies scrambled to be in compliance, we've got a paddle standing by for you to discuss the implications. First though, let's check in on the market action. We are 90 minutes into the trading day, of course. Trying to round out the week here on a positive note. We've got the Dow up 151 points. The S&P 500 up 9. The Nasdaq the only one in the red. The yield on the 10 year treasury note, one to really note today climbing to a level we have not seen in 14 years. We also saw a big jump in the 30 year yield. But we've seen a bit of a pull back off the highs in part because of some of the comments that we have gotten from Fed officials. There's that Wall Street Journal report that came out that pointed to potential concerns within our among Fed officials about over tightening and how aggressively they're moving. And that could be partly what we're doing.",https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XTJjX90THDQ,64,2022-10-21 18:32:45
3881," That came out that pointed to potential concerns within our MungFed officials about over tightening and how aggressively they're moving. And that could be probably what we're seeing the levels right now but the 10-year yield still at 4.24%. Moving on to our top story of the hour. It is all about snap and take a look at where shares are trading right now down more than 30% following its mis-on-revenue estimates for the third quarter. The social media company citing continued deceleration of revenue growth as a result of ongoing challenges that include platform policy changes, macroeconomic headwinds, and increased competition. Joining us now for a snapshot of the path ahead for staff. We've got Jason Halstein, up in Heimer Managing Director and Head of Internet Research. Jason, you know, this certainly was not a great quarter but this is a steep fall for this company. Shares are down more than 30%. How much of this do you think is overdone? Look, I think the challenges and investors are kind of asking themselves, do they want to support this company longer term? I think one of the questions we get from investors is, you know, will they ever put ads in messaging? I think it's pretty well known. We all know we use all of us use messaging products, right? And we generally don't see ads in messaging products. And so, and a lot of this company's use case is at the messaging tool, right? When they do then try to take that activity and get you to spend time using spotlight and using discover, but they're also seeing a ton of competition there from TikTok and others. And so, when you couple together, the 5% decline in US time spent with kind of revenue that was below expectations, and kind of monthly trend that investors are having a really hard time to salary, you know, I think you're having investors trying to decide, do they want to underwrite the stock longer, the company longer term? Jason, there are two key issues that have really persisted from quarter to quarter this year. One is, of course, the slowdown that we've seen in ad spending to the point you just made. Also, the other one is about this company being able to navigate these changes that have taken part as a result of the privacy guardrails that are now in place through Apple's iOS. I mean, these are not new problems that came up during this quarter. And I wonder if you think we've taken away anything more based on that earnings call yesterday about how much worse things are about to get particularly for Snap? Yeah, we think kind of the Apple privacy is a good excuse but not the main reason. That really only affects, for the most part, app downloads or advertisers trying to drop downloads. The bulk of Snapchats advertising is brand advertising. And that's what's been bouncing around kind of month among in kind of an unpredictable way. And they're telling you that they expect their brand advertising to slow as they move through the quarter, right? And so that is the issue. And then they're also telling you that effectively competition is still a threat to time spent. And so this quarter, you saw impressions slowed. Not a ton, they were up 8% item of ads sold versus 9% less quarter. But then price spread was down 3% versus up 4% in the second quarter. And they're kind of telling you that they think those metrics will slow, right? It's basically flat revenue growth in the back half. And it's not the fourth quarter. And it's not all currency. currency was about two points of headwind. So there's definitely, I'd say more companies specific factors. And obviously we'll know more next week when Alphabet and Meta report, but we don't expect kind of as bad of an outlook from Meta because they will be comparing against what was a challenging period last year. Well, and let's pick up on that point because when you look at the other social media stocks, they are falling today in tandem with Snap, not to the levels that we're seeing in terms of declines in the Snap Stock. But Alphabet, you mentioned Meta, Pinterest, another one that's been coming down as well. We've learned in the last quarter that this isn't Snap isn't always a bell weather, partly because these other names are a little more diversified. I mean, what's your expectation when you look at some of these names on the screen? Who's best position?",https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XTJjX90THDQ,65,2022-10-21 18:36:49
3882," This isn't snap isn't always a bell weather partly because these other names are a little more diversified I mean what's your expectation when you look at some of these names on the screen? Who's best position to write out the macro headwinds? Yeah, I mean to your point, you know, we do think that the whole sector is getting penalized Obviously not not as bad as a snap is but kind of down, you know four or five six percent depending on the company We actually do like meta the past right now for playing digital advertising within large cap in front of the quarter Mostly because they already took their loans a year ago, right? So they were the most impacted by Apple's privacy changes They called out at 10 percentage point kind of impact to them They also benefited the most during the pandemic from the poll forward in e-commerce Spending any commerce advertising and that has unwound as we As the economy is reopened you look at the monthly data on retail sales e-commerce isn't growing any faster than overall retail sales So that's kind of telling you that they're still kind of like a hangover there And so we think as that starts to obey and you've easier calms We think the setup is is pretty good for meta and then the last thing is we are waiting for Apple to kind of update It's called SCAD network 4.0. It's the next Technology tool to improve Tracking of ads and and performance data and we think meta is the best position company to take advantage of that for their advertiser So we are optimistic on meta in front of the quarter Okay, well we're watching for those numbers when they come out next week Jason health scene up and Hymer managing director and head of internet Research appreciate the time Thank you Well, let's not turn to the broader markets. We've got fed officials now moving forward Towards another rate hike of point 75 percentage points at the November meeting We've got Yahoo Finance as Jared liqueur is always on top of this and yield certainly been the focus of the week But yet again today we're talking about a level we haven't seen in 14 years Yes, and let's go to the Wi-Fi interactive. I'm plotting the US dollar index We're gonna circle around to currencies in a second because what we're talking about in terms of bonds very closely link with Currencies and there are spillover effects into equities everything is linked here So here's a US dollar index appreciated 17% versus this basket of currencies Mainly weighted towards a euro, but very illustrative of what's been going on here Here's a 10-year Tino yield it looks very similar to that US dollar chart In fact, they're very correlated hitting 4.22 percent now it has backed off a little bit higher number than that But as you said at Keiko most of these bond yields we have not seen since 2007 through 2011 I can put you I can show the five year That's down nine basis points a 30 year that is up base eight basis points So we have a lot that's happening with the yield curve right now and essentially it has been flattening And let me just point you I'm gonna put up the US dollar one more time here And I have some comments from Norte that I want to go over because we are caught in an effects Loop here and this has to do with respect This has to do with the Bank of Japan now Norte is taking a look at this countries They're saying do not have an endless amount of US dollars at disposal to sell meaning that effects intervention will fail when the US dollar Coffers run dry this is from the perspective of these central bankers over in Japan They have amassed a war chest of US dollars. They also hold 1.2 trillion dollars in US treasuries very important here So Norte going on to say more over effects intervention involves selling US treasuries That's to get US dollars which adds upward pressure on US rates That's because rates are inverse to bond prices stick with me one more second here This leads to a stronger US dollar and isolation this affects Intervention intervention US US dollar doom loop doom loop illustrated here I'll show you the picture in a second could lead to dollar overshooting especially when central banks are Enforcing the loop so here we go weaker yen sales of US treasuries higher US dollar rates weaker yen and the cycle Continues and that's what we've been seeing here And this the spillover effects as I mentioned with respect to equities These leveraging actions right here. We're not going to see a bit on equities until all of this is done and the central bankers Have been very flat-footed about the response so far. Yeah the BOJ in even tougher position given the data We got today right eight year high inflation not at the level that we're seeing in the US But still they've got a very dovish policy in place. They've got the yen continuing to weaken against the job",https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XTJjX90THDQ,66,2022-10-21 18:41:06
3883," should give them the data we got today, right? Eight-year high inflation, not at the level that we're seeing in the US, but still, they've got a very dovish policy in place. They've got the Yen continuing to weaken against the dollar and then now that they're looking at it. We didn't get to it, but the Yen very volatile today, maybe an intervention that we don't know about going on right now. Okay, something to watch. Thanks so much for that, Jared. Well, at the time now for our trending ticker and we're seeing weaker than expected subscriber numbers, weighing on shares of Verizon. That stock is down more than 6%. And hitting a 52 week low today, the largest wireless carrier added just 8,000 monthly subscribers in the most recent quarter as competitors offered aggressive promotions to take away market share. That prompted Verizon to offer its own discounts and introduce low-cost mobile phone service and internet plans. There's what CEO Hans Besberg had to say on customer churn this morning. We took a deliberate decision in a second quarter to do price adjustment in certain consumer segments. And we knew that we would have a show on Bob Bell. So that was sort of an expected and very deliberate decision we took. And it was important for us to also do that because our industry has not done price adjustments on wireless ever. So this was the time to do it. We did it for certain segments. So that will ease over over time. So I think that's a very important message. broadband proved to be a bright spot for the quarter for Verizon. The company added another 343,000 wireless home internet customers in the quarter. Well, coming up, the result season stealing the headlines this week, but investors keeping a very close watch on the bond market as a 10-year treasury yield hits levels we haven't seen in 14 years. We're going to talk to market strategy on the other side. If you're interested in software and technology. Such a kal Kai bill has been covered not being sent on by the It's not quite finished raising its target rate as inflation remains stubborn leaned high. Meanwhile, a fresh report in the Wall Street Journal this morning suggests some federal officials are signaling unease with",https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XTJjX90THDQ,67,2022-10-21 18:45:53
3884," It's not quite finished raising its target rate as inflation remains stubbornly high. Meanwhile, a fresh report in the Wall Street Journal this morning suggests some fed officials are signaling unease with big rate rises. So is this the first sign of the long-awaited pivot? Joining us to discuss is Emily Roland, co-chief investments for just a John Hancock investment management. Emily, I'd be curious to get your thoughts on this report that came out from the journal today about the debate that's happening. Whether you, in fact, think that the data that we have gotten, the latest data points to the need for at least a pause in the hikes. Yeah, the volatility in the rate market today has been nothing short of astonishing. We woke up to this continued backup and interest rates that has been playing out over the last few days. And then this journal article comes out suggesting that potentially the Fed is going to be leaning towards 50 basis points in December, instead of 75, at least discussing that at the November Fed meeting here. So, you know, we think that it's right to consider a pause. And you even heard, Lail Brainerd earlier about a week ago talking about the fact that, you know, maybe we are a pause is potentially warranted here as some of the monetary policy decisions start to really work their way into the economy. And it's important to recognize that Fed policy works the long and variable lag. The Fed just started tightening in March of this year and they've implemented the most aggressive amount of tightening that we've seen in the generation in a really, really short amount of time. We want to watch to see how that actually filters into the economy before the Fed just continues down this path of aggressive tightening. How much of that have we actually seen filter through the economy based on what you've seen? Well, we look at the leading economic indicators and we just saw another negative readings. We've had three negative readings in a row here for the leading indicators. And that's the just that we are in a significantly decelerating economic growth climate. The challenge is that the Fed uses by nature of their mandates lagging economic data. So they're looking at the fact that the unemployment rate is at 3.5 percent near a 50 percent lower low, they're looking at CPI data, which just continues to be. And they're big component of that, of course, is the housing market shelter, which tends to be a very sticky component of inflation. It takes time to show up in the data. And the Fed is marching down this path of dampening inflation, really at any cost, but that's the key question at what cost. And they're looking like they're going to keep going until something breaks. I mean, the other big challenge, of course, comes down to messaging. And that's been a bit tricky when you think about how things played out over the summer. You know, now we know that the Fed officials didn't feel like the markets were simply getting the message. We got that very strong message at Jackson Hole. Since then, it's sort of been we're going to continue to hike rates until inflation comes down. How do you think they told the line here? If in fact there is some kind of pause to at least message to the markets, this doesn't mean a pivot. This is just a slowdown. It's such a great question because the messaging and the forward guidance is so critical. And one of the things we learned from this journal article this morning was that the Fed wants to be careful in avoiding a big upside move in markets based on this perceived Fed pivot. So I think if they do decide to go with 50 in December, it's going to be well telegraphed whether it's through the Wall Street Journal or some other mechanism, because you know, we saw that incredible rallying soft to play it out from mid-June to mid-August for your point there. And it was based on this false hope that the Fed was going to reverse course in quick fashion. And clearly that's not the case. And they've made it quite clear that they're going to keep the gloves off in the fight against inflation until the fight is done. Bottom line, Emily, as we look ahead to the next few months, and what does that mean from an investment standpoint? Is this change at all in terms of your thesis on where things are headed? Or, you know, is this also a time to maybe pause and wait to see where the economic debt all leads? Yeah, I mean, investors are feeling really steestic right now. Is this volatility picked up and we're suggesting...",https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XTJjX90THDQ,68,2022-10-21 18:49:45
3885," to see where the economic debt elites. Yeah, I mean, investors are feeling really specific right now is this volatility picked up and we're suggesting to them that they should focus on the horizon, which to us really means looking at the income on high quality bonds as something that's pretty competitive versus the other alternatives out there. You know, we used to talk about China. There's no alternative for so low. There was no other alternative, but to buy stocks and we would argue today that there is no alternative to bond. Yes, price pressures are there, but the fact that you can get five six percent income on high quality bonds right now, we think it's awfully competitive. You know, you look at the dividend yield on the S&T 500, which is less than 2%. So we want to move up the capital structure. We want to get paid income as we wait out this more and we want to get paid. So I'm going to take aways there. Emily Roland, Co-Chief Investment Stragist, John Hancock Investment Management. Good to talk to you today. Okay. There's even more trouble for Elon Musk ahead. The US government reportedly considering whether it should review Musk's newfound empire. That includes his ongoing deal for social media site Twitter and SpaceX's satellite network. Let's bring in Yahoo Finance, Alexis Keenan, who's tracking this. Alexis, let's start with what's happening with Twitter because this is an interesting one given that the concern is really about who's part of this investment group for Twitter that there are foreign players in here that could potentially signal a conflict. Right. So what Bloomberg is reporting is that US officials in the Abadan administration are concerned about the Twitter deal to the extent that the Saudi Arabian prince Al-Wali Ben-Talal, as well as Binance, which has a Chinese founder and has backing from Cuttersauver and Wealth Fund. So that's where they're saying that according to sources, there are maybe some concerns. Now, they also go on to say that it's not really clear which agency would originate this kind of inquiry. But one of the usual suspects is CIFIAS. That's the committee on foreign investment in the United States. That committee in 2018 was given a lot of expanded authority to conduct these types of threat assessments over possible security concerns that arise from foreign investment in US companies. And they even got expanded authority to look at those multinational deals that result in less than foreign control, which was the former case for the agency, especially they got some authority to look at investments that involve companies that are engaged in technology and personal data. Of course, the Twitter deal would qualify, I would think, perhaps under that standard. Now, the idea that the security review of a security review at all based on national concern, national security concerns, it's been raised previously with respect to Tesla, with respect to SpaceX's Starlink satellite network. But it's the first time we're hearing about it raised with respect to the Twitter deal. That's certainly sparking a lot of questions about whether the government could end up derailing this deal. And certainly part of that contract for the merger between the two companies does require that it surpass any regulatory and government review. So that's getting a lot of talk here. Elon Musk already tweeting that in response to this Bloomberg piece saying commenting on a Twitter post that said it would be hilarious if the government ended being the one to derail this tie up between Twitter and Musk's companies that he's formed in order to effectuate this merger. Really quickly, Alexis, you know, any of us who have followed these syphias reviews in the past know that this is never a quick turnaround. And we are talking months and months and months of review. If in fact that's triggered, what does that mean for the deal? Well, Akiko, syphias can take a look at transactions that are already happened. So they can go back and try to get some agreements from companies that have already done the deal. So it doesn't necessarily stop the deal from going forward. But the government could also intervene and say we would let us get out of the contract.",https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XTJjX90THDQ,69,2022-10-21 18:54:06
3886," agreements from companies that have already done the deal. So it doesn't necessarily stop the deal from going forward, but the government could also intervene and say we would like to have some things ironed out before it does commence. So we'll certainly be watching the deadline that the court has put on the deal, which is October 28th next Friday, one week from today. But look, yes, it could go on for a very long time, these types of inquiries, but it doesn't mean that it just stops the deal and it's tracks. Okay, thanks getting a little more complicated there. Alexis Keenan, thanks so much for that. Well, coming up, upscale electricity. If you like trucks and want something like a Hummer, then not exactly a Hummerable GMC might have the thing for you. Yahoo! Finances, pros, supermanians, going to have a story for us on the other side. The competition in the EV space is revving up. General Motors unveiled its latest electric truck yesterday, the 2024 GMC Sierra EV. It's now taking reservations for the $107,000 fully loaded version called the Sierra EV Denali Edition. Thankfully, we've got pros, supermanians, to break down all the details for us. That is a hefty price tag, but it's not the only truck on the market. That's an EV. How does it compare? Well, you know, it's, it's twin is basically this Silverado, the Chevy Silverado, which I find to have a design that's more adventure, lifestyle truck. Whereas if you look at the the new Sierra EV over here, it's more traditional truck like, looks like a work truck. I think it might appeal to a broader set of people. Power wise, it actually has more power than the top one, Silverado has around 750 horsepower, 400 miles of range in that top trim. So that's pretty competitive, but you did mention that price, $107,000, that top tier, it's very pricey, very high and very premium, I would say.",https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XTJjX90THDQ,70,2022-10-21 18:58:45
3887," of range in that top trim. So that's pretty competitive. But you did mention that price $107,000 for that top tier. It's very pricey, very high and very premium, I would say. But I did get a chance to speak to the chief engineer, Nicole Kratz, about lower trim levels that are actually going to compete against the Ford Lightning Pro. Here's what you'd say. $50,000 model for the Sierra EV is an elevation. It's an elevation trim, so it's not a work truck in the standpoint of a $50,000 model. Welcome to Yahoo Finance Live on this Friday afternoon. I'm Sean Smith alongside Dave Briggs. Let's get you up to speed on the market action as we get ready to close out. What has been a rather volatile week here for the market? But looking at today's gains, you can see the Dow up 600 and 36 point to the amp. The S&P up just around 2% the Nasak also pushing higher up just around 1.8% some comments from a San Francisco Fed president, Mary Daley, taking as a bit dovish here for the market. She didn't say that she would like the Fed to be able to quote step down on the pace of rate hikes going forward. That was enough to boost stocks here in afternoon trading. You can see the Nasak up just around 1.8% for the S&P over the past five days. You're looking at a gain of just over 4% with the S&P on track for its best week that we've seen since June. Take a look at the Russell 2000, the small cap index also pushing to the upside for the week up just over 3%. Let's take a look at what's going on in the bond market. You're looking at the 10 year yield putting back just a bit off around two basis points to 421, the 30 year here. It's just a bit higher up just around 8 basis points. When you take a look at some of the sector action that we're seeing. Let's first take a look at it on an intraday basis. So we're looking at materials, energy, financials, leading the way all 11 of the S&P sectors moving to the upside on the 5-day basis. So so far this week, energy by far the winner up just around 8% technology, not too far behind. You're looking at healthcare bringing up the rear up just around 1.8%. So really broad based gains today and buying that we saw not only today, but really what we've seen over the last five trading days. Maybe a misinterpretation of Mary Daly's comment. I think it was. I think they're searching for anything. I look we've had brutal Fridays quite frankly. We're going to turn it around. We'll take this one. Thank you Sean. Alright, let's get you up to speed now on the snap crash. The social media stock plummeting 30% following.",https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XTJjX90THDQ,71,2022-10-21 19:02:55
3888," Brutal Fridays, quite frankly. We have. We're going to turn things around. We'll take this one. Thank you, Sean. All right. Let's get you up to speed now on the snap crash. The social media stock plummeting 30% following a disappointing Q3 earnings report. Snapchat revenue grew just 6%. That's the smallest since the 2017 IPO. And losses surged 400% to $360 million in Part 2. $255 million restructuring charge. If you'll remember, snap announced it would cut 20% of its staff in August. It's roughly 6,000 employees. Jeffers analysts Brent Thale telling Yahoo Finance this morning they may have to go deeper than that. Snap shares now down 83%. This year, other social media stocks feeling the pain is well today metafelling less than 2% Pinterest down 7%. And Twitter also saw more than 4% decline largely on some other concerns, which we will address later in the program. But the ad environment's certainly not helping here. Over now to Jared Bickery is going to get us up to speed on the currency market. Jared, what do we see? Yes. Well, currencies are tied to bonds. They're tied to everything else. So let's take a look. I want to start with the Dow here. You mentioned some of the negative action that we've had on Fridays. Guess what? Not today. Like you said, traders are seizing on those very, very, very slightly dovish comments by Mary Daly. But also a Yen intervention that we got according to the NEC, the Bank of Japan, Interved in the currency market. So let me just go to the Yen here and let's see if I can find this. There we go. That's versus the UN. Here's the US dollar versus the Japanese yen. Now we had broken above the key 150 level. This is a level that has not been breached since 1990. And shortly after that happened earlier this morning, I was sitting with the Kiko Fijita. At the desk here, there was a huge reversal. Let me just show you how that looked. There was this big downleg, a little bit of a reversal there. And we got considerably lower. Now, if you take a look at a six months chart, you can see, well, this happened before. And what happened after that? A couple of weeks later, back to New Hyes. The US dollar was back to New Hyes versus the Yen. All of this is to say that the central bankers for all of the talk, for all of the actions, they haven't really done anything just yet. It's a market's maybe getting ahead of themselves. So we'll have to see if anything comes of this. I've been tweeting about it today. I'm going to be writing about the intervention over the weekend. I just want to get back to the market action today. Shauna went over the sector action. Let's take a look at the Nasdaq. We have Amazon up 3% Microsoft. Microsoft hop 2% Apple up 2% looking at the five day view. Really about the mega cap. So we are looking at some decent gains this week. And I think traders are going to take that. All right, Chair. Thanks so much for that. Let's talk about the broader market moves, what we're seeing play out in the markets today. Really what we've seen over the last several months. And for that, we want to bring in a Thomas Petrophy. He's interactive brokers founder and chairman. Thomas, it's great to see you. So I think we're all trying to make sense of the gains that we're seeing today and comparing that to the losses that we've seen really since the start of the year. The S&P still off just around 21% year to date. What's your assessment of where we stand today? Well, it's very hard to understand these gains because I think optimism is just too strong here because you know that the Fed has to has to rain in inflation. And and they are very far from having done that. So they still have a long way to go and those higher interest rates are certainly going to be earnings in the first, second, and third. And third quarter of next year and estimates will have to come down accordingly. And if you put 15 multiple unto those adjusted earnings, I don't really see the market much above 3000 on the S&P. So how much further do you think the markets have to fall Thomas? I think that it's going to get close to 3000. So that's 10 to 20% lower from here. Thomas, what do you make of the moves that the Fed has made so far because there's lots of debate about how far the Fed has gone if there is this risk that the Fed is going to overshoot? Do you think they've been too aggressive up to this point? I don't think they have been too aggressive. Maybe that would be aggressive in the future.",https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XTJjX90THDQ,72,2022-10-21 19:07:13
3889," Shoo, do you think they've been too aggressive up to this point? I don't think they have been too aggressive. Maybe they'll be aggressive in the future, but so far, look, the economy really hasn't slowed down much as a result of these rate increases and they really want to dampen down retail consumer demand. And once they succeed in doing that, then inflation will slow down, but that will show up in the sales figures for the big tech companies and most consumer goods companies. So, the Fed president, Mary Daly, San Francisco, really rallied the markets. How dovish did you hear these comments? It's time to start talking about stepping down. The time has now to start planning for stepping down. I think that is the wrong message. I think the Fed has to send the message that we're going to stamp out in place no matter what. And if they are in a better position, if they can scare the market into easing up on spending rather than having to force them to ease up on it. So, I don't think the Fed is very happy right now. And Thomas, and with all of that in mind, the fact that you're saying that the S&P could fall to 3,000, I'm curious what you're seeing from your customers, from the retail investor perspective. What are they doing at a time when there's so much uncertainty in the market? So, our core customers who are basically professional traders who work on the trading desks of many of the large investment banks around the world. And they hedge the report fully early on this year. And as the market has been pulling, they just recently started to cover those hedges very slowly. Unfortunately, the retail investors got really hurt and they are not the sidelines. Now, as far as the market going from here, it's generally accepted by the professional traders. The market, as I said, has another 10 to 20% to go down, but it is impossible to pick a button. And so, they have to pick a range of prices at which they gradually get back into the market using like interactive group brokers, as all kinds of algorithms that you can set up to buy, scale down, and falling price, or sales scale up in a range of pricing, pricing prices. So, yeah, it's So, based on the volume of TD Ameritrade and Charles Swab, the Wall Street Journal headline reads, time for day traders to go back to their day jobs. Overall, do you agree without assessment? And when do you think they come back? Well, I agree with the assessment day traders. Yes, they trade their, I mean, look, day traders don't do better or worse in an upmarket versus in a downmarket. So, day traders are just there to try to get the swing of things. And you know, the ones that cannot make a living, of course, they have to go back to their day jobs. But, you know, much of these day trading is now migrated over to the options markets where you can easily, you know, set up option spreads like buying one strike selling another where your risk and profit is limited. But you can take advantage of shorter moves without having to take too much of a risk. So, I think that the conventional day traders has moved from the stock market to the option market. And Thomas, as I take a look at your most recent earnings report, obviously, a",https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XTJjX90THDQ,73,2022-10-21 19:11:24
3890," the conventional data has moved from the stock market to the option market. And Thomas, as they take a look at your most recent earnings report, obviously a beat there. The street rewarded the stock. We saw some appetite for the stock as a result of those earnings. Just what's your assessment of your business at this point during the current quarter? And what does it look like as we look ahead to 2023? So, our business looks pretty good because we have more and more larger professional customers, like hedge funds coming onto our platform. And that is very helpful. So, we have spent several decades automating everything in the business so we can offer our services very, very inexpensively. And so we're finally getting the benefit of it because people are recognizing that IBKR is the platform to go to. All right, we'll have to leave it there. Interactive brokers, founder, Thomas Petrifi, good to see you, sir. Thank you. Enjoy the weekend. Just getting started here on Yahoo! Finance live, coming up Elon Musk reportedly in the Biden administration's crosshairs, why a security review could jeopardize some of Elon's biggest investments. And it would come to cracking down on China President Biden's outtrumping trouble. We'll tell you how.

3891," I'll let's check the markets as we wrap up the week. It's a free-fry Friday, which is why they're rallying so much. Obviously, up more than 600 points on the Dow, the S&P up nearly 2% and the NASDAQ also up about 2% a strong Friday to wrap up this week. Let's talk about it with young you, mob, BMO, wealth management, US chief strategist, chief investment strategist, good to see us sir. So let's discuss this rally to end the week. Largely, we perceive on the perception that Mary Daly, San Francisco, Fed President's comments were dovish. What do you make of the rally? Well, it's welcome, certainly. And I think there are a lot of work participants that have had a lot of challenging days. And so a day like today is certainly a good relief. But if we look at more toward the median picture, we still have, as your previous guests said, a lot of inflation pressures. The Fed still has a lot of work to do and interest rates are still rising. So we're not putting all that much stock into this one day, but it's certainly welcome and we'll take it. Well, young you, what do you make then of the next couple of weeks, the next couple of months in terms of the fact that the Fed's going to stay more aggressive? The 75-base point hike seems like a short thing at this point at the next meeting. Is that going to trigger a sell off? I think the 75-base point is pretty much baked in and the big discussion now is on December meeting, whether it'll be 50 or 75-base point. But I think if we take a step back, the market's in a bit of a catch-22, because if we want earnings to stay stable, given the cost that companies are facing now, both wage pressures, other input costs as well, for them to pass those costs on is what's necessary for earnings to stay stable and passing those costs on mean inflation. And that means the Fed has to continue to be aggressive. So we're in this push and pull dynamic here that's not easy to get out of until we get much better inflation readings. Interesting. A huge week of earnings next week, but in the rear view mirror, what's the lesson, the thematic lesson that you've seen in earnings so far in Q3? Well, expectations came down a lot. I think that's the important thing to remember. If you strip out the energy sector, they went from about a positive 6% back in July for this quarter's earnings all the way down to I think maybe 3%. And so once you lower the bar that much, it does set up an environment where it's a lot easier to beat earnings, a lot easier to have relief rallies. But the problem is, when we go into Q4, if we continue to get downgrades and lower the bar, we'll go through the same pattern that we went through leading up to this quarter, which is a challenging environment. So I think the themes are, there's some stability. Companies are finding ways to manage costs, to pass costs on. But as your previous guest said, there's still a lot of headwinds that remain. And this is going to play out over multiple quarters, not just a couple months. So you're going to get without a mind that what should investors be doing at this point? There are a few areas that we like. And that's a great question. We certainly do like a value as a long term play, even small cap value where valuations are starting to look more attractive. And we're actually looking more favorably on fixed income than we have in a very long time. I think it's gone from an environment where we had a few years ago, what was referred to as Tina, there is no alternative to what I'm calling now as Tara. There's a real alternative. And that real alternative is in the fixed income market. You can get 4% on a two year, about 4.5% on a two year treasury. You can get over 6% and triple B corporates. You can get it around 9%, almost 9% in high yield corporates. Those are starting to look pretty attractive here. So the fixed income market is going to be getting more and more attention as these interest rates continue to rise. John, you have the path narrowed to a soft landing? There is still path to a soft landing. You do want to emphasize that that's still our base case, a soft landing, but that path is narrowing. As interest rates continue to rise and rise sharply as a trajectory for inflation continues to look like it's going to be quite a sticky path ahead. And as global factors and geopolitical factors continue to present problems, that path is starting to narrow.",https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XTJjX90THDQ,75,2022-10-21 19:20:10
3892," to look like it's going to be quite a sticky path ahead. And as global factors and geopolitical factors continue to present problems, that path is starting to narrow. But on the positive side, what you want to reiterate, the job market is very strong. Consumer spending should have a floor under it given the strength of the job market. And so there is a path ahead that can lead to a soft landing. But it becomes challenged as interest rates continue to rise. Young, we were talking to Mark Zandee yesterday about when he expects to see inflation significantly cool. And you told us that he expected to be cut in half in about six months. Do you agree with that? I think that's a reasonable estimate. I guess it depends on which measure you're looking at, headline or core. But I don't think the challenge is getting from, say, 6%, 7% inflation down to 3%, 3%, 1,5% inflation. That's not the challenge. I think that's reasonably achievable. I think the challenge that the Fed's going to have is getting from 3%, 3%, 1,5% down to 2%. And that last mile of inflation is really going to be a sticking point because the tightness of the labor market and the other inflation and pressures, supply chain pressures, ensuring you name it, I think that environment speaks to a situation where getting down to 2% is very difficult. So if the Fed sticks to that target, I think there's going to be a considerable amount more work to do. But yeah, being halved in six months seems reasonable. And then of course, the debate out there is whether or not even has to get to 2% in order for the Fed to think that the job is complete. Well, young Yuma, always great, Tavi. Thanks so much. Have a good weekend. Thank you, Sean. Thanks, Dave. Coming up, Toyota issuing a new warning over the chip shortage. We have the details.

3893," Apple is opening doors to how your phone can be used to get in your home. Literally, the tech giant has teamed up with level on a door lock that uses Apple Home Key. You just tap your iPhone or Apple Watch against the lock to lock or unlock it. You can also text keys to people that you want to let into your home when you're not there. The $329 level lock plus is the first home key supported lock that's being sold in Apple stores. Apple shares currently trading up just over 2%. As fantastic as this is in terms of a luxury is a little bit terrifying. I know real estate agents already have something similar but just being able to the fear of someone you want to hack your phone and get in your home. Yeah. Paraportals will use your phone and it's not locked. Or if you lose your phone. Or if you lose your phone. Or if you lose your phone. Or if you lose your phone. Or if you lose your phone. Risk there. As someone who routinely locks theirself out and always forgets the keys, I am a big proponent of this and I think it sounds like a great idea. I do though. You don't have any fear. There are some fears out there. I think I need to learn a little bit more exactly about what happens if you do lose your phone. How long that key stays active if you were to send it to somebody so they could access your house. Whether it's like a 5 minute thing or a hour thing. It is. It is. I'm excited about it. All right. Moving on here. This semiconductor shortage further hand-bring the automakers. This time threatening Toyota's production targets. Yahoo! Finance is pro supermanian has been following the story for us and pro's more trouble here ahead for Toyota. This chip crisis is still lingering there, especially in Japan. Toyota having to cut its 9.7 million vehicle fiscal forecast for the fiscal year. They are evaluating a new target. They even told us what they are going to cut it to. They are also cutting their monthly outputs. They cut their October output to 800,000. Their November output to 800,000 as well. Cars affected like the Corolla, the RAV4, some Lexus models, even some Camrys. In popular name plates, popular brands across the board are being affected slightly here by their production cut. One note that 9.7 million was an all-time high for the brand. They are optimistic here. It will ask if they made it on 8.6. They are projecting a big 2022, but clearly not happening right now. All right. Prostick around. I want to talk a little bit about Elon. Even by Elon Musk's standards, it has been a very volatile 24 hours. Notably reports suggesting the Biden administration officials are discussing whether his deals should be subject to U.S. national security reviews, including Twitter and SpaceX's Starlink satellite network. According to Bloomberg, one way to do so would be through the law governing the Committee on Foreign Investment in the United States under the Treasury Department. Time is of the essence, Sean. The $44 billion deal for Twitter scheduled to close one week from today. So the timing is certainly interesting to say. The least. Yeah, the timing is certainly interesting. I think there's still a lot of unanswered questions. We talk about this every time just in terms of what from something as basic as what exactly Twitter is going to look like under Musk to how he's going to be able to secure this financing. We know so far. Prostick has had, he's raised about 15 billion in cash from selling part of his stake in Tesla. He's disclosing may filing about $7 billion of financing commitments. But then that does leave a large chunk of change that will still need to be raised in order for this deal to close, in order for him to follow through and buy it for $44 billion. So lots of unanswered questions that we're exactly that money is going to come from and how he's going to get that. Yeah, and that's sort of a more of an overhang in the stock of Tesla stock that he's selling. Those reports he might have to sell in there at $5 to $10 million in Tesla. I'm talking billion. I'm talking billion in Tesla shares to fund the Twitter deal. Coincidentally, this week they talked about buybacks on the earnings call, must say that the board has talked about, we debated it. The board generally thinks it makes sense for a buyback. This look at it do the whole kind of the board approval and the sort of all the kind of looking into how they do that. But it's kind of interesting that that buyback is sort of coinciding with how much money he needs to sort of raise. In the sense that the shareholders a little bit upset about the fact that the, you know, look at Tesla shares this year.",https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XTJjX90THDQ,77,2022-10-21 19:28:54
3894, I'm just saying that that that that that buyback is sort of coinciding with how much money he needs to sort of raise in the sense that people the shareholders a little bit upset about the fact that you know look at Tesla shares this year down you know 30% or so. So it's kind of like a problem not only for Twitter but also for Tesla and we just saw right now the journalist publishing a story about how this would be the biggest hung deal in in in debt because people the banks are kind of saddled with the debt and no one wants to buy it right now. So it's both Tesla shares and also debt kind of mixing together in a kind of a problematic buy here for Musk and Twitter. And you're talking about things mixing together. I mean Elon can't stay out of international issues and this is appears to be by design. I mean he is funding the Starlink Internet there in the Ukraine and I said at one point he wants the US government to do it but now he's going to continue to fund it at 20 million dollars a month. Just yesterday he retweeted a Russian national security security council expert Demetri Medvedev who had trolled Liz Truss so he can't help himself in staying out of these things and we haven't even gotten to the fact that there was a Washington Post report suggesting Elon would lay off 75% of Twitter employees Twitter is now telling their employees don't worry about that. That's not on the cards. You are now. Of course are going to worry about that and start freshening your resume. Yeah of course you are and we've already heard some analyst reaction. Janis is out with the notes saying that you can't cut your way to grow simply that that is not going to happen. He went on to say that if we do see must come in and cut in the numbers of that 75% range is going to be way too aggressive in their option doing that coming in and doing that right out of the gate and it's going to take years before this X app strategy takes hold. So if you go and cut 75% of the workforce I mean press that also lends a lot of questions to exactly why he thinks Twitter is going to be able to operate with a 75% reduction in the head count. There are around 7000 or so employees I believe at Twitter but that's significant of a cut. You've got to start scratching your head and say what the heck is Twitter going to potentially look like under months? Yeah I mean he's sort of taking the viewpoint of I'm from California Silicon Valley. I know to fix these things. We can do these better than how Twitter and current management is doing that right now. One thing I want to note about the syphia stuff is I'm going to key about this. You have the kind of like let's say China cracks down on free speech on Twitter and it lenses I don't want to do that. What about your next Chinese factory? Are they going to then step on him on Tesla in order to get him to act on Twitter? So these guys his hands everywhere but that's going to be a problem with regards to that sort of thing. National security concerns are obvious everywhere. Prost thank you good stuff. All right come out American Express Shares following despite reporting and earnings feet find out why when we come back. It's,https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XTJjX90THDQ,78,2022-10-21 19:33:18
3895," O. Slamifer This time, we're at Triple Play, three stats that we're watching here in the final 30 minutes of trading American Express, Netflix and Hawaiian Airlines, Jared Blyckery. Joining us on Zed to break all of this down my pick today is American Express. The stock actually taking a hit after the company raised its guidance, but that wasn't enough for the street. For the quarter though, the numbers were pretty strong sales, jumping at 24% to 13.5 billion. That's a new record for the company, CEO Steven Squarie, saying that the upbeat that he was still upbeat on the consumer, traveled, demand, exceeding expectations. Customers are not changing spending behavior at least for now. One thing I do want to note though, profits were up only 3% during the quarter, Jared. A lot of that has to do with the fact that American Express set aside more than $700 million in anticipation of a tougher macro economic environment. You're looking at a year to date. It shares off just around 15%. Compare that to the broader market. American Express is actually doing pretty well. So no signs yet, Jared, that the consumer is pulling back. You've got to question though what these numbers could potentially look like for the current quarter and then of course maybe for the early quarters of 2023. Yes. And American Express wasn't the only one that was increasing their loan loss reserves. Let's go to the Wi-Fi Interactive. I'm going to do a quick charting on this. We just showed a year to date. This is a one year and we are indeed by some critical levels here. But let me just put a 20 year chart. Oopsies, let's try to get that 20 year chart up one more time as I fat finger this tiny little tablet. All right, here we go. Now, see what we're looking at here. Everybody focus on that, Shana. There we go. All right, so we got a series of consolidations and breaks to new highs. But this is like a textbook upward trend here. It's just taking place over a very, very long period of time. And the current lows are actually the prior highs and so all is well in the universe here. Now let me shift attention to the NASDAQ 100 from the Dow. And this is over the last five days. Netflix here is the leader. If we sort by equal weight, you can see up in the upper left Netflix up 25% for the week. And here is a 20 year chart. Now this looks a little bit different. It had been in a nice uptrend and severely broke that. That's what happens with some of these growth stocks. But I just want to show you on a two year basis what's that's looking, what that is looking like. Now, we know the news this week, Netflix has somewhat improved their response to subscriber losses. And it seems like they have that on track right now. Lots of hope with their reengineering strategy also pushing to increase the revenues through that ad supported service and also to monetize the free loaders, aka me. So we'll see how that works out, guys. You are full of surprises today, brother. Oopsies, you haven't yet that. Netflix is really interesting. Obviously, the story moving forward is the ad tier and the password sharing. But in terms of the actual content, I think it's interesting because they have this sequel to Knives Outcoming. And I always forget the name is called Glass Onion. And while the theaters want them to do more of that, this is limited. One week, 600 theaters. And on the other hand, they've seen Dumber 10th most stream show of all time. It's not bad. So you can't help but wonder which direction they'll take in terms of content moving forward. I think the Dumber type model seems to favor them a lot more, find these franchises that put up these massive numbers. Yeah, it certainly does. And it also, I think it's just big as a question just in terms of what that subscriber growth is going to look...",https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XTJjX90THDQ,79,2022-10-21 19:37:41
3896," seems to favor them a lot more, find these franchises to put up these massive numbers. Yeah, it certainly does. And I think it's just big as a question, just in terms of what that subscriber growth is going to look like. Like, yes, we got a very, very strong number for the third quarter. I think the ad tier is going to boost numbers at least in the short term. But how many of those subscribers are going to potentially downgrade? I know you and I have talked about that many times. And how many new subscribers are really going to be able to pull in? Because, yes, it's cheaper than what the entry, what the base price is now. But it's still a lot. And people already are subscribed to so many different services that you've got a question where that saturation number is. It will be an interesting story ahead. My play is Hawaiian Airlines, who Amazon is now hired to fly the first Airbus cargo planes in the retail giant's air network. Hawaiian will fly at least 10 Airbus A330-300 converted freighters for Amazon starting in the fall of 2023. Now, the Airbus Jets will be the largest in Amazon's fleet. And we'll replace older aircraft. Amazon currently outsources to Atlas worldwide holdings, ATSG and Sun Country, which fly mainly Boeing jets. Under the agreement, Hawaiian is issuing words for Amazon to acquire up to 15% of its stock. Exercise will over the next nine years. Hawaiian will also hire pilots and additional mechanics as well. Hawaiian stock up more than 10% on this news. But still down, more than 18% year to date, Amazon's up also more than 3%. After a string of strong airlines earnings, Hawaiian will report on Tuesday. One interesting thing we've seen from Amazon, from American to Delta to United Jared is every CEO is talked about the new Norman travel, which is people combining business with pleasure travel, all three of them seeing it wildly. It should be interesting to see if that's a new norm or just a minor reflection of remote work. I really want to jump in on this bandwagon. So no to my superiors here, I am down to fly to wherever, as long as it is a coastal destination with good weather right now. And work. And work, yeah, yeah, work related obviously. Work. It's a great, I don't even know how to follow up with that. You're really throwing them out there. I like it a lot. But let's say I'd back to Hawaiian and what we could hear next week, because there was an interesting note out from Deutsche Bank on the heels of this announcement saying that Amazon's business will not only improve Hawaiians and revenue diversification, but it's also going to help alleviate the earnings volatility that we tend to see when it comes to Hawaiians business. So Deutsche Bank saying it's very positive. You mentioned the fact that they are negative year to date. We'll take a, I guess get a better look at those numbers next week. Great. As we head to break, let's take a look at the rally that we're seeing play out, accelerating into the close. You can see the down year, the highs of the day, up 757 points. S&P up nearly two and a half percent. The NASDAQ also hanging onto gains up just around a 2%. Not next, a TikTok under fire following a report on how the company wanted to use location data. We've got the details on that when we come back. $133 million.��",https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XTJjX90THDQ,80,2022-10-21 19:42:07
3897," Epic music The US-China trade war thought to have simmered a bit following the Trump administration's tariffs escalating to a whole new level the US ban on advanced chip exports. Senior columnist Rick Newman and presidential candidate in 2024 joining us now. No, Rick, you're not running? You've declared, right? Tax breaks for our news anchors. That's my whole platform. That's your platform. So, tell us about the escalation here. These are new rules that the Biden administration announced two weeks ago with almost no fanfare. If you remember back, everything about the Trump tariffs on China went through a megaphone where Trump was talking about it on Twitter, on all of his interviews and everybody had to figure out if he's really going to go through on this thread or not go all the distance. What Biden has done seems to be far more significant with far less fanfare. In the short version this, it's very complicated, is a whole new range of what are basically embargoes on advanced semiconductor sales to China and also any technology that China might be able to use to make its own advanced semiconductor. So one analyst described this as an intent to strangle with an intent to kill China's artificial intelligence industry. And this has everything to do not just with computers and technology, but it has a lot to do with surveillance, electric vehicles, and certainly with advanced weaponry. So the Biden administration is doing something here that really seems like it is going to put a stranglehold on part of China's economy and China is probably going to retaliate in some way. So, this is going to get messier. Just real quick, how do you think they might retaliate? Because we haven't heard much about that yet, Rick. No, they haven't. So some of the things they could do would be making life hard for US businesses operating in China. There are many American businesses that want to sell to the Chinese market and do so to the Chinese market. And you think about Tesla and Apple, for example. They could also restrict sales to the United States of things like rare earth minerals. There are some such minerals, really important to technologies of the future that China has kind of has a corner on the market. So they could do that or they could do subtler things. And they can also file a complaint at the World Trade Organization, which would take years and years to resolve as is usually the case. So this is going to be very interesting for a long time to come. And Rick, speaking of the rising escalating tensions here between the US and China, the Chinese from behind TikTok has now denying some allegations that we heard published initially in Forbes that it was using the social media app to track American users. You would think that this would attract even more scrutiny from Washington, then. And I think it is attracting scrutiny from Washington behind the scenes.

3898," And then. And I think it is attracting scrutiny from Washington behind the scenes. This is what this is kind of a weird dance, if you will, between bite dance, tick tock parent company and Forbes. So Forbes published a piece recently. Saying that the parent company of tick tock based in China had a plan to monitor or track a what sounds like a small number of us individuals and they did not identify who they were now they said they had a plan to track these people and we don't know if it was just randos using tick tock or if they were going to track like Mitch McConnell and Joe Biden on tick tock now what bite dance has come out and said is no we did not track anybody. And we don't track anybody on tick tock any us users on tick tock so Forbes said they had a plan to do it but actually putting it into effect and bite dance came out and said no we never track anybody any American users on tick tock so what's really going on here. But look, I mean, we should all know at this point every social media company sucks up every bit of data. It can get about you, including one space here in the United States. And now there are many millions of people whose data is on a social media app that is controlled by a company in China. Yeah. Is that cool with everybody? You know, it seems to be it seems like a lot of the users simply don't care, which is also part of the issue here, but I'm sure we will this is not the last event. We will continue to hear more about this Rick Newman. As always, thanks so much. Have a good weekend. Bye. All right. Doctors across the US reporting a rise in pediatric respiratory viruses well before the typical winter cold and flu season Yahoo finances. And we're already seeing the number of cases overwhelm some hospitals. That's right. And this is something that experts had been warning about. We've seen that respiratory viruses have been absent from the pressure that health health systems face in the last few years because of COVID. And so what typically happens is that these respiratory viruses come with one rising and the other falling by comparison to each other. But what we're finding right now is a health systems are preparing for three different outbreaks at the same time in the same season. That includes COVID in flu and RSV RSV is an interesting one because it really impacts the most vulnerable and impacts kids and also impacts elderly adults. We've seen 2.1 million cases typically a year. And you see each year RSV leads to on average 58,000 hospitalizations with about 100 to 500 deaths among kids younger than five. So that's where the concern is and that's why children's hospitals especially are overwhelmed. We also know that that's the same age group that has the lowest COVID vaccination rate. So as you can imagine really, really tough times for these health systems right now not surprising health experts have been warning about this in the in previous months and we're trying to see an early aggressive flu season as well. We just spoke to the lab course CEO Adam Schecter about one test that can test for all three COVID and the flu as well. And vaccine companies are working on combo vaccine for for the same reason. Yep. So the rise and respiratory illness shortage of a mox is still in reportedly what are we learning. So we know that this is largely affecting certain CVS locations in the country. It's not a widespread shortage just yet. The company is working with the manufacturer or manufacturers right now. No more details on that. It's important to note that this is something that's been sort of hopscotting around the globe. We've heard reports of shortages on and off throughout the year in different countries as well. From some from various manufacturers and done clear right now what really is causing that but we know we do know that CVS is on track to resume this and it shouldn't be a widespread issue. I'm Julie Kimmelani. Thanks so much for those details coming up next the new business or big business.

3899," MUSIC Taylor Swift and her fans as Swifties have taken over Twitter amid the release of her new album Midnight Yahoo! The album was released at Midnight and according to Downic Detector, nearly 8,000 reports of outages on the Spotify platform as a direct result of the album's release. And if we're talking about Taylor Swift, I know into the break you call her a big business, and she certainly is. From a marketing perspective, the buzz leading up to this album has been very astonishing. Taylor has released TikTok videos, Instagram posts. She released a teaser video during Amazon's Thursday night football game last night, obviously a huge platform there, and she's seen a significant amount of engagement through all of those tactics. And on Twitter, the company released a whole report on Taylor Swift's popularity. Some nuggets from that report you're seeing on your screen, 329 million tweets mentioning Taylor Swift in the last 12 years that fan base name Swifties tweeted over 18 million times since 2010. And so much more, I spoke with Brand expert Sunny Bono. He'll told me that Taylor has used a variety of strategies to increase the momentum surrounding each of her respective releases. We know she's constantly reinventing herself, her music, her look, and that reinvention has really been key to her success. And then finally, one thing that I want to call out is that on Twitter, I notice that a lot of these consumer facing brands, inions, Amtrak, LinkedIn, even do a lingo, they've all tweeted about the midnight's album over the past 24 hours, 12 hours. So they're really capitalizing on Taylor Swift. And that just goes to show the impact that she's had. So at the end of the day, it's just, you know, Taylor's world, we're all just living in it. No doubt, man, she is an absolute machine. Switching gears to the box office, Ally, two releases expected to dominate this weekend.

3900," and she is an absolute machine. Switching years to the box office, Ally, two releases expected to dominate this weekend. One is a DC comic book, black Adam, the other, a romcom, which we haven't seen a lot in the theaters recently. Ticket to Paradise, what's the expectation? Yeah, and I want to start with that, that romcom, because I love a good underdog story. Ticket to Paradise, it's already secure nearly a 75 million internationally, a very successful start, and it does take the pressure off of that domestic debut currently expectations are set in the low to mid teens. It will have to battle the rocks black Adam. That's expected to secure around 6 million plus. So ticket to Paradise could be more of a slow burn, but it does call into question the future of the romcom, according to one analyst that I spoke with, this could symbolize a resurgence of the romcom, especially after the success of the lost city back in March. But we'll have to see how it does. And Ally, I know we're a few weeks away from the black panthers. The sequel here will condo, but the bar has been set so, so high for this film. What are the expectations? Yeah, it's crazy that we already have expectations for this, but early tracking by NRG shows that the sequel could debut to 175 million. Now, if that number holds, it would be the second biggest debut this year, right behind another big Marvel sequel, Dr. Strange in the multiverse of madness. And for a little context there, the original black panther opened to 202 million in 2018. So still a possibility that that number could come in even higher. And we've seen advanced ticket sales been really strong. It won't have that much competition. And of course, it's going to debut right before the holidays. So potentially some more momentum carrying it through the end of the year. But November 11th, that's the magic date that we'll finally see this movie come to theaters. Very much looking forward to that one. Ally, can I now thank you? Enjoy the weekend, my friend. Thanks. You too. Coming up, we're counting down to the closing bell on Wall Street. Stay with us here on Yandong Finance Law.",https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XTJjX90THDQ,84,2022-10-21 19:59:36
3901," All right, just a couple of minutes away from the closing bell. Let's bring in Yahoo! Fanat's is Jared Blyckery to see if we can finally have ourselves a positive Friday, my friend. Finally, eight out of the last nine have been negative. But look at this. To close the week, we have the Dow, the S&P 500, the Nasdaq, each up over 2% throwing the Russell 2000 there with it. The S&P 500 is deck up over 5% down there almost with it and S&P 500 about in the same place. Here is, I think this is going to be the sector action for the week. In fact, the entire week, all five days, energy in the lead followed by tech materials, consumer discretionary, all of those the outperformers and what a day for the Fed. I mean, we woke up to a Nick Timmerl's article, then we had a intervention, then we had some Mary daily comments as well, throwing all of it. And guess what? By the end of the day, by the end of the week, we're seeing a lot of the money flow into some of these fringe markets like meme stocks. So I'm going to go through some of these rather quickly. Here's the Nasdaq also on a five day basis, Amazon, tacking on gains 11% there and video also up 11%. Tesla, having a little bit of a rough go after its earnings, but still managing to cap the week at 4.5% Microsoft alphabet right there with it. Let me just show you some of our heatmaps here for the week. Travel looking pretty good. Carnival cruise lines up 15% United Airlines, the airlines announcing. That's up 14% bank stocks doing fairly well after rounding out the big bank earnings. Earlier this week, you can see JP Morgan Bank of America each up about 10%. Goldman Sachs up 8% with 15 seconds to go. We're going to check in on the EB market. And here we go. I took a Tesla, but look at Ford. That's up 4.5% and GM up 6%. This ending the day well in the green as we wrap up the trading week. Dow, Nasdaq and S&P all up over 2% today. Some of that rally coming in in the final hour and a half of trading. To look at the sector action, all 11 of the S&P sectors moving to the upside for the day materials by far the outperform up just around 3.5%. Energy consumer discretionary financials not too far behind. Right from on, this will bring in Jordan, Pence, Pence, Capitol, management, cheap investment officer. We also have Alfred Eskindar. He's a self financial president and chief operating officer. Dryden, let me start with you. We're certainly are looking at a day of solid gains all through the major averages up to well over 2% today. What's your takeaway not only from the buying we saw today, but really what we've seen play out over the entire trading week? Well, I think everyone's looking for that idea about pause. And whenever you have anything from the Fed speak that possibly there's a pause and raising the interest rate cycle. I think you're going to see a kind of a hyperactive response because everybody's been the frazzled cat for the last couple of months. So things have been a little too negative when every bad news comes out and then sometimes we get a little overreactive on the positive side. So anytime you get something about the Fed's possibly going to pause, then you're going to see this massive reaction. Sometimes it can be an overreaction as well. And that's the question, isn't it Alfred? Because San Francisco Fed President Mary Daly, you have to really seek out the dovish comment and she said the time is now to start talking about stepping down. The time is now to start planning for stepping down, but she was clear, this ain't it. Are we overreacting? Are the markets rather? I don't think it's so much of an overreaction as a release. We've had volatility spiking all year. I mean, if you think about where volatility began and January where we are, it's up 73%. So think about the rocky road that investors have to deal with. You couple that with obviously the moves and the Fed inflation and everyone feeling the pinch at home. And then you get a psychology really coming into play with the average investor. So when you have huge down weeks like we've had in the last couple, a week like today is fantastic. It feels great to be up almost 5% on all the major indices for the week. But that is not a respite for the all clear sign. What we have to understand is the rest of the year is going to look pretty much like this. We're going to have massive weeks up and massive weeks down.",https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XTJjX90THDQ,85,2022-10-21 20:03:30
3902," the all clear side. What we have to understand is the rest of the year is going to look pretty much like this. We're going to have massive weeks up and massive weeks down. And you know, it is not for the investor with a soft stomach. Jordan, what do you think these happen in order for there to be some more conviction in the market and for you to be more bullish? Well, I think there's three big terms out there. We're looking for peace in the Ukraine. We're looking for a pause. We're looking for verification of the peak and interest rates. And so far, a core has not peaked yet. And we don't we're not going to really get until the middle of next month. If you're after this next Fed move, the next read on on inflation. And that's going to probably not be a pretty read. If you it has a core hasn't peaked yet, we think. And so I think you have to get past where we have this moment of assurance that we probably have hit peak both core and headline. And that we are actually legitimately talking about a pause in the rise in the federal fund rates. I don't think a pivot is probably something to be afraid of because I think if they pivot, they've broken it. But if they move to a pause and extended pause period of time to let because consumers have to catch up. We can trade policy. You can change policy overnight or within a day or markets will check in a day. But consumers, the drivers of inflation have to catch up. It takes six or eight months. And I think that we're forgetting that. So for me to be bullish again, we have to begin to see that policy makers are beginning to give the consumers some time for reality to catch up with what they're trying to do. A lot of peas in there. So Alfred, when do we see that pause? And when do we get an indication that inflation is beginning to at least peak? Well, you know, the numbers are going to guide us and and certainly the federal respond accordingly. But in lieu of all that, I think investors really need to take a look at the portfolios and understand the risk exposure and depending on who you are. You know, if you're a young investor, guess what? You've got time. You could actually write out, you know, this volatility, you know, for the next few quarters. However, if you're a little bit older, thankfully, there are plenty of products that have been introduced in the last 10, 15 years that are quite sophisticated that are really terrific defensive products to use when markets are this volatile. You know, if you're 55 and you're thinking about retirement, seeing a 20% draw down the S&P 30 and that's like, that's not what you want to experience. So there's plenty of products out there. Think about the risk in your portfolio and be defensive. Like, you know, winning is also akin to not losing. So the less you lose, the more you win in markets like this. And I think taking a much more defensive posture for those who have been in the market for quite a bit is the right thing to do. It's the prudent thing to do right now. Can you give some of those older investors some of those products? Sure. Well, listen, anything from, you know, fixed index annuities, structured products and then on the super accessible, easy thing are buffer ETFs. Now granted, they're not going to protect you for the total downside that we've seen this year in the markets. But, you know, being down 10% versus being down 25 is still a win. So again, defensive sectors, defensive products products that actually can give the investor downside protection to some extent or completely are some things that should be added to a portfolio. It's not just about stocks and certainly bonds have been down this year as well. So we got to think about the portfolio a lot differently. The 6040 is kind of updated. Jordan, what do you think? And I guess where are you seeing the most opportunity today in terms of what investors should be doing? Well, one thing we have now that we have not had in years is we have an interest rate. And so for some investors, actually, it's appropriate right now. The two years is actually yielding pretty good. And so if they think about long term, we're going to have rights go down. Now's a good time to think about sometime between now and the end of the year, maybe adding some to your treasury to the portfolios because now you can, you know, if you're trying to get eight long term and compound that, well, you know, all four to quarter, get you halfway there. And so, but the other side of it is when we think about looking at who's going to do well in a continued inflationary environment. And we actually see that barbellying things make some sense to the consumer. You have companies like Walmart and some of the ones who are helping.",https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XTJjX90THDQ,86,2022-10-21 20:07:50
3903," than a continued inflationary environment. And we actually see that barbellying things make some sense to the consumer. You have companies like Walmart and some of the ones who are helping the low end consumer, you have people who are making over $80,000 a year. Now moving down to that market, so you're gonna see continued growth there. And actually, wages have grown faster than inflation. So you see wages growing faster than inflation for people at the lower end of the economic spectrum. At the higher end of the economic spectrum, their incomes are rising as fast as inflation. And so it's kind of this barbell between LVMH, luxury goods and Walmart. But it's the people in the middle that are gonna continue to have problems as we get into 2023. Maybe we have a small recession. They're gonna be hurt the most. And so you kind of break it up when you think of equity, you think of barbellying those two ends of the consumer. And I think in the center, you're gonna have some challenges for the maces, the targets and those guys because their customers are gonna move to either side. LVMH Walmart barbell is a fascinating one, Jordan, thank you. Appreciate you coming out in the studio. Alfred, you come see us next time. Both of you guys have a good weekend. Appreciate it. Coming up, stuck barges and lighter loads, how low water levels in the Mississippi River are wreaking havoc on the Midwest supply chain next. here. The pandemic related bottleneck of cargo ships off a Southern California's coast has finally cleared Yahoo finances, Danny Romero joining us now with the details. Danny, what can you tell us about this improvement? Yeah, so the backlog that we saw off the Southern California coast has drastically decline. Let's just take a picture. Let's just take a look at what it looks like right now. Here's a picture from Marine Exchange. They are an organization that tracks the backlog at the",https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XTJjX90THDQ,87,2022-10-21 20:12:46
3904," just take a look at what it looks like right now. Here's a picture from Marine Exchange. They are an organization that tracks the backlog at the LA County ports. You can tell in this picture, really clear waters, not much backlog there. As of yesterday, five container ships are backed up at the LA County ports. So that's a big drop from what we saw, the 109 cargo ships that were backlogged in the LA County ports. But the reason goes back to many of these shipping companies, retailers have been shifting and sending their goods to other ports like Georgia, Savannah, Georgia, Houston, Texas, New York. And so to really cushion themselves against the supply chain snarls that they dealt with during the pandemic, when they sent all their goods to the LA County ports. But another reason for why we're seeing such a big drastic decline in these backlogs goes back to cargo volume. Cargo container volume has actually decreased about 11%. So you're really seeing this shift in dynamics, but the backlogs still remain as there is excess inventory that retailers are dealing with. Certainly something that we will continue to watch right now. Thanks so much. Cargo volume, meanwhile a mess on the Mississippi. How vital is the Mississippi River for US commerce? Well, between 2015 and 2019, 95% of corn, 94% of soybeans, and 45% of wheat moved by barge through the Mississippi River. Now we have dangerously low water levels threatening the flow of grain exports. Peter Friedman is the executive director of the Agricultural Transportation Coalition. Good to see you, sir. I want to dive into the economics in a moment. But how do you characterize these dangerously low water levels in the situation you're seeing? It's having a devastating impact on the flow of some of our major agricultural commodities, both impacting the domestic market, but also impacting our ability in our country to be a good, dependable supplier to the world of these agricultural commodities. Yeah, Peter, talk a little bit more about the economic implications of this because like Dave said, half of US grain exports traveled down to the Mississippi when you see an issue like this. What does this potentially do to prices? Well, it'll increase the prices. Look at the difficulty here. Unlike the international ocean containerized cargo, these are bulk commodities. They travel north, south from the northern part of the Midwest down to the Mississippi River, the mouth of the Mississippi River, to bulk ships that carry corn and soybeans, grains, in bulk, huge commodity volumes all over the world. And those are products that are dependent upon by the rest of the world. And in many cases, they can substitute the sourcing from other countries, but in most cases, they cannot substitute. They cannot find these volumes elsewhere. So what happens is the pricing goes up because you're not only buying grain or soybeans from the United States, you're buying grain and soybeans delivered to the place you need them in Africa, South America, and Asia, and so forth. So the delivery cost is skyrocketing because you can't get the product down the river. And the difficulty is that unlike these containerized cargoes that go are the east coast or the west coast, and you can move around. There is no alternative, no realistic alternative, to the barge movement of these massive volumes of commodities. I can give you an example. One barge, just one barge, is holds the equivalent of cargo of 138 trucks. We're talking about the biggest semi-trucks that you see on the highways. One barge, 138 of those trucks. And typically, the barges go in four barge toes, they're called four toes, four barges. That's 550.",https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XTJjX90THDQ,88,2022-10-21 20:16:25
3905," Typically, the barges go in four barged toes, they're called toes, four barges. That's 550 huge trucks. And you see there are thousands of these barges that are on the sand sitting on the bottom, not moving. So that's thousands of barges. We do not have hundreds of thousands of extra trucks sitting around, or hundreds of thousands of extra truck drivers sitting around able to carry that cargo. So it's going that there until we get some rain. Those pictures are just stunning. Is it as simple as a lack of precipitation? And what can be done? Well, first of all, it has to be recognized. Some people would say that, well, if it doesn't go in barge, can it go by rail? Because rail can also carry large volumes. Difficulty is that the barges and our river system go north to south. And most of our railroads go east and west. So there is not a simple replacement of rail for barge. The situation is really dependent upon, as you show here, precipitation. And what we have with agriculture is you certainly have farmers who know that while people living in cities, sometimes we think we're insulated from mother nature. We're not. Farmers know it. This happens. And we need rain to fill the river and get the depth we need to move those barges. And Peter, you need a lot of rain in order to fill that river. Any assymage, and how long this problem could potentially last? There are some people saying that it could be three weeks. But again, it's mother nature. And predicting that is a profession, I guess, but it's not a science. So we're thinking three weeks. There will be some areas that will fill faster. One of the kind of interim solutions is that you load the barges with less grain, less soybean, less corn. And so they'll be lighter and they can float on less water. And I think that's what we're going to be seeing first. Again, that dramatically increases the cost of transportation by moving less cargo with each barge movement. The other thing that's happening is that there are huge storage facilities being developed. And you just got to place the stuff on the ground. Corn can handle storage on the ground. Soybeans are more delicate. So we're going to be seeing and expecting some damage for that cargo. And when you ship damage goods, you get less money for them. So that's another downstream expectation, even once the water fills these rivers. And massive, massive economic implications here. Peter Freeman, great to have you. Thanks so much for joining us. Thanks for having me. Thanks for coming up. Coming up as soon, you'll be able to squirrel away even more money for retirement. And you have inflation to thank for it. We'll break down the new retirement contribution limits after the break. Be sure to continue to16 disrupt the rest of the revolution.

3906,"........ All right. Me too. Yeah. So nice. You're doing great. Yeah. Oh, yeah. Yeah. Yeah. The pandemic's 7.5 million student loan bar was in default in April. The Education Department announced an initiative to get default bar wars in good standing through its fresh start program. The financial crisis is running with more details on this. How is the fresh start program different from what was previously available to bar wars? Previously, bar wars had to have at least 9 on time payments before they could get out of default status. Due to the pandemic and the forbearance pause, those payments of 0 will count towards that 9. It's useful for people who are like, you know, they've been struggling. They couldn't do it. So now you can use those payments to do it. Also, the forbearance, the fresh start program allows people to restore their eligibility for student student aid. And it removes default from the credit history and also the credit alert system for mortgage lenders. It's important to point out that it's not just students who are able to apply for this relief. Many parents who supported those students throughout college are also eligible. What can you tell us about that? So separate from the fresh start program for default borrowers. The Biden student loan for giving this program is available for anybody that has federal student loans. So what we've been seeing, what representative Ayanna Presley and AOC have been talking about, has been parents and grandparents who've been burdened by not only the parent plus loans as they've taken out for their children and grandchildren. But also, they're still carrying their own debt. Many of them couldn't retire. So if they have debt that they still have from their federal student loan, they can apply. If their children took out federal student loans, they can apply. If they took out parent plus loans, they are also eligible for relief. All right, round of the important information there. Thanks so much for filling us in. All right, it's time to review your Medicare benefits beneficiaries. Have until December 7th to make some potentially money saving decision. Joghub Finance is carrying in and joins us now with the details and carry tells. What do we need to know? Oh, yeah, this is now this is good news. One year and I want to start quickly with some good savings coming up for Medicare beneficiaries in the in 2023. The premiums and the deductibles for Medicare part B are coming down, which is excellent news. The co shares on vaccines are going away and the insulin cap is going to come into effect starting at about $35 a month. So this is great news. So good savings ahead. But this is open enrollment season. So what that means is you have until as you mentioned, December 7th to really take a look. If you have a Medicare Advantage program or a part D prescription plan, this is your time to really look.",https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XTJjX90THDQ,90,2022-10-21 20:25:17
3907," December 7th to really take a look. If you have a Medicare Advantage program or a Part D prescription plan, this is your time to really look hard back to the matter. Seven out of 10 people, Kaiser Family Foundation has found don't actually do this, but they're big savings to be had. And here's why every year, every year changes are constantly going on. You'll get a notice you've already had it from your plan provider, which is called the annual notice of change. And it's things like what pharmacies you can go to your deductibles, all of that stuff comes in the out of pocket minimums, all kinds of things get shifted around every single year. And you can find big savings. I mean, even if your pharmacy is no longer in the network, you could end up saving thousands of dollars by simply moving to a pharmacy that is now in your network, but you might not even realize that if you don't do your homework. So it's really important to really pay attention to these changes because it's the time Medicare Advantage plan, there's a lot of great ones out there, but it's important to really know what is changing year to year and where you can get the biggest bang. Indeed, and Carrie, Dave, if people have questions about their options or how to sign up, what should they do? Where they go? Oh, I'm so glad you asked that. You know, interestingly enough, Medicare has one of the best ways to help you do this comparison shopping. They have something called the plan finder right on the website medicare.gov. Check it out because it's everything. It's not just if you go to your insurer. This is actually giving you everything in your area and yet very helpful. They also, you can just call Medicare. They're excellent about getting on the phone with you and helping you out. Medicare Rights Center is also a terrific resource to help you hold your hand a little bit walk you through it. Trust me, this is a head scratcher for a lot of people very confusing, but there's help out there. The other one I really like is the state health insurance assistance programs. It's called ship help dot org. And if you go to ship help dot org, there's free volunteers. It's a free service volunteers all over the country are there to really help you walk you through this comparison shopping and it doesn't have to be super hard. I mean, someone I was interviewing for this story said to me, hey, you know, if you can shop on Amazon, you can really use Medicare's plan finder. It's not that hard. So it's really worth doing. Even I can figure that out. Carry hand and good to see you. Thanks so much. Enjoy the weekend. Alright, high inflation means there are big updates to retirement savings plan contributions. The IRS announcing a record increase in contribution limits to certain retirement plans. Here are the numbers you need to know. Starting next year, you'll be allowed to contribute up to 22,500 into your 401k for 3B. Most 457 plans or the thrift savings plan for federal employees. That's $2,000 more than the current limit of 20,500 for participants who are 50 or older. The catch up contribution for 401ks and other workplace plans will increase by $1,000 to $7,500. That means if you're over 50, you can contribute as much as $30,000 to your 401k next year. Let's move to individual retirement accounts or IRAs IRA contributions will raise increase $6,500 for 2023 of $500 increase. However, the catch up contribution limit stays unchanged at $1,000. In addition, the IRS announced updates to contributions to individual 401ks and income limits for Roth IRAs. All this just one more way inflation is impacting your wallet.

The book's author, Julia Borson, is here along with Yahoo Finance, editor in chief, Andy Sirward. Julia, it's great to have you. Congratulations on the new book, was going through some stats that you said over just 8% of Fortune 500 CEOs, our women drawing in less than 3% of all VC dollars. I know you've talked with people, everyone from Gwen with Palchro, Dijon, Hyman, at Rent the Runway to Smaller Business Owners, but tell us just what you learned about the key characteristics from those women who do in fact succeed. Yes, those women succeed despite the odds. And I was always so curious, how did these women manage not only to grow and scale game-changing companies, but to do so with such little access to capital compared to their male counterparts. And what I found is that women lead in very different ways than the traditional archetypal male leadership. They're more likely to lead with empathy, a communal approach to management. So bringing in perspectives from across an organization rather than just top-down management, and women are more likely to lead with things like vulnerability or gratitude, characteristics which are not traditionally associated with leadership, but in fact can be leadership superpowers. Julia, Andy here, how are you doing? So good to see you, Andy. Good to see you too. I have a question. So there have been a number of books about women and empowerment and leadership, and how do you think you're moving the conversation forward? Well, so, Andy, there are so many books that tell women what to do to succeed. They say, lean in. Here's the confidence code. Here's how to act, but there are very few books that really summarize and share all these amazing examples and stories. And I think what's really necessary is, as a journalist, for me to show, not tell. You are my boss and mentor many years ago, Andy, and you always said, show, don't tell. I think it's really important for women to see these amazing examples and to see these leadership traits in action. So what I do is I tell the stories of dozens of game-changing, odd-stifying leaders, and then I use the research and data to explain what it is they're doing. Okay, here she's leading with something called servant leadership. Servant leadership is an approach that's taken by Howard Schultz, who founded Starbucks, but is something women are more likely to do, and here's why it's effective if done by both men and women. And Julia, what was kind of the most surprising interview that you did or something that just really blew your mind the most? Oh, there were so many interesting stories in here and so many inspiring stories. I can't tell you the number of times in an interview with one of these founders, Brahmit of Tears, because the grit and resilience encourage of these women to defy the odds was so remarkable. But I think sometimes the stories are most surprising are the ones that are right in front of your nose. So how say Whitney Wolfherd? You may have remembered that she was that tender before she founded Bumble, but what was really driving her to try to switch the way online dating works and put women in charge or the fact that Bwyneth Paltrow, she leads with vulnerability. She's maybe one of the biggest movie stars in the world, but she decided to admit what she didn't know and she had to ask for the CEO role of the company that she started herself. So had to put herself in a position of vulnerability to do that. So I think looking at the surprising unexpected angles of characters that you may have seen out in the news, really finding those news stories will surprise you. Julia Bourston, congratulations.",https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XTJjX90THDQ,93,2022-10-21 20:38:15
3910," is surprising unexpected angles of characters that you may have seen out in the news, really finding those new stories will surprise you. Well, Julia Borsden, congratulations on your new book, author of When Women Lead. Congratulations, we wish you all the best. Thank you. Andy, before we let you go, we want to talk about the column that you just wrote. And you looked into, why ever sessions happen, what causes inflation, what causes economic downturns? And I know a lot of it comes down to supply and demand. What can you tell us? Yeah, well, I mean, it really does come down to that, Shawna, and there's either too much demand or not enough supply. And one of those two things causes prices to rise, economic downturn and a recession. I mean, the typical demand shock would be, say, a stock market crash or 2008, the housing crash, where people didn't have enough money, a lack of demand. A supply shock would be, say, the oil in bargos in the 1970s when there was not enough oil in that tank, the economy. So what do we have here? Well, we have both. And I think it's fair to say that, certainly not in my lifetime, where I have ever seen a case where we got such great imbalances, because you have both huge demand brought about by government stimulus in the United States, where people were buying cars and homes and meme stocks, right? And then the supply problems, which you know about, which are oil, not enough employees, not enough semiconductors. So you put those things together, very complicated. We definitely have both a supply and demand problem right now, which is very vexing for J-PAL for Liz Trusts, right? Leaders having a hard time figuring this out, you guys. Liz Trust, didn't outlive the lettuce. No, it wasn't. What about supply side constraints? We're not all that familiar with. Yeah, I mean, there's a bunch of them. I mean, some of these things are pretty obvious. Like COVID, of course, has caused supply constraints, because number one, of course, it's constricting. The number of people going to work still. And also in China, very much constricting manufacturing there. Ukraine, of course, constricting supply of food, green oil, fertilizer, and those kinds of things. But also you've got things like climate change, which we can get into a little bit. Like for instance, right now, there's going to be a shortage, you guys, of cranberries and prices going up because massive droughts in Massachusetts and the economists are saying, that's because of climate change now, one season. I don't know. I'm not going to get into that. I'm not going down that rabbit hole. But here's another one, for instance. I talked to a guy who runs a waste management company, right? And he said he needs permitting all the time, right? For his business. And he said, because of the great resignation, key personnel in local municipalities, state government, provinces in Canada, federal government, they're not filling these things. It's not because of budget things. It's just there are no people there, so he can't get permits, right? So that's another type of supply constraint. There's just not enough people around to do these kinds of jobs. And Andy, of course, the question that everyone is trying to figure out the answer to is, how do you address the supply shocks and the problems that we're seeing play out in the economy? Well, it's interesting you ask, because the traditional tools of the Fed uses, which is higher rates in the balance sheet, that affects and impacts demand. It doesn't do anything about supply. OK, so some of the things you can do for supply are to reduce tariffs, right? So we need trade flowing around the world. Remember, we also have a trade war with China right now. You guys have been talking about that this afternoon, right? Yeah. And there are other things you can do. For instance, providing relief to debt-ridden nations right now. Other things to do is make sure that the problems of Ukraine aren't hurting Europe. So in other words, providing as much oil and gas as you can to Europe. So there's a number of things like that. And then longer term, climate change people are saying, you know, moving away from oil and gas helps because it's more decentralized, right? So it's not even, it's not the climate change per se. It's just that to get oil, you know, there are certain nations have it, others that don't. So if you can have localized energy. And then supporting local businesses here, like a chip factory in the United States, providing government loans for that versus, you know, waiting for things to come from Asia. So there's, but those are longer term things. It's interesting, which is so used to like flipping a lever at the Federal Reserve for demand. But it's not going to work so well this time around. Yeah, and we're certainly seeing that play out at this time around. Andy Sauer, thanks so much. And of course, you can read Andy's column on YahooFinance.com this weekend.",https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XTJjX90THDQ,94,2022-10-21 20:42:43
3911," It works so well this time around. Yeah, and we're certainly seeing that play out at this time around. Andy server, thanks so much. And of course you can read Andy's column on Yahoo Finance dot com this week. And all right, coming up next the 2022 World Cup kicks off in less than a month. Up next, one of the most well-known voices in soccer lays out what you'll expect from the tournament, including the controversy. We'll be right back. We'll be right back. And that is the sound of soccer. And in just 30 days, tens of millions of soccer fans around the world will hear that voice. This is the biggest sporting event on the planet returns nearly 3 million tickets have been sold for the Qatar World Cup and nearly 4 billion are expected to watch. Let's welcome in. The legendary Andres Cantor who I call the goal, father, Telemundo de Porteis lead broadcaster want to talk a lot about the cup but give us quickly the story of how that call came to be. Well I grew up in Argentina, they thank you for having me on and I grew up listening to the games in the radio. And radio was big and all the announcers called the goal call the same way I do and I happened to be very lucky to be in the right place at the right time and popularize the game of soccer through my goal call and especially in the 1994 World Cup. So I didn't invent anything, I just popularized it a little bit more. It is passionate and it's probably the most imitated call in all of sports. So we are focused now on the World Cup.",https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XTJjX90THDQ,95,2022-10-21 20:47:07
3912," I just, you know, popularized it a little bit more. It is passionate and it's probably the most imitated call in all of sports. So we're focused now on the World Cup. And much of the attention leading up has been on the venue, being on Qatar, being on the lack of human rights. How concerned are you about this venue? In particular, that we've switched seasons. It's not when we typically expect it. And again, that human rights factor. Obviously, you know, when we go into a major tournament, whether it be the Olympics of the World Cup, you're always worried about something happening, because obviously all eyeballs are there for a month. So obviously, I know there has been a lot of things written about human rights violations and so forth. Tel Amundo is taking the most responsible news team on site. So they will report on anything that they find factual to be reported. And I will get to call the games. Obviously, I will not live in a bubble. So if something happens during a game in the fans or with the players protesting, which I doubt FIFA will let them. But obviously, we will report it as serious as the case may be. And with all the responsibility that we have to our audience. Should human rights be considered when selecting a venue for the biggest sporting event on the planet? And should the seasonality of it? Because it's going to go head-to-head with our football versus your football. Obviously, human rights have to be taking care of on many other things when you select big sporting events like the World Cup, which is the biggest sporting event of them all. I have no doubt. We live in a very crazy world. Where do you take the next? I mean, I know it's coming home in 2026. But people from other sites of the world could point out many things that we don't do right in this country. I'm not obviously saying that. But it's obviously a consideration that major sports organizations have to take when they award the hosting rights to different countries. And in terms of the seasonality, I have to say that I love it that it's going to be played in November and December, because the players will get there with about 21 games under the belt. Usually when the World Cup is in the summer, the big stars play about 65 matches a year. So I mean, that is a lot. They get very tired legs when they have to play the World Cup. And now they will play only 21 games. So hopefully that will make for a better level of play. In this country would help certainly if the United States succeeds. It doesn't look great. They come in with the scoreless draw in the Saudis, a two-zip loss to Japan. What's their ceiling? We will see. I have to say that not only for the US, but all the other ones that are not playing great. I mean, England hasn't had a good run lately. They did not make it to the Final Four in Nation's League, neither France, neither Germany. They're not playing that well. But the World Cup is a different animal. It's seven games to get to the Final. The US has its Final on Game One, which is against Wales. If they get past Wales with three points, then they get to play England on Black Friday on the day after Thanksgiving. And if they can be England, then it's onto the next round, then. I don't know what the ceiling will be. But so I think everyone has to concentrate on the opening match more the US than anybody else. Calendar's interesting. The Final will be a week before Christmas on a Sunday. Are you feeling you live in Miami? Are you feeling soccer reach a new level here and whether that be Ted Lasso or Ryan Reynolds purchase of Rexham or the MLS or the NWSL really growing? Are you feeling? Oh, yes. Yeah. I mean, soccer keeps growing in this country. Now I have no doubt. I mean, just numbers alone. You see what the media companies are paying, what NBC paid to renew the Premier League rights, what Paramount Plus paid for four years of Champions League, $1.5 billion. MLS broke attendance records. Telemundo will break sales records for the woke up in Qatar. The ratings are there. The interest is there.",https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XTJjX90THDQ,96,2022-10-21 20:51:18
3913," dollars. MLS broke attendance records. Tel Avivundo will break sales records were the woke up in Qatar. The ratings are there, the interest is there. At a grassroots level, I don't have to tell you everyone plays on the weekend in the parks, in the little league system, if you will. So I think there's tremendous excitement around this woke up. Lionel Messi has Brazil and France as the favorites, agree, disagree? Sure, whatever he says, I'll agree to. He like a good Argentinian, that's one of Jing's Argentinian's chances. I think Argentina will be up there. Argentina is in the path to play semi-final against Brazil, if all planets align. So I think whoever wins that semi-final will crown itself the champion of the world and on the other side. Francis, I believe, is on this side of the bracket. So if he said France, they have to play Argentina. So I don't think he saw the brackets. So it's going to be Argentina, Brazil on one side and I believe it's going to be either Spain or Germany on the other side. All right, should I try it before we go? Go! Go! There you go. Very good. Very good. Very good. Andre Skade, you have to do it for 64 games. I don't have the passion. I don't have the pipes. You'll hear him on Telemundo and on Peacock during the World Cup. Great to see you, sir. Thank you, Dave. Thank you. I do not have the passion. I was impressed. I was hoping you were going to give it a go. So, could I ask you for that one? You made a good point about now, make no mistake. Not a fan of Qatar hosting a World Cup because of the human rights situation. But Andre Skade made a great point about the size being a real advantage. It was prior in Russia, the largest country in the world by area. Teams traveled three, four, and five thousand miles throughout that World Cup. Now it's in the smallest country we've ever seen, the whole world cup. He thinks it's a huge advantage for the teams. They don't have to travel as much and the fans that are all going to see one another and interact with another. Now that's, of course, if the Qatari government treats them well, which is a big concern. Yeah, and Qatar has been a controversial choice ever since it did win the right to host this World Cup. It's going to be interesting. You touched on it at the timing of it. He was saying that he was a fan of the November December timeline ratings wise, at least here in the U.S. when you brought it up, just going up against the NFL. What that could potentially need for ratings here, you would think it would be a huge challenge. But we will see maybe because of the time difference of the games, it would actually work out okay. But I think there's a lot of hype. It won't dampen the Telemundo audience. That is that is that is that is that is that is that is that is that is that is that is our passionate. Alright, coming up, our business known for its meats, but the company now has a smoked bourbon and just know we had to try it for ourselves to close the week. Don't go.",https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XTJjX90THDQ,97,2022-10-21 20:55:47
3914," Till all the tips you get are useful special! gras Tulomimi Arby's slogan remains we got the meats, but they also got the collaborations inspired by its 13 hour smoked brisket sandwich. Arby's this week teamed up with craft distilled re-brain brew to introduce a limited edition smoked bourbon. Smoke with the same wood used to smoke their meats. The bourbon went on sale Wednesday at arbysmoked bourbon.com. It's sold out immediately. They had a second drop today at noon. Flew off the website in a hurry. Thankfully we did get our hands on some. So I do want Shonda to try it. They comes with a smoker that you ordinarily put over this. So you take a little bourbon, you just pour it over the arby's ice cube, mind you. That's a big point. So you can literally put wood chips in here, light it on fire, and it would smoke the cocktail with the wood chips. It's a really nice tactic. Are you sure you don't want to try it? I don't want to make any fire here in the studio. Yeah, I could see. No, so I want to have you try it and see what you think. Don't worry, it won't taste like arby's meat per se. That's what I was a little bit nervous. It tastes good. I'm not a huge bourbon drinker, but it tastes, I'm going to go back first, I got one. You're going back again, so that can't be all that. It is pretty good, and I think that when we've talked about this time and time again, arby is just so smart, we can share. Arby's just so smart when it comes to their partnerships. This is far from the first time that they have teamed up with a liquor brand or somebody else to try and bring some innovation to their menus, some excitement, and clearly by what you just said, the fact that it's sold out twice, it's working. Flies off the shelves. They had a crinkle cut and curly fry vodka a year ago, and it came with a bloody Mary kit. It like this sold out. What do you think of it? I think it's fantastic. I am a bourbon guy though, unlike yourself. So this is a perfect way to end the week. I'd say it's about an eight and a half. I wish I would have let us lighten. We could have done the whole real smoked. Talk to the boss about that. I know, I guess it was a little bit too risky, but maybe I'll take another, one more sip before I walk out today, but I like it, and I was a little bit skeptical on all this. Alright, well cheers to everyone out there on a wonderful week, and that'll do for us on Yahoo Finance. I make sure to come back Monday at 3 p.m. Eastern Time. We'll have all your coverage leading up to and after the closing bell. Have a great weekend. Bye.",https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XTJjX90THDQ,98,2022-10-21 21:00:16
