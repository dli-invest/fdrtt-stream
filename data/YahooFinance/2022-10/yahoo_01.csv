Number one is is as just a man, right? So, China's gonna build her on six 1 million EVs. This shows a double from last year. There's a lot of demand there in China. Even in the US, we saw record a sales Quarter. Power strike so Some of that production for 2 weeks there. So, you have a little supply. You're two.

It doesn't have a lot of cash flow so it's not a value stock.

You know, and it really never caught on and obviously the mining Companies have been under pressure to do more share repurchases in recent years than to invest. So, but we've reached the point where we do have to replace equipment. So, I think, you know, barring a further material decline commodity prices.

Well it's interesting because if we're going to is is California has now mandated the adoption of electric vehicles or every new vehicle sold in 2035 be electric and and the sort of widespread adoption of electric vehicles that's expected we're gonna need electricity and and more electricity Aimed at improving our grid Transitioning us away from traditional sources of electricity but the reality is is that we're gonna need a tremendous amount of natural gas to support that increase electricity demand through the transition which I think both well for energy and infrastructure companies in the business of transporting story and processing and To that end I think there's also some pieces in the inflation reduction act that are relevant to traditional energy companies specifically and increase in 45 Q credits which is the price that the government is going to credit these companies to for carbon and you look at X Energy infrastructure companies who are either in the business now or exploring and investing in the opportunity to sequester to capture And the repurpose carbon dioxide that's become much more economical with the increase in the price of carbon embedded in that deal and so I think investors ultimately have sort of a binary stance on energy.

Public opinion showed very strong support for pushing back on Russia, Support material and weapons for the Ukrainian government but the US public was very reticent and does not want to engage Russia directly On the ground and what Biden indicated yesterday is that at least his administration seems like they wanna make that commitment that is something new and I think that is a bit considered a bit of an es Particularly by the Chinese government And can you talk a little bit about that escalation because I know that euros had come out with a report back in July about the probability of conflict in Taiwan Also a given speaker Nancy Pelosi's visit to Taiwan I mean how does this all play out when you're talking about conflict there?

It's gonna be dedicating hundreds Millions of dollars to a clean energy transition over the next 10 years primarily in the private sector through subsidies for private sector activity, tax credits, and loan guarantees in the like and I think that gives Biden a lot to talk about especially in the context where European nations are now in their short Looking at ways they can, you know, keep the lights on throughout the winter due to gas shortages and spiking electricity prices but in the long run, you know, the European countries still have this commitment to decarbonization but where I think the real interesting topic is gonna be this week is in the developing world Finance these kind of commitments I think you're gonna see the UN and the developing world really hammer a lot on the developed world to try to contribute Help with their both climate transition and also climate resiliency and I think that's gonna be one of the big themes of the UN this week.

Some optimism though for next year from the really expecting that growth really dependent on China's economy reopening on the back of Oh COVID policy though. How often is the guy either about what's happening with China and that potential impact on the US? I I think that's some extraordinary magic out there. If you go and look back over the last sort of 10 to 15 years Chinese GDP growth drove roughly 50% of the increase in in global demands that and GP driven global demand China is through that secular expansion. And so I am optimistic that it provides some pick up. I don't think we can expect to see the kind of recovery that China would have driven in the past. I think that's just a function of that economy having matured somewhat and I think that the total dynamic has shifted someone. Someone are gonna come easy but it's Friday and it's 320 we've had no good news yet so give me something give me some glimmer of hope to take into the weekend Wow I don't have to really take a pause I'm really having to take a pause would not lie Yeah look the labels are gone No I I find it heartening when unemployment is low I think that's a good thing as a human being but I do think there needs to be a little bit more clarity that that there is an easing in the wage inflation that we're seeing for overall inflation to start to subside I think where I do see a little bit of News is I think that there are some stocks that would have been too expensive that we tell investors should be investing in for the long term particularly really stable companies with good dividends.

You know I think when you look at earnings You know there's $150 as you know are kind of bare case scenario. So we could get it could get worse. You know again I I'd come back to the profit warning in the volume warning there and that discrepancy between you know where the miss was and the headline numbers. You know I do think that again this is more than internal struggle with that act. It's more of an intern Issue around their TNT integration and you know gave us a lot less confidence in management's ability to number one navigate you know the potential storm that's coming but also a lot of the strategic initiatives that they laid out in their recent capital markets today Just to be clear you would argue this is more a FedEx problem than a global problem what does it mean for UPS and perhaps even Amazon if anything?

When you see these incredibly high prices that certainly means that demand slows down but when you add to that higher interest rates which also increases borrowing costs. That's a two fold. So that you could start to see demand slowing down rather dramatically Most likely next year we already see it in housing as you just had mentioned we start to we'll start to likely see the other areas and when demand Down.

Yeah, and to be clear, you know, we don't think there's gonna be a military conflict between US and China over Taiwan, anytime soon, but The situation is getting more tense. You've got China who's making military preparations to take over the island and may have the ability to do so within the next several years. You've got a domestic political environment inside the US that is much more hawkish towards China than it was even 5 years ago ",https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Jxz0lF2NkbM,68,2022-09-19 18:39:57

But All signs are towards deteriorate in relations and much more hawkishness of the US government. Finally, John, I know the president's gonna be traveling here to New York later Week to address the you and general assembly. Obviously, a lot of issues on the table, what's happening with Russia and Ukraine but also the broader climate discussion It's kinda the first time all the world leaders are getting together since top 26 a lot has shifted since then as a result of the concerns around energy what do you think is gonna be a central message You know, I think Biden goes to this meeting. Actually, with a lot to say. The US passed probably the most significant climate spending bill in its history and it really, you know, in the inflation reduction act. It's gonna be dedicating hundreds of Of dollars to a clean energy transition over the next 10 years primarily in the private sector through subsidies for private sector activity, tax credits, and loan guarantees and the like and I think that gives Biden a lot to talk about especially in the context where European nations are now in their short run looking at They can, you know, keep the lights on throughout the winter due to gas shortages and spiking electricity prices but in the long run, you know, the European countries still have this commitment to decarbonization but where I think the real interesting topic is gonna be this week is in the developing world ",https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Jxz0lF2NkbM,69,2022-09-19 18:44:16

There needs to be a deeper explanation of how they're going to react to some of these macro headwinds a bit more acute to their network than to the rest of the transportation world and then we'll actually need to see it in in principle probably not as early as the second quarter that Year but hopefully as early as the second half of their fiscal year which would cover the first half of our calendar 23 and then more importantly going forward Was the one that has been taking the biggest kid when it comes to margins more than ground how was significant Is that and when we're talking about cost cutting measures that FedEx announced how effective do you think that they'll be? Well I think it's very significant because Opportunities at the ground you know they had their first investor day in a decade in late June in Memphis which we attended and the investor focus at that time was very much on how can they get the ground margins back Couple digit levels. As you probably saw from the release last week they missed revenue by about 300 1 million dollars but the operating income was a little bit better than expected.

This is gotta reverse because it can't be that much easing by one central bank, the yen, so to answer the question that we began with, what is the central bank that we care about, that's gonna ease first. Well, maybe it's already easing a certain way cuz it hasn't turned the screws and that would be the bank of Japan. So, for me That's where the bell weather is.

You know we don't think that we're going to see a negative number in the third quarter the big swing factor is going to be inventories and given that we had a big drag from the inventory number in the first and the second quarter those 12 unwind themselves in subsequent quarters so if Maybe it's going to there might be some superficial strength in the third quarter number keeping it positive mainly due that to that inventory swing number what we like to do track is the gross domestic income instead of gross domestic product and that's just kind of a different way of looking at the same coin it's Are you looking at what's produced or at the income that's generated based off of selling what's been produced and that GDI or gross domestic income number has been more positive and a little bit more stable and we think that that's perhaps a bit more indicative of the underlying trend which unfortunately is still downwards but not yet make it If I need to talk about the likelihood of new lows at least for the S and P For some silver lining here what could be the catalyst that turns things around for equities here ,https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FmKj2Mc7hTs,75,2022-09-20 19:12:59

I think the slower permit growth is is a function of of what we what you talked about with higher mortgage rates. Maybe builders being a little more cautious until we figure out where mortgage rates are gonna settle out. I also think that that the builders already have a lot of homes that Underway and again now that they're starting to get the the parts to get them built and and get them constructed they may be slowing down a little bit of the forward for direction until they until they can catch up in the field Higher mortgage rates. What do you think demand destruction potentially looks like and how long do you see this challenging landscape here for housing lasting? Yeah I I wish I knew when the mortgage rates were gonna stop going up it's been pretty challenging environment certainly the highest rates we've seen in years We did see in August when rates stabilized for about your late July and early August. Great stabilized for about 6 weeks. That started to help bring some some buyers back in. I I you know, who knows where mortgage rates are gonna go this time around, but if we could find a level and stay there even if it is a higher level, that helps people figure out Monthly payment is going to be and conversely helps the builders I think generate more and more web traffic and foot traffic to start people on that home buying journey And Jay, I wanna ask about the neutral rating on Toll Brothers and the $50 12 month target that you have for them.

You know I haven't really seen consultation in a couple of years and I think given the the opportunities that some of the builders have in the single family for rent space. I it wouldn't surprise me if we see some of the production that was gonna go to for sale move to four rent Can't rule out consolidation but there there are so many Ear marked and targeted to go into that rental market I think there's there's plenty of construction to be had out there it may just not be you know the exactly what the builders had anticipated coming into this year and and I think also you look at the competition force To for sale housing Multi-family rents are still moving up 15% a month single family rents are moving up 15 to 20% a month so we think the overall shelter demand is still very high it's just some of the builders may need to to reset pricing and or help out on the the right side to get people into those homes but I think from from a demand and a shelter to man standpoint we Much better this time around than we were during the GSC. ,https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FmKj2Mc7hTs,78,2022-09-20 19:25:57

1717,Hey it it has to be expected that this kind of move would happen when you see the fed out of aggressively hawkishes as I can say in in today's decision I'm from here you know we think that they couldn't be further movement up on the 2 year if inflation continues to be extremely stubborn You know we think they can stay relatively elevated kind of weather where it is today. But then as you get closer to that economic weakness really starting to come through. And recession comes into interviews while of at that point you could see some downward pressure on 10 years. But at this stage they're very very little to push it down. As long as I said is hiking and the economy stays robust for the time being. And Michael speaking of robust as we look at the sector right and it's really only consumer staples now in the green after this announcement of the 75 basis point hike how important is the consumer going to be in terms of what happens going forward especially when you look at things like earnings Consumption is two thirds to 70% of US the US economy and so you know that remains the big engineers you've seen other parts of the economy be it you know residential investment or obviously there are a lot of problems abroad when it comes to global growth and you know consumption has been really remarkable when you think about all the challenges we've Consumers have had to jump we still see decent real personal consumption growth but of course that has been sort of on the back of this very strong labor market you know month ,https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=03GGAVD1MgM,61,2022-09-21 18:12:25

Six% that means next year their funds rate will be outpacing inflation finally they will be sufficiently restrictive. A lot of people wondering what this means in terms of GDP projections that are out now. What's your take on what we can expect and give them some of the pressures that the fed both can and cannot control. Yes so it was expected that they would bring down the GDP forecast for this year down close to oh which they did by the way they measure it a look at fourth quarter to fourth quarter growth rates last year's fourth quarter was extremely strong since then the economies been a bit treading water Fourth quarter of this year to last year it's gonna look about flat but underneath that underline that I think the household sector in aggregate is still in really good shape we know that their balance sheets in aggregate are are are are good and corporates critically More resilient than expected. A company has been willing to continue to spend.

1719,The Fed trying to dampen demand conditions has to be careful that it doesn't inadvertently Too much dampen the supply side The housing market is a key example where the froth is is coming out of it. We've seen existing home sales decline now 7 months in a row. Demand is slowing. But it's been a tight market for over 10 years now. Very challenged in terms of supply and fed tightening could inadvert Slow down much needed additional new housing to feed into the millennial gen Z demand Similarly in the labor market. A softening would help wage pressures soften a bit here but a strong labor market helps pull people off the sidelines much needed additional labor as boomers are hitting peak retirement years so the trick here is to not tighten so much that Discourages much needed additional labor supply Infrastructure in terms of the production and distribution of goods we've seen that we've seen that be still challenged there's a lot of investment that needs to take place in this new environment It's company is willing to invest On and ongoing basis that holds open the possibility for a longer expansion than most are anticipating now.

And that the the risk scenario which I think is very material is that correlation still heads upward further in the next few months. Housing rental costs are going up. Wage competition especially in healthcare is going up. The service sector is really booming the slowdown that people Sectors and the supply chains are really irrelevant for goods. So, if The theater surprise yet again Further rate hikes next year. Andrew just looking out to the November meeting. If you take a look at the dot right now showing 10 to nine majority in favor of hiking above four and a quarter percent this year making it seem like 75 basis point hike in November is on the table. It sounds like you think that that makes sense. I think that the federal reserves responsibility is risk management No economist generally think that what really matters for the economy is the interest rate relative to the level of inflation So that means if inflation's running at four and a half percent five% And our workers and their families and small companies are expecting a place to continue at five% Even a three% or a four% interest rate is not actually that tight.

1721,"So then if if inflation does remain stubbornly high despite this 75 basis point hike how much wiggle room does the fit actually have from this point on? They're done. They need a plan. They need contingency plans. They need to explain how much further will they go if in place some stays at five% plus. The the projections they released today is is a is a baseline. Okay, that's what they think. Maybe the most likely one About it. Already starts hanging down very quickly and gets close their target with them the next year or so And I think they need to address the material risk that inflation stays stubbornly high. Which is the service sector is critical to consumers it's critical to the economy as a whole and the service sector is where the labor market's very strong right now and where nominal wage growth is is very very rapid and so the pet's gonna have to Far enough So that the cerebral sector actually starts to slow down.

Some of those job openings may be a bit stale as well. So, I think we've likely already seen a bit of softening but of course, if if the fed really over does it here, you could see a sharp rechan A businesses Projecting. See that we are waiting Jerome Pal and may have to cut you off of his speech begins but it sounds as though you don't buy the Fed projections of unemployment going to four four you think well North we heard projections north of seven where do you think it needs to get to drive down inflation let's just say to to four% Hey four. Four% is the average of where it was in in previous cycles that actually you know that isn't a significant wise. That would be considered as a healthier economy. I sure I think pushing it up to about the five% level. The kind of levels that Laurence Summers has been talking about for time and time again. Those are the kind of levels that actually you Start to see an echomic with this coming through and then call inflation going down in the way that they are expecting. So, if they are, if they really believe, then, in place is gonna go down and they need to go a little bit more honest about what's gonna happen to the unemployment rate. Which is what in your estimation. So I think to about the five% level it's not higher and I think at that point that's when you start to create the latest market slack which is sufficient to to dull inflation Press conference getting underway now in DC let's listen in.

1723,The labor market continues to be out of balance with demand for workers substantially exceeding the supply of available workers. The labor force participation rate showed a welcome uptick in August But his little change since the beginning of the year. FMC participants expect supply and demand conditions in the labor market to come into better balance over time Using the upward pressure on wages and prices. The median projection in the SEP for the unemployment rate rises to four. Four% at the end of next year a half percentage going higher than in the June projections. Over the next 3 years the median unemployment rate runs above the meeting estimate of its longer run normal level. Inflation remains well above our two% longer run goal. Over the 12 months ending in July total PCE prices rose six. Three% Excluding the vault of food and energy categories core PCE prices rose four. Six%. In August the 12 month change in consumer in the consumer price index was eight. Three% in the changing course CPI was six. Three% Price pressures remain evident across a broad range of goods and services. Although gasoline prices have turned down in recent months they remain well above your earlier levels in part reflecting Russia's war against Ukraine which has boosted prices for energy and food and has created additional upward pressure on inflation. ,https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=03GGAVD1MgM,67,2022-09-21 18:38:29

Nine% by the end of 2025 still above the median estimate of it's longer run value Of course these projections do not represent a committee decision or plan and no one knows with any certainty where the economy will be a year or more from now. We are taking forceful and rapid steps to moderate demand so that it comes into better alignment with supply. Our overarching focus is using our tools to bring inflation back down to our two% goal and to keep longer term inflation expectations well anchored. Reducing inflation is likely to require a sustained period of below trend growth. And it will very likely be some softening of labor market conditions. Restoring price stability is essential to step to set the stage for achieving maximum employment and stable prices over the longer run. We will keep at it until we're confident the job is done. To conclude, we understand that our actions affect communities, families, and businesses across the country Everything we do is in service to our public mission We at the Fed will do everything we can to achieve our maximum employment and price stability goals. Thank you and I look forward to your questions. Gina. Hi, cheer pal. Thank you for taking a question. Gina, smile from the New York Times. I wonder if you could give us a little detail around how you'll know when to slow down. These rate increases and how you'll eventually know when to stop. So I will answer your I will answer your question directly but I wanna start here today by saying that my main message has not changed at all since Jackson Hole.

1725,"Financial conditions begin to affect Economic activity fairly quickly within a few months but it's likely to take some time to see the full full effects of changing financial conditions on inflation. So, we are we are very much mindful for that. And that's why I know that in my in my opening remarks that Some point as the stance of policy tightens further it will become appropriate to slow the pace of rate hikes while we assess how our accumulative policy adjustments are affecting the economy and inflation So, that's how we think about that. Your second question, sorry was I should know better than tonight. Alright. Question. Oh, there you go. Is it linear do you keep raising major is there a pause that you could envision where you kinda figure out what what has happened to the economy and give time to catch up in the real economy the rate of which stuff to catch up with the real Me. Thank you. So so I think I think it's it's very hard to say with the precise certainty the way this is gonna unfold. As I mentioned what we think we need to do and should do is to move our policy rate to a restrictive level that's restrictive enough To bring inflation down to two% where we have confidence of that and what you see in the SEP numbers is people's views as of as of today as of this meeting as to the kind of levels that will be appropriate. Now, those those those will those will evolve over time And I think we'll we'll we'll just have to to see how that goes. I I there is a possibility certainly that we would go to go to a certain level that we were confident in and and stay there for a time.

1726,"Sequence of events. It remains to be seen. We have always understood that restoring price stability while achieving a relatively modest decline or rather increase in unemployment. And a soft landing would be would be very challenging and and we don't know no one knows whether this process will lead to a recession or if so how significant that recession would be that's gonna depend on How quickly wage in price and flesh inflation pressures come down whether expectations remain anchored and whether you know also do we get more labor supply which would help as well. In addition, the chances of a soft lending landing are likely to diminish to the extent that policy needs to be more restrictive. Or restrictive for longer. Nonetheless we're committed to getting inflation back down to two%. It will because we think that a failure to restore price stability would mean for a greater pain later on. Do you still at the top of your list in terms of understanding the labor market and how much room there is there? Yes vacancies are still almost two to one ratio two unemployed people that's a that and quits are are really very good ways to look at how tight the labor market is and how different From other cycles where which where the generally the unemployment rate itself is the is a single best indicator we think those things have for a quite a time now Really added value in terms of understanding where the labor market is.

We didn't vote on that. I would say that, you know, we're committed to getting to a restrictive level Of For the federal funds rate and getting their pretty quickly And that's what we're thinking about Some discussion now Of overdoing it. What's the incentive to continue front loading right now? Is it lack of progress on inflation seen in the CPI reports? Or is it a motivation to get as much done while the job market is still stronger So what what we've seen is inflation has our expectation has been that We would begin to see inflation come down largely because of of supply side healing by now we would have thought to that we've who would have seen some of that we haven't we have seen some supplies side healing but inflation has not really come down if you At Core PCE inflation which is you know a good measure of where inflation is running now if you look at it on a three six and 12 month trailing annualized basis you'll see that That inflation is at 4845%, and four. Eight%. So, that's those that's a pretty good summary of where we are with inflation And that's not where we expected or wanted to be. So, what that tells us is that we we need to continue and we can keep doing these and we did today do another large increase as we approach the level that we think we need to get to and we're still discovering what that level is but people are writing that down In the recipe where they think policy needs to be so that that's how that's how we're thinking about it Let's go to Colby.

Thank you Neil. A number of commentators have come to the view and including over the world bank that simultaneous global tightening around the world is creates a risk of a global recession that's worse than is necessary to bring inflation down.

But then of course it bounce back well hey that's good we're gonna get inflation but under control but then pal comes out and actually says the economy is out of balance and a big part of what he's talking about is getting examples of those out of balance numbers and that's why we have inflation and we're gonna keep going until we get into balance and I think on I think the markets are saying okay we do need to Back into balance.

We typically see jobs growing even during a recession but the labor force grows more. So, it could be bad but it's not necessarily as bad as those numbers would seem to suggest and I think ideally given the strength that the economy and the job market, Probably where it's gonna come from not mass job losses but simply slower growth. And staying on this trajectory at Pal said that no one knows whether this process will lead to a recession or if so how significant the recession would be and said that's going to depend on how quickly wage and price inflation precious come down when you look at things like wages do we get me indication that they're moving Rexton at the Fed wants right now We've seen real wage growth in particular go negative and that's obviously most we do to inflation but we're not seeing too much in the way of the mitigation of wages and more to the point when you combine wage growth with job growth when you look at the total growth in purchasing power we're not seeing any mitigation at all.

Well, for one, I think it's an incredibly Rich time to be investing and fix income especially as you contrast it to the opportunities last year where core rates were ostensibly oh in in spreads weren't much higher than that. You know, at this point, we're finding opportunities where you can invest in two-year triple A rated paper and get get nearly six%. You can buy high quality performing bonds at 80 and ¢90 on the dollar. Have a great Profile and long-term total return. So, like I said, it's gonna continue to be choppy but it's actually a very rich opportunity set for foreign vets sitting in fixed income at this point in time.

Again I I don't think we've necessarily put in the tops in terms of rates but you're looking at positive real rates that's that's actually quite attractive and relative to your reviews there's actually a number of ways you can express a high total return potential depending on your views of inflation and fed policy the fed is in this weird place where they're Absolutely will but the fed is trying to look as tough as possible.

If you could tell me what happens in China I'd probably be able to answer that question very well but China has really been a lagered or it's been behaving as though it's in a terrible recession right now if they start you know with the appetite to take up all of the 70s few years.

And Rick you really did call it yesterday when Putin put off that address that we were expecting something big to be coming so then beyond sort of condemning words do we get any sort of sense from the international community How they plan on reacting to this move? Here's the dynamic Putin clearly wants to divide Ukraine's allies and that is part of what this war over energy in Europe is all about. It is to make European citizens is extremely uncomfortable over the winter as uncomfortable as possible so that they increase political support to look can we do something? Can we make some kind of deal Ukraine, so we can resume deliveries of Russian energy. There's there's no indication so far that Putin is able to split support for for Ukraine among its allies and I think one of the thing things President Biden and his team is probably doing at the UN behind the scenes off stage is mastering as much Ongoing support for your crane as they can and that is weapons deliveries obviously but economic aid is really important.

Exactly. Good morning, Julie. So, you know, I think right now, the whole market is focused on the macro outlook. You know, what's gonna happen with the economy as a result of tighter financial conditions and high interest rates? And so, that's creating a lot of girations through not just equities but all risk assets and all market prices and so Your financials are really I think at the center of the economic outlook. You know, when people feel good about the economy, financials tend to do well when people are nervous, financials are not really a defensive area and so you're seeing that play through I think in the stocks right now and and no doubt there's some negative news and uncertainty in the market but Maybe take a step back and just talk about your what is happening longer term with these business models and and and also where they trading from evaluation perspective and so our view is that over the long term your higher rate will be positive you have to work through you know some of the you know near term uncertainty but Where already pricing these stocks so this isn't the beginning of the sell off they're already down for the most part on the big bank side 25 to 30% from their highs ",https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TPvH7FUw7-4,2,2022-09-23 13:52:27

Hello there, I wanna start with oil prices actually because the move that we are seeing today is fairly remarkable Oil here right now down almost six% for WTI below $80 a barrel so that's the first time we've seen going below that threshold in quite some time here you have the 3 month chart four crude oil prices and this is really feeding over into what we are seeing in terms of the groups within the S and P 500 as well As I'm trying to figure out how to get us to the sectors here. I'm going the wrong direction. Apparently, here we go. As we go down to the sectors, we are seeing energy stocks really under pressure here. Energy stocks down about Right now, they were down as much as six. Four% as a group earlier in the session. So, this again, I really wanna put a fine point on this. This is the best Group of the year. We have been seeing oil prices, slide gasoline at the pump, has slid as we've talked about before for 100 straight days before pausing in that slide, but if this is any indication for what we are seeing with oil prices and energy stocks, we could continue to see a cap on gasoline prices by extension. Here's the year in nature chart. Still 28% for the year. So, really important move here that we are seeing today in energy prices is really a breakdown in the stocks. Consumer discretionary also under pressure today. That's the your date. It's exactly the inverse down 28%. And still down today and then real quick check on builder on the material stocks.

Same way to compete more with TikTok and so, Is this really going to result in people moving away from TikTok creators moving away from TikTok to go over to YouTube shorts? You know, I think that's their goal obviously. I think they're giving away what 45% of their revenue is or their ad revenue is meant to be going towards creators which is I've talked to creators who are in the creator fund for TikTok and they are not seeing numbers even close to that like for a creator to make it on their own what they're often finding is that they have to do some brand deals like they have to work From businesses if they wanna actually make a living off of TikTok.

Well Kiko it's almost impossible to know that and in all honesty none of us know what the real price points gonna be for Netflix we don't know how they're gonna market it Rising price sensitivity amongst Netflix customers and we've seen declining satisfaction at least on their most mature markets like the US and then when we look at what the other streaming companies are doing they're able to generate five to 10 Subscription pricing by 2 to 3 dollars and still generate more revenue per user because they can get $five plus an adreb new per So we got something that kinda addresses the price sensitivity and is positive for unit economics.

We were expecting that turn around to really happen at this at this meeting. But indeed another 75 and and continuing to November.

1990,"Thing for them. They will risk a recession if that is what is needed in order to get inflation down. Ultimately we think that is what will be needed and that a recession happens by the middle of next year. But it really I think from a the perspective they need to get inflation, pressures down, they need to have very clear convincing evidence That that inflation is back on a path down toward their target in order to pivot at some point where I'm more delish messaging but ultimately we don't think that that's happening this year. We think it's destroyed for next year once a recession. And there's dynamics are are far clear. Now we got some commentary or or speak I believe it was on Friday from from J Pal saying that we might be heading to a new economic normal what is that look like in your estimation And how long might it last Sure so I think we we have two things to focus on from the Fed's perspective. It's the near term how did it deal deal with high inflation, a very tight labor market, and how they get inflation back down closer to two%. That dynamic we think ultimately works its way out with a recession with a Fed tightening bar, aggressively Probably rising to somewhere between five and a half and six% and then I think there's a second Climate change policies are all likely to be supported permanently perspective I think one thing that the economies also currently dealing with is not enough labor supply. It's a key driver of high wage growth. You see firms that still need to find workers. Job openings are near record high levels. And I think those two things together tell you potential growth in the Is likely lower going forward. ",https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BpyHDEpJomQ,53,2022-09-26 17:36:26

Should help to bring down inflationary pressures but most of the goods inflationary pressures we've seen have been on the supply sign and supply constraints So I think it is something that helps the bed but I think the bed needs a lot more help than that.

They need credit spreads to be wider. And I think this is over the past several months. You know, the Fed gave a message at the From sea meeting. The market responded by really easing financial conditions and I think we we that triggered the feds eventual more hockey's response from CheerPal over the past several months particularly at Jackson Financial conditions it'll come through a number of channels the currency one is instantly one of them but I think the fed also needs to see tightening come through equity market Matt we're we're seeing discretionary names in the equities market right now get get a little bit of nibbling action as we kick off today's trading session in this week's trading do you believe that with indiscretionary there are some Resilient pockets than others that are perhaps not as directly impacted by either inventory or supply chain concerns as others because those are things that are definitely out of the Jurisdiction if you will Yeah I think you're having an economy that is is has multiple phases going on here.

You know, stocks have completed this round trip voyage and and and at their new all-time lows for the year. They rose over the summer but then have come all the way back and European stocks, you know, Andrea into a pair of market as equities rallied from mid June to mid August this year.

Well, that's hard to say. I think I think one of the concerns is are we going to get a mild recession or a deep one? I think a mild recession is probably more than priced in at this point. The question is, how much deeper is that going to go? Of course, that's very dependent upon central banks. Do they continue to push higher and higher wanting to be the poll volcars of their era until they get Policy rates into real Territory right now.

I think investors wanna focus on quality stocks across sectors not just trying to pick out a sector too that might be out performing one of the ways we've defined quality this year or what we call short duration stocks. Companies that get more of their cash flows in the near term than out over the next several years. So, that's a lower price to cash flow ratio. Those Even in the month of September. So, focusing on that is important. Second, I think high dividend payers. A very similar theme companies paying a high dividend generally a good cash flow and strong balance sheets. Those stocks have been doing very well this year. Not avoided losses but really I've only experienced about half the losses of the overall market. So, it's another theme investors wanna keep in mind. High dividend payers In every sector are outperforming you don't just have to go to those classic high dividend pairs and say utilities or or telecom you can find them even in the text sector the highest dividend pairs are the outperformers Jeffrey, do you have some cash on the sidelines right now like some of our viewers likely do? Are you putting money to work or should investors wait maybe for some of this volatility to calm down? Well I think it I I think you can use volatility as your friend if you if you've got a long time horizon you've got some cash I think dollar cost averaging into this type of a volatile market does make long term sense are they trying to pick a bottom is very hard you know increasingly we're seeing more value even in the bond market despite the sell out there with high yield bonds now yielding over nine% We've got you know divide to the US are now higher than they've been in quite some time.

All of it's supposed to come through economic growth. There's no real challenge to how they're gonna spend money and so basically, there's been a loss of confidence in the guilt market in Sterling.

We saw a massive rebound in data surprises and data expectations. Through right after the the economy started to reopen. We had a massive reflectionary trade. Because of all the stimulus we got. Now, we've seen the removal of the stimulus and some of the normalization. So, I For the next 12 months is gonna be challenging. I think the next 6 months, we still have the dollar Embedded there by 12 to 14% against specific currency pairs And Mark I just wanna quickly ask you about the new Italian Prime Minister obviously Italy the third largest economy in in Europe what are you keeping an eye on there and do you expect any shift as a result of this?

There's some economists are saying we will see significant slowing. What do you make of the fact that it has been so resilient and do we need to see it substantially slow in order to get inflation under control? Well it is an issue of supply and demand right we have more people that want to hire people than those that wanna work so that's part of the issue with the inflation and wages what I would say is we are hearing about some layoffs coming up with some companies not all companies but some and those are the individuals Have to be cautious and make sure that they've got an emergency fund a lot of cash on the sidelines to help make up for potential lost wages so it it is a little bit of a balance of two you know cities in Ascends but we'll see what happens that's that's basically what we're looking at for our clients we're telling you to be cautious to be thoughtful and almost to be Boring with where they're putting their money right now.

Yeah I think that is a best thing thing you know for example we talked about when when We're talking about how to tax billionaires more at least this is something that Democrats have wanted to do for a while and yet they're this tax plan that we had really didn't include any explicit taxes on billionaires and yet we saw you know at the top of this list for examples Amazon and Berkshire that are held largely by to a very very very mischillioners so the idea Is that if you own a corporation, it's not actually the corporation that has made worse off by taxes. It's the it can be the shareholders, it can be the customers, it can be employees, and also, so does some extent that people who own Berkshire and own Amazon. I know in all these other corporations will be made worse off and that does include a number of very famous billionaires. And in terms of the sectors that are most exposed. I know we're looking at perhaps manufacturing and some other some other sectors as well. There are certain sectors that really stand out to you here.

Jeffrey, you don't expensive work here just in terms of what companies will be affected to what extent. They will be affected.

We're all central banks are tightening in a synchronized manner but in an uncoordinated matter. And this combine tightening of monetary policy around the world We'll have consequences that I'm not sure everyone is capturing at this point. And so when you look at obviously what the feathers looking at is is backwards looking when you look at some of the CPI data and there was concern that perhaps you should sort of wait and sort of see how these things are impacting the real economy before continuing to be so aggressive what's your take on that I think all Central Banks and all policy makers right now are convinced that they need to regain control over inflation. They were all a bit late to the game in terms of tightening monetary policy in the face of what has become persistently elevated inflation and they want to regain control over the inflation and the inflation narrative. And in doing so, they will want to tighten monetary Aggressively continue doing so even if that entails some pain in the form of higher unemployment rate and has power set it below potential trend growth that means essentially that the fed another central banks are looking for a significant cooling of demand a significant tightening of financial conditions and they won't back down at Signs of an economic slowdown. If anything, that slowdown is what they want to see to hope for lower inflation.

And and sticking with the consumer in terms of where we are with supply and demand. Are we seeing any sort of leveling off at this point? Any sort of parity coming in now? We are in some sectors. We are starting to see this delicate rebalancing act taken place and as you correctly note one of the big issues right now is that there are number of sectors that are still in balanced.

In other words, some parents may argue. Well, you know, if there's any benefit, then, then, I'll accept what I think is a low risk. Another Any any risk I don't wanna risk that if if the benefit is so low. So I think I just don't think it's gonna make much of an impact anotherwise healthy young people.

They did not raise by 125 basis points at the last meeting I did not really expect Because in my mind this is a relatively davish fed So, I could bank on about 75 basis points which is what I got. The advantage of 125 basis points would have been Way ahead of the market Ahead of the curve I'm dead after they will not have to do very much. This way around they increase it by 75 the market is expecting under the 75 in November And the market will keep expecting that for a few more meetings They are going to increase even more than they would have had they given a one big move in last month Actually with that said you know we're just talking about the comments that we got from Chicago Fed President Charles Evans today about the concerns that many others have raised about moving too aggressively in too soon Obviously you weren't anticipating the 125 basis points. That's what you said. They should be doing but how big of a risk is that factor? In terms of going too quickly, when we haven't Sincerely seen Policy at least the intended impact of it take hold yet.

2060,So if you are looking for interest rate increases to come to an end or to slow down One way to do it is to have a credit event and the Fed reacts to it by saying now our job is to save the system Think about 1998 with a long term capital management which unexpectedly collapsed in the aftermath of higher interest rates earlier in the decade. Think about 2008 when Lehman brothers went down Policy shifted to ESA. And that is one of my scenarios as a possibility for the future Scenario would be that the very strong dollar Because the strong dollar reads to typically leads to financing issues and if that happens and if you have a coordinated Of supporting the dollar like we did with the plaza accord in 1985 that will be a turn around in policy as well so you need accidents to change it your knock it's not going to happen With the normal course of time Finally Shri while we're talking about the fed right now obviously we're in a global higher rate environment a lot of focus being placed on the bank of England given what has played out over the last few days the huge swing that we've seen in the pound also on the back of these tax cuts that have been propos By this new administration.

I mean, is that sort of how investors should be looking at these utility names as we go into the winter months and look at these major price likes. No i don't think so at all all of those companies profit on higher commodity prices utilities really only have their fortunes based on solid regulation and the investments that they have in their company so if the price of natural gas goes It really is a pass through from from the utility to the customer. So, it's an unfortunate situation for the customers. It also, you know, no utility likes to see bills go up. A because they don't have any benefit from it but be You know it it really it's just not good for the relationship with their customer and their and their regulator so you know again I don't I don't think you have to to worry about You know weather or not the commodity is going to to affect the the profits of these companies new certainly shouldn't be investing in utilities to say go long natural gas or or something like that These are conservative investments The you know, plenty of stocks that yield out, you know, well, over three%, have their, they're earnings growth, you know, inaccessive five% so they really the opportunity ",https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Fbqt2Pa1J9E,39,2022-09-27 16:37:16

We're out of control type one diabetes. We're even a mild illness could land them in the hospital and then thirdly the people who are immune compromise.

Instead of some controversy over having this opinion and and sharing this insight what do you think the the future outlook is for COVID vaccines are we looking at annual shots or are we still dealing with the situation where it's still pretty unpredictable? I think we have to be very good at at monitoring on a worldwide level whether there is a variant that arises that is resistant to protection against serious so so even if you've been vaccinated or naturally affected or both it doesn't matter you would still be at risk for severities and when that happens then we're starting all over again. Original yet because even though these BA four BA five variants are resistant to protection against miles east for most they aren't resistant to protection against severe disease so we're still good in that sense that original vaccine which was made against the so called Wuhan one strain which was a sprain that raised its head in in China has still worked well to protect against against ",https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NpMzGq1hnpU,38,2022-09-28 16:29:53

He also pointed to some of the novel inventions replacing intermediates with smart contracts that also require regular attention your reaction to that Yeah so that's a very interesting problem to look at right now you know the central banks give banks money to pay interest rates etcetera with crypto there's no there's no direct way to do that and they are interest generating products but they're actually I don't think the most of them are loud. I think the there's some regulatory agencies that View against that. So, you'd be interesting to see which view plans out. Building on that back to that op ed in terms of regulations you write that advanced regulations for crypto goes against the ethos but it that it would foster innovation and establish trust so my question is if the US were to come out with clear rules or regulating Would that really help riptoe blossom when we see more money funneled into the sector advancing faster adoption both on the part of corporations and consumers and ultimately does that lift us out of the crypto winter?

So, to be honest, it's very hard to tell. There's a few different prints, well, that's a few different logics here. Why is when there's high interest rate, people should want a hard cash or deposit back in your banks But the banking interest rate is nothing comparable to crippler right now with stating your general generating products And even like D five D five give you very good returns much higher than the bank and the money doesn't leave the D five protocol so the other aspect is the quick place still very much a correlated with a stock market which is actually counter intuitive But I guess today most of the crypto traders are also stock traders So when the stock market tanks and they wanna hold cash and then actually cry to market goes with it in theory they should be inversely correlated but we have not seen that quite just just yet I think it will take a couple of years to To see that. So, yeah, so it's just a few different Aspect of place very hard to predict in one shot like what are the fed policies gonna affect crypto and also yeah crypto is much more international the user based for that is much more diverse we see like in other Continents like Africa, Latin America.

The higher prices or they don't wanna wait cuz that's a new thing too. And that is not happening either. I think that this is probably not the system that is exactly ideal so we probably are just gonna have to Where it's not as if you're gonna lose customers cuz that really is the danger Auto companies as well as dealers as they're just gonna walk because someone else can offer them a car in 3 weeks and maybe at MSRP versus waiting 2 months and you know a few $1000 over on SRP Just got how much of this is because of that when we talk about the increase in cost here how much of it is because of the Consumer. Yeah i mean there's probably a few dynamics going and one is consumer driven over the years people especially in this country we've wanted larger vehicles we want more options as a result a lot of companies especially Detroit companies they shuttered their smaller car lines so that is a naturally driven the price of vehicles up and then we hit this supply short Propelled ,https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NpMzGq1hnpU,45,2022-09-28 16:59:43

Is that surprise you? Really, you know, when you look at, when you look at the numbers that the what surprising is the polling number is 70% of millennials feel they're look for support, look very favorably upon unions and that when it says surprise, I'm happy to see that.

So, you know, you know, this helps them also serve more more people faster because in the drive thru, if you're line piles up You know, people are turning away.

We can't have mortgages, you know, as as mentioned earlier up above But moving 20 basis points each day in order to have the risk of your assets classes stabilize so that's number one secondarily we need to have more certainty with respect to the bed path of future tightening and typically we see you know pretty volatile Moves in equity markets in the last couple of months leading into the fed sort of peak in the hiking cycle we're not there yet and so until we see you know more certainty with regards to a stabilization of the path of the bed hiking cycle we can't expect to see stability within equity ",https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=35iZhU71SmU,34,2022-09-29 16:13:06

What you're seeing from the consumer is a managing down in terms of their cost and so they're doing so by looking at cheaper options whether it's for food, eating more at home, At stores with bigger discounts that are you know best in class in terms of price like some of the big box retailers and and looking at you know how they they can save in terms of their discretionary spend. So I think that stocks that will do well in this environments or ones that are you know typically the trade down socks. At home stocks the big box retailers and the names that you know tend to do well in sort of risk off environments because people are really managing their cost lower and you know looking to see where they can so names that are highly discretionary like travel and leisure I think we're gonna get hit home builders I think Retailers will probably get hit as well but you know the ones that are really focused on providing essentials are the names that I think can outperform.

And it's poor countries which are for all of contribut Least to the climate crisis that are most exposed to its ill effects On that point we did get some news last week from UN Climate Week the the developed countries for long have been calling for some sort of compensation if that's the right term for the climate crisis that is envolded they would argue as a result of emissions that have been put out from major economies like the US as well as China we saw Mark come out and make some commitments on that front as well where do you stand on that in you know the US is long argue that the money could be better spent Mitigation efforts and sort of instead of just handing a blank check as they would describe it I mean where do you think Countries should be stepping in on this very issue when that humanitarian crisis you just described as already been unfolding. Yeah that's good to face this question On. The truth is that it is rich countries that have created the climate crisis. There's no doubt about that. In terms of what we need to do I'm afraid we have to do both. We have to mitigate future climate By chain decarbonizing changing taking the carbon out of energy systems in the rich world we also have to mitigate future danger by helping the poorest countries develop in a way that doesn't repeat our mistakes but we also have to adapt I'm afraid it's too late now to have a choice between ,https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=35iZhU71SmU,41,2022-09-29 16:43:20

I'm not good enough to tell you what'll happen on a day-to-day basis but I can't tell you what we're talking about with investors and that risk that we do see the market move higher in the coming quarter is very top of mine with our clients. As I said have you seen mutual funds cut risk this year we've seen cash balances among US equity neutral funds raspberry sharply we've seen hedge funds reduce their leverage I think that's the appropriate positioning to take when the fed is pushing down equities tightening financial conditions and of course the economy is slowing Where investors are hedging the risk that the market goes higher are unusually expensive so that is a major theme it's something we're talking to clients about but at the end of the day what drives We think there's effectively a ceiling on how high the equity market can go because a major equity market rally with loosen financial conditions You pretty antithetical to what the fed is trying to achieve today.

That being said, you know, I think that cryptocurrency is due tint to lead other risk assets and that they trade 24/7/. So, some people are actually looking at some analysts I've spoken to as as Babies sort of a leading and indicator that October might look better for crypto acids and potentially higher risk stocks.

Of course, the trademark bike Bike Plus and the tread but with all of that in mind you said that product is undifferentiated and too expensive so even if they do have these new partnerships only commerce front how do they eventually start to get into new homes or just get more subscribers it sounds like though you you believe that this Just going to oh. They're not going to be able to do that You gotta start with the unit economics. First, they have to produce a product that actually generates a profit and they're not doing that. So, whether or not they sell that over their website, Amazon's website, or in Dick's Sporting Good Stores, sort of doesn't matter how much you sell a product that Actually generate a profit.

Yeah I know they're absolutely gonna need more cash I mean they're burning at an alarming clip and look the bottom one on content is that it's it's expensive to produce I mean just look at the troubles that Netflix has had right people don't realize that Netflix is a terribly cash flow negative business because they capitalize all those content costs yeah content is not cheap go to original Content is expensive. So, that's not gonna save the business. And you gotta keep in mind that margins right now profit margins are negative 30%.

Like any other vaccine it's an education for the body and the other approach I write about the identical virus approach that led to the J and J as well as the AstraZeneca vaccines tats are really interesting one two that one also took years in making and I read about how the how that began really with HIV effort to to salvage we haven't Figure that one out yet but they shifted these scientists and said, okay, we can't do HIV but we're gonna get a vaccine for COVID.

What's happening in the UK the difference being is that printing money when I'm when inflation was two% is one thing printing money when it's eight and a half percent creates a whole lot more problems so I think we could see the financing problems that we saw in 2019 potentially without the fed riding to the rescue So Michael obviously we're still expecting this period of volatility to last until the third is ready to pivot or change direction in terms of if you have a short term investment horizon A longer one.
