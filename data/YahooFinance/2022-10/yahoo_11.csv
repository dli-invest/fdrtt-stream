It's the near term how did it deal deal with high inflation, a very tight labor market, and how they get inflation back down closer to two%. That dynamic we think ultimately works its way out with a recession with a Fed tightening bar, aggressively Probably rising to somewhere between five and a half and six% and then I think there's a second Climate change policies are all likely to be supported permanently perspective I think one thing that the economies also currently dealing with is not enough labor supply. It's a key driver of high wage growth. You see firms that still need to find workers. Job openings are near record high levels. And I think those two things together tell you potential growth in the Is likely lower going forward. ",https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BpyHDEpJomQ,53,2022-09-26 17:36:26

It helps to tighten financial conditions. It makes exports from the US more expensive. So it helps to reduce growth through that channel. Should help to bring down inflationary pressures but most of the goods inflationary pressures we've seen have been on the supply sign and supply constraints So I think it is something that helps the bed but I think the bed needs a lot more help than that. They they really need tight financial conditions. They need that through reel yields moving to to even higher levels. I think they need equity markets to to be lower. They need credit spreads to be wider. And I think this is over the past several months. You know, the Fed gave a message at the From sea meeting. The market responded by really easing financial conditions and I think we we that triggered the feds eventual more hockey's response from CheerPal over the past several months particularly at Jackson Financial conditions it'll come through a number of channels the currency one is instantly one of them but I think the fed also needs to see tightening come through equity market Matt we're we're seeing discretionary names in the equities market right now get get a little bit of nibbling action as we kick off today's trading session in this week's trading do you believe that with indiscretionary there are some Resilient pockets than others that are perhaps not as directly impacted by either inventory or supply chain concerns as others because those are things that are definitely out of the Jurisdiction if you will Yeah I think you're having an economy that is is has multiple phases going on here.

Well now let's take a closer look at the border market with Charles Schwab chief global investment strategist Jeffrey Kleintop so Jeffrey as you're taking a look at what markets are reacting to right now and you're really saying the currency story is the one to keep an eye on what are the currency markets telling you right now I think that's true. You know, stocks have completed this round trip voyage and and and at their new all-time lows for the year. They rose over the summer but then have come all the way back and European stocks, you know, Andrea into a pair of market as equities rallied from mid June to mid August this year. The currency market was skeptical.

Well, that's hard to say. I think I think one of the concerns is are we going to get a mild recession or a deep one? I think a mild recession is probably more than priced in at this point. The question is, how much deeper is that going to go? Of course, that's very dependent upon central banks. Do they continue to push higher and higher wanting to be the poll volcars of their era until they get Policy rates into real Territory right now.

I think investors wanna focus on quality stocks across sectors not just trying to pick out a sector too that might be out performing one of the ways we've defined quality this year or what we call short duration stocks. Companies that get more of their cash flows in the near term than out over the next several years. So, that's a lower price to cash flow ratio. Those Even in the month of September. So, focusing on that is important. Second, I think high dividend payers. A very similar theme companies paying a high dividend generally a good cash flow and strong balance sheets. Those stocks have been doing very well this year. Not avoided losses but really I've only experienced about half the losses of the overall market. So, it's another theme investors wanna keep in mind. High dividend payers In every sector are outperforming you don't just have to go to those classic high dividend pairs and say utilities or or telecom you can find them even in the text sector the highest dividend pairs are the outperformers Jeffrey, do you have some cash on the sidelines right now like some of our viewers likely do? Are you putting money to work or should investors wait maybe for some of this volatility to calm down? Well I think it I I think you can use volatility as your friend if you if you've got a long time horizon you've got some cash I think dollar cost averaging into this type of a volatile market does make long term sense are they trying to pick a bottom is very hard you know increasingly we're seeing more value even in the bond market despite the sell out there with high yield bonds now yielding over nine% We've got you know divide to the US are now higher than they've been in quite some time.

There's some economists are saying we will see significant slowing. What do you make of the fact that it has been so resilient and do we need to see it substantially slow in order to get inflation under control? Well it is an issue of supply and demand right we have more people that want to hire people than those that wanna work so that's part of the issue with the inflation and wages what I would say is we are hearing about some layoffs coming up with some companies not all companies but some and those are the individuals Have to be cautious and make sure that they've got an emergency fund a lot of cash on the sidelines to help make up for potential lost wages so it it is a little bit of a balance of two you know cities in Ascends but we'll see what happens that's that's basically what we're looking at for our clients we're telling you to be cautious to be thoughtful and almost to be Boring with where they're putting their money right now.

Yeah I think that is a best thing thing you know for example we talked about when when We're talking about how to tax billionaires more at least this is something that Democrats have wanted to do for a while and yet they're this tax plan that we had really didn't include any explicit taxes on billionaires and yet we saw you know at the top of this list for examples Amazon and Berkshire that are held largely by to a very very very mischillioners so the idea Is that if you own a corporation, it's not actually the corporation that has made worse off by taxes. It's the it can be the shareholders, it can be the customers, it can be employees, and also, so does some extent that people who own Berkshire and own Amazon. I know in all these other corporations will be made worse off and that does include a number of very famous billionaires. And in terms of the sectors that are most exposed. I know we're looking at perhaps manufacturing and some other some other sectors as well. There are certain sectors that really stand out to you here.

We're all central banks are tightening in a synchronized manner but in an uncoordinated matter. And this combine tightening of monetary policy around the world We'll have consequences that I'm not sure everyone is capturing at this point. And so when you look at obviously what the feathers looking at is is backwards looking when you look at some of the CPI data and there was concern that perhaps you should sort of wait and sort of see how these things are impacting the real economy before continuing to be so aggressive what's your take on that I think all Central Banks and all policy makers right now are convinced that they need to regain control over inflation. They were all a bit late to the game in terms of tightening monetary policy in the face of what has become persistently elevated inflation and they want to regain control over the inflation and the inflation narrative. And in doing so, they will want to tighten monetary Aggressively continue doing so even if that entails some pain in the form of higher unemployment rate and has power set it below potential trend growth that means essentially that the fed another central banks are looking for a significant cooling of demand a significant tightening of financial conditions and they won't back down at Signs of an economic slowdown. If anything, that slowdown is what they want to see to hope for lower inflation.

And and sticking with the consumer in terms of where we are with supply and demand. Are we seeing any sort of leveling off at this point? Any sort of parity coming in now? We are in some sectors. We are starting to see this delicate rebalancing act taken place and as you correctly note one of the big issues right now is that there are number of sectors that are still in balanced.

Otherwise health is a less than 65 years of age and don't have any any health problems would have booster buys you as a few more months of protection against mild illness so low risk low reward. So is it my situation where maybe someone who is considering it for their child it's up to them if they want it or is it because of other mitigation measures going away maybe the vaccine is the best option right now Well, in some ways, it's a matter of your style. In other words, some parents may argue. Well, you know, if there's any benefit, then, then, I'll accept what I think is a low risk. Another Any any risk I don't wanna risk that if if the benefit is so low. So I think I just don't think it's gonna make much of an impact anotherwise healthy young people. We really should focus on those three groups where most likely to benefit because the goal of the vaccine is to protect against serious illness. It's the only reasonable goal. It's the only attainable. We're not gonna be able to stop mild illness. We're not gonna be able to stop Transmission and then to try and do that with frequent boosters for otherwise people who are who are not likely to end up in the hospital I think doesn't make a lot of sense. What about in context of the new ravarians coming along should we be getting boosters as a result of preparing against those? That's a great question. I mean, right now that the strands that are circulating are BA four, BAfive. So, these sub variants of overcrowd. They're clearly Kylie Contagious. They clearly evade immunity in terms of protection against mild diseases but they don't evade immunity for protection against severe disease.

Since 1929, there have been 26 bear markets, 15 accompanied by a recession and as we talk about what's happening not just with the fed but also global central banks. That's still the top of mine, especially for a lot of investors who are saying, well, what is this all mean and where is Bottom. We look at where the markets have been. That's right and where we also have heard strategies say that the markets do not bottom as the fed is increasing rates or they have not seen market spot 'em as if it continues to hike rates.

They did not raise by 125 basis points at the last meeting I did not really expect Because in my mind this is a relatively davish fed So, I could bank on about 75 basis points which is what I got. The advantage of 125 basis points would have been Way ahead of the market Ahead of the curve I'm dead after they will not have to do very much. This way around they increase it by 75 the market is expecting under the 75 in November And the market will keep expecting that for a few more meetings They are going to increase even more than they would have had they given a one big move in last month Actually with that said you know we're just talking about the comments that we got from Chicago Fed President Charles Evans today about the concerns that many others have raised about moving too aggressively in too soon Obviously you weren't anticipating the 125 basis points. That's what you said. They should be doing but how big of a risk is that factor? In terms of going too quickly, when we haven't Sincerely seen Policy at least the intended impact of it take hold yet. The question is what we all mean by risk there akiko and if you are talking about the risk of a recession That risk is clearly there. There is nothing the fed can do about it.

2060,So if you are looking for interest rate increases to come to an end or to slow down One way to do it is to have a credit event and the Fed reacts to it by saying now our job is to save the system Think about 1998 with a long term capital management which unexpectedly collapsed in the aftermath of higher interest rates earlier in the decade. Think about 2008 when Lehman brothers went down Policy shifted to ESA. And that is one of my scenarios as a possibility for the future Scenario would be that the very strong dollar Because the strong dollar reads to typically leads to financing issues and if that happens and if you have a coordinated Of supporting the dollar like we did with the plaza accord in 1985 that will be a turn around in policy as well so you need accidents to change it your knock it's not going to happen With the normal course of time Finally Shri while we're talking about the fed right now obviously we're in a global higher rate environment a lot of focus being placed on the bank of England given what has played out over the last few days the huge swing that we've seen in the pound also on the back of these tax cuts that have been propos By this new administration. Where do you think the BOE moves from here and what is the risk of contagion of a misstep spilling Across borders.

Demand has been very, very solid.

I mean, is that sort of how investors should be looking at these utility names as we go into the winter months and look at these major price likes. No i don't think so at all all of those companies profit on higher commodity prices utilities really only have their fortunes based on solid regulation and the investments that they have in their company so if the price of natural gas goes It really is a pass through from from the utility to the customer.

Now, for investors out there, frame that for us, what is that look like? What does it look like for GDP?

Instead of some controversy over having this opinion and and sharing this insight what do you think the the future outlook is for COVID vaccines are we looking at annual shots or are we still dealing with the situation where it's still pretty unpredictable? I think we have to be very good at at monitoring on a worldwide level whether there is a variant that arises that is resistant to protection against serious so so even if you've been vaccinated or naturally affected or both it doesn't matter you would still be at risk for severities and when that happens then we're starting all over again. Original yet because even though these BA four BA five variants are resistant to protection against miles east for most they aren't resistant to protection against severe disease so we're still good in that sense that original vaccine which was made against the so called Wuhan one strain which was a sprain that raised its head in in China has still worked well to protect against against ",https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NpMzGq1hnpU,38,2022-09-28 16:29:53

Before we get to your opet I wanna kick off the interview with your reaction to US Federal Reserve chairs comments this morning on regulating crypto in which she said basically monetary policy normalization raising interest rates around the world has revealed structural issues with decentralized fin Really needs to be regulated properly. He also pointed to some of the novel inventions replacing intermediates with smart contracts that also require regular attention your reaction to that Yeah so that's a very interesting problem to look at right now you know the central banks give banks money to pay interest rates etcetera with crypto there's no there's no direct way to do that and they are interest generating products but they're actually I don't think the most of them are loud. I think the there's some regulatory agencies that View against that. So, you'd be interesting to see which view plans out. Building on that back to that op ed in terms of regulations you write that advanced regulations for crypto goes against the ethos but it that it would foster innovation and establish trust so my question is if the US were to come out with clear rules or regulating Would that really help riptoe blossom when we see more money funneled into the sector advancing faster adoption both on the part of corporations and consumers and ultimately does that lift us out of the crypto winter?

So, to be honest, it's very hard to tell. There's a few different prints, well, that's a few different logics here. Why is when there's high interest rate, people should want a hard cash or deposit back in your banks But the banking interest rate is nothing comparable to crippler right now with stating your general generating products And even like D five D five give you very good returns much higher than the bank and the money doesn't leave the D five protocol so the other aspect is the quick place still very much a correlated with a stock market which is actually counter intuitive But I guess today most of the crypto traders are also stock traders So when the stock market tanks and they wanna hold cash and then actually cry to market goes with it in theory they should be inversely correlated but we have not seen that quite just just yet I think it will take a couple of years to To see that. So, yeah, so it's just a few different Aspect of place very hard to predict in one shot like what are the fed policies gonna affect crypto and also yeah crypto is much more international the user based for that is much more diverse we see like in other Continents like Africa, Latin America.

The higher prices or they don't wanna wait cuz that's a new thing too. And that is not happening either. I think that this is probably not the system that is exactly ideal so we probably are just gonna have to Where it's not as if you're gonna lose customers cuz that really is the danger Auto companies as well as dealers as they're just gonna walk because someone else can offer them a car in 3 weeks and maybe at MSRP versus waiting 2 months and you know a few $1000 over on SRP Just got how much of this is because of that when we talk about the increase in cost here how much of it is because of the Consumer. Yeah i mean there's probably a few dynamics going and one is consumer driven over the years people especially in this country we've wanted larger vehicles we want more options as a result a lot of companies especially Detroit companies they shuttered their smaller car lines so that is a naturally driven the price of vehicles up and then we hit this supply short Propelled ,https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NpMzGq1hnpU,45,2022-09-28 16:59:43

Is that surprise you? Really, you know, when you look at, when you look at the numbers that the what surprising is the polling number is 70% of millennials feel they're look for support, look very favorably upon unions and that when it says surprise, I'm happy to see that.

We can't have 10 or 20 basis points move. We can't have mortgages, you know, as as mentioned earlier up above But moving 20 basis points each day in order to have the risk of your assets classes stabilize so that's number one secondarily we need to have more certainty with respect to the bed path of future tightening and typically we see you know pretty volatile Moves in equity markets in the last couple of months leading into the fed sort of peak in the hiking cycle we're not there yet and so until we see you know more certainty with regards to a stabilization of the path of the bed hiking cycle we can't expect to see stability within equity ",https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=35iZhU71SmU,34,2022-09-29 16:13:06

What you're seeing from the consumer is a managing down in terms of their cost and so they're doing so by looking at cheaper options whether it's for food, eating more at home, At stores with bigger discounts that are you know best in class in terms of price like some of the big box retailers and and looking at you know how they they can save in terms of their discretionary spend. So I think that stocks that will do well in this environments or ones that are you know typically the trade down socks. At home stocks the big box retailers and the names that you know tend to do well in sort of risk off environments because people are really managing their cost lower and you know looking to see where they can so names that are highly discretionary like travel and leisure I think we're gonna get hit home builders I think Retailers will probably get hit as well but you know the ones that are really focused on providing essentials are the names that I think can outperform.

Yeah that's good to face this question On. The truth is that it is rich countries that have created the climate crisis. There's no doubt about that. In terms of what we need to do I'm afraid we have to do both. We have to mitigate future climate By chain decarbonizing changing taking the carbon out of energy systems in the rich world we also have to mitigate future danger by helping the poorest countries develop in a way that doesn't repeat our mistakes but we also have to adapt I'm afraid it's too late now to have a choice between ,https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=35iZhU71SmU,41,2022-09-29 16:43:20

Well Hopefully those homeowners have adequate insurance protector right now and they're claims will be paid. If you have an insurance company that number one runs into Paying claims are number two is declared in solvent because of the mass losses from hurricane Ian you are protected by either the border hurricane catastrophe fund or the Florida insurance guarantee association so your claims will be paid you do not need to worry about that So what are some of the solutions then to obviously these underlying problems that already preexisted this current wave of hurricanes and storms? What we need our legislative actions that are strong enough to stop the mass flow of lawsuits until there is a legislative package in place to disincentivize these types of frivolous lawsuits being filed literally sometimes by the thousands by single Law firms. We've got a big problem and we are gonna have complete instability in the Florida market if we don't stop the fall of lawsuits.

I'm not good enough to tell you what'll happen on a day-to-day basis but I can't tell you what we're talking about with investors and that risk that we do see the market move higher in the coming quarter is very top of mine with our clients. As I said have you seen mutual funds cut risk this year we've seen cash balances among US equity neutral funds raspberry sharply we've seen hedge funds reduce their leverage I think that's the appropriate positioning to take when the fed is pushing down equities tightening financial conditions and of course the economy is slowing Where investors are hedging the risk that the market goes higher are unusually expensive so that is a major theme it's something we're talking to clients about but at the end of the day what drives We think there's effectively a ceiling on how high the equity market can go because a major equity market rally with loosen financial conditions You pretty antithetical to what the fed is trying to achieve today.

That being said, you know, I think that cryptocurrency is due tint to lead other risk assets and that they trade 24/7/. So, some people are actually looking at some analysts I've spoken to as as Babies sort of a leading and indicator that October might look better for crypto acids and potentially higher risk stocks.

Of course, the trademark bike Bike Plus and the tread but with all of that in mind you said that product is undifferentiated and too expensive so even if they do have these new partnerships only commerce front how do they eventually start to get into new homes or just get more subscribers it sounds like though you you believe that this Just going to oh. They're not going to be able to do that You gotta start with the unit economics. First, they have to produce a product that actually generates a profit and they're not doing that. So, whether or not they sell that over their website, Amazon's website, or in Dick's Sporting Good Stores, sort of doesn't matter how much you sell a product that Actually generate a profit.

Yeah I know they're absolutely gonna need more cash I mean they're burning at an alarming clip and look the bottom one on content is that it's it's expensive to produce I mean just look at the troubles that Netflix has had right people don't realize that Netflix is a terribly cash flow negative business because they capitalize all those content costs yeah content is not cheap go to original Content is expensive. So, that's not gonna save the business. And you gotta keep in mind that margins right now profit margins are negative 30%.

Like any other vaccine it's an education for the body and the other approach I write about the identical virus approach that led to the J and J as well as the AstraZeneca vaccines tats are really interesting one two that one also took years in making and I read about how the how that began really with HIV effort to to salvage we haven't Figure that one out yet but they shifted these scientists and said, okay, we can't do HIV but we're gonna get a vaccine for COVID.

What's happening in the UK the difference being is that printing money when I'm when inflation was two% is one thing printing money when it's eight and a half percent creates a whole lot more problems so I think we could see the financing problems that we saw in 2019 potentially without the fed riding to the rescue So Michael obviously we're still expecting this period of volatility to last until the third is ready to pivot or change direction in terms of if you have a short term investment horizon A longer one.

The other key driver of course is earnings and here too we think estimates are getting close to where they need to be. We've seen some pretty clear In the last several months we still think there's a little bit more downward moves likely to come but we think consensus earnings estimates are getting close to where they should be 3600 that is our newly revised year end target for this year so we think the market is pretty close to fair value Positioning in flows. And over you've seen a very very sharp D rating in markets this year and accordingly we've seen a very sharp degree of selling from our institutional investor clients this is appropriate in our view but also raises the risk that if we get some data in the next couple months that is slightly better than expected we could see a pretty sharp rebound especially as ",https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ACZtRLAJ6j4,35,2022-10-03 16:20:37

Just said don't worry about the next few weeks or what's happening from here until the end of the year but I'm gonna ask you about that because so many investors are closely watching what the fed is doing I know you said that you think the fed should pause it's a rate it should pause it's rate hikes when do you expect though the fed to pivot Well I I I wouldn't be surprised if it the November meeting they they do a raid hike that's far less than the 75 they've been doing they could do maybe 25 and 50 and I think they might take a pause after that I mean to me we're at the point where we we've had to meet sufficient tightening Rachel in the pipeline since March of 2021 we've had a tremendous drop in the money supply growth rate from 27% down to basically 4 year% on year fiscal juice was 18 and a half percent GDP back in March of 2021.

2476,One typically without a mask inflation the thing that really makes a recession much worse is that you go into it with generally sky high confidence and then you destroy confidence on main street which lengthens in deepens the recession we won't do that here because confidence is already been destroyed we're heading into a Down with confidence starting to revive which will buffer us against it a contraction overall. The other thing is if animal spirits start to revive here that's gonna run right through main street economy and also help the stock market Continuing to rise now as we look forward.

2477,"The more than five% and look at chevron as well almost six% as we see them really making gains here ahead of the Opec plus meeting in Vienna on Wednesday so here to break down what the meeting could mean for oil prices is Greg share now Pimco Portfolio manager and head of commodities so these gains that we're seeing right now we have some analysts saying look we could be looking at potentially $100 a bar soon. Do you think the same? Yeah, I think there is upside to oil right now. What is remarkable that we're talking about opac curtailing production at a time where the inventories globally are at the lower end of the historical range and you're looking at it in the market which is highly back related which is a state where the prompt prices Bob deferred prices which is typical when a market is tight and there's and consumers are willing to pay a premium for immediate delivery. If you look at the carry in the oil market succeeding 15% which is on the operator of historical range to think that Opec is taking this as a time to cut is really without historical president and if they do so, they're gonna To keep the inventories low. Which will keep upward prices. There are likely doing this to one preempt any potential demand slowdown. But also in my mind they're doing it to reflect the fact That their spare capacity is towards the bottom of historical range. It's sort of like driving a car with your foot pressed down all the way to the metal and you're starting to get feedback and vibrations in this system and I think as a result, they wanna move off of their production that they're at right now. In order to create some spare capacity in the system and create some flexibility, should there be addition Down the road. ",https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ACZtRLAJ6j4,76,2022-10-03 19:20:17
2478,"But also can lead to potentially lower oil prices in the process because it'll take some of the pressure out of the system that we have seen We're gonna what do you think of this debate overpriced caps or not? I guess how effective are they typically or do you think they would potentially be? So it's being sold right now when you're talking about oil specifically As an attempt to get around European sanctions do you agree to a price cap we'll wave some of these sanctions on an unshipping and insurance and hopefully that will grease the wheels but that is not ultimately how the market should function and I think the price cap could likely backfire in part because Russia holds a say and how much they're willing to sell and to who and at what price? And Nate and we've seen small reductions and export volumes could have outside impact and prices particularly when the market is tight. Now, in Europe, the problem is it sends the wrong incentives to the consumers. Particularly if there's some That aren't capped they will have a higher burden just to bear if the market is tight so for example if you're gonna cap residential commercial industrial end users will have ultimately higher prices to manage through the the demand rational that needs to happen Surprise caps are really not the ultimate solution Than they're hoping for.

When it comes to use market what do we learn from car max when they got hit sales were down six and a half percent they're CEO saying the consumer look to be hit by affordability what do we learn there? Well, I think, you know, used car buyers are gonna be much more price sensitive, okay? Use car buyers. They're not gonna be in the wealthy. They're not gonna be the ones buying the Corvettes and the Broncos and the Gladiators because they've got plenty of money. So, they're kinda the early indicator here and if they're falling off because they're not gonna invest in a new car now, they've decided to hold off on a big purchase. Global economy in general Horizon. So call when we look at things like affordability what consumers are willing to spend on is there a sweet spot right now in terms of the kinds of models that consumers want to buy? You know, they've always wanted flexibility and that's why SUVs become so popular over the last 10 plus years. It's the idea that one car conserves so many different purposes. So, you're still gonna always have that that SUV flexibility be one of the focuses of consumer demand and that's why so many car companies have switched Generally toward SUVs versus cars but it also means that if you're able to buy without getting an SUV if you can get by with the Sudan You get a much better price versus an SUV which everyone wants.

So again, that's the that's kind of the like profile. The next 6 months gonna be very clear Clearer not very clear you know we've been talking a lot about jobs I'm curious to ask you about housing yeah because we talk about housing a lot and how much mortgage rates have gone up and how it's there it's a problem of affordability but when you talk about it as an Driver how concerned are you about housing? Well, that is an interest rate sensitive sector so when the fed tightens or any central bank titans, it's not uniform across the economy. You're gonna look at the interest rate sensitive sectors and they should be feeling the pain first. That's housing durable goods etcetera. So, the housing starts we have a couple of funny prints recently but that should be Going down, housing demand should be slowing down as the prices should be leveling off but again, you're looking for an narrative that's gonna deceleration rather than tanking but do you know the mortgage rates are pushing seven% right now, right? Not too long ago, they were three and some of us luckily locked in lower than that but that's that's a big affordability issue. So, that should be, you know, breaking the economy But again, if people have jobs, they think they're gonna keep their jobs. They're gonna continue to spend. The moderate they're spending for, you know, lower acid prices or you know, bit higher inflation but that's the sector. One of the sectors that's on the short list. Yeah. If we start to see that really go pear shape, then Might be in the recession scenario rather than the slowdown scenario. So, we have housing prices coming into wraps. We have consumers worried about even rising interest rates and we have the market's terrible year for the markets. Many parts of it. How does this impact consumer spending into 2023?

If that's not coming down meaningfully after Sort of nice scenario we're talking about and then we get your down like Julie but I think that's not a baseline right now. Oh nope. Another contributor to that the inflationary pressures that we have seen has been energy costs as well and even as we think about what a US recession may look like, there's also what we were discussing earlier in the show in And some of the cutting and some of their production. What that may mean in Europe but also how much the European or a global recession more broadly may also trickle into the US economy. Yeah, I mean, energy, oil prices are in the 80s right On Opec's gonna talking that looks like strategically they might wanna kinda keep them in that zone but energy prices are down quite a bit right so going around town there were five handles on gas not too long ago an hour in the three so that That's source of inflation has come down the supply chain source of inflation has come down food still a bit elevated but if we put all that in sort of a non-core bucket that part of the inflation is pulling down the headline numbers but the We just talked about 2 minutes ago which is the core is still going up. So, that's gonna help. If that helps drag down the other stuff, that's good but you know, we still have a core inflation problem in this country and a lot of other countries and that's what Central Banks have to look at Other stuff is great for the headline but they're really focused on the the core.

If you look at the carry in the oil market succeeding 15% which is on the operator of historical range. To think that Opec is taking this is a time To cut is really without historical president and if they do so they're gonna continue to keep the inventories low which will keep upward prices they're largely doing this to one preempt any potential demand slow down but also in my mind they're doing it to reflect the fact That their spare capacity is towards the bottom of historical range. It's sort of like driving a car with your foot pressed down all the way to the metal and you're starting to get feedback and vibrations in this system.

I guess how effective are they typically or do you think they would potentially be? So it's being sold right now when you're talking about oil specifically. As an attempt to get around European sanctions do you agree to a price cap we'll wave some of these sanctions on shipping and insurance and hopefully that will grease the wheels but that is not ultimately how the market should function and I think the price cap could likely backfire in part because Russia holds to say and how much they're willing to sell and to who and at what price? And Nate and we've seen small reductions in export volumes could have outside Particularly when the market is tight. Now, in Europe, Album is it sends the wrong incentives to the consumers Particularly if there's some That aren't capped. They will have a higher burden to to bear if the market is tight. So, for example, if you're gonna cap residential, commercial, industrial end users, we'll have ultimately higher prices to manage through The demand ration that needs to happen so price caps are really not the ultimate solution That's gonna rebalance the market and unfortunately it could lead to more volatility and then they're hoping for it.

Michael highly recommend you check out some of the memes and gifs of those millions of people waiting to play. Twitter is entertaining right now as far as overwatch too but I think you answer my question there about Future of this activism merger Microsoft acquisition. They they launched a website yesterday just basically to PR the acquisition and what it does for the gaming community. That's not generally a good sign. Why is this taking so long and when do you think it gets approved? It warms my heart that you say jiff which is the correct way to say it by the way. No, it's taking so long because the the government Starting to actually do its job and I think, you know, we had 4 years where where government agencies got out of the way and let businesses do whatever they how they wanted. We now have a different administration. I think the FTC is watching out for the consumer and making sure that if a combination goes through that it doesn't result in a lowering Competition.

I think that tech companies suffer from the delusion that if they're good at one thing they can be good at everything and so that's clearly that clearly was Google's problem that's clearly Netflix is problem In 2001 they they did a little better with the Xbox 360 in 2005 and then a lot better you know the Xbox one and the Xbox series X but they they figured out that they need to really own Content to be good and it took them literally 15 years to have great content and that then they wanna Netflix isn't going to do it by building one game at a time and they're not gonna do it by buying little tiny, you know, mobile game developers. Anybody who wants to be in this business is gonna have to make a splash. So, the answer to your question is Yes consolidation is likely if a big tech company decides they wanna be in this I don't think Netflix has the assets or the appetite to go spend you know 6070 one 1 billion dollars Amazon maybe but they you know they're they're pissing money down a whole trying to build games themselves and they're doing a really Job at it.

Also, there were some discussion with his brother, Kimball Musk saying that there was this blockchain idea that there would be a paid a tweet so that it would be recorded much later than goes back, walks out back and say, no, that's not gonna really be possible because of And see issues that the platform has to chug along much quicker than that from a programming standpoint also for those concerned that to Dan's point that there would be not enough speech moderation musk on April 28 said this to an investor Michael Kive's he said Twitter is obviously not going to be turned into some right wing nut house aiming to be Oddly inclusive as possible. Do the right thing for the vast amount of majority of Americans. So, he is saying that he does realize that content moderation has to happen Really quickly down the timing of this obviously weeks before that court case was set to begin but also just about a month out from the midterms.

That's gonna put a little bit of a crimp in the people who are looking for a fed plaza or a fed pivot. It gives us likely to drive inflation at least stabilize inflation to higher level There is another catalyst looming in December when you've got those sanctions on Russian oil taking effect obviously these headlines coming out of G seven countries saying they maybe they wanna try and phase that in to to try in limits Impact to the markets overall but how much of that has actually already been priced in, you think? Well, I think a decent amount of it again. I was short crude oil prior to the leaks of opac potentially cutting by a one 1 million. My prediction was there were going to cut by a one 1 million a half and be able to sort of go out of the public and say we're actually trying to help our allies as best we can by not cutting two 1 million barrels. It didn't do that. They went ahead with My own barrel. So, from a perspective of what's going on with the future output of production. They've already been missing their current production quota. So, there's two 1 million barrel cuts really only gonna be about 800 1000 to a one 1 million if they actually were to reach maximum here So, the length of it is disturbing to me. The length of time that they're going to do this because this means that it can do and they're they've announced they're gonna have meetings every other month now. Which prior to that, they said that they would be at a need to know basis. Every other month means they can adjust as both up or down and it seems like they're target is more to Production now.

Production certainly key when you consider how depleted SPR already is. You know, there's a political backdrop to all this which is of course that trip the president made to Saudi Arabia over the summer. You know, we saw in the bath aftermath of that Opec Plus just increasing production just slightly but now you've got this What is considered you know more than expected two 1 million barrels a day production cut what does that mean in terms of the US relationship with the Saudi's well it's obviously iceier than it used to be and let's let's not forget that this goes back to the murder of the journalist Kamal Kashoji Jamalka Shoji a few years ago Turkey a perpetrated by the Saudi regime so Biden described the Saudi government and their leader Muhammad Bidzelman as a state in when he was running for That obviously reflected deteriorating relations and then he had to go over there kind of kind of taking it back and saying could you please release a little more oil they basically Said no. So, you know, there's a there's a lot this market is huge and very dynamic and you're one of the things that has gotten the Saudi's attention is increased production in the United States. The United States is still the world's largest producer of oil. It became the first largest producer a couple of years ago and it still is. But the government here doesn't control the oil sector. That's a big difference. So, the government here can't say pump more, pump less. That's up to the private sector and all the incentives there. So, very dynamic market.

Well I think there's a number of things starting with Opec Plus concerned about the world going into a recession which impart was caused by high energy prices earlier this year when we saw crude oil places rallied in between 130 and $140 a barrel as well as the high natural Industrial output so I think they wanted to take a preemptive step to reduce production in light of declining demand Higher inflation rates eating into their budgets.

2676,"They have all the money they need in terms of deposits. The banks that do compete aggressively are the smaller institutions. So, it's not the one that has a branch on every corner, not the one that has its name on the stadium, but smaller institutions, we see rates as high as 301%. Now Institutions like dollar savings direct UFB direct these are completely federally insured so I say move your money over to these and get that risk free return No a lot of people obviously more comes through with some of these bigger bags that they recognize but as you mentioned, they're not seeing the returns. How important is it to shop around at the moment? It's really important because there is an arms race going on at the high end of the savings market. By the way, I think these rates are even more attractive than CDs because they're liquid. You could get three. Six% on a 1 year CD but you could get 301. On a totally liquid, federally insured, Savings account and these rates could continue to go higher too because banks do compete but you're not gonna get anything pretty much by just sitting in the big bank. The average there is 014. So, what you wanna do is shop around, look for federal insurance, and look to tie this to your checking account. I think that's a good You may keep the big bank checking account for ATM access and other things. Link it to a savings account. Park your emergency savings there. You could get at least a few $100 a year. You know, if you save $10 thousand over the course of the year at three%, that's 300 bucks.

And I also wanna ask you about some of these credit card balances and loans and things that people are starting to take out as they now are dipping more into their savings than ever as inflation starts to bite. What should people be aware of? And what are you tracking when it comes to things like credit content? The average credit card rate is about 18 and a half percent now that's the highest in 30 years balances have been going up as well According to the New York Fed as of Q two they were four percentage points below that all time high which was set in late 2019 but they did take up 13% from Qtwo of last year to queue to of this year we're gonna get the queue three data soon I think that could well show a record but this is another one of those kind Counterintuitive things that despite the highest rates in 30 years despite what could soon be an all-time record for credit card balances delinquencies remain very low the debt to income ratio remains very low The industry is thinking about this in terms of normalization. You know, yeah, these delinquencies are gonna go up but so far the the thinking is that it won't be in a worry some sense. It'll be maybe back to 2019 levels. The strong job market definitely helps.

2682," in some cases they're just absolutely shocking but you know of course it was almost a week ago we got that car max report and and the stock was absolutely. So I just don't want folks to forget about that because we're going into earnings season coming up we're going to get results from a car vano in an automation in that car max report I think was very disturbing so let's pull some stats here and we're getting a lot of weakness in the used car market and a lot of this data comes from manheim. Noting that wholesale used vehicle prices fell 2.3 per cent per cent per cent from August in the first 15 days of September so prices are really starting to to come down here as I think a lot of would be buyers are blocking it some of the interest rates are getting on these loans in many cases above a seven percent price declines according to the manheim index the steepest in full size and sports car in sports cars some of the higher so some of the higher priced offerings here and we have that manheim chart two now of course we saw a big spike and used car vehicle prices at a lot of the market and we saw a big spike and used car vehicle prices at around the pandemic is everybody needed a car they wanted a car they were out there traveling more they were doing stacations or just staying home now they've also then they also when they start to return to the office they went out there and bought cars they don't want to take public transportation but now all those dynamics I would argue are no longer in play at the extent they were we're now we're seeing prices come down alongside of a slowing economy now the losers from the slow down in the use vehicle market or of course car max where there's very ugly report auto nation is pretty much the same as car max in terms of business model carvana the online focused retailer of used vehicles and then you have a hurts and a Davis now why did I include them in here because you know a lot of times their stocks trade off the perceived value of the inventory or the car inventory that hurts in in avis own so those car prices are coming down that's less of a valuation or less value assigned to the hurts and avis budget rental fleets or their inventories over a good quote here so I'll just add to from Adam Jonas Morgan Stanley noting car max might be first on and feeling the impact of the use car decline but we expect the entire retail auto retail franchise and auto credit complex to follow so something to keep in mind from Adam my take is this auto retail stocks are probably dead money for right now I know if you're happy there I'm getting ready to go out for crews my sunglasses on but still it's going to be hard to find positive catalyst for some of these names in the coming months. You know it's really interesting on especially the use car side when we think about the rental parts of that business that you mentioned to I almost bought my first car from enterprise actually because I had known and there are a lot of people out there that take advantage of this after they do find out that it hurts that a avis that an enterprise that they actually do sell used cars because sometimes they're just trying to work through old inventory that they have in order to get newer vehicles that are going to be able to be rented out and have better maintenance cycles over a longer period of time knowing how many times those keys are changing hands to. Did you buy it? I didn't know. I didn't. I didn't. I didn't. I was about to have like throw out 300,000. They have a lot of models.

2683," oke October already shaping up to be a volatile month after the S&P 500 posted its worst monthly return since March 2020 in September. Our next guest says any future rallies in the market will be muted. She says, let's bring you BlackRock America's eye shares investment, a strategy head, Gargie Chaudry, Gargie, it's good to see you. Fade those rallies, you say. Why should folks be thinking that way? Good morning, Julie. Good to be here. So I think that a few times we've seen this deal already that the market has prepositioned for a Fed pivot. And what we've learned over and over again from the various Fed because that has spoken this week and previously is that they're not quite ready to do that yet. So to the extent that we're not getting a fully dovish pivot from the Fed, I think any time that the equity market rallies like it did the first two days of October with those two massive moves that we hadn't seen since April 2020, every time we see moves like this, I think we're supposed to fade them. Now look, I'll say that you're still supposed to be invested in certain corners of the equity market. But broadly, I think that there will still be some more volatility and pain ahead, especially as we continue to see the data slow down and perhaps even grapple with the recession. Would you believe prompted some of the early quarter rally that we'd seen? Yeah, I think that some of that was just positioning. I think a lot of people, as you guys know and talk about often, became really bearish. So there was that crazy price action, I would say. And some of that was just positioning. So a rally based on just the short positioning out there. Some of it was like I had said earlier that this expectation or this view that the Fed would pivot, think back to two months ago where we did see one soft CPI print and we saw a huge amount of rally in the equity markets on the back of that. Then of course, last month, we saw a very strong CPI print and we gave back a lot of that rally. So I think this back and forth between the direction of rate and between the direction or the estimation of a pivot from the Fed is going to drive equity markets in the future. And I still believe that we are going to continue to see a little bit of slowing down. I mean, earnings growth will have to slow from here. And I think that's still going to play out in the equity market. So stay invested. Be in minimum volatility, be in energy equities, be in healthcare. But broadly, is this rally going to persist? I don't think so. And Gargi, we just are hearing from Neil Cash.",https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ahmy7qqS3zQ,2,2022-10-06 13:57:57
2684," be an energy equities, be in healthcare. But broadly, is this rally going to persist? I don't think so. And Gargi, we just are hearing from Yelp Keshkari who's participating in a Q&A. The head one that caught my eye sort of echoes what you've been talking about. He said the bar to shifting our stance on policy is very high. You know, it sort of emphasizes, right? Don't get ahead of yourself folks and look for the pivot. If their bar is very high to shifting their stance, what are you looking for for them to go over that bar? What signals are you looking for from the economic data that actually would cause maybe, okay, let's not even say a pivot, even a pause or a slow down in their strategy. Sure thing, Julie. I think that's the most important question. And I think the Fed has tried to be transparent about it. So they will need to see, or their expectations of inflation will need to come down. They will need to see a few months of data where inflation is decelerating, not accelerating, and moving closer to that target of 2% on 4 BCE. We haven't seen that yet. And again, one number does not print things. So it will have to be a more of a three or four prints of decelerating inflation, certainly on the core inflation. So that's number one. Another way in which I think we could, so that's the most important. But secondly, I think that the Fed could pause, again, not pivot, maybe just stay, stay with it, if you will. I think they would, if they started to see a significant slowing in the labor market. And that's something that the Fed has made very clear that they want to see the labor market slow down. Now, if we see a couple of months of maybe a hundred thousand prints on the payroll, I think that's possible that we can hear the Fed talking about a slow-up out of policy or a pause in the months ahead. But again, it's not one month. It's a few months. And then finally, I think we did, obviously learn a lot from the Bank of England. We are not in the same position as the UK at all, they're different dynamics in the market. But I will say that if there is any kind of market functioning questions that arise in the US, and again, we're not there now. But if that does happen in 2023, I think that could be a way in which the Fed indicates to us that they will not be raising rates in a significant manner, or at least that the bar has come down. Gary, we're coming up against two interesting market moving events. We have the Fed meeting November 2nd, and then a couple of days later, we have the midterm election. So let's say this, let's say the Fed comes out here, reiterates their hawkish tone. We get that out of the way. Next day, after the elections we learn, we're going to have divided government. What happens to the stock market in your view into your end? I think it's going to be very difficult for the stock market to have the rallies that we saw in the first two days of October in that situation. Now look, a lot of things will drive the stock market. I don't want to base it entirely upon the Fed and elections only. Obviously, we have a blockbuster earnings season. That's something that will obviously be a big driver of the market. But all of a sequel, if you're just giving me a hawkish Fed and a divided government, I think it's just going to be really hard for the equity market to make new highs or to get back to levels that we had seen perhaps in the second quarter of this year with that framework. I think we really need to see a fundamental shift in the earnings picture where earnings growth is very healthy across all sectors. And I just don't see how that happens when we have an economy that is slowing down because the Fed wants it to. All right, thanks, Gargie. Good to catch up with you. BlackRock America's I-Share's investment strategy head, Gargie Chaudry. Thanks so much. Coming up, the recent surge in mortgage rates is causing Americans to rethink, home buying, will the rates stay at these levels? We actually have a little bit of relief, maybe.

2685," is Welcome back to Y'all of Finance. I'm Brian Saazi here with Julie Heimann and Brad Smith markets are tiptoeing into Friday's crucial jobs report. It's seen some mixed action across the board amongst the major indices but for right now at this particular moment in time, all three major indices in the red. Julie over to you with some breaking news on a market. You follow very closely that is mortgage rates. Well now I do like everyone 6.6% 6.66% is now the average 30 year fixed rate mortgage according to Freddie Mac that information just coming out. It is a very very slight improvement over the 6.7% that we talked about last week as Freddie Mac's chief economist points out rates remain quite high compared to just one year ago. Meaning housing continues to be more expensive for potential home buyers. This is something that we have talked a lot about the real world implications of having these higher mortgage rates that are more than double where they were a year ago. The people are just going to pay a lot more over the life of the mortgage. It also means by the way that housing prices are starting to come down as a result because if someone is paying overall more for financing the house then what's got to give in many cases it's the home prices and the demand that we have seen also has been falling to some extent. Yeah, it continues to be more expensive for potential home buyers here. Freddie Mac also noting that they're going to make some enhancements to their market survey really improving and looking at some of the collection quality diversity of data use. It seems like kind of mirroring what we had seen from ADP earlier. This year over the summer this is a time to really get a better sense of how accurate the data still is and still as of right now for some of these rates it does still point to what we all expected and still some home buyers are experiencing is the higher rates that they're having to pay for an extended period of time which is kind of barring out. And it's just the average if your credit isn't up to snuff right. You're paying way more than this. Maybe last year at this point if your credit wasn't good what maybe you pay five or six percent now what do you eight nine ten. One thing to point out is people do refinance. They're mortgages right. So if rates do if you buy a house at this rate and then rates go down then you can many people can then refinance. So that is one little.",https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ahmy7qqS3zQ,4,2022-10-06 14:06:50
2686," So if you buy a house at this rate and then rates go down, then many people can then refinance. So that is one little more positive tone here. All right, let's talk about the implications of all of this and the implications of higher rates on the economy overall. For that we bring in Kenneth Rogoff. He is Professor of Economics at Harvard University. He's joining us now, Ken. Thank you so much for being here, first of all. Here is sort of a very visible real world impact of Fed policy, right? The rate increase that we have seen in mortgages specifically and the effect that the knock on effect that has on the housing market. What do you think overall about the effectiveness of Fed policy with fighting this current bout of inflation? Well, we haven't had them fight about of inflation in a very long time. So whatever models we had, we have to dust off and see. I think we know that their long lack of facts, yeah, it hits the markets very quickly. It's equity markets, more slowly, housing markets, but things like employment, the peak effects can be a year off. So it's very hard. It's one of the things that makes it so hard for the Fed to get to a soft or soft-ish landing, which I'm pretty skeptical about. Okay, and so with your skepticism about getting to a soft-ish landing, what would the reality of the economic detriment incurred be if we were to see what many economists are calling for a recession in mid-2023? Well, I mean, I think it could be pretty brutal if the Fed really is hell-bent on having inflation come down as quickly as possible to two or two and a half percent. We have Europe very likely going to recession China. It leads to growth recession by all measures for the Amor recession. That's a lot of pressures on us, the dollar is very strong. And interest rates are rising very fast. So I think the idea that it's going to be a really mild recession if that would be lucky. I'd say it could be a tough trade-off for the Fed once the numbers start setting in. I'm a little worried that having gone the wrong way in one direction with the change in their framework and not looking at the unemployment and what that was saying about inflation, they're now going in the other direction and possibly moving too fast given the long legs. Professor, if the economy does get brutal, like you just suggested, do you think this is a Federal Reserve at some point next year that is back to unwinding these aggressive rate hikes they've been taking recently? So here's the thing. Yes, but I think where we're going to land at the end of this and now I'm looking maybe two years ahead is that a level of interest rates higher than we're used to even after inflation comes down. The real interest rate, the premium of the interest rate over the inflation rates, been extraordinarily low since the financial crisis. Some people say it's secular stagnation, demographic, low productivity inequality, what have you. I think if you look at a long horizon, in fact it was abnormally low in that period and we're going to get some moving back to being meaning that interest rates even when they start coming down, they not come down all that much. So how do we then determine what the sort of natural or stable rate should be, right? Is there any way of sort of gaming that out what that could look like? Very tough. My own research sort of speaks to the 10-year rate which I think will end up in a higher place than we've been used to before the pandemic. But what's going on with the Fed funds rate with all the regulation and the financial repression is a little hard to say. So they really have no idea that's one of the things that's making it difficult. But if you're asking, I think it'll be higher than we're used to. For consumers right now, what should they be navigating? How can they best navigate perhaps even leading into the scenario that you've described? I mean, it's a tough picture. We're probably...",https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ahmy7qqS3zQ,5,2022-10-06 14:10:44
2687," perhaps even leading into the scenario that you've described. Well, I mean, it's a tough picture where probably headed towards a, you know, difficult situation coming out of a difficult situation. Certainly, I think employment is the key. Everybody's been particularly young people can moving jobs, you know, every six months or a year. They better think twice about that in this period when it might not be so easy to land on another job. Can I want to switch gears a little bit because you focus not just on the US, but on the globe as well. And you and some others are just out with some really interesting research on the real estate market in China. Now, so much, there's been so much attention on the sort of zero COVID policy and the negative effect that's having on China. But there's some underlying risk here that you illustrate in this research. We're looking now, you look at so-called tier three Chinese cities, some of the smaller cities, although still pretty large, and that there's this excessive housing stock and that there's been really a sharp slowdown in prices and housing prices in those areas. What kind of risk is this presenting for the Chinese economy? Well, I think it's a huge long-term problem with or without the zero COVID policy. Housing, real estate, more generally, commercial real estate infrastructure has been the go-to policy for China. I did some research a couple of years ago, peak China housing, showing all the factors that suggested we really have come to an end of it. And more recently, my co-author and I've shown that a lot of that is concentrated in the more hidden tier three cities, the Cincinnati's of China, so to speak. But they out, let me say the Cincinnati's of China could be five and ten million people, maybe since the United States of few hundred thousand, and on top of that, there are a lot of them. They account for 60% of GDP. You don't see it that people travel to the big cities, they're less visible, but they have, they really have a problem where they've been building like crazy and are sort of getting to the end of the line of that development strategy, and it's not that easy for them to pivot. And so what then happens when we do see China coming out of zero COVID, at the same time that the rest of the globe is slowing down or even entering recession. I mean, do we see sort of a circular effect here where China's troubles maybe exacerbate the troubles of the rest of the globe? China's been enormously important for the rest of the globe. It's counted for, I don't know, like a quarter of all global growth over the decade before the pandemic may be going into the first year, at least according to the IMF, and those days are over. I think we're looking at much slower growth in China, who knows what the real numbers are, but much slower growth in China for years to come. And of course, it matters. I mean, it hits commodity exporters, the hardest, that they have a raracious appetite for commodities, but European luxury car makers, et cetera. I think it's going to have a very big effect. And that's even without the Ukraine war and whatever happens there and which side China ends up on. Can we go off, Professor of Economics at Harvard University. Thanks so much for the insights and the forecast and calculations, all of it, great conversation. Guys, let's get to the Iowa finances and that's for over at the Wi-Fi Interactive with a look at what's taking place here on the day and that is what we're tracking. And you guys were just talking about those markets, right? And just looking at the home builders, we did see a little bit of action here with some of these home builders that had been in green territory. Now losing some of that steam, I just want to also pull up a year-to-date chart so you can see how much these home builders have lost year-to-date. Looking at the sector action, we are seeing the markets down right now, so you're looking at utilities and also real estate, which are moving to the downside. You've got energy, though, that is still in green territory. And over on the NASDAQ 100, some of these mega caps that had been in green earlier are now a bit under pressure in video had been more than 1% earlier now losing some steam. Also looking at some of what's happening with our trending tickers because we've got two trending tickers that we should mention on our trending ticker page.

That is putting pressure on stocks. And on those trending, we are seeing Pinterest that's trending right now. Number one on our Yahoo Finance page. That's after that Goldman call. But also want to check out Costco because Costco's September sales came in higher than expected. So you're looking at those sales that increasing for Costco. And the stock right now up more than 1% year to date also outperforming the broader markets because that's chewy. But you're today Costco down 14% still outperforming the broader markets. You can tell consumers still want to get value big bulk. They love Costco. I love those hot dogs and as for a thanks for saving me to appreciate it because we're here before we had to break. You saw on that board, a nice highlight of chewy. Let's put a spotlight on the impressive wheat so far for shares of chewy. Sock is up close to 20% on the week. We're seeing it add to gains a little bit here on the early going. Dusting the Nasdaq Composites 5.5% gain. The online pet retailer, Stock, got a big boost on Wednesday, especially into the close as data from investment research out that Yippet found chewy sales trending above expectations for the current quarter. We will note that chewy in late August slashes full of your sales outlook by a couple hundred million dollars in stock. Got absolutely clobbered. Coming up. Sorry, I was just going to say I just bought some handouts. It's really so good. Amazon versus chewy. Alright, let's take that discussion off on a very interesting topic. Alright, coming up.

2689," Let's get down to business now with some other headlines we're watching. Uber's former security chief Joseph Sullivan has been found guilty of obstructing an FTC probe for failing to report a 2016 data breach to authorities. Prosecutor said he took steps to cover up the incident, classifying the hack as a bug bounty rather than a data breach. Sullivan's legal team said that after the hacker signed non-disclosure agreements, the security chief felt the incident did not need to be reported. The Sullivan now faces a five-year prison sentence for obstruction, and up to three years for failing to report a felony. That data breach, by the way, occurred during Travis Kalinick's term as CEO, where top performers were often given a blind eye. Meanwhile, General Electric is restructuring the company laying off workers at his offshore wind unit as it grapples with weak demand, rising costs, and supply chain delays according to reports. The cuts are expected to affect 20% of the offshore wind unit's US workforce, which equates to hundreds of workers. Wind has been GE's largest and most profitable renewable business, but the expiry of renewable energy tax credits took a big toll on demand. And Ford is raising the price again for its electric F-150 lightning pickup truck. The second time in the last couple months, the chief is versioned. Now retails were just under $52,000, that's a roughly 30% increase from the original starting price of about $40,000 with first-win on sale in May. Ford said in his statement, the increase is on the result of ongoing supply chain constraints, rising material costs, and other market factors. So as. Fitter shares continue to trade below Elon Musk's $54.20 offer price, as there is still fears on a deal getting done. Let's get more on this with City's Senior Alistair, Ron Josie, Ron. Good to see you here, just based on your knowledge of the situation, folks, you have talked to, do you still think this deal gets done at that price? You know, we were pretty, the big news this week was around coming together, both parties suggesting with Elon saying we will honor our original $54.20 share offer and Twitter come out, coming out specifically and saying that it's something that we are looking to do as well. So the fact that they are both negotiating table, not in court going against each other, I think that's a positive step. And it seems to me, it's just a matter of time until something happens in this deal seems to be on the path to being consummated. So that would be our view overall. What's the reality of any changes that would be made to Twitter and when that would actually take place, even if and as this does kind of continue to work its way through? Yeah, I mean, if something were to happen, meaning that if it is acquired by Mr. Musk and if we go through and it's a now private company, look, unfortunately this has been in the public world now that this acquisition back in force and call it March or April, I believe, with the initial deal initial offer there. And so Twitter has gone through quite a bit of change from then until now, not only from a business perspective with advertisers potentially pulling back, maybe getting a little bit more nervous, some placing ads on Twitter, in addition to the macro changes that are happening out there, but then internally, there's just a lot of concern in our view around morale, around basically attrition or just getting things done in new products being launched. So your question of how long would it take to sort of get the business back up to speed? Frankly, it would take probably some time to rebuild and the macro environment would not help in the current environment where advertising continues to be a little bit of a software subject overall. And Ron, we don't even know what he's going to do with the company, right? I have to say, man, it must be tough analyzing this company right now. You didn't know if the deal was going to get done. You don't know what Elon's going to do if he does indeed consummate the deal, right? I mean, we've gotten some hints dropped. There's been a lot of speculation. Trump's going to come back. He's talked about this, everything app X, whatever. But like, how do you, how do you even model concretely in a situation like this? Well, it'll be a lot easier for them internally as a private company. So you wouldn't have to talk to folks like myself to model and figure out what's next. But you essentially have to rebuild the business, right? So you start, I'm sure the first my order of business is to look at the product to your point, see what can be done to make it more user friendly, to get more users on the same thing. If your business is veryать that you will be able to live in depressed memories. See, you continue.",https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ahmy7qqS3zQ,8,2022-10-06 14:24:12
2690," So you start, I'm sure the first my order of business is to look at the product to your point, see what can be done to make it more user friendly, to get more users on the service onboarding with something that was a big focus prior to this saga that we're incurring currently. And so number one would be product. Number two then is figuring out how you best monetize. And right now the model is primarily advertising. But of course, there's options around subscription. There's options around maybe payments or something along those lines purchases. So there's different things you can do. But I think day one, whenever this comes to a conclusion has to be let's focus on the product. Let's make sure it becomes that, call it town square, open free marketplace, and then everything else should follow. But it's not something that I think happens overnight. It's likely to take some time. Ron, is there an appetite in the marketplace for this super app concept that Elon is pushing here? Do consumers want to, let's say, go into Twitter, tweet, then also maybe get taken to trade some stocks on XYZ platform, and then order an Uber, and then a hamburger for dinner. I mean, do people really want that? Yeah, it's interesting. The super apps here in the West haven't really taken on as much as they have, taken off as much as they have over in Asia and other parts of the world. And so that definitely is a TBD overall. Partnerships to allow things along those lines that would build off of what you see on Twitter make sense. You can see that happening. But one super app, it's a change in use case, right? And the thing with Twitter that haven't covered the company for a while now, and looking at it quarter in, quarter out, the number one thing is a product, be those monetizable daily active users. And so the more you can do to get those users on board, everybody knows Twitter. What's always surprising is you would think it would have a bigger footprint overall. And so that's the in terms of users. And so that's probably the job number one. And if the super app does that, that's a big question. But frankly, it's still too early to even offer that. And I think you're right, it would have to be something that would at least be in line to what you are looking for and consuming while on Twitter. And there's partnerships that can make that happen. But it's definitely, I would say, the product is that that's on the roadmap for down the road. Once everything settles for the most part. Is it possible that after all of the dust is settled, that Twitter in privacy becomes a media company? And I mean, a media company with partnerships that can actually charge people for the ability to watch video content, whether that be from the WMBA, whether that be live sports, or the partnerships with even some of the entertainment companies that they've worked with over the past, creating kind of a charging premise based on that, where the social connectivity just becomes an extra add-on on top of that. Yeah, I mean, there's a lot of things that you can do with the platform when you have as many monetized, well, DAUs that are out there. I would say, and we've always talked about the content on Twitter is amongst the best out there. And the content is really just an amalgamation of what people are saying and doing and tweeting and whatnot. And you can get lost in Twitter for hours, challenges, that product, providing those details on what you're looking for, going more in a media strategy, working with providers and partners. We've seen success in that, right? And I think Twitter in the past has had partnerships by providing videos and highlights from the Olympics, from the NFL, from many different sports teams, as well as award shows and whatnot. So I think going down the media path is something that would continue. The question is, the model changes from primarily advertising to maybe some sort of subscription that's a TBD. And I would say most entertainment companies on the web that have gone the paying for content, it's not an easy sort of chasm or bridge to cross. And so you really need to provide that value to get users to subscribe to it. And right now, again, Twitter has some tremendous and fantastic content in there to matter surfacing it and providing that right user experience on a personalized level. And that's really the key thing going forward, the personalization. Well, Ron, unfortunately, I think this is the first time we've talked to you about Twitter. Unfortunately, maybe it'll be the last if this still goes through. Although perhaps it'll be a relief for you. I don't know. I think we'll find some other good stuff.",https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ahmy7qqS3zQ,9,2022-10-06 14:28:21
2691," Fortunately, I think this is the first time we've talked to you about Twitter. And fortunately, maybe it'll be the last of this still goes through. Although perhaps it'll be a relief for you. I don't know. We'll find some other good stocks to talk about with you, though. Thanks so much for coming on. Cities, senior analysts, Ron, Josie. Appreciate it. Thanks for having me. Thanks. Coming up, Europe's natural gas crisis and focus as the E remains divided on how to tackle rising energy prices will have the latest on the other side. This morning, Swedish investigators confirmed suspicions of many saying that the recent leaks in the Nord Stream gas pipelines from Russia to the EU were caused by detonations. Now they don't say who was responsible for those detonations, but nonetheless, they say the preliminary investigation has, quote, strengthened the suspicions of serious sabotage. Let's talk about the natural gas dynamics in that area and indeed around the globe. For that, we're joined by Goldman Sachs, head of natural gas research. That is Samantha Dart. Samantha, it's good to see you again. So we got this report this morning. I, again, it sort of confirms what a lot of folks had suspected. I don't know if it changes in your mind the calculation, the risks to supply knowing indeed that it was detonations that caused those leaks. It doesn't really. We already expected it. I think this is pretty much consensus that Nord Stream 1 or Nord Stream 2 for that matter would not flow gas to Nord Stream 2. Not only now, but going into next year as well. So our northwest shear and gas balance is remained the same. Okay. And so, I mean, for those of us who are still trying to admittedly wrap our heads around this fully, I mean, the price impact that this would have towards the end users, the end consumers of this natural gas as well.",https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ahmy7qqS3zQ,10,2022-10-06 14:32:12
2692," trying to admittedly wrap our heads around this fully. I mean, the price impact that this would have towards the end-users, the end-consumers of this natural gas as well. Yeah, so what the region is having to deal with is a massive lack of supply, right? This has been already established since the close from Russia have been curtailed and increasingly curtailed over the course of this year. As a result, we have seen prices skyrocket to 10 times or more of their 10-year average and we expect them to remain elevated going forward. Now sequentially, it's a bit tricky because over the course of the winter, actually if winter temperatures are close to average, we expect prices to drop a little bit and bring a little bit of relief because you have enough storage to deal with that deficit. Now going into next summer, yes, we still expect extremely elevated prices over 230 euros summer next year. Samantha, your colleagues over on the oil side of the equation raised their forecast for brand, I know. If oil prices start to trend back up higher, will we see an uptick in natural gas demand or is that demand just kind of firmly capped by the price action we've seen on that side? So you're right that under this surprisingly bullish op-ed cut that has been announced, the balance for oil looks even tighter and as our colleagues highlighted, you still have the risk of potentially a $30 per barrel spike to oil prices from here. Now even taking that into account, natural gas is still so expensive that it would continue to provide an incentive for users to substitute actually away from that, and into oil. So one interesting anecdote that we've been seeing, especially going into this winter, is that now this gas to oil substitution is not even just about the power generation sector, but it's also happening starting to happen in the industrial sector where some users, instead of buying incredibly expensive natural gas, they're opting for using oil in their boilers instead. Samantha, if we do in fact go into a more prolonged recession or economic slowdown, where do you see prices for natural gas going? So the interesting thing about this slowdown that we are seeing, especially in Europe, is that it's being caused by the lack of natural gas. So think about it this way. We don't have the normal supply of natural gas. So the only way to manage storage, the only way to guarantee that we're not going to face blackouts in the winter, is to curtail demand. So this is why prices have been so elevated. And as a result, yes, we're seeing aluminum producers cutting back, fertilizer producers, gas, I'm sorry, cement, glass refineries. So industrial activity is indeed slowing and bringing Europe into a recession because of the lack of natural gas. So this is what needs to happen until this deficit in gas is resolved. Goldman Sachs head of natural gas research, Samantha Dart, always good to see you. We'll talk to you soon. Coming up, Guggenheim is calling this company its best idea into 2023. We'll break down a few analyst calls today. Don't go anywhere.",https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ahmy7qqS3zQ,11,2022-10-06 14:36:24
2693," The Now time for our call for the day. Despite Nike's inventory lows and margin pressure, Guggenheim is feeling good about the sneaker giant. The investment bank is maintaining its $135 price target and by rating on the Athlete's Leisure Maker calling it its best idea into 2023 or another way of looking best. They're saying, just do it. I'm so excited. But it's an amazing achievement. I'll try to bring this back. So interesting note by Guggenheim. I love Olympic fanat Robert Derbels work. He actually notes the top of this report that he's been covering the company for about 20 years. It feels like I've been following him for 20 years. But he does note that while profits are under pressure, he does still like Nike's brand equity. It likes its scale around the world. It likes its structural advantage in terms of its supply chain. And he goes on to say, again, some pretty cool charts that, yes, Brad, you wear Nike's? Not today. I saw the eyes move down. But Derbels also notes that we would note that Nike has a history of quick operating margin recovery from steep macro-driven drops. And we might be looking, I think investors might be looking for that to happen very, very soon. I'm wearing a brand today that was formerly owned by Nike. They divested from Cole Han. Not before making them really revolutionary, at least with the different souls that Cole Han would use in the lunar lawn from Nike. But again, I mean, this is really just kind of leaning into that brand equity that Nike has. And we were actually tossing around some of the stats that Julie was pulling earlier before the show, 22 out of the past 25 years. Nike has beat the S&P 500 performance here. And so you continue to think about what the brand has done over that time, whether it's some of the different acquisitions, making strategic decisions to get out of certain sports or at least equipment making in some sports. That's really led to the company being able to financially put those dollars that capital to work elsewhere. And the cultural partnerships that they've been able to make over time as well, they keep them in the spotlight. I just bought a new pair of sneakers. Yeah, which one? Did not buy Nike's. Really? I bought Sockinis. I tried on a pair of Nike. I tried on a pair of Sockinis. Good running shoe. It's not for running this. It's just for cash, for comfortable. It happened to your retro Reeboks. No, go ahead and pull it up. When your lift rang, it's normal for you to perform utility quality software in",https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ahmy7qqS3zQ,12,2022-10-06 14:41:34
2694," You tried on a pair of Nike? Very good though. I tried on a pair of sock and ease. Good running shoe. It's not for running this. It's just for cash, for comfortable. What happened to your retro Reeboks? No, go ahead and pull it. I didn't then, not yet. Not yet. I'm still thinking about. I'm still thinking, I'm still. Okay. Percolating. We got one 60 bucks. Just do it. Let's do it. Bye now. All right. We're going to continue to track shares of Nike here on throughout the rest of the day on that. But also, keeping close tabs on shares of Pinterest here today, take your simple P.I.N.S. Up 3.6% today. This is this morning after Goldman Sachs, analysts Eric Sheridan gave the company an upgrade to buy from neutral, raise the price target to $31 per share, saying that he left a recent meeting with senior Pinterest management with increased confidence here. There were a few things that were called out as a part of this. One of them, according to the analysts, companies, leaders are focused on monetizing its platform, working to raise the amount of inventory that users can purchase and making that more shoppable, which is what we continue to talk about. A good social media company, even if Pinterest doesn't want to be called a social media company, let's be real here. It's going to come back to the e-commerce, the shop ability of a platform that is so directly annexed to this idea of its users coming there and finding inspiration or inspiration, if you will. As long as users aren't flocking to another platform or getting taught by TikTok, how to do something, and then having a purchase decision that gets triggered from there, then Pinterest perhaps can maintain some of that fanfare among its new consumers, and that triggering a better average revenue per user on the site too. I like this note, and one reason why I like it is because I was at that Goldman Sachs conference. I saw Eric working in the room, and I saw the Pinterest team there. So this is a very thorough, I think, well thought out report by Eric Sheridan, who came on with us at the event, talked a lot about the headwinds that tech is facing right now, but there's a lot of expectations now built into Pinterest, and I think a lot of that rests on New CEO Bill Ready, delivering against some of these expectations, and I would just caution investors that it might take a couple quarters to see his vision play out on the top and bottom lines of Pinterest. Those shares are actually downless this year than I would have expected. All right, let's talk about, and speaking of shares that have been going down, Credit Suisse, JP Morgan upgrading the stock from underweight to neutral setting, a positive impact from the Lenders reported restructuring plan. You can see the shares are bouncing a little bit today. They're up just about 1% in US trading, that is. Of course, they also trade in their native Switzerland, and JP Morgan, it's a pretty wonky node here, but basically they're outlining two scenarios. In the first scenario, a dramatic restructuring of the bank with a 70% shrink in its investment banking operations and exit from fixed income commodities and currency trading and equities trading. So that would indeed be a big change in that scenario. Their tier one capital ratio would actually stay the same according to JP Morgan. In the second scenario, they assume yet another half-hearted investment bank restructuring, and they seem to be a little bit less positive on that particular scenario. So still some scenarios for Credit Suisse to sort of pull through this without needing to raise additional capital. I guess it's kind of the bottom line here by selling shares. This is a good bedtime read. The Niki guy died, right? They'll just do okay. All right, before we get... Giving people information. Well, you know what, here's the thing. Niki is then great. Pinterest, maybe they'll do better, and Credit Suisse will see what they do. Guys, coming up on the other side of this short break. We've got our, well, we've got much more here on Yahoo Finance, including, well, we don't have the fan who caught Aaron Judges' 60-second home on ball, but guess what? He's fielding offers upwards of $2 million. We've got more on the other side. Thank you. key. key. option Thanks",https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ahmy7qqS3zQ,13,2022-10-06 14:46:18
2695," Djz Slava, the base. Time for Cup for Time. Three stories, one minute each. We start with this today. People still want their Costco hot dogs and bulk groceries despite rising prices. The Costco reported another strong month of sales. For September with net sales up 80 or 8.5%. 80.5% year over year. This despite same store sales dipping on lower gas prices. All right. You're taking a look at some of the comps up 8.5% year over year for Costco. People still want it. You love it. I love it. I will refrain from saying something funny on the hot dog. When you're looking at the prices, it's a good deal to see prices decelerate in September vs. August. That inflation in a lot of these daily categories, like Costco grocery stores, you name it. It's starting to roll over over a little bit. And that's a good thing for consumers spending into the holidays. I think they recently said that they're not going to raise their membership price yet. You're predicting one that was made. It's coming this year. Yes, yes. On the gold. It's not coming this year. It waited me the last minute, but it's going to be a big earnings driver for that company. And I mean comparatively, Costco, BJs, Sam's Club underneath of Walmart, all of them had been trying to cozy up to the consumer, especially in the bulk buying boom that would seem to be. Indeed. All right. Uber is reviving itself driving vehicle plan after selling its autonomous driving research division. Uber signed a 10 year deal with an emotional to add self driving cars to its vehicle lineup. The self driving cars would work for both Uber and Uber Eats and several US cities upon launch. Still no details on where, where that will be. And I recently saw some of my first self driving cars out in San Francisco. I know some, you know, going to New York going to another place. And I think it was a Zooks. I can't see how these are the future. I still have a driver behind them. And I still ordered Uber. I didn't order a Zooks, but they look cool. That's all you got for me. Yeah. It seems like it's really early stage. I mean, regulations, like nothing is there yet. I've interviewed the CEO of Zooks and the founder of Zooks before. And of course, all of those companies that you kind of lumped together there between Zooks, between Waymo and then even for Uber and some of their driverless technology. It's all going to be dependent upon how well they're also able to license that out to some other companies that want to take advantage of it in the future too. Again, a lot of reds.",https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ahmy7qqS3zQ,15,2022-10-06 14:53:00
2696," For Uber and some of their driverless technology, it's all going to be dependent upon how well they're also able to license that out to some other companies that want to take advantage of it in the future too. But again, a lot of red tape that they've got to get through and then additionally when you think of the customer and how this is going to be able to cut down cost for the customer as well as the company, operating cost per mile, north of a dollar, this could perhaps bring it below 40 cents. All right, and a big payday for the lucky baseball fan who caught Aaron Judges, that Aaron Judges ball, the ball estimated to bring in $2 million at auction. As of now, the Dallas-based man that caught the ball has not decided what he wants to do with it. He could give it back to Judge and the Yankees where he could sell it himself. Another unknown is taxes. The IRS has yet to come in but some experts speculate catching the ball could count is a taxable... Isn't this guy a millionaire? That's what I was told by our team. I don't know anything about him. Oh good for him. So then is it a capital gains tax because you paint for the... Sounds like he could afford it. To go to the game and then now your return on that is you actually get a good bet off. I mean, I just think it's fascinating that the regulations are such that when you catch a ball it becomes your property and one of our producers, Connor Hickey, was explaining to us it's written on purpose that way because it absolves them of liability if you are injured by a ball. I think I think... I think flying, right? Whether it's a bat or a ball or whatever it may be. I think Conor owns a lot of Mickey Mantle rookie cards so he's sitting on that goal. He knows a lot about this. Alright guys coming up next we're going to talk a little Tesla. Stick around. Tesla CEO Elon Musk continues to make headlines surrounding the Twitter acquisition. Meanwhile, shares of Tesla, T-S-L-A. Yeah, they are moving lower on the day right now by the...",https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ahmy7qqS3zQ,15,2022-10-06 14:54:28
2697," Elon Musk continues to make headlines surrounding the Twitter acquisition. Meanwhile, shares of Tesla, T-S-L-A. Yeah, they are moving lower on the day right now by about 1.2 percent. Questions have swirled around the tech-tightened sales of Tesla shares to finance is deal-making coupled with whether he might be too distracted to hit targets at Tesla. Craig Irwin, Roth Capital Partners Senior Research Analyst joins us now. Craig, you have a neutral rating and a $250 price target on Tesla. Now that we got that out of the way, help us answer some of these questions here. First and foremost, is Elon Musk too distracted to run both Twitter and Tesla? And what does that mean for Tesla? Just one point for regulatory reasons. The split-adjusted price target is 85. The last printed note is pre-split. So is Elon Musk too distracted to run Tesla? Frankly, Tesla is his baby. This company is a great expression of his personality. And he has shown tremendous capability to manage many different things, neuralink, the boring company, SpaceX, and other outside ventures. And the intellectual curiosity necessary to execute pretty well there. So will it possibly take time away from Tesla? Yes. I think the question that probably needs to be asked is, will he be giving enough time to Twitter? And I'm not the best judge of that. I think he already has some pretty clear ideas on Twitter. And he does have a history with PayPal and the digital payments space, which I think is part of his vision on fixing that asset. So it doesn't bother me for Tesla. I have other reasons that I'm very bearish on the company, but I have tremendous respect for what they've done. Well, we'll get to those reasons in a second, Craig. But does it even matter if Elon is distracted? Who cares? And I mentioned that because we have EV tax credits in play that are probably going to be a big tailwind to Tesla. And then we have cars that people just really seem to be obsessed about. Yeah, I mean, they've done each tremendous job, right? They've basically made the automotive industry sexy again. The last time it was sexy was the 1950s. That was when it's a come out of the best universities in the world and say, oh my gosh, I want to work for a car company. Now, those same kids are coming out and saying, I want to work on electric vehicles. The work on future drivetrain technologies, Elon Musk deserves a lot of that credit, because it's his vision and his commitment that's allowed that to take place. Does it really matter for Tesla so much? Not really. The flywheel is rolling. It's running. And they have very different issues to manage through over the next couple of years. Then what they've had to challenge through to date. And whether or not Elon Musk is the one that's the right person to make those decisions, we'll find out. I'm skeptical. I think there's some very challenging things ahead for this company. If Musk is maybe reducing his intensity with the company, it might not be a bad thing. Craig, I know there's no imminent changes at the top of Tesla, but is there anybody else there who could run the thing besides him? Oh gosh, that's a tough question. I don't think so. I've talked to a lot of former Tesla executives. I know people that have turned down positions at Tesla that are leaders. They're respect to various. It's a difficult company to work at because Elon Musk is an unreasonable person. Not in a bad way, but in a motivating way where he doesn't take no for answer. He wants to learn what you got wrong, why you got it wrong, how you're going to do a different to achieve the goal. So yes or no, yes, we got it. No, we didn't. A lot of people aren't well cool to work in that environment. There's a lot of burnout and a lot of turnover as people like to talk about for Tesla with heavy, heavy departures over here. Craig, I only got 30 seconds here. Colder months. They're coming soon. China and Tesla production. That's going to remain one of the main areas to continue to track and can the company adequately mitigate any logistics impacts and factory shutdowns.

2698," one of the main areas to continue to track and can the company adequately mitigate any logistics impacts and factory shutdowns as it doesn't seem China is going to change their zero COVID policy anytime soon. Yeah, China's China's going to be tough for them. That's going to determine whether or not they make their numbers this year, 20,000 20,000 unit months or 19,000 unit months. China, right. I don't think this is what's the biggest issue for the company. The biggest issue is competition and alternative equity is like Porsche and the upcoming Ford spin off large well established properties that are executing well. You have other examples of some of the SPAC IPOs that are actually showing success. Test has big problems on the horizon as far as this competitive environment and they don't really have the technology lead that many many people claim everybody has access this same gender base. Imagine that competition for Tesla Craig. Thank you so much Craig Irwin Rothkopf little partner senior research analyst appreciate your time this morning. Thank you. Thank you.

Goldman Sachs by the way stays bullish on oil raising its crude forecast to $110 a barrel. That's an aftermath of this OPEC plus decision. Joe Biden's his move cut move was cut was shortsighted and we'll see if the energy world's Dan Dicker agrees with us and investors wait for progress on the newly revived discussion between Twitter and Elon Musk. We look at the chance of a deal and the flow of information if we get one. But first let's take a quick look at the markets we see the Dow under a little bit of pressure down about 100 points the S&P 500 off about 1 quarter of a percent and then Nasdaq off just slightly and then checking in on the bond market we do see yields elevated just ever so slightly in the looks like the 5 10 and also 30 year tenor and with all eyes on tomorrow's jobs report. Let's welcome in Black Rocks global chief investment strategist way Lee and could you please give us your forecast and by the way it's great to see you here could you please give us your forecast of what you expect tomorrow because this is 1 half 50% of the feds dual mandate a lot of eyes on this report. Hi there good morning thanks for having me so in terms of the jobs report I think given how strong earlier momentans are it's possible that we could see kind of headline decrease but I would say that our focus is really solely what mainly around the participation rate because labor shortage has really contributed to this supply shaped environment. So if that starts to be alleviated certainly that would have feed through to inflationary dynamics and that would feed through to market pricing for rate hikes and also broadly risk sentiment as well. Let me ask you just generally about some of the central bank actions we've seen around the world over the last two weeks a bit of a 180 by the bank of England now buying bonds albeit for a short period of time. I think that we're seeing a lot of the same as the other banks are also the banks of the bank of Japan buying the US dollar try or excuse me buying its own currency the end trying to strengthen that versus others as well as the US dollar what are you seeing in the global effects world and what implications do you think this might have for equities especially as we consider these jobs numbers that you just explained to us. So really is the a result of this supply driven new regime that we're in whereby given the fact that inflationary pressure comes from supply bottlenecks and supply shortages then it's a lot harder for central banks to fight that their tools are primarily focused on addressing the demand side of the equation. You talked about bank of England going from announcing QT to start buying bonds obviously there are specific kind of fiscal development in the UK that led to the the bond buying but more broadly it just goes to show how difficult it is for a central bank decision making in this supply driven environment characterised by tougher trade offs and you also talked about bank of Japan and more broadly. So I think it's a totally policy development and currency as well I will make one observation so far this year depending on where you are based depending on which currency you are denominated your experience of the global market returns can be vastly vastly different right part of that is the dollar strength but it's more than that as well so dollar in a near term is very much driven by rate differential as well as global risk on and risk of sentiment so far has been very very strong. But given the fact that how much currencies are contributing to the experience of investors of the global markets we think that is actually really important when we think about our allocation to consider where our investors and clients are based in which is why we're rolling out regional our allocation so for example I am sitting here in the UK.,https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ahmy7qqS3zQ,18,2022-10-06 15:06:46
2700," where our investors and clients are based in, which is why we're rolling out regional asset locations. So for example, I am sitting here in the UK, and we recently wrote out Euro asset location views. So really from the perspective of Euro-denominated investors, how their asset location could look like versus a dollar denominated investors. And that is critical. Being local is critical in the context of the elevated macro uncertainty and elevated currency volatility. Yeah, call it part for the course versus, I guess based on this trend of deglobalization that we've seen over the last five plus years. Now, I want to talk a little bit more generally about the, we saw the US dollar strength in versus most currencies quite considerably. It's backed off of that. And the other part of the equation there is with an easing US dollar in the short term, we're seeing a bid for commodities. Now, we've been talking a lot about OPEC plus and oil, but I want to focus on silver, gold, and some of the other commodities that we've recently catch a bid. A lot of people have either been waiting for gold to catch a bid or have just counted it out entirely. What do you think of the precious metal complex right now? Well, exactly as you framed the correlation between the dollar and precious metal has been in place. And I think in that context as dollar, we can, you talked about how the risk on the sentiment earlier in the week led to a weaker dollar. It has been somewhat supportive of commodities and precious metals for that matter. But I would broadly say though the importance of diversification cannot be overstated in the context of the world that we're entering into. So thinking about the macro environment, we're currently expecting a recession. This year in Europe, in the UK, and next year in the US. And at the same time, risks of central banks over tightening policies into restrictive territories in order to fight inflation. The risks of that have risen significantly. Recently, but also certainly versus beginning of the year. So in this kind of environment where it makes sense to be more prudent when it comes to our location, when it comes to portfolio taking, than having diversification in portfolio makes sense and certainly go to play the role in that. And I think that is also part of the considerations behind recent price action. We got a time for one more, a bit brief here. But I want to talk to you about the Chinese UN and also policy makers there. We've seen the UN strengthen against the Japanese yen about 12% year to date. Yen has considered, has weakened considerably. And I talked about the measures by the BOJ before. Do you think the PBOC intervenes to in the in the in the in the Yuan here? And what consequences would that have for global risk assets? Well, I think more broadly when we talk about the Chinese Yuan, we also have to talk about the Chinese economy. Right? So what has happened so far this year is that there has been significant headwind for Chinese economy from the perspective of the zero-covid policy acting as a dampener to economic reopening momentum and at the same time previously the Chinese economy was supported by the tailwind of global export. Like when the rest of the world was in shutdown, the export from China and the demand for that has added to strong momentum last year. But now the rest of the world is switching back on and China is in zero-covid mode. So that export tailwind is is is fading away as well as the the China economy is in a way as well. And both of their act as headwind and challenges for Chinese economy this year and the Chinese currency movement so far this year are reflection of that. You talked about versus the yen but also versus the dollar of the dollar story is beyond more than just Chinese Chinese Yuan. I would say one thing though as we kind of had into next year, some expectation needs to be big deal around the restart momentum obviously a lot contingent on how the COVID policy would evolve. But in the same way that the US economy opened up with strong momentum, your PM economy opened up with strong momentum in such an expect higher growth levels next year versus 2022. Surprise.",https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ahmy7qqS3zQ,19,2022-10-06 15:11:23
2701," went up with strong momentum, your PM economy, opened up with strong momentum in such an exact higher growth levels next year versus 2022. So, please say lots of moving parts here. Really appreciate your insights. As always, Waili, BlackRock, Global Investment, Chief Strategist, thank you for your time. And we're keeping an eye on oil prices as well. This morning following a big move by OPEC Plus to slash output by two million barrels a day beginning in November, exceeding market expectations and incurring the wrath of the Biden White House for more on this. Let's welcome in, Yahoo, finances in S for A. And we got a little bit of a surprise yesterday. And as we've been talking about, now OPEC Plus has already not been able to fulfill its quotas. So they said, this is really just a cut of about one to 1.1 million barrels per day. That's still a lot of nests. Yeah, that is, it's significant. It's a significant cut. And a one takeaway is that OPEC Plus must be concerned about a worldwide recession in order to be making such a cut. Goldman Sachs came out with a forecast and updated forecast saying that oil could reach $110 a barrel in Q4, also $115 a barrel by the end of the first quarter of 2023. And if these cuts are sustained through December of 2023, then these elevated prices would remain elevated. I mean, the only thing that could bring it down is really demand destruction at this point. Now, during the financial crisis, Jared, between 2008, 2009, oil prices, those had peaked at $145. They came all the way down to $35 a barrel in five months time. Andy Lipo of Lipo Associates is saying basically that, look, they must be worried in order for them to be doing this. It also shows you that the US dollar has also been having a huge impact on these oil prices. And we've also seen some rubblings or heard them that the Biden White House would also consider another release from this strategic petroleum reserve that's the SPR. We saw that take a place and be in effect earlier this year. I think those purchases or those releases have now concluded, but what about the possible effects of any new releases from the SPR? Yeah, well, certainly that would have a short term effect. Like we've seen with gasoline prices, as we've seen those gasoline prices coming lower. But one interesting point also about this OPEC plus decision is it kind of also shows you the waning influence of the US, because this is as much as it is about demand and supply as it is also political in a way as well. And the sort of relationship between Saudi Arabia and Russia and the sort of waning influence that the US is having on the cartel as well. Yeah, and I'd add the most important influence the US has on the cartel is the fact that WTI, and most global oil, is quoted in US dollars. So a huge investment, I would guess you would say, to protect right there. Thank you for that. Yeah, who finances in that for it? All right, our trending ticker of the day is Pinterest. It is surging 45% after Goldman Sachs upgraded and stopped to buy from Newfoundland, raised its price target to $31 from $24. Goldman analyst Eric Sheridan likes the improvements in user growth and engagement, as well as the potential for revenue growth and operating margin into next year in 2024. Monetization is a key area that Goldman also likes with the prospect for the social media company increasing its share of ad spending, and that says companies cut budgets and expenses and coming up. You're going to want to take a look at this. Talking cyclical stocks, the ride continues, love that plan continues for Peloton as a pandemic era, darling announces 500 more job cuts. We're about 12% of its workforce. Will the struggling group find its feet? Will we take the deep dive next?",https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ahmy7qqS3zQ,20,2022-10-06 15:17:10
2702,"'' Welcome back. Peloton laying off a large number of its employees. The new CEO of Berri McCarthy, who is looking to cut costs and make sure that in this environment where the company is trying to create more partnerships on the wholesale front, see more of their cash and capital be put towards actually being able to continue production but also the right sizing of production and overall just the structure of the company that that really comes down and hits some of unfortunately the employee base. Now what we also do know is that even over the course of earlier this week they had netted some new partnerships on the wholesale front and it really kind of spells out what Berri McCarthy is looking to do is tap some of those wholesale partners look to those channels to potentially drum up even more subscribers within everything from Dick Sports all the way to your Hilton state and then eventually being able to at the same time build on the digital subscriptions the number of people that are continuing to use these connected devices but then it comes back to if he does not see the growth necessary in this next stretch of time and he's looking out to the six month period even out as far as 18 months perhaps to say whether or not Peloton has been successful at implementing some of these strangers and if it will prove to push them back to profitability as well. One at Hone and we got a brief second here on that timeline. Sure. Now he based but this is McCarthy basically gave the company six months and he did not mince words here have you ever heard a CEO of a company give a going concern risk factor to its employees basically in this context. Not one that isn't already looking at perhaps some type of bankruptcy. It would have to be imminent. Imminent threat and what's even more noteworthy about that is whether or not they would actually be looking for a sale if they would be looking for a sale.",https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ahmy7qqS3zQ,21,2022-10-06 15:20:13
2703," a bankruptcy precedent. It would have to be imminent. Imminent threat. And what's even more noteworthy about that is whether or not they would actually be looking for a sale if they weren't able to hit some of those potential targets, because he did bring up this thought of, I don't know if we are a standalone company or a viable standalone company, just Peloton, if we're not able to hit some of these financial targets that we've set forth. He did say that this is the most optimistic that he has been, but he certainly to your point did not mince words there, and it starts to raise the question about who would buy a Peloton, especially when you've already got other stationary bikes that are being sold at Dix, that are already being sold on Amazon. So then it gets into the rest of the fitness category and the connected device category too, and it's really tough to sell on whether or not it would be a company in Apple or some other major tech company that would say, no, what? Yeah, we'll take on a connected fitness device company where they've already struggled to kind of mule-outs in new homes. There's a lot of baggage there. We'll have to see what happens, but Peak Peloton with the stock down over 90%, we'll see what comes of that. Thank you for that, Brad Smith. Thanks. And now a new game, all the kids are playing as well as Wall Street veterans, and they're raging about it. SPAC, D-SPAC, or Fold, and who better to join us with an update of this beleaguered sector is Alexander Seminova. Alex, excuse me, you've been covering this, and IPOs have done poorly this year. SPAC's much worse. What are the details? Yeah, just a terrible time for the SPAC market, such a huge turnaround from last year, and the year before, what has been called, the SPAC Renaissance Miss Chaud, saw this sharp uptick in SPAC activity, and it really a big come down this year. SPAC liquidations are on the rise with these Blaine check companies, really struggling to find targets for their deals to close so far this year. 22 special purpose acquisition companies worth about $10 billion have been liquidated, according to a weekly report by SPAC research. That's more than that. And more than half of those liquidations have occurred since August, and that's not even taking into consideration the liquidations that have been announced and haven't actually happened yet. For example, last week, Chimoth Pallia Petia set in a regulatory filing that he would liquidate to of his SPACs, also after failing to find a target and return $1.6 billion to investors, Bill Ackman also liquidated his vehicle. So it's just one after the other that is falling apart. Yeah, and I read an interesting stat yesterday that 40% of these companies, SPAC companies are issuing going concern warnings. That means they might go out of business for their investors, and that's double the IPO rate. But I want to hone in on some news today. George Soros' son, in, well, he's been part of the SPAC movement as well. And we've got some details there. You can share with us. Yes, so Bloomberg reported yesterday that the Everton Football Club spurred takeover interest from a SPAC led by George Soros is nephew that's according to people familiar with the matter. But there's no certainty yet whether the transaction will be closed, especially in this market where some deals are announced, but they don't actually follow through because the conditions are changing so rapidly. Yep, rapidly changing conditions. We've come to see this as the new norm. Yahoo, finances, Alex, Simon Overt, thank you for sharing that. Coming up, Black Gold getting a tailwind, Goldman's oil team stays with a bullish call for $110 for Per barrel on Brent, over at the White House President Biden labels, OPEC plus short-sighted surprise surprise, we look at the prospect for prices up next. to",https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ahmy7qqS3zQ,22,2022-10-06 15:24:54
2704,"ayer. Welcome back the bold seam in control after the third quarter kicked off with a big two-day rally, but a slew of economic data ahead could alter the market optimism. And I want to get a quick check of the Wi-Fi interactive where we can see energy in the forefront today, followed by communication services, tech and consumer discretionary. Those are at the top, what you see in green. To the downside, utilities is down almost 2% followed by real estate and healthcare. All of those are defensive sectors and let's get a check of the majors now and we can see a mix board. Nasdaq, just barely in the green by seven basis points, it's been fluctuating all day and then the Dow is down about one third of a percent and the S&P 500 down one fifth of a percent. So without further ado, we want to talk about the current market action and that is with Kelly Cox, she is E-Torrell's US Investment Analyst and Kelly, always great to see you here. We've done a number of webinars together and we've talked about some of the statistics in the S&P 500 and I think you and I were looking at some of the same data this week and what were you looking at? What were some of the conclusions that you came to? Yeah, dear, we were looking at some of the same data. I mean, the rally we've seen so far this week or at least on Monday and Tuesday has been fierce, I think we can all agree on that. But it's so fierce. I mean, it's the first time the S&P has rallied 2.5 percent or more in back-to-back days since December 2008 and you and I both ran the data, right? We see these kinds of rallies either deep in their market or in the first few days after a bull market starts, which is the exact opposite to an area there, right? And it just goes to show just how complicated this environment is for investors, how just the motion fueled and panicky it feels and it's quite a tough position to be in because we could be staring down to different paths here. And so investors who are nervous right now, what is your advice to them? Hopefully everybody's sitting on piles of cash, but that's not necessarily the case. I know that I have a significant amount deployed, got some on the sidelines here ready to be deployed. What are you telling your clients right now? Yeah, well, it's interesting you say that because you've seen the sentiment and the sour moon that the market is in, I'd expect there to be more cash on the sidelines than then we think. But at the same time, we're telling our clients to really manage your emotions here, to understand where the market environment is, but also the fact that it could be very costly to miss out on the first few days of a bull market. We really like a barbell strategy here.",https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ahmy7qqS3zQ,23,2022-10-06 15:29:29
2705," and where the market environment is, but also the fact that it could be very costly to mess out on the first few days of a bull market. We really like a barbell strategy here, holding on to some risk, but being defensive at the same time. And where do you see the market opportunities when this market finally turns around? Maybe it already has, maybe the lows in, but that's not necessarily the sure bet right now. What kind of sectors or styles are you looking at? Yeah, well, this market really is bottoming. We would expect to see more of an uptick and risk here, more of a more of a surging growth year asset here. We really like quality risk though at the moment. I mean, there are a lot of different flavors of growth stocks. We all know that with tech, you could look at the more speculative concept stocks, or you could look at big tech. We think big tech is a good example of quality risk with strong financials. And at the same time, we really like cyclicals here, but we're feeling a little more cautious at the moment only because we don't know what the future holds for us here. And if we see growth deteriorate much more, we could see that reflected in physical stocks. Hey, Kelly, I was writing our newsletter this morning, the morning brief. Actually, I wrote it yesterday afternoon for publication this morning, but it was about those very same market statistics that you were talking about. After I ran the data and I saw kind of a mixed bag there, I kind of went off on a rant. And you know, you and I love to parse the data and look for things. Sometimes we don't always find an edge. Maybe you did, maybe I didn't, but I think my message for investors is sometimes you just got to turn off the news, not Yahoo Finance, of course, while you're watching this broadcast, but you got to filter out the noise, just wondering what you're thinking about this as you also talk to some of your clients. Oh, it's so hard because it's so noisy these days and there are so many things you can look at to find that signal. And I mean, here, I do know I like parsing through data. You just said that, but I always try to remind people that when we see these big and up and down days, there's something significant happening. What that's significant to, what that moment or significance is, we're not really sure yet. And I know that's not super helpful, but you have to really remember, you know, your own goals and your own needs, especially strongly in times like this, you know, really focus on why you're investing and what kind of time horizon you have because that will help you determine which market and which voices you listen to. That's right. Focus on risk management and your timeframe. Lots of signal in that interview, not a lot of noise. Thank you for that, Kelly Cox, EToro USA investment analyst. Coming up next, the House of Pain is in effect witness by the surging US dollar, but also in the housing market, US home prices have been falling at the fastest price pace since the financial crisis, but is the fed intent on breaking the market to save the economy?

2706," Feeding Welcome back. Oil prices heading higher with crude oil WTI above $88 per barrel. And that's after OPEC plus's decision to cut output yesterday by 2.1 million barrels. What does this mean for the energy space? Let's bring in Dan Dicker, founder of the Energy World. We're Dan. Let me talk to you about this report here. Glad to have you always great to hear from you. This is an effective cut of a lot less than 2.1 million barrels per day because OPEC plus has not been living up to their quotas because they can't pump necessarily that much out of a lot of the countries. What is your take? And Dan, you might have to unmute yourself on the phone. We're not getting any audio at this time. Alright, it looks like we're going to have to go to break. We're going to see if we can get Dan Dicker back on the phone right after this.",https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ahmy7qqS3zQ,25,2022-10-06 15:37:10
2707," Harlemague Welcome back. A quick check of the markets now where we see everything under a little bit of pressure. The Dow is down by 4.10% of the S&P 500 a little bit less. And the NAS deck, as I'm looking at at the Wi-Fi interactive down just seven basis points. And now a quick check of the bond market as well. We're seeing the 10 year Tino yield up about five basis points. Let me see if we can get a read on the five year here. That is up seven a little bit more. And the 30 year is up 2%. So the front end of the curve receiving a little bit of a boost there. The 13 week T bill yield about break even down just slightly from yesterday's levels. And also the dollar, the dollar after being under a little bit of pressure over the last couple weeks showing signs of strength. And that is weighing on a part of the equities complex here today. Not the energy sector. We see XLE. That's up about 1%. Followed by the mega cap sector's communication services, tech, consumer discretionary, just barely up there. All of those out performing to the downside, seeing utilities and real estate underperform each of those down about 2%. Now, anyone shopping for a new home has seen it firsthand. US home sales going hot from hot to ridiculous levels. Yahoo, finances, Danny Romero has more on how the feds inflation fighting tactics are weighing on the housing market. What are you seeing? Jared, what I've been hearing the way it's being described to me as that the housing market is being brought to its knees by the Federal Reserve. That's what a macro strategy is from bespoke investments told me yesterday. Following the drop in the mortgage demand from the associate from that we saw from the mortgage bankers association seasonal index. So yes, those higher mortgage rates are really taking a hit on the housing market and it could get worse. That macro strategist is estimating that the volume of mortgage demand could fall 10%. And not only that, but mortgage rates could peak 8%. Yes, today we did see mortgage rates dip to 6.6%. But to put this into perspective, climbing rates has added $337 to a typical monthly mortgage payment. That is according to redfin data. But again, this all goes back to the feds decision. If they continue to slow down economic activity, then we are going to see slower demand for mortgages. And so far, there's been no indication that the fed is backing off. And we also haven't had any inflation prints to show that inflation is coming down. That's right. Part of the fed strategy is to, well, not cripple the economy, but also, but hamper the economy a little bit. Unemployment has to rise. And we already, you just said that people are facing mortgage increases in their mortgage payments of about $330 somewhere in that ballpark. Is there a ray of sunshine? Where's the hope here? Yeah. So home prices have come down, but against, again, that's not really correlated to inflation. One part of the housing market that is correlated to inflation is rents. Apartment rents have come down. We saw that from July to August. But that's because people are paying so much for everything else that there's really no little wiggle wiggle room really for rents. So yes, landlords are losing their pricing power. Tenants are, they're also losing tenants as well. So yes, rents are still elevated and prices are high. They're expected to come down, but that could take some time and also it goes back to the issue of supply and demand. Yeah, with a lag and not going to help me on that lease, I just signed, but thank you for the report here. Yeah, who finances Danny Romero? Coming up next, it's a grab bag. Who knows what we're going to talk about? Yeah, who finances Danny Romero just joined us, but we have more on the other side of this break.",https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ahmy7qqS3zQ,26,2022-10-06 15:41:43
2708," It's considered a natural礼, so we'd like to measure investment houses. Welcome back. Oil prices heading slightly higher about half a percent up and that's after OPEX plus decision to cut output. And let's talk about what this means for the energy space with Dan Dicker. He is the founder of the energy word and we have him on the phone here. Dan, always great to talk with you. The official cut was 2.1 million barrels per day but in effect it is much much less than that. Why is that? Well, basically Jared, it's because OPEX has been under producing what it has been promising the market since December of 2021 and that's only grown. I mean, you might have realized that they've been increasing their limits, their production gaps almost every month since December of 2021 but not meeting those limits and it's sort of kind of grown to the fact that now there's a shortfall between what they've been promising and what they've actually been producing of somewhere between 2.5 and 3.5 million barrels a day. So it's very, from a practical point of view, it's not clear how much of a practical effect this cut will have but of course from a psychological point of view, it's enormous. I mean, this is OPEC reasserting their control of a market that has as bad as a supply problem from a global standpoint as I've ever seen in the 40 years that I've been covering oil. So if you're going to try and beat down prices as the Europeans and Biden have been trying to do with Fed, Fed rate hikes and quantitative tightening and of course releases from the SBR, you do find that OPEC had had enough and was saying, look, we've got a fundamental market here that should support prices closer to 3 digits and we don't like oil going under $80 a barrel. So they called an emergency meeting and they've made a statement here saying they're going to try and prove.",https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ahmy7qqS3zQ,27,2022-10-06 15:46:56
2709, support prices closer to three digits and we don't like oil going under eighty dollars about so they called an emergency meeting and they've made a statement here saying you know they're going to try and prove to uh... Biden and the europeans that this is a supply problem and not really a pro a price problem in this cli in this ties closely to the relationship between the u.s. and the Saudis i believe it was several months ago the uh... Saudis announced a one hundred uh... thousand barrel per day protection cut and i think that was an olive to the by the administration was only hours after that that by the announced that yes i'm going to meet with the saudis for the first time here uh... what is this mean for the relationship with the u.s. going forward when you have this level of disagreement yeah i mean look there's a visit by the isn't a very interesting spot and of course the Saudis are a an ally of the united states and they they they rely on the united states for military supplies as well as support not ways so uh... but there is also the other side of the story which nobody really wants to hear is that uh... Saudi Arabia is uh... you know an oil economy and at the the times when they can't get the revenues out that they feel that they deserve they they generally have to make some moves to try and protect those revenues now by the is coming up on not only on trying to uh... to uh... uh... a tackle of very bad inflation problem but he also has midterms that are coming up and high gas prices are a political nightmare so he is trying to balance again these relationships that he has with uh... middle east allies along with political needs he has as well as economic needs he has to get inflation under control and it's really it's going to be a war here between you know what the what the united states in the EU can do with much of this monetary policy that's really pushing down all sorts of risk assets including stocks but of course oil too and what the Saudis and the rest of opette can do trying to protect their market by really cutting production and adding to what's already a very deep deep supply problem and we and we got to leave it there always appreciate you stopping by and thanks for sticking around here on the phone dan dicker founder of the energy world all right while twitter shares they are up today and all looks like well they are down just slightly and that is after investors await progress on the newly revived discussions with Elon Musk the latest must and the group are reportedly delaying the billionaires long awaited deposition after his decision to proceed with the forty four billion dollar deal also admit discussions over financing writers reporting that apollo global management and six street partners who had been looking to stump up some of the money no longer are in talks polloglabel management is a parent company of yahu finance yeah who finances elixis keen and joins us now in elixis there was speculation yesterday that twitter wanted musloyer to disclose whether he reacted to an anonymous email what do we know about this yeah Jared so there was some speculation and it was about this may six email that twitter was asking the judge for more information the judge uh saying that musk might have to turn over more details on an anonymous sender that sent an email to musk's attorney alix bureau and it was thought that it might be connected to peter zatko the twitter whistleblower that has caused so much upheaval in terms of spam and bot counts and twitter security on its platform but in an affidavit to the judge today that was filed sphero said this to date i have taken no actions of any kind with respect to that may six email so kind of putting to bed that part of the speculation but as you know look at the share price today reflecting a lot of doubt still not quite leveling off to that fifty four dollar and twenty cent price that musk has now reproposed that he will close the deal there um the wall street journal reporting that the parties are going late into uh talks late wednesday still unsettled about how to move forward exactly despite the fact that musk has said in a letter that is now filed with the sec and that the court has its hand on saying that he'll go forward on those original terms but here's the problem there's some fuzzy language in that letter and what it says is it's pending musk's receipt of debt financing and what they're talking about there is the approximate twelve point five billion dollars that's coming from morgan stanley and is committed from morgan stanley uh but what's the hold up really it could be that debt fine,https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ahmy7qqS3zQ,28,2022-10-06 15:50:25
2710," at $12.5 billion that's coming from Morgan Stanley and is committed from Morgan Stanley. But what's the hold up really? It could be that debt financing language. It could also be possibly executive and employee compensation that needs to come out of this deal. Twitter might want some more terms around that. And also they might want indemnities to be inserted into this new re-up deal. We don't know for sure though, but let's focus back on that financing for just a minute. It was back in April on the 21st that Musk had said through his lawyers that more information on Twitter's fake accounts, those spam and bot accounts, was needed for Musk's financing. So I would think that Twitter would want to clarify that that is indeed not going to be the case if he is going to go through with this deal. Plus added to that, banks can independently assert a claim that a material adverse event has occurred. That would be a change, a major change in conditions that they could assert and say, well, that changes whether we can offer this financing to Musk. Now the lawyers that I've talked to have said that's probably not going to be the case. But we still have to wait and see here. But they do say that there's one key thing to watch for. And that is that deposition of Elon Musk that was scheduled to go forward today, but is now delayed. All these M&A lawyers that I'm in talks with, they say that certainly Twitter would want to have Musk's testimony before they go forward with any trial. The trial is still on the books, Jared, for October 17th. And we'll have to see what comes of this. And we're going to stick with the subject and pivot from legal battles. And thank you, by the way, for that Alexis Keenan. We're going to pivot from legal battles and financial wrangling to a bigger picture take on Elon Musk's potential takeover. Tesla's CEO has labeled himself a free speech absolutist and while heralded by some, it is stoked fears from civil rights organizations and equal measure. Now from Twitter as a business to the flow of information we're joined by Sinan Araw, MIT Sloan School of Management, Professor and author of the hype machine. Sinan, always great to see you here. So what's your take on this situation and its meaning for the future of Twitter? Great to see you. Thank you for having me. You know, I predicted that this is exactly what would happen. That this deal would go through. I actually predicted it would go through at a slightly lower price is the market choosing that price for me at the $50 range. There could be some negotiations about a slight price decrease in order to get assurances on the Twitter side from Musk and the financiers. More tight language about how they could or couldn't be required to go through with the deal. We'll see whether the prediction bears out exactly. Obviously, when the investors came in, it was a different climate. Now there's higher interest rates, there's inflation, there's a lot of uncertainty to the Ukraine war. Just this week oil prices, OPEC and Russia constraining supply. So it's a much different environment to finance debt. The banks could try to back out and could trigger this escape hatch for a billion dollars by Elon Musk. But there could be some negotiations and Twitter could say we want assurances and we'll negotiate something to get those assurances. Because remember for the Twitter board, this was a no brainer at $54. This was a great deal for them and they'll want this deal to go through. Assuming the deal goes through, first thing you're going to see is a mass exodus due to firings and people quitting. People who are currently at Twitter, inside information says that they do not want to work for Elon Musk's new Twitter organization. Mostly, many of them would leave on their own volition. Elon Musk is indicated that much of the Twitter leadership he does not approve of their decision making. So he might get rid of some people. So the compensation negotiation I think is less important because you're going to see a wholesale clean out and a wholesale change in the approach. You're going to see Donald Trump return to the platform almost immediately. You're going to see moderation rules relaxed towards this more free speech environment, although you can't get rid of moderation entirely. You're going to see attempts at the subscription model be more forthcoming in the short term, a lot more bot detection and bot removal as well. That's in the short term. And I think we should also talk a little bit about the long term expect web 3.",https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ahmy7qqS3zQ,29,2022-10-06 15:54:56
2711," for term, a lot more bot detection and bot removal as well. That's in the short term. And I think we should also talk a little bit about the long term, expect web three strategies to enter Elon Musk vocabulary. Will there be a Twitter coin? Will that be related to the subscription model? How will that be financing the business going forward? Well, you touched on monetization there, a key pillar of turning the business of Twitter around. I've seen some ideas floated that the business model could follow that have linked in and corporate some of that of YouTube. What does this look like to you and what does this mean for the platform? Yeah, I think Elon Musk has made clear that he thinks that an advertising alone business model cannot save this company. There are a lot of people that agree with this opinion. I think that Twitter has struggled to succeed with a advertising only business model. Twitter blue as a subscription model was kind of a, you know, toh's dangling in the water attempt to see how it would go. You can expect much more heavy commitment towards paying subscribers for premium services and or for institutional accounts to be part of the strategy of an Elon Musk Twitter. In addition, I think that you can imagine that there will be other types of subscription models. For example, selling access to particular types of institutions in terms of information that is packaged up as information services for institutions, whether it be for prediction purposes or for other types of purposes. And given that it will be a private company, there will be a lot less oversight from the public sphere over what's going on. And you can also imagine an attempt to be more inclusive of conservative voices, which would try to get at the user numbers that have been steady, but not really increasing at the rates that Elon Musk would like to see. Well, we got to leave it there. Sin and Al-Ral, but I really appreciate you stopping by and all of those insights as always. All right, we got to talk crypto now with Bitcoin hovering around $20,000. As I think it has done for half the year, we're going to bring in Yahoo finances, David Hollerith, who's going to talk to us about cryptocurrency space and David. What is the latest here? Because we've seen Bitcoin not, well, it's been trying to get off the dime here. But I've been saying Bitcoin $20,000, as I said before, for a pretty long time. Yeah, Jared, the reversal is here. And RISC version has taken Bitcoin. It briefly went below $20,000 earlier yesterday. And now it's hovering right above $20,000. This is the key psychological point. Obviously, this is sort of maybe a potential into the strong start in October that Bitcoin and equities have seen. I think there's a lot of expectation around the jobs report that will come out tomorrow. And the CPI print next week. And the expectation is that Bitcoin's fundamentals from here could expect what analysts are calling a healthy consolidation from here. And that should remain the case for a while. As we see, the Fed pivot idea is sort of not really caring much ground. But we see a double dose of robust hiring on Friday in a hotter than expected inflation report next week. We could see heavier consolidation. All right. We're going to have to leave it right there, if it but really appreciate your time here again today. And we want to get a quick check of the market before we leave you to break. And we are looking at a mixed market right now. You can see the NASDAQ slightly in the green up about 12 basis points. And the Dow and the S&P 500 still mired in red territory, though, but off of those lows. And let's get a quick check of the Wi-Fi interactive where I'm looking at our sector ETFs. And we can see energy still in the forefront WTI crude oil still up above $88 per barrel. Also communication services in tech, those ETFs in the green to the downside real estate and utilities extending their losses, each of those now down more than 2%. And just also looking at some of our leaders. We saw mean stocks really take off this week. Those are our leaders today. Those are a 2% followed by EWY.",https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ahmy7qqS3zQ,30,2022-10-06 15:59:05
2712," two percent and just also looking at some of our leaders. We saw meme stocks really take off this week. Those are our leaders today. Those are up 2 percent followed by EWI. That is a South Korean ETF followed by home builders, transports, socks. That is the chip stocks, software and internet stocks. Those are in the green to the red to the downside, seeing some losses here for the cannabis and solar ETF sectors. Also checking in on the bond market real quickly, we can see the 13 week T. Oh, that's the US dollar. That is up now 8 tenths of a percent, but we wanted to check on the 10 year Tino yield. That is up six basis points to 3.82 percent. That does it for the 11 to 12 hour list take a look at one. Well, we already took a look at the market. So I'll guess what? Just come back tomorrow. See you on the job today 8.25 AM Eastern. It's promptly. Thank you. Everyone, the S&P 500 has had its best back to back days since April 2020. And the best two days start to the fourth quarter, going back to the first full year of the five day trading week in 1953. For more on what this means, the four the market's going forward. Let's bring in RBC capital markets head of US equity strategy, Lower Calvacena, Lower Great to speak with you this morning. Of course, in the futures at least right now, we are discovering that it can indeed go the other way still. And so with that in mind, how are we really set up for the fourth quarter? Is this just the two days at least that we had seen to begin October and the fourth quarter? Is that just a bear market bounce or is there something more that you're seeing in the tape? Well, I think both of those things could be true. We actually went back and looked at how markets traded in 2002, 2003 in 2010, 2011. And how that compared with the environment we're in today. The reason why we're doing this is because we're doing this.",https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ahmy7qqS3zQ,31,2022-10-06 16:03:08
2713," are there something more that you're seeing in the tape? Well, I think both of those things could be true. We actually went back and looked at how markets traded in 2002, 2003 in 2010, 2011, and how that compared with the environment we're in today. The reason we picked those periods is because we had come out of major crises, had an initial bounce, and then we basically settled into these kind of year, year and a half type trading ranges where bottoms were formed. It took quite some time to get that done. It was painful. It was bumpy. It lasted a long time. And I feel like as I peer into the early part of 2023, that's really what we're set up for. So we've come down. We're seen a big battle back at the June lows. We dipped a little bit below them. But I think markets, you know, I've heard a lot of people try to defend that 3500 level. I wouldn't say people are crazy bullish out there. That's certainly not a stretch, but I think there has been, you know, this talk of a potential pivot, maybe earnings have been, you know, kind of worked down in the minds of the buy side at least, even if numbers still need to come down. So I think people are trying to come up with reasons why the market could bounce here at the end of the year. And I do think if you look back at that 0203 and 2010, 2011 history, you can find a justification for it. Laurie, do you still think we will see a lengthy bottoming process? And how long do you think I will play out? So, you know, it's interesting because that 0202 example, the stock market has been trading with a 72% correlation this year, with that 2002 period. And when I think about 4Q and 1Q, what happened back then really does seem like a reasonable template for going forward. And what I mean by that is you think about the earnings backdrop. We're going into this reporting season where based on a lot of these pre-announcements, we're starting to see it does feel like the earnings mandate is going to be ripped off, at least to some extent. But I think that that's not really possible to do entirely until we get into February and March of next year. And that's going to be year ahead outlook season. That's when the full year numbers for 22 are going to be reported. And companies are really going to be forced to talk about 2023. And so I think you're not really going to be out of the woods from an earnings perspective until you get to that through that 4Q reporting season. And, you know, we'll sort of see what happens here in the next few weeks. I feel like, you know, kind of short term predictions on earnings reporting season never quite pan out for anybody. But I do think that that earnings mandate, we're just really not going to have that visibility on 2023 for a few more months. Given the calls that we're seeing around and describing what another recession could look like from everyone from the economists to CEOs right now. And some of them saying that it should be short and not painful. At the same time, there is the question of how it would actually compare in the stock market reaction to previous recessions as well. What do you believe that might look like? So I am in the short, shallow recession camp, and I know that feels awfully consensus. And there's always risk to consensus arguments. But I do think that both corporations and households are in a very strong position heading into this relative to past recessionary period. So I think the starting point matters and the starting point is very good relative to where we've been in the past. Now, when you think about stock market reactions, I think that's why 3500 is such a battleground. Because if you look at the history of recessionary drawdowns in the stock market back to the 1930s, the median drop has been about 27% peak to drop. And that takes you to 3501 on the S&P. If you look at a meet, if you look at an average recession drawdown, it's a little bit worse. It's about 32%, which takes you down to 3200 on the S&P. As I talked to some of my friends in the technical analysis community who just read the charts, they tell me 3,500 and 3200 are also important levels to watch. So that history does seem to be rhyming or kind of sinking up with some of those technicals. I have a very hard time believing this would be worse than what we saw in the pandemic when there was just enormous uncertainty, enormous fear. And that was a 34% drawdown. So it took you a little bit below that to 3200 mark. But I think it was interesting that when confronted with that great calamity that was building on the health side, markets basically priced in a typical recession. So it's very hard for me to think we're going to do much worse than that this time. Laurie, do you think this is a market that would cheer a Republican just to take over in the midterm elections? Markets historically, if you look at the combination of a Democratic president and either a Republican led or split leadership Congress, that has been one of the best environments for stocks over time. And again, we're looking at very long stretches of history on that.

We also know that investors intuitively like RIDLOT And a lot of investors have worried that the Democratic agenda and I'm not trying to cast you know any sort of You know kind of view on this personally, but what I hear from investors is that they worry that some of the Democratic initiatives That are have been on the table in the past that haven't gone through would end up adding to the inflation problem So I do think that markets you know would benefit from a sentiment perspective From the Republicans doing well this fall and I think what's really interesting about that is back in June and July Even when sentiment was pretty dour in the equity markets a lot of investors were telling me the Republicans are going to do well That's a potentially positive catalyst for markets markets typically do well in the fourth quarter of a midterm year And then we started to see the polling data and the betting market data start to shift against The Republicans and back in favor of the Democrats and I think that took some of the wind out of the sales of the market contributed to the down move We saw but now if you look at the real clear politics data is starting to suggest that Republicans are doing a little bit better in the generic ballot And I have to wonder if markets are starting to sniff that out when you look at the price action of the last few days Laurie I have to give you in your team a shy a lot of these charts that we showed throughout the segment came from your extensive research big fan Always of your charts. So please do keep them coming RBC capital markets head of U.S. equity strategy Lori Calvacino. We'll talk to you soon You You For more on the markets let's get to city global wealth head of investments for North America Kristen bitterly Kristen great to speak with you here this morning here as we continue to kind of put in context the move that we're seeing today With what we saw to kick off the fourth quarter. What is this really set up for the probability of everything from a actual bounce that is sustained To a Santa Claus rally that some might be looking for come December I think unfortunately I think these markets require patience discipline and and a bit of defense We expect that we're going to see volatility and choppy markets from here through the rest of the year And I think what we saw over the past two days and look I'm not one to criticize any market rally But it really was a function of what we saw back in June as well some very oversold conditions Peak bearishness we know sentiment is that all time lows And so the market just having a little bit of a relief rally I think we'd have to keep in mind though that in bear markets These types of rallies are actually quite common in eight out of the past 10 bear markets We saw rallies off the lows of more than 10 percent and they didn't happen just once They happened several times So these tactical bounces are to be expected But it doesn't mean that we're out of the woods yet So Kristen that the market a couple days ago cheered weaker than expected ISM data Today we're seeing the market not like some hotter than expected reads on 80 p.m. Employment and then on ISM services just moments ago Should bowls be rooting for bad news on the economy? I think it really just points to the fact that the Fed is in the driver's seat and we say don't fight the Fed in bull markets We should also say",https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ahmy7qqS3zQ,33,2022-10-06 16:11:36
2715," for bad news on the economy. I think it really just points to the fact that the Fed is in the driver's seat. And we say, don't fight the Fed in bull markets. We should also say the same when we're dealing with bear markets. And so the Fed has been very resolute and very clear on their positioning in terms of the fact that inflation, their ultimate target is 2%, and we're not anywhere close to that. And also with inflation, the Fed is not just data dependent, they're trend dependent. They're not going to look at just one number. They're going to look at the overall trend. And we need to see that come down. The second part is employment, unless we see a material decline in employment or a rise in unemployment, I should say, that's not going to change their trajectory. So I think the market, this bad news is good news, good news is bad news, it's everyone hoping for a Fed pivot, and we don't see that. So what we are seeing though is some of the banks at least calling for what could be a soft landing or at least giving the Fed a little bit more credence to say, yeah, we've got more confidence that we had in the past. Or on the other side of that, you have some economists saying, you know what, it's not going to be as bad of a recession as we thought it might be. Which of the narratives really do you believe has the most credence here? I think you have to prepare yourself for the probability of a recession. We recently increased our probability to about 70% in 2023. And the reason for that is again, looking back at these two data points, which are really the overall inflation number as well as employment, unless we see any trend really change, we don't expect the Fed to pivot. And so all of the tightening that they've already done in terms of rate hikes being the fastest and steepest in history, combined with quantitative tightening, this has not flowed through to earnings. So this is something that those tight, that tightening of financial conditions can take anywhere from six to upwards of 12 or more months to really flow through to the economy. Which is why we think the earnings outlook when you look at consensus earnings growth for next year at around 8%, we think that's way, way too rosy. And we're actually expecting if we're continuing on this trajectory, that we would see an earnings contraction next year. If that's the case, Chris, in that 70% chance of recession does come to fruition with an actual recession, should investors be holding cash? Is cash no longer trash? So here's the thing in terms of our portfolios and how we're positioning. We are preparing for this environment. And so I think it actually depends upon your definition of cash and one of the things that I do think, if we have any bright spots in the market right now, is the fact that if we look just over two years ago, 40% of the world's government debt was negative yielding. Now we have six month T-vils that are close to 4%, we have a two year treasury that's north of 4%. And so what we've been doing is adding some of this fixed income exposure, very high quality because of this concern of a recession, but very high quality in terms of US government debt, looking at investment grade corporates, municipal bonds, and even some value in bank prefers as well. So there's ways of getting marginally higher yields and getting marginally better outcomes, but still being pretty defensively positioned. With where stocks are right now and where some of the valuations have dipped lower to, for those who have a long term time horizon, is this a safe time to get back into the markets or is there still kind of a leg lower that you would be tracking against? So market timing I think is a very, very challenging thing. As you mentioned earlier, we do see Santa Claus rallies sometimes and 80% of the observations in Q4 tend to be positive. And so one of the things that I think if you do have a medium to long term time horizon, when we look at situations where the S&P 500 has declined by 25% or more, looking forward out three years, there's never been a negative return. In fact, the average total return over that time period is close to 40% out five years. The average total return is around 85%. And so in terms of putting capital to work and looking at opportunities now, there certainly are opportunities if time is on your side. Hopefully it is. We'll leave it there.

2716," you you you Elon Musk's pending acquisition of Twitter This poise to send shock waves through society, but also the social media investing landscape. Joining us for more on this is Rohit Kolkarni, MKM Partners, senior analyst. Rohit, always great to get some time with you. We're seeing at least this morning, now I know you're not a Tesla analyst, but we're seeing Tesla Shlare share his under pressure on this news. How big a mess is Twitter going to be for Musk, meaning how much Kenny fix it, and how much do a distraction do you think will be to him in his various other efforts? Hey, thanks for having me. I think Twitter has been a case study in kind of how a great business or a great company can have issues with business fundamentals as in be it overhiring, under investing in technology, and not figuring out the exact go-to-market strategy, not figuring out the exact disclosure strategy. So there have been ebbs and flows in the levels of mismanagement in Twitter in my opinion. So I think near term, I feel Musk, if this deal actually happens, needs to figure out the top level, sea level exact team that they need to have in place. He's been pre-vocal about criticizing existing management team. So I wouldn't be surprised in the next three to six months. He figures out who would run Twitter. Until then, I think it's fair to say that he would be fairly distracted with probably putting more time behind Twitter and putting less time behind other things. Obviously, he's a guy who works 30 hours a day. So I'm sure he can manage that. Yeah, sending satellites into space orbit and ultimately producing electric vehicles for sustainability here on Earth seemed just a little bit more important in terms of prioritizing his time. But then you do have what will be a privately held company at that point in Twitter. How does that change? What Twitter looks like in the future? Musk has also talked about in the past how he doesn't like the rigmarole of being a publicly traded company sometimes and he was referring to Twitter back then or referring to Tesla back then. He will get that chance with Twitter. What changes about the company? I look unlike a SpaceX. I think SpaceX is a case story as to how a large company can stay private for such a long time and yet have all the capital needs kind of satisfied in a way that they can. I think if Twitter can be that, I think there's no better person than Musk to facilitate that transition from a public to a private kind of player. But having said that, one thing that Twitter has is it's inherently going to be under public scrutiny. It's one of the widest known brands in the world regardless of its size. More people follow Twitter for media than many other kind of media platforms. I'm sorry, Noh Rabati, who here. But no matter what.",https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ahmy7qqS3zQ,35,2022-10-06 16:20:13
2717," is more people follow Twitter for media than many other kind of media platforms, sorry, Nora, but Yahoo, here. But no matter what, there is going to be public scrutiny. So I think after the restructuring, after figuring out a very smooth running business, I feel it's in the best interest of Musk and his team to bring Twitter back to public markets. There is a scenario here that it may be longer than three years that what he initially contemplated. It could be five years, but it's better to come back to public markets, a much more smooth lead on company, a much more well-managed business than staying private because no matter what, there is going to be public scrutiny on Twitter, not that politicians, world leaders, other leaders are going to stop using Twitter if it is going to be a private company. Roy, do you see Musk owning Twitter for the rest of his life? Or is this, he comes in, tosses out the existing management team, cans of a bunch of underperforming executives that enjoy the free coffee and various other perks at Twitter, restructures the business and he takes it public again in three years? In my opinion, Musk is very, very passionate about what the core value prop of Twitter is. And in terms of how he himself has used Twitter for essentially evangelizing ideas and even to some extent getting product ideas from in a crowdsourced manner. So I feel he would probably be involved in Twitter as one of the largest shareholders. He is the largest shareholder right now, whether he stays as the largest shareholder for the foreseeable future remains to be seen. I would guess that in the next probably three to five years, he's still going to be the largest shareholder beyond that. Once he thinks the vision of what he wants Twitter to be has been achieved, he probably fades into the background, but I don't see him completely going away from Twitter, neither as a user nor as an investor at any time in the next three to five years. You talk about monetizing Twitter further underneath of Musk and it would need to be reliant on advertising and perhaps that remaining a baseline, however you believe or and some of the other street analysts have also believed that that could be a detriment having having Musk over top of Twitter and advertisers not wanting to continue to advertise at least in the same type of accelerated fashion that they had over years, even after Twitter added video. If you saw a decrease in advertising, then you have to increase the number of paid users. Is Musk alone enough to increase the amount of people who are willing to say, you know what, I'll pay to use Twitter. Would you pay to use Twitter? You're kidding a lot of challenges that Twitter has already faced in the past in terms of balancing monetization and balancing user growth. Ideally, they want both, but management in the past hasn't been able to achieve both. It's probably lack of resources, lack of vision, lack of execution, you call it. So if there's a way to manage both and on top of it, if there's a way to pivot the business model from complete advertising focus to a partial subscription and then advertiser subsidized, I think that is therein lies the challenge. Quite a few companies are trying to do that. If you look at what Snapchat is doing, Snapchat has a Snapchat plus. They think they can get to 10 million users next year. Netflix is going that way. So there are a lot of web properties who are going either from advertising to subscription or the other way around YouTube is doing that. So it is challenging. It needs focus, but I think that's the right step. So there would be a balance and along the way, obviously, the biggest challenges to have stable user base, I think, given what Musk can do and probably bring back a few other power users. Without taking any names, I think that that should help with diversifying the user base and probably bringing back the polarizing views that Twitter brought to the table. One of those power users, Rohit, might be former president Trump. Musk has not was not keen on that lifetime ban for the former president. If he does bring back Donald Trump to the platform, do you think advertisers will flee completely flee the Twitter platform? It's hard to say.",https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ahmy7qqS3zQ,36,2022-10-06 16:25:01
2718," Let's bring back Donald Trump to the platform. Do you think advertisers will flee, completely flee the Twitter platform? It's hard to say. I mean, what I would say is there would need to be a mechanism for advertisers to be able to choose where their ads are being shown. And in a way that their ads feel to be next to content that they view as brand safe. I think that's the bigger challenge. It is okay to have content that could essentially not be co-shared for a bunch of users, but so long as ads are not placed next to it, I think advertisers would be okay with that. So I think that's the bigger challenge from a product standpoint where can Twitter if they allow back users, if they let, if they just take out all this censorship, or at least the quasi-sensorship that the company has, can they essentially go back to advertisers and say, by the way, we can ensure that your ads are not placed to the content that you feel is not brand safe for you. And these are the ways that we are going to help you do that. I think that's the bigger challenge from a product standpoint. I feel it's a much bigger problem to solve even Facebook and even larger companies have not been able to solve it in a more convincing manner. So they've just chosen to shy away from that content itself. So if Musk brings back a whole lot of content like that, then there's a bigger challenge for the company to solve. MKM Partners, senior analyst, Roe Hit, Carl Carney, always good to see you. Great analysis. We'll talk to you soon. Thank you. you You Oh, you're seeing crude oil prices jumping after OPEC plus agreed to cut production by 2 million barrels a day. That is higher than estimates. It's an attempt to boost prices in an already tight market. It comes amid reports of strong pressure from the White House to avoid such a move. Let's get some reaction. From Bob Iachino, Path Rating Partners co-founder and chief market strategist, Bob, you know, the OPEC plus spin will certainly be about this looking at global demand, but you know, we did have the Russian Deputy Prime Minister Alexander Novak at the seat in Vienna. So, you know, what do you make of what played out today? How much of this is really about the global oil picture? How much of this is politics? Well, I think with OPEC, you're generally getting both. I think that's pretty certain. I mean, obviously you can flip that around and say that the release of oil from the SPR is also about politics because we don't generally get those kinds of reactions to price increases. The release of the SPR was large when the largest in history and it didn't really, according to the Department of Energy, only reduce prices by somewhere between 25 and 40 cents a gallon at the pump. That's from the Department of Energy. Now, having said that, it was good timing. It got certain national averages on regular gasoline, for example, down to comfortable levels, but this does seem like a crack in the world.",https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ahmy7qqS3zQ,37,2022-10-06 16:29:15
2719," timing. It got certain national averages on regular gasoline, for example, down to comfortable levels. But this does seem like a crack in the relationship between the US and Saudi Arabia while OPEC Saudi Arabia, while OPEC plus made this decision. And you mentioned Mr. Novak sitting right next to Prince Abdul bin Salman, who was actually in that room that's very discouraging in terms of what can happen with the inflation picture going forward, especially ahead of the midterms. We've already seen a spike in oil futures here. I mean, what does this ultimately mean moving forward in terms of where energy prices are likely to go? We talk about OPEC plus Saudi Arabia and Russia, but obviously there's many other members who don't often meet their quota. Yeah, and I want to correct myself. I said, been Salman. It's Abdul bin Aziz. But from that perspective, when you're looking at where crude oil is going, I still think it's going to be weak. When you look at demand, given the potential recessionary picture globally, demand has been falling off a cliff. Now, some of the refinery utilization numbers that we've seen the recent fall has been because of Hurricane Ivan. We actually had about 12 refineries and drilling sites shut down into golf as a hurricane Ivan came through. Those will be reassessing and reopening and we'll see where utilization goes at that point. But OPEC is definitely the driving force in price given that U.S. production has reached about 11.8 million barrels and can't go much higher without capital investment, which we've seen really depressed over the last 12 to 18 months. So it is OPEC that's going to be controlling this price. But if we get the global recessions that are being predicted, they're almost assured in the UK and the EU, not quite the same here in the U.S., you're going to get a continued fall in demand. And because this particular cut is going to last all the way to December 2023, that's going to put a little bit of a crimp in the people who are looking for a Fed pauser or a Fed pivot because it's likely to drive inflation, at least stabilize inflation to higher levels. There is another catalyst looming in December when you've got those sanctions on Russian oil taking effect. Obviously, these headlines coming out of G7 countries saying they maybe want to try and phase that in to try and limit impact to the markets overall. But how much of that has actually already been priced in, you think? Well, I think a decent amount of it. Again, I was short crude oil prior to the leaks of OPEC potentially cutting by a million. My prediction was they were going to cut by a million and a half and be able to sort of go out into the public and say we're actually trying to help our allies as best we can by not cutting to million barrels. They didn't do that. They went ahead with the two million barrels. So from a perspective of what's going on with the future output of production, they've already been missing their current production quota. So this two million barrel cuts really only going to be about 800,000 to a million if they actually were to reach maximum here. So the length of it is disturbing to me. The length of time that they're going to do this because this means that they can do, they've announced they're going to have meetings every other month now, which prior to that, they said that they would be on a need to know basis. Every other month means they can adjust as both up or down and it seems like their target is more to adjust production down. I think OPEC wants to see a hundred dollar barrel crude oil. I still think we're going to see 65 before we see 100 in the WTI market. And finally, Bob, we've got the EU agreeing on a price cap for Russian oil. This is likely to take effect later in the year. But what's the impact on that? I mean, there's some who are skeptical who say this can actually be an effective policy. But what do you see in terms of this affecting price moves? Well, I'm one of those that's skeptical about that. I don't really think it can work in the way it's structured. It's based on insurance protections and Russia's already said they'll self-insure some of their cargoes going to India and China. It's interesting to see a production cut because it might actually slightly be targeting these caps. If there's a new production cut, then Russia can absorb most of it and not really have to worry about the price caps as they'll be able to get out what they can self-insure and leave the rest alone and not really be defying their commitment to OPEC Plus. I suspect that's why Robert Novak was in the room to discuss the effect of the cap and probably to make it less likely that it's going to work. Bob, I, at China, always get to get your analysis, path trading partners, co-founder and...",https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ahmy7qqS3zQ,38,2022-10-06 16:34:02

Bob Iichino, always good to get your analysis, Pat Trading Partners, CoFounder and Chief Market Strategist. Well, millions of Americans hoping for student loan forgiveness are waiting for online applications to open this month, but the Biden administration's plan could cost more than 400 billion and could give higher earners greater benefits. Another issue is mounting legal challenges in recent weeks. Biden administration seems to have reacted to this with some scaling back of those measures. Let's bring in Mark Goldwine, he is SVP and Senior Policy Director of the Committee for Responsible Federal Budget. We're good to talk to you today. What steps the administration has now taken? We've got boroughs with privately held student loans no longer qualifying for relief. You've been quite critical of the initial announcement from the administration. What do you think is going to look like? Once we go through all these legal hurdles? The administration is playing legal lacumal right now. I think the issue is very likely the courts are going to rule this illegal if it comes to court. The administration is trying to prevent it from coming to court by making sure nobody has standing. Private lenders complain you prevent people from rolling over their consolidating their private plans. People that are in the income driven repayment plan plan you create an opt out. The administration is trying to cut off legal channels for people to challenge this in court, but if it does get challenged, I think there's a decent chance it's not going to make it. What do you mean when you say it's not going to make it? Are we talking about a complete cancellation of the program? That's a possibility. I'm not a lawyer in economists, but I can tell you how much this costs. The authority the president's using for this unilateral cancellation was really an authority meant to cancel that for troops coming back from Afghanistan. It wasn't meant for every single person of the pandemic. It's meant for people with financial hardship. I think there's a good chance courts are going to look at this and say the president overstepped his authority. Spending is really the authority of the Congress, not of the president. Let's talk about some of the criticisms when this first came out. You said that this would was largely targeted towards those at the top half of the income spectrum. 57% you say to 65% of the extended positive cancellation go to help those who are in the higher earning bracket. Has that thesis changed for you at all? As you point out, the administration has done this legal lacomal and tried to evolve the program. I don't think it's going to change that much. When we were just about canceling $10,000 per person, this plan was very regressive. The administration fixed some of that by basically doubling the cost for people that were on the Pell Grants program. But when we found it's still up to two thirds of the benefit will go to the top half. I don't think any of these changes are going to change it much. Over a lot of people that were in private loans or people that have been in default for a long time.",https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ahmy7qqS3zQ,39,2022-10-06 16:37:53
2721," Still, up to two-thirds of the benefit will go to the top half. I don't think any of these changes are going to change it. Much, remember a lot of the people that were in private loans are people that have been in default for a long time and maybe just got out of it. And so I think they're going to look distributionally pretty similar. As you point out, since this policy was first announced, the administration has been hit both from the left, as well as the right with those saying it doesn't go far enough and other saying, this is just simply irresponsible. If, in fact, your thesis holds, and I realize you're not a lawyer, but these legal cases really come to try and halt the program in some way. What do you think should be done in terms of targeting those who have debt? Is there a way to go about this policy without the wider bracket that we have heard from the administration? More importantly, is there appetite in DC to pick up that discussion again? I hope that if the courts were the soleagle, we're out of money, we actually have to think. And I hope the administration will reach out to the relevant committees in Congress and actually work on legislation to focus on higher education costs and value themselves. Because that's the real problem. As tuition is continue to rise fast, the people aren't getting as much value for that tuition. There are also things we can do to improve, for example, the income driven repayment program to make sure that nobody's really, or that fewer people are really stuck with debt. But that's not going to happen with some kind of across the board cancellation. The current proposal, I think, is mainly got to just add a lot to inflation, drive up higher edged costs, and give a lot of windfall benefits to folks that don't really need it. Mark, I do want to ask you about another headline number that came out this week. Gross national debts are passing $31 trillion. We're talking about just $1 trillion being added in a nine-month span. Obviously borrowing is going up because of rates going up. What does this mean, ultimately, for the fiscal health of the country? Well, we're in big trouble. Look, we've the highest inflation rate in 40 years. That's in no small part because of these very high deficits we've been running. We also are headed towards record levels of debt, even as a share of the economy. We're going to be higher than World War II. And with the Fed now raising interest rates to try to fight inflation, there's a very real risk that debt becomes unsustainable. We face one of these interest rates spirals that just a year ago people were saying wasn't possible. Mark Goldwine, SVP and Senior Policy Director of the Committee for Responsible Federal Budget. Good to talk to you today. Joining us with more on all this is Maria Vettme. She's State Street Global Market Senior Multiaxid Strategist. Good to talk to you today. Walk me through this big reversal that we have seen. We started Q4 off with a big bang. And here we are today talking about a big sell off. Yeah, hi. I mean, for us, the kind of big rally we saw earlier in the week was a minute bit unexpected. We still have fairly barely bearish outlook on the market. So it could have been potentially a little bit over exaggerated reaction to some concerns for science of them.",https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ahmy7qqS3zQ,40,2022-10-06 16:42:17
2722," outlook on the market. So it could have been potentially a little bit over exaggerated reaction to some concerns for science of concerns about labor market. But I think it's important to kind of realize that we came to this to the date release in Joel's number in a very oversold position in risk assets, right? So Stokes been selling fairly consistently for good six weeks, dollars close to all time highs. We have a very difficult position in the market. So market was a very short risk. You have a number that suggests that labor market is potentially weakening. You can change Fed expectations and boom, you have this huge reaction. But on the kind of hindsight, what we see is that actually US economy may be showing first signs of labor market weakening, but there are a lot more to it. And kind of our overall kind of barricade comes from consumers still have money to spend labor market. We don't know whether it's that week after all. I mean, you're putting chart of participation rate. We know that people haven't come back to work to pre-covet level. So money is still there. So inflation problem is not so difficult to get very bullish in this market. Yeah, that is a long list of things that you just rattled off in terms of concerns weighing on investors right now. We've obviously got that big jobs number coming out on Friday. What's your expectation there? And what are we likely to see from the market if, in fact, it comes in a little weaker than expected? No, I think you're exactly right. So kind of risk reward is very, very asymmetric. So market really light stone to first Joltz number, which is, I mean, not the primary number in terms of economic numbers in general, but market was very, very encouraged and hopeful that we have seen some weakness from what FETO has already done and they don't need to be very, very aggressive. So should that be confirmed by week payroll number, I think the reaction would be really, really huge. If we see, I mean, we're probably not in a camp expecting a lot of weakness and should that come then we kind of continue to going down, but definitely outsized reaction on weaker payroll numbers. We've said that we're looking ahead to that November meeting for the FET. In the meantime, we've got earnings season really kicking off into high gear. How much of that is going to be the driver moving forward, at least in the short term? I mean, that was really interesting because so far this year because earnings almost didn't matter. So what has was driving equity markets is really those macroeconomic head fins and compression and multiples while earnings stayed, I mean, not not great, but still positive. So companies were producing profits. So up to now earnings didn't matter. We probably expect something similar. We still expect corporate earnings to be somewhat okay, not great. So trailing earnings exceeding reported numbers. Guidance will probably be weakish as we worry a lot about the management of worry about a lot about tighter financial conditions. So guidance will probably be weak, but it's really about policy. So I would probably still say that yes, earnings isn't important, but macroeconomic headwinds dominate.

2723," you pupu astronauts were sighing so they literally were seeing firsthand in both shave the stock price flight. They are looking then going crazy giving us these biggest oil cut that we've seen since 2020. We want to bring an Andy Lippau president of Lippau Oil Associates. Andy, it's great to see you again. So of course, the big question here is what this does to the price of oil. Goldman out this afternoon, raising its fourth quarter forecast, $110.00. A barrel saying that this is very bullish for crude. What do you think? Well, I think it is bullish. And we saw on Monday and Tuesday, the oil market react prior to the meeting and go up by $7 a barrel. And here we've added another dollar today on the back of the OPEC Plus announcement. The one thing that I would point out is while the production cut is advertised as two million barrels a day from their existing quotas, OPEC Plus is already producing 3.6 million barrels a day underneath their quotas. So the actual impact is more likely to be between 900,000 barrels a day and a million barrels a day. So then Andrew, in terms of the timing of this, could traditionally OPEC OPEC Plus, they do tend to stay the course in this. What do you think was perhaps the tipping point that led to this? Well, I think there's a number of things starting with OPEC Plus concerned about the world going into a recession, which in part was caused by high energy prices earlier this year when we saw crude oil prices rallied between $130 and $140 a barrel, as well as the high natural gas prices that we're seeing in Europe, which is causing a contraction and industrial output. So I think they wanted to take a preemptive step to reduce production in light of declining demand. I think another reason that they've cut production is to stabilize prices because they see a stronger dollar than higher inflation rates eating into their budgets. And we heard from the Biden administration shortly after this was announced saying that it will continue SPR releases as appropriate, also looking for additional tools to reduce the organization's control over energy prices. They talked about doing this with Congress. What does that potentially look like and entail? Well, there's very few levers that the government can actually do. If we want to reduce the price of fossil fuels, we need to get more of them out of the ground and the administration really hasn't been favorable to adopting those policies. One thing that has been discussed is perhaps limiting or banning the export of crude oil or refined products. But if we think about that, though we're part of the global market on crude oil, if we were to export less, some other place in the world, namely Europe or Asia would go without. On the refined products, we're exporting a significant amount down to Mexico, Chile, Brazil, Argentina, and the rest of South America, as well as Europe. So these policies in order to reduce exports and build inventories here have significant ramifications between the US and its allies. And so to that point, then, when you have these sort of shifting dynamics here, what does this do in terms of US influence on OPEC and OPEC Plus and who is OPEC and OPEC plus primarily then focusing on? Well, I think that OPEC Plus's decision is really showing the waning influence of the United States, and they're really snubbing their nose at the higher energy prices that are impacted.",https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ahmy7qqS3zQ,42,2022-10-06 16:51:14
2724," decision is really showing the waning influence of the United States and they're really snubbing their nose at the higher energy prices that are impacting whether it's the US or the European Union. When we do look at OPEC plus, you know, we have the core OPEC 10, which excludes Iran, Libya, and Venezuela. And then we've got a number of countries outside of OPEC, the non-OPEC 9, which of course includes Russia. But at its core, the decision is really rest with Saudi Arabia, the United Arab Emirates in Kuwait, who are currently producing at their quota. And those are the three countries that were reluctant to increase beyond their quota to make up for the shortfalls from countries like Nigeria and Angola. This clearly is not what the White House wanted, what the Biden administration wanted the decision to be. And, of course, this comes amid concerns about a weakening economy. If we do see oil prices jump from here, if we do see $100 a barrel, I guess, how big of a hit do you see that potentially meaning then for demand? I guess, to what extent do you see demand falling off if we are back above $100 a barrel? Well, I think world-wide demand could drop, you know, one to two million barrels a day. Now, if we put that in context with really high natural gas prices in Europe, I think OPEC plus is fear and even deeper declines and demands, maybe three million barrels a day, which could really put oil prices under pressure. And so, Andy, how soon do you think we'll hit that $100 a barrel mark? In terms of the domino effect, when perhaps US consumers might start to feel the impact of that, how soon do you think that will happen? Well, I think these higher oil prices certainly prevent gasoline prices from continuing their seasonal drop during the winter. So, I would argue that the consumer at the gas pump is already going to be seeing the impact over the next couple of weeks. Also, we're going to see a greater impact on the diesel fuel price because that's really where the shortages are located, inventories in the US are at their lowest level for this time of year since 1996. The European Union is about to phase in their ban on Russian refined product imports in February and their buying seven to 900,000 barrels a day. And as diesel prices go up, the consumer is going to pay for it in the cost of goods and services that are delivered to their homes. Certainly putting more pressure on the Fed is they're trying to get inflation down as well. A big thank you, Andy Liffel, for joining us this afternoon. Mariner's played a playoff game. We were still renting movies from Blockbuster Video, including the first Harry Potter flick. It was 21 years ago and Friday, the longest postseason drought on American professional sports comes to a close.

2725," Oh, and Friday, the longest postseason drought on American professional sports comes to a close. Let's talk about it with Mariners president of Business Operations, Katie Griggs. Katie, great to see you. Your star player, Julio Rodriguez, had not yet turned one the last time this happened. How do you describe the excitement level in Seattle? I mean, it's palpable. It was incredible on Friday night, if you saw it on the faces of our athletes, and the fans, and the stands, and then basically homes throughout our region. I mean, it really was a moment of celebration for this city. Getting that monkey off our back was incredibly important, and now we can focus on bigger and better goals. You are clearly the lucky charm in your first year. Hopefully someday, you know, being the only woman president in Major League Baseball is not a big deal, but it is now with the only one that has that title. What do you want young women to learn from your rise to this point? I think it's a don't have to be anything unique. It really is important to be yourself. But with that being said, it's helpful to see someone like you, and know that, you know, that there are people that can do it, and therefore you can do it. I hope so. The journey has been an interesting one for you. You enrolled in North Carolina, stated 14. You went to turn our sports. You worked for the Atlanta United FC Soccer Club, and now the Mariners, what's the common thread throughout that journey? You know, I've been incredibly fortunate throughout my career to be surrounded by mentors who have helped support me as I try to figure out what I wanted to be when I grew up. I never could have scripted the career path that I've been on. With that being said, I've really built a career around learning and trying to find places where I didn't have experience, get that experience and see where it took me, and I've been incredibly fortunate that it's taken me here to the Seattle Mariners. Yeah, you weren't really focused on baseball. You weren't necessarily a baseball lifer, so how'd you wind up as president of the Seattle Mariners? Baseball's always been a part of my life. I actually played Little League as a kid. My neighbor had a batting cage in his yard, and we were always out there playing. So it's been something that's been part of my life since I was little. The Durham Bulls are my team growing up and Raleigh North Carolina. So baseball's always been a passion of mine. With that being said, for me, it's about the fans. It's about how do we use sports to bring our communities together? And baseball, we have 81 regular season opportunities to do that throughout the year, and we're really excited here in Seattle to hopefully bring folks together many more times throughout the postseason as well. And because of all those games, it's probably the biggest challenge in bringing that fan experience because there are so many games. It's led to some interesting innovations with the Mariners and Amazon. Tell us about that. Yeah, no, for us, it really is about ensuring every single fan has an incredible experience. And one thing that anyone who works in sports or anyone who's been to a venue knows is lines can be a real challenge when you're bringing tens of thousands of people together on a game day. So with partnership with Amazon and their Just Walk Out technology, we rolled out a, what we're calling our walkoff market. At the beginning of this season, and it's something where our fans can swipe their credit card walk in, get food, concessions, some chotchkes, and then walk straight out and avoid the line altogether. And it's something that's, we've seen tremendous return so far. Oh, boy, what a huge difference. So it's not just you, the league is making some changes. They're adding the pitch clock to help that fan experience next year. How do you think that'll help from the fan experience? And what else can the game do to appeal to a younger audience? Yeah, I think, you know, they're making a lot of moves that I'm really optimistic. We'll ensure that that fan experience stays fresh and meets the needs of today's fan. With that being said, I think one of the opportunities we have, and you've seen it here in Seattle this year, you referenced Tuleo earlier, is really, we've got tremendously engaging charismatic athletes on our squad. And so for us, we recognize when you're looking at Gen Z, you're looking at Gen Alpha. This is a, these are cohorts that grew up on social media. They know what's real, they know what's fake. They care about authenticity. And so for us, it's how do we ensure that we're showcasing our athletes for who they are, the silly, the fun, the competitive, bringing that to life in a way that resonates with both current fans as well as people who haven't yet discovered their fans. Speaking of the silly and the fun, I don't know if you know about the Savannah bananas, they're an exhibition team down in Savannah. They have more TikTok followers in the Red Sox, Yankees, and Dodgers combined. Is there something that can be learned from what they're doing and applied to Major League Baseball? I think the Savannah bananas have done an absolutely phenomenal...",https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ahmy7qqS3zQ,44,2022-10-06 17:00:28
2726," He's in Dodgers combined. Is there something that can be learned from what they're doing and applied to Major League Baseball? I think the Savannah Banana has done an absolutely phenomenal job of creating an experience, right? And so when you're looking at this, what they're doing, they're bringing the fun back to the sport. And for us, whether you're looking at exactly how we do it, I suspect it'll look a little bit different, but whether you're looking at the celebrations that happen after a home run, whether you're looking at about celebrations that happen after a winter, the ways in which our athletes get along with each other, get along with our fans. A lot of that fun is something we focus on a lot in terms of bringing that to the forefront and ensuring that whether you're at the ballpark, you're watching from home or you're consuming on social media, you're getting a sense of that. So think with the Savannah Banana, you're doing his awesome. Another fan evolution is you took advantage of the work from home concept with work from the ballpark. Tell us about that and you see this returning. Yeah, we'd love to. I think it was something we saw tremendous and interesting in our marketplace, which was a lot of fun. Now we recognize people are doing all sorts of different things and are working from a variety of locations. And really this was an opportunity. We saw some folks who were here taking Zoom calls from Microsoft Teams calls from the actual ballpark itself. We also saw some people who were having team meetings there and bringing people together. It really is about how do we leverage the incredible asset we have here at Team Noble Park to ensure that we're creating an experience that works for everyone. And we know for day games, a lot of folks have to work. So if you got to work, we can give you a pretty cool backdrop to do it. Innovative and inflation proof. You guys are offering tickets and a meal for 20 bucks. How was that done at the major league level let alone on an expensive city like Seattle? Yeah, no, look, we are tremendously fortunate. We talked about the 81 regular season home games earlier. That means we have a lot of ability to welcome in our community. And we realize our community represents a lot of different people with a lot of different economic abilities. We believe we have an opportunity and obligation to be a place where everyone can come together. And that means we need to price things accordingly. So on our value games, we have tickets as low as $10 and you referenced our value menu, which we rolled out this year. For $3, you can have a refillable soda, a hot dog, popcorn, peanuts, red vines. It really is something where we're intending to ensure that all of our fans, regardless of who he's here, they are, can come, can have a good experience and can afford to come back again. All right, Katie, I promise you this. Seattle is coming out to the All-Star Game 2023 in Seattle to see all these innovations. We'll see you there, deal? Can't wait to host you all. All right, Katie Griggs, president of the Seattle Marinus. Congratulations, best of luck in the post season. Good to have you. Thank you. Thank you. You better take me with you on that trip. I promise, you will. I'm in. We'll set up some jobs. I'm in an easy sell, yeah. I like it. Maybe we'll do the show from there a few days. I like it. I like the bosses watching. In this episode of influencers, venture capital list and domain money CEO, Adam Dell. You can invest today in the banking system of tomorrow. And that's a very exciting investment opportunity for retail investors. If you are solving a fundamental problem with a technology solution that appeals to the end customer, that's a pretty good formula. I've been very fortunate to have a front row seat to one of the great entrepreneurial success stories in our country's history and couldn't be more proud of my brother, Boyd, he's done. Hello, everyone. And welcome to influencers. I'm Andy Surwer and welcome to our guest, Adam Dell, venture capitalist and the founder and CEO of a new trading platform, Domain Money. Adam, great to see you. Good to see you, Andy. Thanks for having me. I want to ask you all about domain money, but first of all, I've got to ask you about the crazy markets this year, both in crypto and in equities. What the heck is going on? Well, market volatility is one of the things that is inherent in our market, right? Whenever you have such a large inflow of capital.",https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ahmy7qqS3zQ,45,2022-10-06 17:04:25
2727," is one of the things that is inherent in our market. Whenever you have such a large inflow of capital into a discrete number of assets, you're going to have significant swings. As Warren Buffett likes to say, the market is a voting machine in the short term and a weighing machine in long term. And as I look at the long term trends, some of the free cash flows, sources that are being spit out of some of the larger tech names. I'm quite bullish on their prospects going forward. And as it relates to cryptocurrencies where we're focused, I look at the fundamental underlying components of blockchain technologies and their contribution to our financial markets, less from a speculative standpoint and more from a core market function, a core financial function. If you look at, say, example, VISA, VISA moved about $10 trillion worth of transaction volume around the planet last year. Last year, Ethereum alone moved 11 trillion. And so that just gives you a sense of the scale of the impact of these technologies and what impact they will have on our broader economy. I'll give you another example. Money markets. A few years ago, the number of dollars involved in DeFi, money market protocols was less than a billion. That's a 2018 stat. This year, it's over 200 billion. And so the growth of the financial utility of these underlying technologies is undeniable. And as they become more widely adopted in commercial use cases, again, unrelated to speculation, I think you're gonna see a significant growth in real revenue and real cash flow coming out of these technologies. Yeah, I hear you, and I wanna ask you more about those technologies, but just sort of again, back to the macro environment, because, say, first of all, with the tech stocks, they've just been such winners in so many ways in our economy, but the driver here right now is higher interest rates. Does that concern you? Well, I mean, interest rates have been so low for so long that there's a whole generation of investors out there and market analysts who believe that this is the norm. And obviously, on a historical basis, interest rates don't stay this low. And so I think, given the true cost of capital and the fiscal responsibility that is incumbent upon responsible central banks to employ, interest rates inevitably need to go up over the long term. And with regard to cryptocurrencies, blockchain aside, people are talking about Bitcoin and they sort of positioned it, Bitcoin and Ethereum, other cryptocurrencies as either a hedge or not correlated to equities. But right now, it looks like those currencies are correlated to equities. What's your take on that? Yeah, I think that is a reflection of the maturity that the crypto markets are going through. These assets are now more broadly held across a larger institutional base. They're now held across a larger retail base. And so downward pressure in the macro market invariably will impact crypto as well. All right, let's switch over to domain money. Your new company is it pretty new and what is it? How old is it? So we launched today. Oh, that's good. January 25th. So we have thousands of customers on the platform today. It is a robust, sophisticated investment solution for both stocks and crypto. We provide a number of differentiated features that we think distinguish us from the market, achieve among them.",https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ahmy7qqS3zQ,46,2022-10-06 17:08:06
2728," and for both stocks and crypto, we provide a number of differentiated features that we think distinguish us from the market. Chief among them is our signal product, which goes really deep down the data rabbit hole around the underlying fundamentals associated with these crypto assets. I'll give you a few examples. We analyze the Twitter firehose as well as other social channels and we provide a proprietary social sentiment score where we basically provide positive, neutral, negative ratings on the social sentiment of underlying assets. Another thing we do is we track the flow of funds on exchanges, so tracking the on chain and off chain activity of underlying crypto assets, which is indicative of sentiment and price volatility. A third thing we do is we track project health. We look at the overall quality of the management team, the number of GitHub submissions, and we present all of these insights to retail investors in a very consumable and easy to understand way. Those are some of the things that we are doing at Domain that are unique. What about the timing of this all, Adam? With the Fed, probably raising rates a number of times this year, we were in this incredible bull market, particularly during COVID, where there was all those stimulus checks coming into people's pockets and then they were going out to broker dealers and spending it. Are you heading into sort of a wind coming in your face? Yeah, well, short-term market swings are not really the thing that we pay a lot of attention to. We spend much more of our focus on the long-term trajectory of these assets. As I mentioned, there are some incredibly powerful forces that are driving real cash flow out of a number of the investment projects, the investment classes that we're looking at, particularly as it relates to DeFi protocols. We're very encouraged by the underlying trends that we see. A lot of people look at the price of Bitcoin or any given crypto asset over the last couple of weeks and say, gee, this doesn't look really good. I look at something very different, which is that a couple of years ago, there was virtually no transaction volume moving around the world to empower NFT transactions. Last year, it was 23 billion. A few years ago, less than a billion in DeFi volume, last year, 200 billion. 11 trillion in transaction volume on Ethereum. These are profound trends that are not going away just because of the short-term volatility in the financial markets.",https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ahmy7qqS3zQ,47,2022-10-06 17:12:20
2729," you you you you it in And speaking of those profound trends, Adam, and you mentioned, you worked at Goldman, you mentioned Visa, what does your take on these legacy institutions? Are they gonna get consumed by these trends? Or are they gonna co-opt them? I'm everyone I always talk about Visa and MasterCard or Dead because of electronic payments. And of course they benefited like crazy. But now there are questions about those companies, for instance. Yeah. Well, we've been honored that we were selected by MasterCard to be part of their smart path program. What I've seen from the Visa and the MasterCards of the world is they've really wrapped their tentacles around anything and everything related to blockchain technologies because they like many smart investors see the opportunity set and what it can mean for improving the efficiency of our banking plumbing. The bigger story though is what these technologies will do to allow consumers to both borrow and lend on their assets. That game is going to change profoundly because of blockchains and represents for consumers a real opportunity to make real yield on their assets or borrow at a much more market-driven rate rather than one available from their credit card or from their personal loan provider. We'd explain to us how that would work at them. Well, if you look on a number of the DeFi marketplaces where you can borrow and lend, you see rates that are much lower than what you would get from a credit card or from a personal loan provider out there in the market. But aren't those companies just trying to garner market shares and then a money-losing proposition or is the margin on crypto so much lower so that it is still profitable? Well, it's a true marketplace where rates are a function of what someone's willing to pay rather than a fair bit of regulatory constraints and controls that prevent true market rates from being accessible to anyone. You know, the average consumer can't access a money market in the same way that an institutional investor can. And crypto represents an opportunity for those markets to be opened up to anyone.",https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ahmy7qqS3zQ,48,2022-10-06 17:16:17
2730," that access to money market in the same way that an institutional investor can. And crypto represents an opportunity for those markets to be opened up to anyone. That was the metaphor I was looking for. That's great. Okay, and speaking of regulation though, you provided me with a nice segue. The Biden administration is reportedly looking, I was reportedly preparing, I should say, an executive order for release coming up soon that will outline a comprehensive government strategy on crypto. Is it a good idea for the White House to get directly involved here? Well, we welcome and invite regulation into this industry because it's an important step in its maturity. You know, I'm, I'm, I point people to the fact that, you know, China's efforts to try to clamp down on this activity had virtually no impact on the overall value of the market or trading activity for that matter. And it just shows you that information wants to be free and markets want to be free. And so I think it's incumbent upon the United States as a leader, financial systems and financial markets to think, think through the policy decisions around what is a stable digital currency. How do we bring this nascent market into mainstream financial functions while at the same time protecting investors from the things that are scary and may not be as above board about this industry. And obviously in any new industry, those, those, those players emerge. You know, Andy, you and I remember the early dot com period where there were hundreds of companies many going public without clear business model or any line of sight to positive cash flow. And yet despite all of that noise, an enormously valuable set of companies emerged that redefined the very fabric of our economy. And the same dynamic will exist with blockchains and crypto. We're in the middle of a Cambrian explosion of diverse projects and initiatives that are being tackled by engineers using these technologies. And some subset of those will become the very building blocks of the next generation of our banking system. Would regulation impact domain money? We've worked hard to ensure that we are following the letter of the laws relates to regulation because we want to represent this industry as it matures rather than being part of the fringes of the wild, west of the industry. Right. My understanding, Adam, is that you said, quote, the notion that individuals are rational actors as a false one, they're emotional animals and they make financial decisions based on emotion. So is that true? Okay, good. Glad we got that right. To trading platforms like yours though, then have an obligation to protect users from themselves. Well, you know, I believe it's our obligation to inform the consumer and provide them with as much information as we can to educate them about making rational investment choices. We really stress on our platform, education, transparency, and time-tested investment strategies. So we talk a lot about dollar cost averaging. We talk a lot about portfolio theory. We talk about a lot about market fundamentals. What is the market size of this technology? What is the product market fit? What is the management team? What is the business model? And what is the viability of that business model over time? Rather than, you know, things that are meme and momentum driven. And so while I can't protect, you know, individuals from making bad decisions, I can help inform them. And so our goal is to achieve that for investors. I want to ask you about wealth inequality in financial services because of course, the wealthiest Americans still on the vast majority of equities. And it's probably true about crypto, although I'm not really informed. I'm just guessing maybe you know the answer to that as well. How do we address that? Is that anything?",https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ahmy7qqS3zQ,49,2022-10-06 17:21:13
2731," of equities. And it's probably true about crypto, although I'm not really informed. I'm just guessing, maybe you know the answer to that as well. How do we address that? Is that anything that concerns you, Adam? Well, the most interesting opportunity for blockchain technologies is opening up of markets to a broader set of our members of society that don't have fair access to a financial relationship that allows them to live their lives. Borrowing money, earning interest on deposits, those core components of our financial system are available to people who have bank accounts, who have credit scores. And blockchain's operate differently. They don't require there to be trust between the two parties to a transaction. And so they, as I mentioned earlier, represent an opportunity to open up those markets to a broader segment of our society and to make available to individuals who have fewer dollars, a fairer interest rate, a real yield on their savings, which they might not otherwise have access to. I mean, if you're a merchant in Taiwan and you have savings, how do you get yield on those savings? If you're a doctor in Nebraska and you have savings in your bank account, they're paying you 0.06%. That's not a market rate in terms of interest on your money. And blockchain's represent an opportunity to open those up to fair market rates and real market rates for each one of those individuals. Does that mean bad things for the legacy banks? I believe that the legacy banks are smart enough to acquire and partner and evolve their business models over time to embrace the changing nature of how financial entities make money. If you look at banking over the last 10, 15 years, it's been, it's very clear what's happened with the introduction of Dodd-Frank and other regulation, you know, interest rate competition has been introduced into the market. And so the revenue that banks have made from interest has basically been cut in half. In response, what they've done is they've basically doubled their fees. And so they nickel and dime the consumer on these little things that, you know, nobody pays attention to, but add up over time. Eventually that that game is going to run out and true market rates. What can you borrow for at what rate? What can you earn on your deposits at what rate? Those will be made available to consumers without the required on-ramp associated with, you know, establishing a bank account. You will be able to access those rates through DeFi protocols powered by blockchain technologies.",https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ahmy7qqS3zQ,50,2022-10-06 17:25:15
2732," you you you you you you you do you you do you or as we wrap things up here I got to ask you some personal questions, and of course that means I got to ask you about Michael your older brother Michael Dell CEO of Dell what was it like growing up with with Michael and what about it do you think contributed to the success of both of you guys your household? Well my mom used to like to say that she had three boys and she left out food for two. You know, Michael was always a young man in a hurry. He was always tinkering with something, doing something, working on something and he was pretty good at figuring things out. And so, you know, I've been very fortunate to have a front row seat to one of the great entrepreneurial success stories in our country's history and couldn't be more proud of my brother and what he's done. Right. Okay. So, you're still working with him. I mean, you're in touch with him. You guys talk, what's your relationship like today? We talk a lot and I just saw him and he's doing well and working hard and enjoying his role as the CEO of Dell. Yeah, and it's just watching that kind of come and not go, but it's sort of had these different chapters, I guess, is how you characterize it, right? Yep. All right. And so, you've now found it a bunch of successful companies, your self-addom and you've sold some to different entities. What have you learned and what are some mistakes you've made, what are some things you've learned along the way? Yeah. Well, you know, one is that if you are solving a fundamental problem with a technology solution that appeals to the end customer, that's a pretty good formula. And so, I've tried to focus on finding market problems and solving them with technology. The second and this won't be any deep insight, but it's all about the team and the quality of the people around the table trying to solve the problem you're trying to solve. And so, I really focus on that. I'm very proud of the team we've put together at Domain Money.",https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ahmy7qqS3zQ,51,2022-10-06 17:29:17
2733," the table trying to solve the problem you're trying to solve. And so I really focus on that. I'm very proud of the team we've put together at Domain Money, about 25 of my former colleagues from Goldman Sachs chose to join me in this new adventure. And in addition to those folks, we've hired Brad Olson, who was the head of content for seeking alpha, the head of trade-offs from Kenneth Fitzgerald. We hired a COO who ran the crypto business for SOFI. We've established a really solid team that is very focused on our mission, which is to build our customers wealth. You have a metaverse part of it or no? Well, we will bring additional assets onto the platform over time. I think you'll see us getting into the NFT space sooner rather than later. And so customers can look forward to that. In the coming months. All right, let me know when you get the metaverse thing down. Okay, I'll add that and go into Domain Money. Final question Adam, how do you see using your influence on this world? Well, I don't know how much influence I have other than, I like building things. I like catalyzing teams around specific objectives and goals and trying to motivate and set direction there. It is very fun for me to build things. I genuinely enjoy it. I get a real rush out of creating something and then having people use it. And so I'm very focused on making sure that we deliver the best investment platform experience in the market. I remember when Goldman was working on the Apple card and there was chatter among the industry and even within the halls of Goldman Sachs, what does the world need another credit card for? And if you've ever used the Apple card, it's really a delightful, unique experience. And I think the same opportunity exists in investment platforms where there are real improvements that can be made in the customer experience, the customer support, the education process, the journey that we take customers down as we help them try to make better investment decisions. And so I'm very focused on that as well as the rest of the team. Adam Dell VC and founder and CEO of Domain Money. Thanks so much for your time. Andy, thanks for having me. You've been watching influencers. I'm Andy Sirwork. We'll see you next time. You've got talent..... Welcome back to Y'all of Finance. I'm Brian Sausie here with Julie Heimann and Brad Smith. Markets are tiptoeing into Friday's crucial jobs report. It's seen some mixed action across the board amongst the major indices. But for right now, at this particular moment in time, all three major indices in the red. Julie, over to you with some breaking news on a market, you follow very closely. Alright. See this morning's Karai Sabigraad.ป Section",https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ahmy7qqS3zQ,52,2022-10-06 17:35:08
2734," But for right now at this particular moment in time, all three major indices in the red. Julie, over to you with some breaking news on a market. You follow very closely that is mortgage rates. Well, now I do like everyone 6.6% 6.66% is now the average 30 year fixed rate mortgage according to Freddie Mac that information just coming out. It is a very, very slight improvement over the 6.7% that we talked about last week as Freddie Mac, so Chief of Godness points out rates remain quite high compared to just one year ago. Meaning housing continues to be more expensive for potential home buyers. This is something that we have talked a lot about the real world implications of having these higher mortgage rates that are more than double where they were a year ago. The people are just going to pay a lot more over the life of the mortgage. It also means by the way that housing prices are starting to come down as a result because of someone is paying overall more for financing the house than what's got to give in many cases it's the home prices and the demand that we have seen also has been falling to some extent. Yeah, it continues to be more expensive for potential home buyers here. Freddie Mac also noting that they're going to make some enhancements to their market survey really improving and looking at some of the collection quality diversity of data use. It seems like kind of mirroring what we had seen from ADP earlier. This year of the summer this is a time to really get a better sense of how accurate the data still is and still as of right now for some of these rates it does still point to what we all expected and still some home buyers are experiencing is the higher rates that they're having to pay for an extended period of time which is kind of barring out. And it's just the average if your credit isn't up to snuff. Right. You're paying way more than this. Maybe last year at this point if your credit wasn't good what maybe you pay five or six percent now what do you eight nine ten. One thing to point out is people do refinance their mortgages right. So if rates do if you buy a house at this rate and then rates go down then you can many people can then refinance. So that is one little more positive tone here. All right. Let's talk about the implications of all of this and the implications of higher rates on the economy overall for that we bring in Kenneth Rogoff. He is professor of economics at Harvard University is joining us now Ken. Thank you so much for being here first of all. Here is sort of a very visible real world impact of Fed policy right. The rate the rate increase that we have seen in mortgages specifically in the effect that the knock on effect that has on the housing market. What do you think overall about the effectiveness of Fed policy with fighting this current bout of inflation? Well, we haven't had them fight about of inflation in a very long time. So whatever models we had you know we have to dust off and see. I think we know that their long lack of facts hits the markets very quickly. It's equity markets more slowly housing markets but things like employment that the peak effects can be a year off. So it's very hard. You know it's one of the things that makes it so hard for the Fed to get to a soft or softish landing which I'm pretty skeptical about. Okay. So with your skepticism about getting to a softish landing what would the reality of the economic detriment incurred be if we were to see what many economists are calling for a recession in mid 2023? Well I mean I think it could be pretty brutal if the Fed really is hellbent on having inflation come down as quickly as possible to two or two and a half percent. We have Europe very likely going to recession China. It at least a growth recession by all measures for the amorous session. That's a lot of pressures on us. The dollar is very strong and interest rates are rising very fast. So I think the idea that it's going to be a really mild recession if that would be lucky. I say it could be a tough tradeoff for the Fed once the numbers start setting in. I'm a little worried that having gone the wrong way in one direction with the change in their framework and not looking at the unemployment and what that was saying about inflation. They're now going in the other direction and possibly moving to...",https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ahmy7qqS3zQ,53,2022-10-06 17:38:49
2735," and not looking at the unemployment and what that was saying about inflation, turn out going in the other direction and possibly moving too fast, given the long legs. Professor, if the economy does get brutal, like you just suggested, do you think this is a Federal Reserve at some point next year that is back to unwinding these aggressive rate hikes they've been taking recently? So here's the thing, yes, but I think where we're gonna land at the end of this and now I'm looking maybe two years ahead, is that a level of interest rates higher than we're used to, even after inflation comes down. The real interest rate, the premium of the interest rate over the inflation rates, been extraordinarily low since the financial crisis. Some people say it's secular, stagnation, demographic, low productivity inequality, what have you. I think if you look at a long horizon, in fact it was abnormally low in that period and we're gonna get some moving back to being, meaning that interest rates, even when they start coming down, they not come down all that much. So how do we then determine what the sort of natural or stable rate should be, right? Is there any way of sort of gaming that out what that could look like? Very tough. My own research sort of speaks to the 10 year rate, which I think will end up at a higher place than we've been used to before the pandemic. But what's going on with the Fed funds rate, with all the regulation and the financial repression, is a little hard to say. So they really have no idea that's one of the things making it difficult. But if you're asking, I think it'll be higher than we're used to. For consumers right now, what should they be navigating, how can they best navigate perhaps, even leading into the scenario that you've described? Well, I mean, it's a tough picture where probably headed towards a difficult situation coming out of a difficult situation. Certainly I think employment is the key. Everybody's been particularly young people who've been moving jobs every six months or a year. They better think twice about that in this period when it might not be so easy to land on another job. Can I want to switch gears a little bit? Because you focus not just on the US, but on the globe as well. And you and some others are just out with some really interesting research on the real estate market in China. Now, so much attention on the sort of zero COVID policy and the negative effect that's having on China. But there's some underlying risk here that you illustrate in this research. We're looking now, you look at so-called Tier 3 Chinese cities, some of the smaller cities, although still pretty large, and that there's this excessive housing stock and that there's been really a sharp slowdown in prices and housing prices in those areas. What kind of risk is this presenting for the Chinese economy? Well, I think it's a huge long-term problem with or without the zero COVID policy. Housing real estate more generally, commercial real estate infrastructure has been the go-to policy for China. I did some research a couple of years ago, peak China housing, showing all the factors that suggested we really have come to an end of it. And more recently, my co-author and I've shown that a lot of that is concentrated in the more hidden Tier 3 cities, the Cincinnati's of China, so to speak. But they out, like we say, the Cincinnati's of China could be five and 10 million people. I'm like, maybe Cincinnati's of a few hundred thousand. And on top of that, there are a lot of them. They account for 60% of GDP. You don't see it that people travel to the big cities, they're less visible, but they really have a problem where they've been building like crazy and are sort of getting to the end of the line of that development strategy. And it's not that easy for them to pivot. And so what then happens when we do see China coming out of zero COVID at the same time that the rest of the globe is slowing down or even entering recession. I mean, do we see sort of a circular effect here where China's troubles maybe exacerbate the troubles of the rest of the globe?",https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ahmy7qqS3zQ,54,2022-10-06 17:43:09
2736," on or even entering recession. I mean, do we see sort of a circular effect here where China's troubles maybe exacerbate the troubles of the rest of the globe? Oh, China's been enormously important for the rest of the globe. It counted for, I don't know, like a quarter of all global growth over the decade before the pandemic may be going into the first year, at least according to the IMF. And those days are over. I think we're looking at much slower growth in China, who knows what the real numbers are, but much slower growth in China for years to come. And of course, it matters. I mean, it hits commodity exporters, the hardest, that they have a raracious appetite for commodities, but European luxury car makers, et cetera. I think it's going to have a very big effect. And that's even without the Ukraine war and whatever happens there and which side China and so on. Can Rogoff, professor of economics at Harvard University? Thanks so much for the insights and the forecast and calculations, all of it, great conversation. Guys, let's get to yeah, we'll finance this. And as for right, we're at the Wi-Fi Interactive with a look at what's taking place here on the day. And as we're tracking. And you guys were just talking about those markets, right? And just looking at the home builders, we did see a little bit of action here with some of these home builders that had been in green territory. Now losing some of that steam, I just want to also pull up a year-to-date chart so you can see how much these home builders have lost year-to-date. Looking at the sector action, we are seeing the markets down right now. So you're looking at utilities and also real estate, which are moving to the downside. You've got energy, though, that is still in green territory. And over on the NASDAQ 100, some of these mega caps that had been in green earlier are now a bit under pressure in video had been up more than 1% earlier. Now losing some steam. Also looking at some of what's happening with our trending tickers, because we've got two trending tickers that we should mention on our trending ticker page. Well, that's the oil right now. But you can see also the US dollar index by the way going a little bit higher. That is putting pressure on stocks. And on those trending, we are seeing Pinterest that's trending right now. Number one on our Yahoo Finance page, that's after that Goldman call. But also, want to check out Costco because Costco's September sales came in higher than expected. So you're looking at those sales that increasing for Costco. And the stock right now up more than 1% year to date also outperforming the broader markets because that's Chuyi. But year to date Costco down 14%. Still outperforming the broader markets, you can tell consumers still want to get value big bulk. They love Costco. I love those hot dogs. And it's for a Thanksgiving chewy. I appreciate it. Because we're here before we had to break. You saw on that board, and it's highlighted Chuyi. Let's put a spotlight on the impressive week so far for shares of Chuyi. Stock is up close to 20% on the week. We're seeing it add to gains a little bit here on the early going. Dusting the NASDAQ composites 5.5% gain. The online pet retailers stock got a big boost on Wednesday, especially into the clothes as data from investment research outfit Yippet found Chuyi sales trending above expectations for the current quarter. We will note that Chuyi in late August, slashed its full year sales outlook by a couple hundred million dollars. And the stock got absolutely covered. I'm sorry, I was just going to say, I just bought some canned dogs on Amazon versus Chuyi. Oh, really? All right, let's take a discussion offline. Very interesting about that. All right. All right, coming up, supply chain rows are trickling down to the price of Ford's hot selling, electric pickup truck, the F-150, Julie's back with the latest business headlines. I'm the other side of it. All right. All right. All right.",https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ahmy7qqS3zQ,55,2022-10-06 17:47:32
2737," Patreon.yGirls.com Let's get down to business now with some other headlines we're watching. Uber's former security chief Joseph Sullivan has been found guilty of obstructing an FTC probe for failing to report a 2016 data breach to authorities. Prosecutor said he took steps to cover up the incident, classifying the hack as a bug bounty rather than a data breach. Sullivan's legal team said that after the hacker signed non-disclosure agreements, the security chief felt the incident did not need to be reported. The Sullivan now faces a five-year prison sentence for obstruction, and up to three years for failing to report a felony. That data breach, by the way, occurred during Travis Kalinick's term as CEO, where top performers were often given a blind eye. Meanwhile, General Electric is restructuring the company laying off workers at its offshore wind unit as it grapples with weak demand, rising costs, and supply chain delays according to reports. The cuts are expected to affect 20% of the offshore wind unit's US workforce, which equates to hundreds of workers, wind has been GE's largest and most profitable renewable business, but the expiry of renewable energy tax credits took a big toll on demand. And Ford is raising the price again for its electric F-150 Lightning pickup truck. It's the second time in the last couple months. The chief is versioned, now retails for just under $52,000 bucks. It's roughly 30% increase from the original starting price of about 40,000 with first wind on sale in May. Ford said in a statement, the increases on the result of ongoing supply chain constraints, rising material costs, and other market factors. Soz? Twitter shares continue to trade below Elon Musk's $54.20 offer price, as there's still fears on a deal getting done. Let's get more on this with cities, senior analysts, Ron, and Josie Ron. Good to see you here. Just based on your knowledge of the situation, folks, you have talked to, do you still think this deal gets done at that price? You know, we were pretty, the big news this week was around coming together, both parties suggesting with Elon saying we will, on our original $54.20 share offer, and Twitter come out, it's coming out specifically, and saying that it's something that we are looking to do as well. And so the fact that they're both negotiating table, not in court going against each other, I think that's a positive step. And it seems to me, it's just a matter of time until something happens in this deal seems to be on the path to being consummated. So that would be our view overall. What's the reality of any changes that would be?",https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ahmy7qqS3zQ,56,2022-10-06 17:52:23
2738," So me, it's just a matter of time until something happens in this deal seems to be on the path to being consummated. So that would be our view overall. What's the reality of any changes that would be made to Twitter and when that would actually take place, even if and as this does kind of continue to work its way through? Yeah, I mean, if something were to happen, meaning that if it is acquired by Mr. Mosk and if we go through and it's a now private company, look, unfortunately, this has been in the public world now that this acquisition back in force since called it March or April, I believe, with the initial deal, initial offer there. And so Twitter's gone through quite a bit of change from then until now, not only from a business perspective with advertisers potentially pulling back maybe getting a little bit more nervous, some placing ads on Twitter, in addition to the macro changes that are happening out there, but then internally, you know, that there's just a lot of concern in our view around morale, around basically attrition or just getting things done in new products being launched. So your question of how long would it take to sort of get the business back up to speed? Frankly, you know, it would take probably some time to rebuild and the macro environment doesn't what would not help in the current environment where advertising continues to be a little bit of a softer subject overall. And Ron, we don't even know what he's going to do with the company, right? I have to say, man, it must be tough analyzing this company right now. You didn't know if the deal was going to get done. You don't know what Elon's going to do if he does indeed consummate the deal, right? I mean, we've gotten some hints dropped. There's been a lot of speculation. Trump's going to come back. He's talked about this, everything app X, whatever. But like, how do you, how do you even model concretely in a situation like this? Well, it'll be a lot easier for them internally as a private company, so you wouldn't have to talk to folks like myself to model and figure out what's next. But you essentially have to rebuild the business, right? So you start, I'm sure the first order of business is to look at the product to your point, see what can be done to make it more user friendly, to get more users on the service, onboarding with something that was a big focus prior to this saga that we're in currently. And so number one would be product. Number two then is figuring out how you best monetize. And right now the model is primarily advertising, but of course there's options around subscription, there's options around maybe payments or something along those lines purchases. So there's different things you can do. But I think day one, whenever this comes to a conclusion, has to be let's focus on the product, let's make sure it becomes that, call it town square, open free marketplace, and then everything else should follow. But it's not something that I think happens overnight. It's likely to take some time. Ron, is there an appetite in the marketplace for this super app concept that Elon is pushing here? Do consumers want to, let's say, go into Twitter, tweet then also maybe get taken to trade some stocks on XYZ platform, and then order an Uber, and then a hamburger for dinner. I mean, do people really want that? Yeah, it's interesting. The super apps here in the West haven't really taken on as much as they have, taken off as much as they have over in Asia and other parts of the world. And so that definitely is a TBD overall. Partnerships to allow things along those lines that would build off of what you see on Twitter make sense. You can see that happening. But one super app, it's a change in use case, right? And the thing with Twitter that haven't covered the company for a while now and looking at it quarter in, quarter out, the number one thing is a product be those monetizable daily active users. And so the more you can do to get those users on board, everybody knows Twitter. What's always surprising is you would think it would have a bigger footprint overall. And so that's the, in terms of users. And so that's probably the job number one. And if the super app does that, that's a big question. But frankly, it's still too early to even offer that. And I think you're right. It would have to be something that would at least be in line to what you are looking for and consuming while on Twitter. And there's partnerships that can make that happen. But it's definitely, I would say, the product is that's on the roadmap for down the road once everything settles for the most part. Is it possible that after all of the dust is settled, that Twitter in privacy becomes.",https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ahmy7qqS3zQ,57,2022-10-06 17:56:30
2739," for down the road once everything settles for the most part. Is it possible that after all of the dust is settled, that Twitter in privacy becomes a media company? And I mean a media company with partnerships that can actually charge people for the ability to watch video content, whether that be from the WMBA, whether that be live sports or the partnerships with even some of the entertainment companies that they've worked with over the past, creating kind of a charging premise based on that, where the social connectivity just becomes an extra add-on on top of that. Yeah, I mean, there's a lot of things that you can do with the platform when you have as many monetizable DAUs that are out there. I would say, and we've always talked about the content on Twitter is amongst the best out there, and the content is really just an amalgamation of what people are saying and doing and tweeting and whatnot. And you can get lost in Twitter for hours, the challenges that product providing those details on what you're looking for, going more on a media strategy, working with providers and partners. We've seen success in that, right? And I think Twitter in the past has had partnerships by providing videos and highlights from the Olympics, from the NFL, from many different sports teams, as well as award shows and whatnot. So I think going down the media path is something that would continue. The question is, the model changes from primarily advertising to maybe some sort of subscription. That's a TBD. And I would say most entertainment companies on the web that have gone the paying for content, it's not an easy sort of chasm or bridge to cross. And so you really need to provide that value to get users to subscribe to it. And right now, again, Twitter has some tremendous and fantastic content in there to matter surfacing it and providing that right user experience on a personalized level. And naturally, the key thing going forward, the personalization. Well, Ron, unfortunately, I think this is the first time we've talked to you about Twitter. Unfortunately, maybe it'll be the last of this deal goes through. Although perhaps it'll be a relief for you. I don't know. We'll find some other good stocks to talk about with you, though. Thanks so much for coming on, cities, senior analysts, Ron, Josie appreciate it. Thanks for having me. Coming up, Europe's natural gas crisis and focus as the E remains divided on how to tackle rising energy prices will have the latest on the other side. we have here.",https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ahmy7qqS3zQ,58,2022-10-06 18:02:07
2740," the This morning, Swedish investigators confirmed suspicions of many, saying that the recent leaks in the Nordstrom gas pipelines from Russia to the EU were caused by detonations. Now they don't say who was responsible for those detonations, but nonetheless, they say the preliminary investigation has, quote, strengthened the suspicions of serious sabotage. Let's talk about the natural gas dynamics in that area and indeed around the globe. For that, we're joined by Goldman Sachs head of natural gas research. That is Samantha Dart. Samantha, it's good to see you again. So we got this report this morning. I, again, it sort of confirms what a lot of folks had suspected. I don't know if it changes in your mind the calculation, the risks to supply, knowing indeed that it was detonations that caused those leaks. It doesn't really, we already expected it and I think this is pretty much consensus that Nordstrom one or Nordstrom two for that matter would not flow gas to Nordstrom gas. Not only now, but going into next year as well. So our Nordstrom gas balance is remained the same. Okay. And so, I mean, for those of us who are still trying to admittedly wrap our heads around this fully, I mean, the price impact that this would have towards the end users, the end consumers of this natural gas as well. Yeah. So, what the region is having to deal with is a massive lack of supply, right? This has been already established since the close from Russia have been curtailed and increasingly curtailed over the course of this year. As a result, we have seen prices skyrocket to 10 times or more, their 10-year average. And we expect them to remain elevated going forward. Now sequentially, it's a bit tricky because over the course of the winter, actually if winter temperatures are close to average, we expect prices to drop a little bit and bring a little bit of relief because you have enough storage to deal with that deficit. Now go and eat you next summer, yes, we still expect extremely elevated prices over 230 euros summer next year. Samantha, your colleagues over on the oil side of the equation raised their forecast for Brent, I know. If oil prices start to trend back up higher, will we see an uptick in natural gas demand? Or is that demand just kind of firmly capped by the price action we've seen on that side? So you're right that under this surprisingly bullish op-at-cut that has been announced, the balance for oil looks even tighter. And as our colleagues highlighted, you still have the risk of potentially a $30 per barrel spike to oil prices from here. Now even taking that into account, natural gas is still so expensive that it would continue to provide an incentive for users to substitute actually away from that natural gas and into oil. So one interesting anecdote that we've been seeing, especially going into this winter, is that now this gas to oil substitution is not even just about the power generation sector, but it's also happening starting to happen in the industrial sector where some users, instead of buying incredibly expensive natural gas, they're opting for using oil in their boilers instead.",https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ahmy7qqS3zQ,59,2022-10-06 18:04:41
2741," probably expensive natural gas, they're opting for using oil in their boilers instead. Samantha, if we do in fact go into a more prolonged recession or economic slowdown, where do you see prices for natural gas going? So the interesting thing about this slowdown that we are seeing, especially in Europe, is that it's being caused by the lack of natural gas. So think about it this way. We don't have the normal supply of natural gas. So the only way to manage storage, the only way to guarantee that we're not going to face blackouts in the winter is to curtail demand. So this is why prices have been so elevated. And as a result, yes, we're seeing aluminum producers cutting back, fertilizer producers, gas, I'm sorry, cement, glass, refineries. So industrial activity is indeed slowing and bringing Europe into a recession because of the lack of natural gas. So this is what needs to happen until this deficit in gas is resolved. Goldman Sachs head of natural gas research, Samantha Dart, always good to see you. We'll talk to you soon. Coming up, Guggenheim is calling this company its best idea into 2023. Now time for our call for the day. Despite Nike's inventory lows in margin pressure, Guggenheim is feeling good about the sneaker giant. The investment bank is maintaining its $135 price target and by rating on the Athlete's make or calling it its best idea into 2023 or another way of looking at this. They're saying just do it. I could not get it.",https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ahmy7qqS3zQ,60,2022-10-06 18:08:28
2742," decision that gets triggered from there, then Pinterest perhaps can maintain some of that fanfare among its new consumers, and that triggering a better average revenue per user on the site too. I like this note, and one reason why I like it is because I was at that Goldman Sachs conference. I saw Eric working in the room, and I saw the Pinterest team there. So this is a very thorough, I think, well thought out report by Eric Sheridan, who came on with us at the event, talked a lot about the headwinds that tech is facing right now, but there's a lot of expectations now built into Pinterest, and I think a lot of that rests on New CEO Bill Ready, delivering against some of these expectations, and I would just caution investors that it might take a couple quarters to see his vision play out on the top and bottom lines of Pinterest. Those shares are actually downless this year than I would have expected. All right, let's talk about, and speaking of shares that have been going down, Credit Suisse, JP Morgan upgrading the stock from underweight to neutral citing a positive impact from the Lenders reported restructuring plan. You can see the shares are bouncing a little bit today. They're up just about 1% in US trading, that is. Of course, they also trade in their native Switzerland, and JP Morgan, it's a pretty wonky node here, but basically they're outlining two scenarios. In the first scenario, a dramatic restructuring of the bank with a 70% shrink in its investment banking operations and exit from fixed income commodities and currency trading and equities trading. So that would indeed be a big change in that scenario. Their tier one capital ratio would actually stay the same according to JP Morgan. In the second scenario, they assume yet another half-hearted investment bank restructuring and they seem to be a little bit less positive on that particular scenario. So still some scenarios for Credit Suisse to sort of pull through this without needing to raise additional capital, I guess, is kind of the bottom line here by selling shares. This is a good bedtime read. Yeah. Oh, the realtor is. Hey, the Nike guy died, right? They just do OK. All right, before we get... Giving people information. Well, you know what, here's the thing. Nike is then great. Pinterest, maybe they'll do better, and Credit Suisse, we'll see what they do. Guys, coming up on the other side of this show break. We've got our, well, we've got much more here on Yahoo Finance. Including, well, we don't have the fan who caught Aaron Judges' 60-second home on ball. But guess what? He's fielding offers upwards of $2 million. We've got more on the other side. Yeah. Good afternoon. Yeah, good afternoon.",https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ahmy7qqS3zQ,61,2022-10-06 18:16:12
2743," seven you Slava, Debase. Time for Cup of Time. Three stories, one minute each. We start with this today. People still want their Costco hot dogs and bulk groceries, despite rising prices. Costco reported another strong month of sales. For September with net sales, up 80 or 8.5%, 80.5% year over year. This despite same-store sales, dipping on lower gas prices. All right. You're taking a look at some of the comps, up 8.5% year over year, 4 Costco. People still want it. You love it. You like saying about this hot dog? I will refrain from saying something funny on the hot dog. And I'll say this, it was good to see prices decelerate in September versus August. So another little sign that inflation in a lot of these everyday categories that a Costco grocery stores you name it, is starting to roll over a little bit. And that's a good thing. I think for consumers spending into the holidays. I will say, I think they recently said that they're not going to raise their membership price yet. You're predicting one that was made. It's coming, it's coming. It is. Yes. And the gold. It's not like it's not coming this year. They waited me the last minute, but it's going to be a big earnings driver for that company. Yeah. And I mean, comparatively, Costco, BJs, Sam's Club, underneath of Walmart, all of them had been trying to cozy up to the consumer, especially in the bulk buying boom. That would say. Indeed. All right. Uber is reviving itself driving vehicle plan after selling its autonomous driving research division. Uber signed a 10-year deal with an emotional to add self-driving cars to its vehicle lineup. The self-driving cars would work for both Uber and Uber Eats and several U.S. cities upon launch. Still no details on where, where that will be. And, you know, I recently saw some of my first self-driving cars out in San Francisco. I know some, you know, going to New York, going to another place. And I think it was a ZUX. I just can't see how these are the future. I still have a driver behind them. And I still ordered Uber. I didn't order a ZUX, but they look cool. And that's all you got for me. Yeah. Yeah. It seems like it's really early stage. I mean, regulations, like nothing is there yet. Yeah. I've interviewed the CEO of ZUX and the founder of ZUX before. And, of course, all of those companies that you kind of lumped together there between ZUX, between Waymo, and then even for Uber and some of their driverless technology, it's all going to be dependent upon how well they're also able to license that out to some other companies. That want to take advantage of it in the future too. But, again, a lot of red tape that they've got to get through. And then, additionally, when you think of the customer, and how this is able, going to be able to cut down costs for the customer as well as the company, operating costs per mile, north of a dollar. This could perhaps bring it below 40 cents. Yeah. All right. And a big payday for the lucky baseball fan who caught Aaron Judges, that Aaron Judges ball. The ball estimated to bring in $2 million at auction, as of now the Dallas-based man that caught the ball has not decided what he wants to do with it. He could give it back to Judges and the Yankees, or he could sell it himself. Another unknown is taxes. The IRS has yet to come in, but some experts speculate catching the ball could count as a taxable... Isn't this guy a millionaire? That's what I was told by our team. I don't know anything about him. Oh, good for him. So then, is it a capital gains tax because you paid for the... Sounds like he could afford it....to go to the game. And then now your return on that is you actually got a good bet off. I mean, I just think it's fascinating that the regulations are such that when you catch a ball, it becomes your property. And one of our producers, Connor Hickey, was explaining to us, it's written on purpose that way, because it absolves them of liability if you are injured by something flying, right? Whether it's a bat or a ball or whatever it may be. I think Connor owns a lot of Mickey Mantle rookie cards, so he's sitting on that ball. So he knows a lot about that. Okay. Alright, guys, coming up next, we're going to talk a little Tesla. Stick around.",https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ahmy7qqS3zQ,62,2022-10-06 18:20:29
2744," Now there's a lot about that. Alright guys coming up next. We're gonna talk a little Tesla, stick around. Tesla CEO Elon Musk continues to make headlines surrounding the Twitter acquisition. Meanwhile, shares of Tesla, T-S-L-A. Tesla's shares are moving lower on the day by 1.2% of the shares. Around the tech-tightened sales of Tesla shares to finance, deal making coupled with whether he might be too distracted to hit targets at Tesla. Just one point, for regulatory reasons, So Is Elon Musk too distracted to run Tesla. Frankly, Tesla's his baby. This company is a great expression of his personality and he has shown tremendous capability to manage many different things, nerling the boring company, SpaceX, and other outside ventures. And the intellectual curiosity necessary to execute pretty well there. So will it possibly take time away from Tesla? Yes. I think the question that probably needs to be asked is will he be giving enough time to Twitter? And I'm not the best judge of that. I think you already have some pretty clear ideas on.",https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ahmy7qqS3zQ,63,2022-10-06 18:25:33
2745," is will he be giving enough time to Twitter? And I'm not the best judge of that. I think he already has some pretty clear ideas on Twitter and he does have a history with PayPal and the digital payments space, which I think is part of his vision on fixing that asset. So it doesn't bother me for Tesla. I have other reasons that I'm very bearish on company, but I have tremendous respect for what they've done. Well, we'll get to those reasons in a second, Craig, but does it even matter if Elon is distracted? Who cares? And I mentioned that because we have EV tax credits in play that are probably going to be a big tailwind to Tesla and then we have cars that people just really seem to be obsessed about. Yeah, I mean, they've done each for a menace job, right? They've basically made the automotive industry sexy again. The last time it was sexy was the 1950s. That was when it's had come out of the best universities in the world and say, oh my gosh, I want to work for a car company. Now, those same kids are coming out and saying, I want to work on electric vehicles. I want to work on future drivetrain technologies. Elon Musk deserves a lot of that credit because it's his vision and his commitment that's allowed that to take place. Does it matter? Does it really matter for Tesla so much? Not really. The flywheel is rolling, it's running. And they have very different issues to manage through over the next couple of years than what they've had to challenge through to date. And whether or not Elon Musk is the one that's the right person to make those decisions, we'll find out. I'm skeptical. I think there's some very challenging things ahead for this company. And if Musk is maybe reducing his intensity with the company, it might not be a bad thing. Craig, I know there's no imminent changes at the top of Tesla, but is there anybody else there who could run the thing besides him? Oh gosh, that's a tough question. I don't think so. I mean, I've talked to a lot of former Tesla executives. I know people that have turned down positions at Tesla that are leaders and they're respect to various. It's a difficult company to work at because Elon Musk is an unreasonable person. Not in a bad way, but in a motivating way where he doesn't take no for an answer. He wants to learn what you got wrong, why you got it wrong, how you got to do a different to achieve the goal. So yes or no, yes, we got it. No, we didn't. A lot of people aren't well-tooled to work in that environment. And there's a lot of burnout and a lot of turnover as people like to talk about for Tesla with heavy, heavy departures over here. Craig, I only got 30 seconds here. Colder months, they're coming soon. China and Tesla production, that's going to remain one of the main areas to continue to track and can the company adequately mitigate any logistics impacts and factory shutdowns. As it doesn't seem China's going to change their zero-COVID policy anytime soon. China's going to be tough for them, that's going to determine whether or not they make their numbers this year, 20,000 unit mists or 19,000 unit mists is China, right? I don't think this is what's the biggest issue for the company. It's a big issue with competition and alternative equities like Porsche and the upcoming Ford spin-off. Large, well-established properties that are executing well. You have other examples of some of the SPAC IPOs that are actually showing success. And Tesla has big problems on the horizon as far as this competitive environment. And they don't really have the technology lead that many many people claim. Everybody has access, this name, same database. Imagine that, competition for Tesla, Craig. Thank you so much, Craig Irwin, Rothka, and the Capital Partners Senior Research Analyst. I appreciate your time this morning, thank you. Thank you. And one final check on the market before you leave you as we see Twitter shares a little bit weaker here today. So we're the overall markets, not seeing a huge decline, but a bit of a pullback. And coming up in the next hour, more on the Twitter drama with Sinan Oral and Yahoo Finance is Jared Glickry, Sinan who is literally worth a book.

2746, I finance it's 11 a.m. in New York City. I'm Jared Blickery and here's what I am watching. Stocks dip as yields take higher amid uncertainty over the path of inflation. Tomorrow's jobs report is a main event and we'll talk market positioning with Black Rocks way Lee in a minute. Goldman Sachs by the way stays bullish on oil raising its crude forecast to $110 a barrel. That's at the aftermath of this OPEC plus decision. Joe Biden's his move cut move was cut was short-sighted and we'll see if the energy world's Dan Dicker agrees with us and investors wait for progress on the newly revived discussion between Twitter and Elon Musk. We look at the chance of a deal and the flow of information if we get one. But first let's take a quick look at the markets we see the Dow under a little bit of pressure down about 100 points the S&P 500 off about one quarter of a percent and the Nasdaq off just slightly and then checking in on the bond market we do see yields elevated just ever so slightly in the looks like the five ten and also thirty year tenor and with all eyes on tomorrow's jobs report let's welcome in Black Rocks global chief investment strategist way Lee and could you please give us your forecast and by the way it's great to see you here could you please give us your forecast of what you expect tomorrow because this is one half fifty percent of the feds dual mandate a lot of eyes on this report hi there good morning thanks for having me so in terms of the jobs report I think,https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ahmy7qqS3zQ,65,2022-10-06 18:33:16
2747," A lot of eyes on this report. Hi there, good morning, thanks for having me. So in terms of the jobs report, I think given how strong earlier momentans are, it's possible that we could see kind of headline decrease, but I would say that our focus is really solely what mainly around the participation rate, because labor shortage has really contributed to this supply-shaped environment. So if that starts to be alleviated, certainly that would have feed through to inflationary dynamics, and that would feed through to market pricing for rate hikes and also broadly risk sentiment as well. And let me ask you just generally about some of the central bank actions we've seen around the world over the last two weeks. A bit of a 180 by the bank of England. Now buying bonds, albeit for a short period of time, ostensibly speaking, also the bank of Japan buying the US dollar, or excuse me, buying its own currency, the yen trying to strengthen that versus others as well as the US dollar. What are you seeing in the global effects world? And what implications do you think this might have for equities, especially as we consider these jobs numbers that you just explained to us? I think what we're seeing really is a result of this supply driven new regime that we're in, whereby given the fact that inflationary pressure comes from supply, bottlenecks, and supply shortages, then it's a lot harder for central banks to fight that. There are tools, a primarily focused on addressing the demand side of equation. So you talked about bank of England going from announcing QT to start buying bonds. Obviously there are specific kind of fiscal development in the UK that led to the bond buying, but more broadly it just goes to show how difficult it is for a central bank decision making in this supply driven environment characterized by tougher trade-offs. And you also talked about bank of Japan and more broadly policy development and currency as well. I will make one observation so far this year, depending on where you are based, depending on which currency you are denominated, your experience of the global market returns can be vastly, vastly different. Part of that is the dollar strength, but it's more than that as well. So dollar in the near term is very much driven by rate differential as well as global risk, calm and risk of sentiment so far has been very, very strong. But given the fact that how much currencies are contributing to the experience of investors of the global markets, we think that it's actually really important when we think about our allocation to consider where our investors and clients are based in, which is why we're rolling out regional asset locations. So for example, I am sitting here in the UK and we recently rolled out Euro asset location views. So really from the perspective of the Euro denominated investors, how their asset allocation could look like versus a dollar denominated investors. And that is critical, being local is critical in the context of the elevated macro uncertainty and elevated currency volatility. Yeah, call it part for the course versus, I guess, based on this trend of de-globalization that we've seen over the last five plus years. Now, I want to talk a little bit more generally about the, we saw the US dollar strength in versus most currencies quite considerably. It's backed off of that. And the other part of the equation there is with an easing US dollar in the short term, we're seeing a bid for commodities. Now, we've been talking a lot about OPEC plus and oil, but I want to focus on silver, gold, and some of the other commodities that we've recently catch a bid. A lot of people have either been waiting for gold to catch a bid or have just counted it out entirely. What do you think of the precious metal complex right now? Well, exactly as you framed the correlation between the dollar and precious metal has been in place. And I think in that context as dollar, Wikens, you talked about how the risk on sentiment earlier in the week led to a weaker dollar. It has been somewhat supportive, or firm, of companies.",https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ahmy7qqS3zQ,66,2022-10-06 18:37:26
2748," You talked about how the risk on the sentiment earlier in the week led to a weaker dollar. It has been somewhat supportive of commodities and precious metals for that matter. But I would broadly say, though the importance of diversification cannot be overstated in the context of the world that we're entering into. So thinking about the macro environment, we're currently expecting a recession. This year in Europe, in the UK, and next year in the US. And at the same time, risks of central banks over tightening policies into restrictive territories in order to fight inflation. The risks of that have risen significantly. Recently, but also certainly versus beginning of the year. So in this kind of environment where it makes sense to be more prudent when it comes to our location, when it comes to portfolio risks taking, than having diversification in portfolio makes sense and certainly goes to play the role in that. And I think that is also part of the considerations behind recent price action. We got a time for one more, a bit brief here. But I want to talk to you about the Chinese UN and also policy makers there. We've seen the UN strengthen against the Japanese yen about 12% year to date. Yen has considered, we can consider it, and I talked about the measures by the BOJ before. Do you think the PBOC intervenes in the yuan here? And what consequences would that have for global risk assets? Well, I think more broadly when we talk about the Chinese yuan, we also have to talk about the Chinese economy. Right? So what has happened so far this year is that there has been significant headwind for Chinese economy from the perspective of the zero-covid policy, acting as a dampener to economic reopening momentum and at the same time previously the Chinese economy was supported by the tailwind of global exports. Right? Like when the rest of the world was in shutdown, the export from China and the demand for that has added to strong momentum last year. But now the rest of the world is switching back on and China is in zero-covid mode. So that export tailwind is fading away as well. And both of their act as headwind and challenges for Chinese economy this year and the Chinese currency movement so far this year are reflection of that. You talked about versus the yuan, but also versus the dollar of course, the dollar story is beyond more than just Chinese yuan. I would say one thing though, as we kind of head into next year, some expectation needs to be big deal around the restart momentum, obviously a lot contingent on how the COVID policy would evolve. But in the same way that the US economy opened up with strong momentum, your PM economy opened up with strong momentum in such an expect higher growth levels next year versus 2022. So if I say lots of moving parts here, really appreciate your insights as always, Wailie, BlackRock, Global Investment Chief Strategist. Thank you for your time. And we're keeping an eye on oil prices as well this morning following a big move by OPEC Plus to slash output by two million barrels a day beginning in November, exceeding market expectations and incurring the wrath of the Biden White House for more on this. Let's welcome in, Yahoo finances in S for a and we got a little bit of a surprise yesterday. And as we've been talking about now, OPEC Plus has already not been able to fill its quotas. So they said, this is really just a cut of about one to 1.1 million barrels per day. That's still a lot of nests. Yeah, that's, that is, it's significant. It's a significant cut and one takeaway is that OPEC Plus must be concerned about a world ride recession in order to be making such a cut. Goldman Sachs came out with a forecast and updated forecast saying that oil could reach $110 a barrel in Q4, also $115 a barrel by the end of the first quarter of 2023. And if these cuts are sustained through December of 2023, then these elevated prices would remain elevated. I mean, the only thing that could bring it down is really demand destruction at this point. Now, during the financial crisis, Jared, between 2008, 2009, oil prices, those had peaked at $145. It came all the way down to $30.",https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ahmy7qqS3zQ,67,2022-10-06 18:41:45
2749," down is really demand destruction at this point. Now during the financial crisis, Jared, between 2008, 2009, oil prices, those had peaked at $145. They came all the way down to $35 a barrel in five months time. Andy Lipo of Lipo Associates is saying basically that, look, they must be worried in order for them to be doing this. It also shows you that the US dollar has also been having a huge impact on these oil prices. We've also seen some rubblings or heard them that the Biden White House would also consider another release from this strategic petroleum reserve that's the SPR. We saw that take a place and be in effect earlier this year. I think those purchases or those releases have now concluded, but what about the possible effects of any new releases from the SPR? Yeah, well, certainly that would have a short term effect. Like we've seen with gasoline prices, as we've seen those gasoline prices coming lower. But one interesting point also about this OPEC plus decision is it kind of also shows you the waning influence of the US, because this is as much as it is about demand and supply as it is also political in a way as well. And the sort of relationship between Saudi Arabia and Russia and the sort of waning influence that the US is having on the cartel as well. Yeah, and I'd add the most important influence the US has on the cartel is the fact that WTI, a most global oil is quoted in US dollars. So a huge investment, I would guess you would say, to protect right there. Thank you for that. Yeah, who finances in us for it? All right, our trending ticker of the day is Pinterest. It is surging 45% after Goldman Sachs, upgraded stock to buy from Newfrolet and raised its price target to $31 from $24. Goldman analysts, Eric Sheridan likes the improvements in user growth and engagement, as well as the potential for revenue growth and operating margin into next year in 2024. Monetization is a key area that Goldman also likes with the prospect for the social media company increasing its share of ad spending and that's as companies cut budgets and expenses and coming up. You're going to want to take a look at this. Talking cyclical stocks, the ride continues, love that plan continues for Peloton. As a pandemic era, darling announces 500 more job cuts. We're about 12% of its workforce. Will the struggling group find its feet? We take the deep dive next.",https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ahmy7qqS3zQ,68,2022-10-06 18:47:37
2750,"locks every day enroll to obey to release new Welcome back. Peloton laying off a large number of its employees. 500 to be exact for the fourth time this year in another effort to save its struggling business. Yahoo! Finances Brad Smith here with the latest Brad what are the details? So the details around this of course as you laid out yet another round of layoffs for Peloton and this is really under the direction of the new CEO Barry McCarthy who is really looking to cut costs and make sure that in this environment where the company is trying to create more partnerships on the wholesale front see more of their cash and capital be put towards actually being able to continue production but also the right sizing of production and overall just the structure of the company that that really comes down and hits some of unfortunately the employee base. Now what we also do know is that even over the course of earlier this week they had netted some new partnerships on the wholesale front and it really kind of spells out what Barry McCarthy is looking to do is tap some of those wholesale partners look to those channels to potentially drum up even more subscribers within everything from Dick Sports all the way to your Hilton stake and then eventually being able to at the same time build on the digital subscriptions the number of people that are continuing to use these connected devices but then it comes back to if he does not see the growth necessary in this next stretch of time and he's looking out to these six month period even out as far as 18 months perhaps to say whether or not Peloton has been successful at implementing some of these changes and if it will prove to push them back to profitability as well. One at Hone and we got a brief second here on that timeline. Sure. Now he based but this is McCarthy basically gave the company six months and he did not immense words here have you ever heard of a CEO of a company give a going concern risk factor to its employees basically in this context. Not one that isn't already looking at perhaps some type of bankruptcy. It would have to be imminent. Immunin threat and what's even more noteworthy about that is whether or not they would actually be looking for a sale if they weren't able to hit some of those potential targets because he did bring up this thought of I don't know if we are a standalone company or a viable standalone company just Peloton if we're not able to hit some of these financial targets that we've set forth. He did say that this is the most optimistic that he has been but he certainly to your point did not immense words there and it starts to raise the question about who would buy a Peloton especially when you've already got other stationary bikes that are being sold at Dix that are already being sold on Amazon. So then it gets into the rest of the fitness category and the connected device category too and it's really tough to sell on whether or not it would be a company in Apple or some other major tech company that would say no what yeah we'll take on a connected fitness device company where they've already struggled to kind of move lots new homes. Yeah lots of baggage there we'll have to see what happens but peak Peloton with the stock down over 90 percent we'll see what comes of that. Thank you for that Brad Smith. And now a new game all the kids are playing as well as Wall Street veterans and they're raging about it. Spac D-spac or Fold and who better to join us with an update of this beleaguered sector is Alexander Seminova Alex you excuse me you've been covering this and IPOs have done poorly this year. Spac's much worse. What are the details? Yeah, it's just a terrible time for the SPAC market such a huge turnaround from last year and the year before what has been called the SPAC Renaissance East Child that saw this",https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ahmy7qqS3zQ,69,2022-10-06 18:50:36
2751," So terrible time for the SPAC market. Such a huge turnaround from last year and the year before, what has been called the SPAC Renaissance Beast Show that saw this sharp uptick in SPAC activity. And really a big come down this year. SPAC liquidations are on the rise with these bling check companies really struggling to find targets for their deals to close so far this year. 22 special purpose acquisition companies worth about $10 billion have been liquidated. According to a weekly report by SPAC research, that's more than half of those liquidations have occurred since August. And that's not even taking into consideration the liquidations that have been announced and haven't actually happened yet. For example, last week, Tamath Paliya Patiyah said in a regulatory filing that he would liquidate two of his SPACs also after failing to find a target and return $1.6 billion to investors. Bill Ackman also liquidated his vehicle. So it's just one after the other that is falling apart. Yeah, and I read an interesting stat yesterday that 40% of these SPAC companies are issuing going concern warnings. That means they might go out of business for their investors. And that's double the IPO rate. But I want to hone in on some news today. George Soros' son, well, he's been part of the SPAC movement as well. We got some details there. You can share with us. Yeah, so Bloomberg reported yesterday that the Everton Football Club spurred takeover interest from a SPAC led by George Soros' nephew that's according to people familiar with the matter. But there's no certainty yet whether the transaction will be closed, especially in this market where some deals are announced, but they don't actually follow through because the conditions are changing so rapidly. Yep, rapidly changing conditions. We've come to see this as the new norm. Yahoo, finances, Alex, Selenova, thank you for sharing that. Coming up, Black Gold getting a tailwind, Goldman's oil team stays with a bullish call for $100, $110 for Per Barrel on Brent.

2752,".... Welcome back the bold seam in control after the third quarter kicked off with a big two-day rally but a slew of economic data ahead could alter the market optimism and I want to get a quick check of the Wi-Fi interactive where we can see energy in the forefront today followed by communication services, tech and consumer discretionary. Those are at the top what you see in green. To the downside, utilities is down almost 2% followed by real estate and health care. All of those are defensive sectors and let's get a check of the majors now and we can see a mix board. Nasdaq just barely in the green by seven basis points. It's been fluctuating all day and then the Dow is down about one third of a percent and the S&P 500 down one fifth of a percent. So without further ado we want to talk about the current market action and that is with Kali Cox. She is E-Torrell's US investment analyst and Kali. Always great to see you here. We've done a number of webinars together and we've talked about some of the statistics in the S&P 500 and I think you and I were looking at some of the same data this week and what were you looking at? What were some of the conclusions that you came to? Yeah, dear. We were looking at some of the same data. I mean the rally we've seen so far this week or at least on Monday and Tuesday has been fierce. I think we can all agree on that. But it's so fierce, I mean it's the first time the S&P has rallied 2.5 percent or more and back-to-back days since December 2008 and you and I both ran the data, right? We see these kinds of rallies either deep in their market or in the first few days after a bull market starts which is the exact opposite to Nareo's there, right? And it just goes to show just how complicated this environment is for investors, how just the motion fueled and panicky it feels and it's quite a tough position to be in because we could be staring down to different paths here. And so investors who are nervous right now, what is your advice to them? Hopefully everybody's sitting on piles of cash but that's not necessarily the case. I know that I have a significant amount deployed. Got some on the sidelines here ready to be deployed. What are you telling your clients right now? Yeah, well it's interesting you say that because you've seen the sentiment and the sour moon that the market is in, I'd expect there to be more cash on the sidelines than then we think. But at the same time, we're telling our clients to really manage your emotions here, to understand where the market environment is but also the fact that it could be very costly to mess out on the first few days of a bull market. We really like a barbell strategy here holding on to some risk but being defensive at the same time. And where do you see the market opportunities when this market finally turns around? Hopefully it already has, maybe the lows in but that's not necessarily the sure bet right now. What kind of sectors or styles are you looking at? Yeah, well this market really is bottoming. We would expect to see more of an uptick and risk here, more of a surge in growth your assets here. We really like quality risks though at the moment. I mean, there are a lot of different flavors of growth stocks. We all know that with tech, you could look at the more speculative concept stocks or you could look at big tech. Everything big tech is a good example of quality risk with strong financials. And at the same time, we really like sickle-cooked here but we're feeling a little more cautious at the moment only because we don't know what the future holds for us here. And if we see growth deteriorate much more, we could see that reflected in sickle stocks. Ekele, I was writing our newsletter this morning. The morning brief, actually I wrote it yesterday afternoon for publication this morning but it was about those very same market statistics that you were talking about. After I ran the data and I saw kind of a mixed bag there, I kind of went off on a rant. And you know, you and I love to parse the data and look for things. Sometimes we don't always find an edge. Maybe you did. Maybe I didn't. But I think my message for investors is sometimes you just got to turn off the news. Not Yahoo Finance, of course, while you're watching this broadcast.

2753," But I think my message for investors is sometimes you just got to turn off the news, not Yahoo Finance, of course, while you're watching this broadcast, but you got to filter out the noise, just wondering what you're thinking about this as you also talk to some of your clients. Oh, it's so hard because it's so noisy these days and there are so many, you know, things you can look at to find that signal. And I mean, here, I do know I like person through data, you just said that, but I always try to remind people that, you know, when we see these big enough, you Welcome to Yahoo Finance on this Thursday afternoon. I'm Sean Smith along with Dave Briggs. Let's get you up to speed on the market action as we head into the final hour of trading. Taking a look at the major averages, all three, the major averages in the red right now, starting with the Dow, the Dow off just around 375 points back below 30,000 in the Nasak off just around 6, 10th of a percent. S&P also moving to the downside off about 1% today, Russell 2000, the small cap index here, moving to the downside once again off just around 6, 10th of a percent. You look at the bond market, the yield of trending higher once again as we're seeing pressure in equities a 10 year yield up to six basis points to 382, the 30 year up to 3, 7, and 9. You look at the US dollar index that also trending to the upside now back above 112. So you look at some of the sector action this afternoon, a bit of a mixed picture. I guess you can say with energy, the only sector holding onto gains up just around 1.6 percent. But for the rest of the market, we really are seeing some pretty broad base selling real estate and utilities, the worst performer so far, of the day real estate and utilities both off just around 3 percent, Dave. Thank you, Sean. Let's get you up to speed now on the oil market still ingesting that historic cut from OPEC Plus that's bringing it as for a for the latest price action. Want to get your thoughts on some White House comments first, but what do we see in today? Yeah, that's right. So today we did see oil settle higher for the fourth straight day. And of course, after about 2 million barrel per day cut that was announced by OPEC Plus this week, Goldman Sachs now saying that it could see oil going up to as high as $110 per barrel in the first quarter, $1.15 by the first quarter of 2023. And if the cuts were to last through December,",https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ahmy7qqS3zQ,72,2022-10-06 19:03:30
2754," for barrel in the first quarter, one-fifteen by the first quarter of 2023. And if the cuts were to last through December of 2023, then you could see these elevated prices higher. And some analysts are saying this really goes to show you the gravity, sort of speak of how OPEC sees the possibility of a worldwide recession by cutting by this much. Now, some countries don't meet their quota already, so it's not necessarily two million barrels per day. But nonetheless, the only thing that would really drive prices lower were to be a serious recession. And we did see from 2008 to 2009, when you saw oil prices go from $145 per barrel all the way down to $35 in five months time. And I mentioned some comments from the White House. You know, as Amos Hockstein says, he doesn't think increased prices will be a result to this. He also said he thinks it's well below two million in actuality, closer to 900,000. And then he qualified that by saying, if there are any net cuts at all, he says some countries will cut, others will increase. What do you make of those comments? Yeah, that's right. So he's basically reiterating that some countries, as you mentioned, are not meeting their quotas. So you can't really say that it's two million barrels per day. Also talking about the SPR and that there is some space to release more of the reserve. Look, nonetheless, you did have officials from the White House basically saying that they're disappointed by this. They're disappointed by OPEX plus decision. And some analysts would say that it's as much of the decision about supply and demand as it is also a political decision because certainly this is a snub towards the US. Yeah, that visit and that fist bump with MBS certainly looks unproductive. In Esfere, thanks so much, appreciate that. Let's talk more about the markets with Jack Adlin, Crescent Capital, CIO and Founding Partner. Jack, always good to see you, sir. Big picture, the cuts from OPEX plus what do you mean for the markets? Yeah, I mean, I think it's probably suggest that the headline is a little more striking than actuality. I think you alluded to the fact that there are number of members that aren't meeting their current quota. So the net effect of this two million barrel drop is closer to five to 700,000 barrels a day. Still, we don't like to see production cuts, but it isn't as stark as what the headlines would suggest. Jack, looking at the broader market action today, all three of the major averages under pressure once again, we started the week on a very upbeat and I know with the Dow rallying 1,500 points in just two days, but we have now seen two days of selling. Where do you think we go from here? Is there more downside risk ahead? There can be, you know, really it's all about the 10-year treasury and it's all about the dollar. I think that if you looked at just the year-to-date performance of the S&P 500, it's virtually entirely explained by the move from 1 1,5% 10 year up to 375, 380 10 year. So I think that explains virtually to the decimal point, the move in the S&P 500. Now, of course, we're watching the dollar because it really signals how investors view the Fed. Once investors believe that there's light at the end of the tightening tunnel, we'll start to see the dollar peak and then start to roll over. In that case, I think then it's probably an all clear signal for equity investing and probably foreign stocks, non-dollar, denominated stocks will likely lead the way higher. But until that time, unfortunately, the 10-year treasury is really held hostage by the Fed. If they do believe that the market's rally too much and that the wealth effect could undermine their ability to fight inflation, guess what, they start selling treasury notes and push that rate higher. So I'm not necessarily banking on the rate yet. I think it's all about the Fed at the moment. And the Fed all about at the moment, tomorrow's jobs report, what do you think they need to see to change the narrative? Sure, unfortunately.",https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ahmy7qqS3zQ,73,2022-10-06 19:08:00
2755," at the moment. And the Fed all about at the moment tomorrow's jobs report, what do you think they need to see to change the narrative? Sure, unfortunately, the jobs report isn't really the big data point anymore. It's taken a backseat to the inflation data, but I'd like to see something that is consistent with what we saw with the jobs, the Jolts report, showing a million fewer job openings, and then the higher claims earlier today. If we see a jobs report that's consistent with that, perhaps lesser hiring, lower hourly hours worked, and the hourly wages slipping. I think that's a good sign, but still nothing's going to underscore the inflation until the inflation data comes out next week. Check another big thing for the markets next week is going to be earning season big banks starting to report their results. We certainly have seen estimates revised lower. What are you expecting from third quarter earnings season? I guess what do you think it's going to tell us just about the strength or the weakness of the equity markets here in the fourth quarter? Yeah, so I think this is certainly not a great environment for banks. We're heading into a downturn. The curve is inverted, so there's really no opportunity necessarily for net interest margin. We also have banks tightening their lending standards as they perhaps start to see some weakness among their borrowers. Then we've got a lot of the trading and buy out activity substantially lower. There aren't too many levers for the banks right now. The good news is I suppose bigger picture. Their capital positions are a lot stronger. We generally don't make the same big mistake twice in a row. Although we are watching some of the European banks to see how they're going to hold up in their stark economy moving into the next couple quarters. Yeah, looks ugly ahead and given all that, new favorite high quality companies who have grown their dividends over time. Do you have some examples of such? Sure. Again, there's nothing really too crazy, but Chevron, a great high quality company with a 3.8% or so of dividend yield. This is a company that's been growing. It's dividend at 5.3% annually for the last five years. So that's pretty strong. We've got general dynamics. Also, pretty nice sweet spot of the market. 2.99% dividend yield growing. It's dividend at 8.9% over the last five years. And then lastly, archer Daniels Midland, ADM, 1.9% dividend yield growing. It's dividend at about 4.5% annually. So pretty strong players in sectors of the market that are somewhat insulated from the vagaries of the economy right now. And we'll call it a no news as good news environment for these stocks. Check another big story. Another big concern here for investors. Really, for multi-national companies has been the strong dollar. We have the US dollar index back above 1.12 today. I guess how big of a risk do you see this being as we head into the final quarter of the year? Yeah, I've never seen. I don't think the market has seen the dollar strength and as strong as much in such a short period of time. And so when you start looking at global economies and global markets, that creates some dislocations that we don't know is going to happen. So part of the concern we have certainly is in emerging market debt perhaps, particularly that segment of the emerging market debt market that's denominated in US dollars. And other other economies, other central banks. So I think we see issues there. The good news is, though, fundamentally, the dollar is very expensive relative to many of our trading partners currencies. And so once we see, again, a peak in a fed tightening in that peak in the dollar, my guess is the next opportunity for risk taking. It's going to be in non-dollar markets like the Japanese yen or the EWJ for example could be an interesting play. All right, Jack Abel. And always great to talk to you. Thanks so much for taking the time to join us today. Thank you. Well, we are just getting started here on Yahoo Finance Live.

2756," I'm always great to talk to you. Thanks so much for taking the time to join us today. Thank you. Well, we are just getting started here on Yahoo Finance Live. Coming up, Peloton CEO says its latest round of job cuts is a quote, necessary step to save Peloton. And an analyst weighs in to tell us if he agrees. The deal is not done yet. Elon Musk and Twitter are still hammering out their $44 billion buyout agreement. Find out what the holdup is. And Adidas reviewing its deal with Kanye West, fellow streetwear investor, Shark Tankstar, Damon John, weighs in. Don't go anywhere. Peloton shares moving to the upside today. Up just around three and a half percent after announcing that it is cutting 500 more jobs. It's fourth layoff announcement of the year CEO, Barry McCarthy, telling the Wall Street Journal, quote, we need to grow to get the business to sustainable level here to talk about what that level could potentially look like. And the path forward for Peloton, we want to bring in Simeon Segal, BMO capital markets, managing a director and a senior analyst. Simeon, it's great to see you. So McCarthy, out saying that these cuts are necessary to put the company in a better position. I guess how do you see Peloton positioned right now? And is it in a position to return to growth? Hey, great to see you. Great to be here. I think that we need to incorporate or internalize the fact that Peloton has a great brand. It has a great community. But that doesn't necessarily mean it has room for growth at this point. And so I think what we're seeing now as a turnaround is just that much more difficult. We're watching incremental costs cuts, unfortunately, which are impacting people's lives. But it's also this decision to recognize that to get to profitability, the company needs to recalibrate. And so I think if we can focus on profitability as opposed to growth.",https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ahmy7qqS3zQ,75,2022-10-06 19:16:43
2757," back in people's lives. But it's also this decision to recognize that to get to profitability, the company needs to recalibrate. And so I think if we can focus on profitability as opposed to growth, I think there's a story. I think every time the focus is on trying to get a new member, there's going to be another drag. And now their fourth round of layoffs leaves them about half the number of employees they had at their peak. The interesting report also says McCarthy gives him six months to turn this around. If you're a betting man, what kind of chances do you give Peloton to turn it around in six months? Yeah, so fortunately, I'm not allowed to be a betting man right here. So that's the fact. So the fact that they say right now, it's an interesting point. So there were a few different articles out there today. One of them mentioned six months. One of them didn't. My understanding of the Peloton email that was sent out did not mention the six months. So but it's there. And that means we have to ask the question, what does that mean? And so I think that there's been so much of a conversation surrounding the fact that Peloton went from here to here really quickly. Now it's somewhere in the middle or somewhere down here. All the question there is what's the value? Is there an acquirer? And so I think the six month conversation started raising the question again of is there a point in which Peloton management says, you know, let's run a sale process? And that's I think the relevance in the interesting part of that six months nuance comment that you bring up. But we have to remember, even if the company decides they want to sell, it doesn't necessarily mean you have somebody who wants to buy. And I think what we have to still ask the same question, we've been asking it since February of 22 when people first started talking about are there acquirers? At the end of the day for a company that's watching it's the man falter and it's churned grow, does Peloton now that the company is cheaper, look more attractive? Or for these big tech companies that have been named as potential acquirers, wouldn't they have rather bought this company when it was on its way up when it was grabbing that mind share? So I think that it's very interesting. And the comments today are very interesting, raising, re-raising the question of, should emanate you on the table? But I think we still have to figure out just because they, even if they decide they want to put it up for sale, which they have certainly said they're not, do they find someone who wants to pick the stock up or the company up, given where it has come down to? Well, Sidney, what do you think? Because you obviously follow the company so closely, you've been an analyst tracking Peloton's every move now for quite some time. Do you think a sale is likely to be on the table at some point? Yeah, I think that it is hard. And the lesson I can obviously be wrong when it comes to this. But I think that at the end of the day, Peloton, as an entity, we've published a report noting that the downside, Leacy, it can be $5. And the thought process there is, if you have three million subscribers that become $2 million, because the churn goes up and because the people that bought during COVID aren't necessarily your best customers. So if you were, and again, not saying they will, but if you were to lose a third of your base at the current price, you can still just $5.5 stock. We have to internalize that still, right? We're still in the billions of market cap as we think about what that means. So for a company to come in and buy, you have to figure out what they're getting. And right now, what you're getting is an ongoing bleed of your members as opposed to a growth of your members. So I think what the company needs to do is convince themselves in the outside world whether they sell themselves or not, that they can find the bottom, that they can stabilize, that they can say we've got very strong, loyal brand, loyal brand people that are willing to pay are recurring $44 a month, and maybe even more. But the question is, what is that number? We don't know that yet. And I think every dollar that's spent trying to get someone new, rather than committed to focus on maintaining the people that are already involved, I think it's a dollar that's probably not that well spent. And I think that's what we're seeing. And so I think is there a value with where Peloton is worth, yeah, I'm not in the camp that Peloton is zero far from it. I think Peloton offers something very compelling and makes people very happy. But we need to figure out what that level is. And that's, I think, the question that's going on right now. And the companies you often read about, of course, the usual suspects, Apple, Amazon with more cash than most countries. And then of course Netflix, maybe on the undercard, does any of those make sense? So again, way out of my pay grade, but I think it's there to ask the question of, is Peloton in trouble more attractive to one of those companies, at a billion, two billion, three billion, four billion, versus Peloton doing really well at 10 to 15 billion? Because the companies you just mentioned are very large companies with very large market caps. And so what they rather is that incremental $10 billion, I know this sounds absurd, but it's the incremental $10 billion to catch a,",https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ahmy7qqS3zQ,76,2022-10-06 19:21:23
2758," Companies you just mentioned are very large companies with very large market caps. And so what they rather is that incremental $10 billion, I know this sounds absurd, is the incremental $10 billion to catch a falling knife more attractive than if they would have wanted it on the way up. I just, I think right now we're talking about this as a distressed asset. And the companies you just mentioned are looking for growth vectors. They're not looking to try and get something on the cheap unless they believe it's stable. So that's what I think the company has. I think for their standalone or for an acquisition they need to show they can be stable. Because until then you have to ask that question of what does NAPO really get at this point that they couldn't have gotten better off last year when they thought the trajectory was just going up into the right. So, I mean, what do you think it's going to take for Peloton's turnaround effort to really start to resonate with investors? Yeah, I think that's an excellent question. And I think well, he is all about perspective and where we start from. I think if we internalize what the company did, they went from zero to several billion dollars. That is a tremendous achievement in a very short amount of time. The problem is in between them, they went to 50 billion dollars. And so at the end of the day, it's hard to argue that it's not resonating with investors. It's just not resonating with the investors the way it did over the last few years. And that's been effectively the reason we've had the celebrating. But I do think right now it is still a very, it's valued at a very large business. A lot of the companies that went public later than they did. A lot of companies that are younger than they did have watched up and down as well. So I think for them to get people back on board, people need to be able to create the bottom. I know I've said a few times and it's this idea that once you can create the stable, once you can create the trough, you can start building back up and figure out where you're going to go. But people need to figure out his Peloton growth story or they just a very nice business. And then there's nothing wrong with being a very nice business. But that gets me to that $5 of earnings, which is so much lower than where we are right now. Or sorry, $5 share price. So that's I think this element of figuring out the identity. Every time we hear about another ongoing cut, it makes people think, well, maybe I'm not at the bottom yet. Maybe I don't know where we are. And I think that's the next shoe to drop. We have to find out what the churn starts looking like over the next year. So I think there's still a lot of questions. Indeed, there are. Simeon Siegel answered a lot of them for us from BMO. Appreciate that good stuff. All right. The new developments now in the Twitter Elon Musk saga. The Wall Street Journal reporting that the two sides could reach a deal by Monday. And right now the talks are focused on financing and litigation. That timeline would also have heard a deposition from Elon Musk, which had been delayed until then. The goal it appears from both sides is to stay the Delaware Chance Record trial, which is slated to start on October 17th. And a court filing Elon Musk as the deal could close on or around October 28th. Stay tuned.

2759," People is This time for triple play, three socks that were watching in the final 30 minutes of trading Pinterest, Tesla and Uber. Let's kick it off with my pick and that is Pinterest. Goldman, upgrading the stock to a buy, lifting its price target to $31 a share and playing 25% upside for the stock. And what they call a more positive risk-reward skew. Now, analyst Eric Shardin is optimistic about Pinterest's efforts to grow its user base and also increase monetization, writing in a note to clients that, quote, despite some uncertainty in the near term, we see Pinterest as positively levered to a number of long-term secular growth themes. Now, those seems, including engagement and ad that spend shifting online, also social commerce and the creator economy. Pinterest shares more than 30% in the past three months, but year to date still well in the red. Off just over 40%. So, Jared, we have Goldman getting a little bit more bullish on Pinterest. You can't help but wonder how much of a valuation call this is with the stock off so significantly since it started the year. I think so, Shana. Pictures worth a thousand words. Let's go to the Wi-Fi Interactive where I have a max chart going back to their IPO date. Late 2019, actually, this is just the last three years. If we put a max there, we go. We can see all the way back to 2019. Anyway, we got this Brian Sasi bulging bicep pattern as he likes to call it, but as you can see, no lie, we do a lot of this on the morning show. You should check it out sometimes. There is a rounded bottom here that the stock has been making all year long. 28 looks like a maker break. Level for me, it's right there. A lot of times you might see a little bit of a dip. That would be a massive saucer and handle formation that I'm tracking right there. But I do want to move on because I am looking at the EV space and we have Mizzou making, and actually cutting its price target on Tesla and Neo, though it did keep the firms by ratings on both. Once after the two automakers posted their latest production and delivery data, analysts are still saying strong demand is China moves to electrify and he characterized a quarter and it September as being quote, mostly in line as supply and logistics remain a challenge. Now Mizzou lowered its Tesla target to $370 from $391 in change, noting that effects headwinds. Read the Soring Dollar could weigh on quarterly revenue estimated to be $22.5 billion. From now see, Neo stock, by the way, trading to $40 instead of 42. Let me pull up the Wi-Fi Interactive here one more time where I have our heat map. I'm going to check on Neo first. Let's pull that up. This is a year-to-date chart. You can see mostly range bound since about March of this year, although it did have that big decline earlier. You pull up a max chart going to its IPO date on the IPO date at the New York Stock Exchange in 2018. This has been a slow, steady downtrend right here, not really breaking that trend line, so have a little bit more work to do on a breakout basis. Then take a look at Tesla here. I'm going to narrow this to the last five years. I just want to show the massive consolidations that we oftentimes have in this stock. We are in the midst of another one, have you had to break out of this?",https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ahmy7qqS3zQ,78,2022-10-06 19:29:50

We are in the midst of another one to have you have to break out of this play either Dave. Jared, you did not explain what the dip bicep is. Is that the blickery bicep? Oh, wow. Is that a fire? Is that a subtle dig here at my chart? Pattern naming authority, or is that a dig on my bicep? I don't know, Dave. What was it bulging bicep pattern? That's what Saazi calls it. A lot of his stocks that have roundtripped their gains throughout the pandemic. That is a big thing. We need to start incorporating that into the show daily. So I'm out bulging bicep pattern. You guys trade market. I will NFT it. We're gonna be rich. There we go. That's all we need tonight. I will stay in the automobile space. My place, Uber, no shortage on the right-hailing giant this week. First, nearly two years after selling its autonomous vehicle research, you that they are back in that space. Uber is sounding a 10-year multi-market deal, a joint venture between Hyundai and Appteve for autonomous cars on both. It's right-hailing and Uber Eats delivery app. That's the key there. Trips are expected to start later this year. We're not exactly sure where, but based on regulations in California, you might expect Florida and Texas to be the first two markets. Also on Wednesday, Uber's former head of security was found guilty by a federal jury in San Francisco of attempting to cover up a data breach that actually saw tens of millions of both customer and driver records stolen. How does it all come out? The wash Uber shares up by more than 2% on the day, but as you know, it has been a struggle those far this year, still down more than 30% year to date, John. Yeah, Dave, looks like investors are a little bit encouraged about the autonomous news. It's interesting what we've seen come from a lift in Uber in this space because both have changed plans as they've been under pressure to more so focus on profitability rather than taking some of these costly chances. So this is an interesting play because it gives Uber some exposure in this space, but it doesn't have to pour all that money into its own research and development to get that exposure. So we'll see whether or not this partnership does in fact pay off. All right, coming up next. At a time when the stock market remains extremely volatile, our next guest explains why you should be investing in the space economy.

2761," massively effective razorure laser magazine. After not some around the world are en route to the International Space Station following a Wednesday launch from the Kennedy Space Center in Florida. The crew five mission is the sixth flight for the joint endeavor between Elon Musk's SpaceX and NASA, the mission commander by the way in this flight. Nicole Mann, she is the first ever Native American to travel to space. But what about the space investment space? Andrew Chanan is the Pro Cure AM founder and CEO here as part of our ETF report brought to you by Invesco QQQ. Good to see you, Andrew. We do want to talk about the ETF space, but what significant progress has SpaceX made? So what we're seeing is roughly a launch every week, which is something that is quite unheard of and the pace at which they're sending these satellites up is something that is both an opportunity as well as a concern that needs to be managed as far as space debris goes in the future. But what they're doing is really pushing the space industry forward significantly and it's creating many opportunities for numerous companies throughout the industry. Andrew, speaking of the many opportunities for companies within the industry, what is this through those two investor excitement when you're trying to get investors excited about investing in space is something like this type of space. You know, I think we saw two launches yesterday and expecting a third today. You know, one of it is extremely interesting because Elon Musk is essentially sending a Russian cosmonaut to the ISS. The first time that this has happened on from US soil in decades. So with all of the tensions that we see geopolitically seeing that space is still able to drive forward despite ongoing hostilities. This is something that shows how cooperative the industry is. But when they're sending up these satellites, you have to think about satellite manufacturers and operators. You know, parts, manufacturers for what goes into these. At the same time because they're sending up so many satellites, it's drying up the supply of launches from what space X can provide, well creating opportunities for other launch companies, many of which happened to be in the UFO ETF that are now going to see other clients potentially stepping forward for launch needs, which is something where this rising tide seems to be lifting a lot of ships here. Indeed it is. Nice analogy there. You have three reasons to invest in the space economy. What are the Andrew? You know, it's constantly changing, but one thing that we notice again with the with the Russian Ukrainian conflict going on right now is how important space is from a military standpoint. And from the early days of the invasion, satellites were actually providing us with the imagery showing the Russian troop buildup on the border. And as we've seen the different issues with one website satellites being held hostage and rocket parts not being sent from Russia due to sanctions, there creates all this need for non-Russian companies and allied countries to create these types of solutions that are needed for the space industry. And because space is so key for militaries, we're seeing a tremendous amount of spending coming from militaries and governments around the world. So the percentage of what is being spent from space coming from governments is slowly starting to increase, which is certainly encouraging. But there's also technological changes like reusable rockets that are significantly lowering the cost of entry to space. So we're at a technological turning point, which is extremely exciting. But also so many other technologies that we use utilize space. So transformative technology. And so, we're seeing a lot of things that we're seeing in the space. And so, we're seeing a lot of",https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ahmy7qqS3zQ,80,2022-10-06 19:38:39
2762," space. So we're at a technological turning point, which is extremely exciting. But also so many other technologies that we use utilize space. So transformative technologies like 5G, the internet of things, it connected devices, even cryptocurrency and cloud computing are starting to rely on space. So if you're looking at any of these industries and you're looking for companies that are literally operating as the digital data, told keepers for this digital data superhighway, space companies become extremely critical for that. Andrew speaking about all the money that's being spent within this industry, what do you think is the growth trajectory for this sector here, looking out over the next five to 10 years? So we're not allowed to make projections, but we can look at various research houses that do put out numbers and Morgan Stanley believes that we're looking at potentially a $1.7 trillion space economy by 2040. Think of America, Merrill Lynch has come out saying north of $2 trillion by 2045. So there are varying estimates, but one of the large reasons that people believe that this industry will continue to grow, it comes from the communication side. So broadband internet connectivity, Elon Musk is sending up basically double the amount of satellites that were in orbit as of two years ago, just in the last year or so. So we're seeing new industries emerge, other industries really starting to heat up, and this is something that hopefully could be a benefit for the broader industry as whole. All right, Andrew Chan, and always great to have you. Thanks so much. Thanks for having me. Dave? All right, some breaking news now, Shana, and some big for the cannabis space. President Biden announcing moments ago, the administration will pardon all prior federal offenses of simple marijuana possession. This folks is a major step toward decriminalization, most believe. Cannabis stocks are jumping at the news. You can see Aurora, Canopy, Curly, Green Thumb, Truleaf, all flying on this news, in particular, Truleaf up 33. Green Thumb 26, Curly, the leader in the space, climbing towards 40% up on this news because of presumed optimism of federal legalization by the instructing health and human services secretary, Xavier Bissera, to initiate a review on how marijuana is scheduled under federal law. Currently, marijuana is a schedule one drug designated for the most dangerous substances on the same level as heroin and LSD, pot stocks, flying on this news. Interesting to digest the other next couple of days and see if there really is optimism towards federal legalization. We've still heard zero Republicans to date in the Senate support any legislation, even safe banking, which has passed the House six times and cannot get out of the Senate. And that does not have to do with federal legalization, just rather the banking space. Shana, it's interesting to see this kind of optimism. It is. It's very interesting to see this kind of optimism, especially when you take a look at how the stocks are reacting to this. And I think they have been waiting for this sort of ruling here or some sort of statement from the White House, from the administration in terms of their plans here, how they are going to deal with some of those offenses. So the fact that we are getting this news, we're seeing the reaction and some of the largest players in this space, David, the roar of just around five and a half percent, Curlyf rallying. Look at that. Up 29% now, 30% green thumb. Truly, if you're all have a massive move to the upsides of the catalyst, I think that this sector has been waiting for for quite some time. Yeah, I'll just be honest here. I mean, this business has been waiting for anything optimistic. I don't know that this changes the equation at all, but I understand that they've been waiting for any sort of good news in this industry. Coming up next, we're going to, we're going to check in with on real estate mortgage rates headed in the right direction. A real surprise turnaround. I'll be at slight good news. We'll also take a look at the rental market ahead.",https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ahmy7qqS3zQ,81,2022-10-06 19:42:30
2763," MUSIC A sliver of good news for potential home buyers today is mortgage rates falling slightly after rising for six straight weeks. The 30 year fixed falling to 6.66%. As you can see on the screen from 6.7 a week ago, that's according to Freddie Mac and their chief economist attributing the drop to quote ongoing economic uncertainty. Rate still over more than double what they were one year ago. In practical terms, that means an average monthly mortgage more than $1,000 per month more than this time last year on a $500,000 loan. Meanwhile, the median monthly mortgage rate is up $800 just since January. A little bit more context, current rates will actually cost perspective buyers around $100,000 in actual home buying power compared to a year ago. Overall though, the story remains unchanged. New listings fell for the 13th straight week. They are down 17% from a year ago. Homes are sitting on the market for longer by an average of six extra days compared to a year ago. The projection still suggests we will see 7% mortgage rates in the 30 year fixed before we'll see 6.5. Obviously, mortgage rates do not rise and fall directly with Fed action more tied to the 10 year, but needless to say, if the Fed goes for another 75 point hike, which they are expected to, we will see rates continue to climb, Shawna. All right, Dave. Let's stick with housing here and take a look at what's happening in the rental market. As inflationary pressures and economic uncertainty are hitting that market pretty hard and your report from real payments, you found that apartment demand plunged in the third quarter. It's first a three-key drop that we've seen in 30 years. We want to bring in Jay Perth.",https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ahmy7qqS3zQ,82,2022-10-06 19:47:06
2764," Hitting that market pretty hard and your report from real page you found that apartment demand plunged in the third quarter. It's first a three-q drop that we've seen in 30 years. We want to bring in Jay Parsons, head of the economics industry principles at real page. Jay, it's great to see you. So very unusual for us to see a drop here in the third quarter, which is typically very strong three-month time frame for the rental market. What do you think is behind this massive drop that we saw? Yeah, so I think the first thing I was looking for is signs of affordability concerns, given the number of, given the rate, the rent increases that occurred over the last couple of years. But that's just not showing up. Wages are still up. Rent collection is still very high. In fact, they actually up year over year. And we're not seeing any kind of move down into cheaper units and cheaper areas. And so really what appears to be happening is a freeze in household formation because there's very little leasing traffic right now. And obviously we know people aren't buying houses right now. So it tells me that people are kind of in a weight and sea mode. And they've really pushed the pause button on their housing search for the time being. The pause button. Is that how you describe the entire housing sector at the moment? And is that because of mortgage rates? It seemed like buyers and sellers have back to your word paused. Yeah, no, I think, you know, obviously for renters, it's not necessarily mortgage rates directly, but it's those same kind of underlying factors that are driving up mortgage rates. And that's really inflation, you know? You know, we've been talking a lot about home prices and rents, but you know, one thing everyone feels every day is groceries. I mean, they're up 13% year over year. And so I think with overall inflation, we're seeing consumer confidence is way down. And you think about it, you know, when you don't feel certain about the economy and your place in it, your financial situation, human nature is to weight it out, weight and sea. And so, you know, thankfully, as you know, the job market remains strong for the time being on employment slow. And so that tells me that there's a lot of pent up demand being built up right now. So if the job market remains strong, I do think demand will come back, but it's certainly not happening right now. Jay, how long until you think that demand does return to the rental market? Yeah, good question. So these next few months, you know, winners slow period for housing of all types. You know, you don't see a lot of people moving around in the winter months. And so we really won't know much until early spring. So I think the time we get to out March, we should see that demand come back. Now, of course, if the job market turns, it could be a very different story, but at this point, I would expect to see a lot of that, particularly for rentals. I think we'll see rental demand come back first around that timeframe. What's the inventory story in the rental market? So we saw a huge drop off in vacancies in 2021, record apartment demand, record single felony rental demand. We peaked on occupancy rates in March. It has gotten a little better for renters out there. There's a little more availability. It's still low. You know, while there was weak apartment demand in Q3, it's still a very tight market. We have very low vacancy right now. We have high retention rates, but we, it's gotten a little bit better. And I think the good news for renters as well is we're gonna see a lot of new inventory next year. We're seeing 40 year highs in apartment construction. We're seeing a large number of single family rental communities, build-strength communities are being built. We've even heard of home, home sellers. We're now choosing to wrap their homes with a way out the mortgage market. And so there's definitely more inventory and I think we'll see more next year as well. Jay, what does this do to prices? I guess that there's more inventory and more options on the table. Are we gonna go and you see a pretty big drop then in rentals? I don't think we're gonna see an issue drop in rents from most parts of the country. I think we could see some seasonal cuts here in the winter months, but nothing dramatic and drastic. But I think we can see it more importantly, though, I think we're gonna see a big moderation in rent growth next year. And to be honest, we've already seen that. I mean, the certainly the CPI does not reflect this. And most of the big rent hikes occurred in 2021. And in 2022, we've really seen more moderate rent increases. And I think we're gonna see a kind of more of them return to normal in terms of rent growth next year. All right, Jay Parsons, great to get your take. Thanks so much for joining us.

Dan Halley is here with the breakdown of the new products. Dan, you were able to get your hands on these new products at the event earlier today. What do you think? The big news is the Pixel Watch. This is Google's first party smartwatch. They have made the Wear OS or Android Wear operating system before. Those have been used by the likes of Fossil, Michael Cours, Samsung to build smartwatches. None of them really looked all that fancy though. We're talking about the Michael Cours stuff. It's their own style of smartwatch. It looks incredibly elegant when you see it in person. It's a circular design. It's got these large bezels on it, but you can't really see it that much. So it just feels like the text is floating there in space. It's a 41 millimeter watch face itself. So just to give you a sense of what that means. The standard Apple Watch is 41 millimeters and then there's 45 millimeters for the larger size. This is going to fit on anybody's wrist that might be a little bit smaller. My wife, for instance, has a small wrist and that looks totally great on her. I tried it on and it looks great on me too. But everything does. I think that this is going to be something that is going to help get Android smartwatches up to speed with what Apple's been doing. Because Apple has just been straight crushing it for years. So this is potentially a way for them to get in. That's interesting because I didn't know how I would feel. But full disclosure, I'm not an Android user. So I'm not necessarily having ventured in to their products. What do you think of the phone now? The phone is really interesting. So it's basically pure Google. It's their design, their take on the software. What they think the software should be. The big stand out here is a camera. The one with the third little dot there, that's the pro. That has an ultra wide angle. An angle, a standard camera. Then it can do two times optical zoom, five times optical zoom equivalent, five times actual optical zoom, and then ten times optical zoom equivalent using different types of cropping. So it looks great. I mean, you're going to be able to see things that you otherwise wouldn't be able to zoom into with other phones.",https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ahmy7qqS3zQ,84,2022-10-06 19:55:12

Yahoo, finances, Ali Garfinkle here with what's next for Google and their cyber strategy. Hi there, Ali, what are you hearing? Hi Dave, great to see you. So Google Cloud Chief Information Security Officer Phil Venables sounded off this morning this afternoon, actually. And the message I was getting was really clear. Google cybersecurity ambitions are massive. This deal, as big as it is, also massively increased their threat intelligence capabilities. So they want to get this right. And I would say there are two important things for a member here. First, this is happening in a moment when cybersecurity risk is higher than ever. That's what experts have been telling me. And it makes sense that in this environment, we're seeing Google really shore up its cybersecurity position. But also the other thing too, and the second thing, the thing I'm watching is that this is their biggest deal in 10 years. It's even bigger than actually Fitbit, which actually made those watches possible in part. And I'm looking for Google to spotlight this going forward. We could see that as soon as next week, when the Mandient Deal is reportedly set to be a big part of Google Cloud's major event. So that's what I'm looking for here. All right, good stuff, Ali.

2767," All right, just a couple of minutes to the closing bell. Let's bring in Jared Blyckery with a chance to check out these markets as they are little red on the board. Hey, Jared. Little red on the board, but we're going to redeem ourselves here with an interesting look at the cannabis sector. But first, we do have markets under pressure down over 1% Sozi S&P 500, Nasdaq down 3 quarters of a percent in the Russell 2000, a little bit less than that. Let's skip straight to the action. This is the cannabis heat map that we have working here. We can see a number of issues up over 30% a lot of these Canadian issues, but also Tilray, the American ADRs traded almost 30% right now. CGC canopy up 20%. This is after Biden proposes to decriminalize, not decriminalize. Basically, it's a get out of jail free card for anybody who's been arrested for possession. Hope that goes through in the States. Take it up as well. Besides that, we are seeing a lackluster day in the stock action. Energy in the forefront, we see crude oil topping $88 per barrel to the downside. Utilities, real estate extending their losses, both of those off more than 3%. Pretty defensive sectors, so not really getting too worried about that. But we will take a look at the travel sector as we head into the frozen bell. And here we go. Another day of declines as we wrap up the training day, all three of the major averages ending in the red, the Dow off 300 and 47 points as we shake out the final trades of the day, S&P off just around 1% NASDAQ off about 7% of a percent. The sector action, energy, the only sector closing the day in positive territory, the worst performers on the flip side, real estate and utilities, both of those sectors off just over 3%. All right, let's make sense of the action that we saw today. And for that, we want to bring in Matt Stucky, Northwestern Mutual Wealth Management, Senior Portfolio and Strategist. And we have Jeremy Schwartz, Wisdom Tree, Global Chief Investment Officer, great to see both of you. Matt, let me start with you just in terms of the equity moves that we're seeing today. Once again, another day of declines coming off a very strong start to the week. What do you think of the action that we've seen over the past four days? Well, good afternoon. Thanks for having me on the show. I think this is just really a continuation of what we've been dealing with all year in terms of an elevated volatility profile for the market. The market is hanging on to every kind of whiff of inflation reports out there. Good reports are being met with relief rallies in the market while hot reports on inflation are just furthering the pain and increasing volatility even further. And we have a job support this tomorrow morning, which we'll wait and see how it looks. But it's just going to be another data point that markets are going to probably trade off of significantly as we look to see how the employment market is functioning here. Jeremy, do we learn more from the strong start to the week in the quarter or the last two days in the pullback? You know, we've all been bond traders as Matt was talking about where it's all pivoting on rates and the Fed and sort of you had rates fall. It started with the Bank of England stepping in to support the markets and the bond markets. Now, it was already a temporary measure. So the question is do they think things can go beyond that? I do think sentiment was very washed out. So there was an element of just sentiment being so negative that there was some measure saying sentiment was from a zero to 100 goes out as zero. And so can you go up from there? So I do think there was some relief rally from that relief from bond pressure coming off. We do think the Fed should pivot in their November meeting. We think they should go more like 50 instead of 75. But we'll see, you know, as the next month comes, is true. That would be another further catalyst for the beginning part of this week in the last few days. It's true.",https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ahmy7qqS3zQ,86,2022-10-06 20:04:23
2768," or catalyst for the beginning part of this week than last few days. But it's certainly all trading off of what's happening in the bond market is the key driver here. And Jeremy, how are you, I guess how are you managing some of the risk there in the bond market? Because we certainly have seen a ton of action, 10-year yield up once again today, up another six basis points to 381. How are you adjusting your portfolio as a result? Yeah, we manage model portfolios for and help give some guidance to clients on how do we think about that. We've been very underweight duration for a while. And coming into the year, yields were so low there was just no cushion to offset any rising rates. This is the first quarter where we've sort of upped our duration. So we have two strategies, one is the floating-reachered U.S. of FAR. It's been the best play for rising fed. We've also had a yield enhanced core, AGGY, which is just a little bit longer duration than the ag. We sort of moved some from the floating-reachered to the yield enhanced core at our recent rebalance across a lot of our models. We're still underweight duration. We're saying we're not ready to fully join the duration party. We're still short duration versus our benchmarks. But we sort of cut the gap in half because we do now think yields are very different. You've got a few hundred basis points increase in real yields. There's really now yield back in fixed income. The high yield market, you get 8 to 9% yields. So it's just a very different story than what you started the year. And so we did cut that duration gap in half in a lot of our model portfolios. And Matt, you said you still expect a couple of elevated CPI reports based on the back of housing Y. And what are you seeing overall in the housing sector that gives you a sense of where the entire economy might be headed? Yeah, this is a really critical point to make here about housing is that housing flows into CPI with about a year and a half lag. So what you're seeing in CPI right now in the services component, a third of which is housing is what we saw in the housing market in 2021. And we all remember what housing looked like last year where annualized gains were 20% or higher. But it's a very completely different story as we look at what the housing market looks like this year. From where we started this year up until this week, mortgage purchase demand is off 37%. And the month on month gains in the housing market are history. We've gone from a month on month gains of 1 1 1 2% to negative territory over the summer. And considering where affordability is and where mortgage rates have been trending this quarter, it's likely that we're going to see further declines. And so that's going to take some time to filter into overall headline inflation and core inflation. But the question is, is whether policymakers at the Federal Reserve and other central banks around the world will look to more of a forward looking indication of where inflation is going, not the stale inflation that we're likely to see, which is going to be elevated for the next couple of quarters because, again, housing moves into the numbers with about a year to year and a half lag. Matt, given all the uncertainty that you were just talking about in the market, some of the challenges that investors are facing right now, what do you like? That's a good question. I think the diversification is your best friend and volatile markets. And we agree with Jeremy that a lot of value has been restored into the bond market. And so while it's been a painful reprise this year, invests with great corporates around a five-year mark or trading between five and a half percent, that provides you some cushion against traditional equities. Within equities, the position we've had for the last couple of years is to be tilting our portfolios towards cheaper parts of the market. And we think that's still an attractive place to be invested. Value spreads continue to be historically wide. And so if you think that a recession is coming in 2023 and our base cases that we do have some sort of a mild recession, there's a lot of cushion already built into the price. A sector neutral value implementation, the large cap space, trades less than nine times for looking earnings. And so even if estimates get cut significantly for that basket of equities that I just mentioned, you still have a lot of cushion because it's only, like I said, nine times earnings. All right, good stuff. Matt Stuckie, Jeremy Schwartz, appreciate you both being here. Wonderful breakdown there. Coming up the best drama in the world.",https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ahmy7qqS3zQ,87,2022-10-06 20:08:57
2769," Thanks. All right. Good stuff. Matt Stucki, Jeremy Schwartz. Appreciate you both being here. A wonderful break down there. Coming up, the best drama in the world of business, the latest in the Elon Musk Twitter saga right after a short break. Good food. All right, the latest in the juicy Asalga in the business world, that of course, the back and forth between Elon Musk and Twitter will he or won't he? Elon's lawyers now asking a Delaware court to halt the upcoming trial, which starts October 17th over his deal to acquire Twitter at 5420 per share. We have senior reporter for the Wall Street Journal Carol Lamartha with us to discuss what's next in this deal. Caraguthus here, you've been all over this deal. Will we see Elon Musk deposed as early as Monday? That's currently the big question. I think that's why the two sides are deep in talks. They're hoping to, I believe, reach an agreement before them. I don't think either side wants to go through with that at this point, but still a possibility as of this moment. Karen, you've done some reporting here. You're now saying that Elon Musk reporting that Elon Musk is now saying that he wants this all contingent on whether or not he receives the necessary jet financing. What can you tell us about that? And I guess just a likelihood or unlikely, that that's going to happen, given how different the market is today compared to how it was when you initially struck this deal. So that wasn't a condition of the initial deal, but interestingly when his lawyers sent a two sentence letter to Twitter on Monday, surprising us all and saying, let's just do the deal on the original terms, he threw in this new financing condition. And so that is where the talks this week have really centered around. Now as far as...",https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ahmy7qqS3zQ,88,2022-10-06 20:13:07
2770," the deal on the original terms, he threw in this new financing condition. And so that is where the talks this week have really centered around. Now, as far as the idea of the banks having an out, that is not something I'm hearing and awful lot about. I think that would be very unlikely. They have a reputational risk. They would need to deal with it. They were to try to pull out of this deal. I think it's more that it's just another bargaining chip for him in these negotiations at the moment. How short are estimates that Elon Musk, how short is he of the 5420 per share? How much Tesla shares do we figure he may have to sell? That's a great question. He's already sold a large chunk, as you know. And to finance his equity portion, he's personally on the hook for over $30 billion worth of equity. Now he has a few friends and business acquaintances that have agreed to help with that. But they're not obliged to do it the way he is. So he may need to sell even more shares at the end. Kira, what's your best guess just in terms of whether or not this does go to trial? How long could potentially take to close and whether or not you have confidence? That it will, in fact, close and go through this time. So right now, the two scenarios that I think people are looking at are the following. One, they could reach a deal this weekend ahead of Monday, in which they agreed to put the lawsuit on hold and hopefully close the deal by the end of the month. The other scenario involves they don't reach a deal. They go to trial. That's five days starting the week after next. We'll probably get a decision within a few weeks. You would assume that if the decision is bad for Musk, he would probably appeal it. That would take a few additional weeks. We would probably have clarity by the end of the year. But then we'd still need to hold a potential vote on it if any of the terms changed or get all the conditions in place for the deal to close. So that would be a much more drawn out close. Any sense if Elon is still trying to reduce this deal from the $54.20, the $44 billion price tag? So that's an excellent question. As you know, we reported before his letter on Monday saying let's just do it at the original price. They were in deep discussions about a price cut. So anytime there's negotiating going on between two sides, I just assume any term is any possible term changes still on the table. I wouldn't rule it out as things move around, but I haven't heard that it's a focus of the discussions as they stand today. Karen, we've been following your reporting very closely. We will continue to follow it. Thanks so much for having on with us and giving us the latest. Karen Lombardo, the Wall Street Journal.

2771,"és Well, if you're in the market for a Ford F-150 Lightning EV, the task is getting tougher and the price tag higher, Ford raising the price. The second time in as many months, this week by $5,000, the starting price now, $519,740, up 11% from the previous price hike and 30% more than in May of 21. Senior Auto's reporter, Prouds, who remaining here with more on this story, Prouds, good to see you. What are we learning? Dave, you mentioned that second price hike there for that base model, the Ford F-150 Lightning EV. Ford announced that truck had a sub-40,000 price tag, a shot across the bow to the industry that we can make this truck for cheap. But you know what, it seems like things are getting in the way, namely inflation. I spoke to an auto analyst named Sam Fiorani at AutoFourCast Solutions. He's a big car manufacturing expert. He told me that Ford had no choice but to do this. It wasn't sustainable for them with inflation and part shortages. He said it was an in-ocertune time when Ford came out. He said, I'm from F-150 Lightning because of the fact that we started having inflation hit the economy. You know, you can't, you also, you said you can't blame Ford here because it's not an execution problem. GM and Tesla also having problems at pricing. We saw Tesla Royce prices. We saw GM say that their Ford Equinox is not, I'm sorry, there are seven Equinox. It's not going to be below 30, but around $30,000. So, you know, you can't actually blame Ford here because of what's happening as an industry by a problem. But there is a silver lining here and he said that perhaps by raising prices, Ford can actually invest in their EV transition more fully. And then also potentially, we might be able to see cheaper EVs down the road. But you know, it's hard to say right now to Ford F-150 Lightning Reservation holders were going to see a bigger price tag when they finally get that truck. Yeah, with that demand, they've got a lot of pricing power there. Prowse, thank you. Shana. All right, Dave, access to funding and concerns about credit availability are two big challenges. Minority business owners are facing today. And so, according to a new report from Bank of America and Shark Tank's Damon John is looking to help his announced plans for the third annual Black Entrepreneurs a day that will feature big names, including Spike Lee, Venus Williams and Shaqille O'Neill. We want to bring in Damon John, the Shark Group, a CEO and founder of Black Entrepreneurs Day. Damon, it's great to see you. Once again, and have you back here on Yahoo Finance. Congratulations on the announcement that you made today, the third annual Black Entrepreneurs Day. Just give us a sense right now. This of course happening later this month at a time when the economy is slowing down, business conditions are changing very rapidly. Give us a sense of just what you're hearing from business owners and entrepreneurs today. Yeah, I think, I mean, listen, you report and I'm hearing it a lot from watching you. You know, with inflation and everybody being squeezed and we're just looking at the challenges with Ford Tesla and everybody else. The supply chain is still being somewhat bottlenecked and figured out. It's getting tougher out there. You know, and that's the challenge and that's why as I launched Black Entrepreneurs Day for the third year, it's about access to capital and it's about more information on how to operate a business these days because we still have to start cutting and the cutting is not over.",https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ahmy7qqS3zQ,90,2022-10-06 20:22:09
2772," the day for the third year, it's about access to capital and it's about more information on how to operate a business these days because we still have to start cutting and the cutting is not over. I think we have a we have some time to keep cutting because these prices in inflation and the supply chain is problematic. Yeah, shocking. A day to see 40% of black business owners say they think they'll never have equal access to capital. Is that problem getting better and the people that might be at your conference? Shaquille O'Neill, Venus let alone her sister Serena Spike Lee, how are they changing that atmosphere? Well, it is somewhat getting better in one sense, but on the flip side, you know, it's not. You know, a lot of people, a lot of corporations after George Floyd had donated a lot of funds and it was an internal mandate to go out there and to address some of these matters. That's why we love working with JP Morgan Chase, Walter Management and they have their criteria as to deploy 30 billion over the next couple of years, but a lot are pulling back, you know, they're pulling back because they're looking at these things in line item. I'm not taking it personally. They're saying, hey, if we got to reduce our, you know, a lot of stuff we're doing by 30%. Well, something like these type of programs, they're just looked at as line item. They cut them when we always say that the people who need the most get cut the first and that's something that needs to, that needs to be readdressed because when more issues come around, they're going to be the ones with their pants down and the press and a lot of people are holding them, you know, holding them to their word of what did you say about two years ago? Now, why should Kilo Neal Spike Lee and Venus are honest to have people identify with people who are in great positions, but to talk more about their losses and where they failed and how they overcame those things and how they had to continue to educate themselves because many of us African Americans did not come from what legacy wealth. So our parents and grandparents could not share this information or wanting to, you know, scale back and deal with tough times like this. And David, talking about empowering these business owners, showing them what success looks like. I guess, how do you better prepare them for the future? We talk about the fact that access to funding is so, is so tough for many minorities that the numbers are pretty drastic, just the gap between access to funding. Guess what do we need to do in order to close that gap? Well, the challenges, what you need to do is any entrepreneur, whether African American or not is you have to constantly educate yourself on how to improve your business. And often that is the structure of your business. A lot of times when I meet with entrepreneurs, they literally cannot take in the capital because they don't have quick books or they don't have other sources so I can really trace where the money came from and where my money is going. A lot of times is internal structure and then it's always like any other business going back to what is the core of your business. I know, you know, I believe that we should always spend 20% on looking forward into improving the business and then, but at times like this, you need to go full out on who is your customer, why are you and how you offer providing for them? Where can you cut the fat and make it through these times? You get as lean as possible. You have a restaurant stop becoming a ghost kitchen in various other things like that. And you got to recalibrate your business because you got to get lean right now because winter is coming. You built the iconic clothing brand Foubu. Another icon, frankly, has been Kanye West, what he's done with Yeezy up 30% in 21.1 billion to a deed is alone, let alone his partnership with Gap. He's been very critical of both those relationships, Damon. And today we learned from the Wall Street Journal that his partnership with Adidas has been put under review. The problem is certainly not access to capital for Kanye. What is do you think? I think there's a communication through what Kanye expects, you know, and is everybody on the team from the top down in line with that and did they agree upon that? You know, businesses, it's moving often, right? And when the things were good and everything was going great, that's fine. But when supply chain issues come and or maybe they have over inventory or they order too much, well, they're going to have to adjust those numbers. And as much as Kanye is, you know, somebody who's leading it, you know, the theory of business who pays the most says the most, you know, and if Adidas and those people have massive amount of inventory, they have to let go or they have to start cutting prices to retailers or not, you know, they don't have the people walking through their doors anymore. You know, you've got to make adjustments. So I don't know what those agreements are and I'll leave it up to all of them, but it's not always as one side is what we see.",https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ahmy7qqS3zQ,91,2022-10-06 20:26:15
2773," all into their doors anymore. You know, you got to make adjustments. So I don't know what those agreements are. And I'll leave it up to all of them, but it's not always as one side is. What we see, Kanye happens to have a loud voice, but we haven't really heard from the people who are dealing with the supply chain and all the other things that they have challenges with. Damien, sticking with retail, another consumer facing brand I want to ask you about is Peloton because once again, today they're in the news announcing another round of cuts, a fourth round of job cuts this year. From your perspective, I guess, what does a company like Peloton? What do they need to do in order to turn things around and get investors back on board? That's a really good question. I thought Peloton would have been sold a long time ago because they happen to have a captivated audience, 45 minutes to an hour on viewing the screen. And I would have thought that one of the Netflix of the world, the Amazon's of the world would have just grabbed them due to eyeballs. So that's still not off the table at the moment, but I really don't know what they could do right now. I think that's over my pay gradient because they are suffering and I did invest in Peloton not after the bump, but after it brought it back down, but it kept going back down. And I'm like, what the hell did I do? So I wish I had the answers to that, but I don't have the answer to that. It has been interesting watching, just sipping from a fire hose, the amount of news coming out of there. Damien, you often quote Elon Musk and talk about his leadership style and his innovation over the recent years. What do you make of the latest twist in turn? Suddenly he's back in on buying Twitter. I think he's a sharp negotiator, and Elon has always three or four steps ahead. He's already had, he has a plan for this thing and I think he's just basically doing what we all do. You go to the house, you put a bid on it, you get everybody out of the way and then you start setting the engineers in there and you find out all the things that you would like to have adjusted sooner or later, before the seller gets seller's fatigue or you get them to go down on pricing and you get them where you want them. So I think it's just a negotiation and the crazy thing is he's using the same exact platform that he's purchasing to help negotiate what he wants to do. He's brilliant, I will never try to think ahead of Elon Musk. Yeah, Damien, I guess just your reaction now has handled this acquisition so far and also heading into a company where the culture is obviously has gone through many rollercoaster rides to say the least over the last several months as someone who has a very successful track record. I guess how do you kind of write that ship? How do you write the ship of their culture? Yes. Challenging at the moment, you have to almost get to the theory of crashing and burning or slashing all leadership because it really comes from a leadership standpoint and getting all the old guards out of the way. And because today is very hard to get at workforce that really wants to work for you. They want to work for culture, they want to work for purpose. So I believe that it's really going to be cleaning house and you get there of all the people that are at the top. All right, Damien, John, wanted to say you did a great job on Mask Singer. You're looking spelt, Matt. And you look like you have really been working it out, brother. Good to see you. Black Entrepreneurs Day, October 27th at New York City's Apollo Theater, the website blackentrepreneursday.com. Please check it out the deadline, the 12th. Good to see you, sir. All right, come on up next. We're going to take a quick break here. When we come back, OPEC plus cuts on the rise in the Biden administration reported looking elsewhere from oil will tell you where next. Drink some water today up to the stage,",https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ahmy7qqS3zQ,92,2022-10-06 20:30:46
2774," Sorry. All right, with OPEC Bloss following through with historic production cuts of two million barrels a day, where will the United States go to offset those cuts? According to a report by the Wall Street Journal, the answer just might be Venezuela. That will involve the loosening of sanctions with the Maduro regime. Scott Bauer is the CEO of Prosper Trading Academy. Let's talk about this with him good to see a Scott. So first, the White House pushing back a little bit on this this morning saying it's premature to suggest sanctions relief. What's your reaction to the cuts and the potential for dealing with the Maduro regime to offset them? Well, I think it's very dangerous and it's dangerous because they've been in talks or at least they started talks at the beginning of the Russia, Ukraine, war back in March. So we're talking it's been six or seven months. I don't even want to say negotiation, but since those talks have started and we haven't really gotten anywhere and it sure seems that this is an afterthought, almost, in a reaction to the cuts that we saw yesterday from OPEC Plus. So maybe this is going to happen, but it certainly puts the United States in my opinion in a position they don't want to be and something that they don't want to do in terms of giving up sanctions or quite frankly having to trust Maduro and the regime that they're going to come to the table and that they are going to meet the opposition and talk about legitimate elections in the future. So I think we're not in a great spot with this. So Scott, they're looking at doing this in order to boost supply. I guess how much of an effect do you see this potentially having on prices? Right, so that effect is not going to come quickly either. The state of drilling is in shambles in Venezuela. There has been a very long time where there hasn't been anything going on and even Chevron, who's the big driller going to have to get in there, it's going to take them months to get up and running. So in the near term, it has no effect whatsoever on adding any supply to the marketplace. We're talking probably three to six months down the road. Now, maybe if it happens, maybe the market looks at that and says, okay, that's good enough. We know that there's going to be some pain right now, but maybe.",https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ahmy7qqS3zQ,93,2022-10-06 20:35:00
2775," the six months down the road. Now, maybe if it happens, maybe the market looks at that and says, OK, that's good enough. We know that there's going to be some pain right now, but, you know, maybe by the end of the year or first quarter next year, we know there's going to be this supply coming back on. But even when Venezuela was in their full production, that was 3 million barrels a day. So, you know, let's say we get a third of that back, maybe half of that back, you're looking at a million to a million and a half a day, what's that is up and running? Of course, all this matters depends upon your interpretation of those OPEC plus cuts, which they say are around 2 million barrels a day. Again, Amos Hoxtine told CNBC this morning, he thinks it's closer to 900,000, but he said he'd actually be surprised if there's any net cut at the end eventually anyway, and it shouldn't have a massive impact on prices. What do you make of that? I actually agree with that, and that's because they haven't hit their quota. So, that 2 million number that they're floating out there, because they haven't hit their quotas now, that's why we see that actual reduction, if you will, the 900,000 or a million. Quite frankly, I'm surprised that the market reacted the way it did, that it's not more of a buy the rumor sell the news type of event. I understand why crude went up after the announcement yesterday morning. I would have thought we would have actually seen it fall back a little as the market really digested, what you just mentioned, that 2 million number is really not 2 million. Scott, what do you think this all means for gas prices going up, looking down the line here? The average national average today is 387 up about 4 cents from yesterday up 9 cents from the last week. Are we going to be back above $4 soon? Yeah, I think we're going to see that probably within the next couple of weeks. And, you know, it's that chicken and egg thing when we see crude prices go down, yeah, gas prices go down a little bit or takes them a long time. Now, all of a sudden, you know, over the last week, 10 days, we've seen crude prices rising. And man, we've seen, at least where I live, probably 40 to 50 cents a gallon higher. It just the last week. So, yes, I think sooner rather than later, I would bet even by the end of next week, we're back above the average of $4 a gallon. Bad news here for consumers. All right, Scott Bauer, great to speak with you. Thanks so much for joining us. Have a good day. Thank you, Sean, for some big breaking news now on cannabis reform. President Biden announcing about an hour ago that the administration will pardon all federal offenses of simple marijuana possession. They'll also urge states governors to do the same and ask the HHS secretary and attorney general to reexamine how cannabis is scheduled. As you might expect, shares of marijuana stocks soaring on this news. We are talking a minimum increase around 20 percent for a lot of the big names and check it out here. Or a canopy cure leaf, green thumb and true leaf. And the biggest gainer on the day is with us now. True leaf up 36 percent on this news. We're joined now by the CEO of True Leaf, Kim Rivers. Kim, nice to see you. First, there had been a lot of negative sentiment regarding the abide administration and how they handled cannabis just your reaction to this U-turn. Well, I mean, better late than never. That's what I would say. And I'm really thankful that President Biden did step up and fulfill one of his campaign promises, which was, of course, as he stated early on that no one should be in jail for cannabis use or possession. So we've gotten the possession side of things at the federal level today, which, of course, is historic and is very, very important. And so I do want to pause and say, you know, thank you. And hopefully this is the first of many steps in the right direction as it relates to reform. I'm also very hopeful that, of course, the governors will follow suit at the state level as there are many, many more folks incarcerated at the state level for possession as well. And so hopefully that will, this will, this will start a movement there. President Biden tweeting, as I've said before, no one should be in jail for just using or possessing marijuana. Today I'm taking",https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ahmy7qqS3zQ,94,2022-10-06 20:39:05
2776," This will start a movement there. President Biden tweeting, as I've said before, no one should be in jail for just using or possessing marijuana. Today, I'm taking steps to end our failed approach. Let's talk about the third aspect here, which is examining the scheduling of cannabis. How significant is that news? You know, that's again, that is historic and monumental. As President Biden correctly pointed out, currently marijuana is scheduled the same as heroin. I think we can all agree that that is simply laughable at this point. There are millions of Americans who utilize cannabis legally under state programs today for health and well-being, and of course, also recreationally under adult use programs as alternatives to alcohol as an example. And so, you know, certainly it sends a strong signal that this administration is taking proactive steps to re-examine how this country has categorized marijuana historically. And again, hopefully this is the beginning of a conversation that is long overdue as it relates to significant and substantive reform. Kim, clearly investors are optimistic of federal legalization. We mentioned your stock popping 36% on this news. Are you more optimistic of legalization than you were a few hours ago? You know, I think that this this market in the sector has been fairly held back as a result of the lack of federal action. I think that, you know, coming into a democratic controlled house in Congress coupled with a presidency who ran on promises of cannabis reform. The sector has been stagnated and waiting for, you know, a substantive step forward, which I think was provided today. So, you know, there has been a lot of work that's been done in both chambers and actually by bipartisan work that's been done in both chambers and conversations around substantive frameworks. And again, this is going to take some work. So I do want to say that because it is a complex issue and we do need to make sure that we get it right and that we are thoughtful and comprehensive and that we are and have a resulting ecosystem that is encompassing and is one that is sustainable. But certainly I am encouraged for sure that this is that first step that I believe that the market and certainly that we have been we have been looking for. I'm hearing cautious optimism. Give me a time frame. How long do you think we are before federal legalization? And the biggest obstacle here has been just getting safe banking through the Senate past the House now a half a dozen times. When can that get done? Well, so, you know, certainly safe banking is is teed up and ready to go. It has been for quite some time. It's been past numerous occasions on numerous occasions in the House. Of course, on the Senate, there's been a lot of conversation around, you know, safe banking as a standalone or safe banking paired with some sort of additional criminal justice reform. I'm actually expungement is it was a was a and certainly making sure that we have we have remedies for folks who are in prison to this today actually is a big step to help that. And perhaps will then, you know, is for an action on safe banking, which we certainly were hopeful would happen before the end of the year. I can tell you that in terms of full blown legalization and again, that is going to take some work. We do need to make sure that it is a thoughtful program that is, you know, does ensure that folks who are currently utilizing cannabis are able to continue and that we are we are thoughtful about how that product is regulated and that is safety, of course, is a paramount concern. And then also again, the ecosystem that's developed as one that is inclusive and diverse. And again, I just I think that we do need to make sure that we can all stand behind that result. But in terms of when that can happen, and there are a lot of measures in the legislature that have been drafted, and there are bills that are literally sitting and waiting waiting to go. There's framework bills, there's bills that address, you know, research and safety. And so there's there's a lot of work that that is ready and can come to fruition quickly. If the political will is there to actually dig in and lean into this issue and begin and begin to get some things passed out. So I think that again, press.",https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ahmy7qqS3zQ,95,2022-10-06 20:43:20
2777," If the political will is there to actually dig in and lean into this issue and begin to get some things passed out. So I think that, again, President Biden's support in his signaling that he is willing to spend some political capital on this and to – in a signal to Congress that this is an issue that's important, which it should be because it's important to the American voters. You know, the American acceptance rate, as it relates to cannabis, has only increased since President Biden has been in office. Pull after pull shows that Americans want legal reform and legal access to cannabis. So no surprise there. And again, hopeful that this is the first of many steps to come. Been searching for Republican reaction. Can't find much. Congresswoman Nancy Mays did tweet, applaud the administration for their necessary big step forward and bringing justice to so many. She is one of the few Republican supporters in the House of cannabis legislation still waiting for some Senate comments. Truly CEO Kim Rivers. Nice to see you as always. Thank you. Thank you. All right, coming up. The auto is using AI to help people level up their skills and advance their careers. The company CEO joined us next to tell us how they're doing. All right. Advanced in your career or moving to a new industry can be confusing and stressful. But what if artificial intelligence could assess your skill set and connect you with the training and certifications that you would need? That's precisely what our next guest company, Otto, aims to do, joining us now for more on that we want to bring in the founder and a CEO of Otto Milan of Cortistani for today's installment of Career Control brought to you by straight talk wireless. Milan is great to see you. Just talk to us, I guess, first just give us a groundwork of what exactly.",https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ahmy7qqS3zQ,96,2022-10-06 20:48:00
2778," for today's installment, a career control brought to you by straight talk wireless monitoring. To see you, just talk to us, I guess, first, just give us a groundwork of what exactly auto is and how the AI exactly works. Thank you for having us, Johnna. I'm really excited to be here. So basically what we do with the AI is, we have to start by understanding who you are as an individual. So we assess you on your personality and it's all sorts of traits from how artistic you are realistic and enterprising. And then the next component is understanding what past experience you have. It could be being a waitress, it could be being a farmer, which is what I did before I went into, you know, working in tech, but truthfully, whatever it is, we understand what your experience is and we run all of that information against a massive database of resumes to see where is their overlap in, where you are today, with where you want to go and how can we help you understand what those skills are that are monetizable and in demand in today's marketplace and recommend the right curriculum from across the internet and our partners to be able to recommend the right courses to quickly up-skill you and make you valuable again in the marketplace and competitive. Well, who's your target audience or these people that are just entering the workforce have only been in the workforce for a few years or are also people going to use auto that have been in a job for maybe 10, 12 years and they're looking to change what they're doing today. So our focus today is on 18 to 24-year-olds, individuals that are currently trying to find more alternative solutions than the current university and college route. However, the truth is as we start to scale out and our AI becomes more intelligent at realizing what success looks like at different stages of people's careers, we'll be able to take anyone and even an individual that may have been out of the workforce for say 10 years after being some expert of a sort and helping them identify what are the one or two skills that we could help you find and train to then be really competitive in the job market. Milan, presumably there was a problem with the way this is happening now that you were looking to solve. What is the breakdown in the way people are choosing careers where we stand today? Sure. So right now there isn't much clarity into how an individual that is going on after high school to figure out where they want to go with their career and what it is that they want to do beyond a college advisor or the SAT kind of helping determine which school you could get into. And likewise, when you're on LinkedIn or indeed or any of these platforms really where you keep all of your information about your past experience, that information is never used to help you understand what you're missing when you don't land a job. And that's what we want to do. We're here to use data for good and gamification to basically help you understand why it is you don't land a job when you apply for it. By knowing what a competitor that did land that job, what it was that they had as a skill and what we can do to help make you more competitive the next time. So say someone out there right now wants to get started. Where do they start? How much does it cost? How involved is the process? So if you're interested right now in one of the three career tracks we offer, which are in digital marketing, software engineering and graphic design, you could come to auto.com and you sign up and you'll be able to, after joining our wait list as we're in beta right now, you'll be able to essentially take our AI assessment and we'll start by figuring out who you are and then recommending the courses for you to get started. We have a membership that starts at $12 and that helps you get significant discounts on all of the curriculum we offer. But even for users who are not members of ours, they can come to auto and they can take courses at the same price as any of our partners online or better guaranteed. All right, auto founder and CEO Milan Kordistani really appreciate a good stuff you're doing there. Thanks. Shout out over to you. What's moving after hours, my friend? All right, Dave, we have two stocks here in focus. Let's kick it off with Levi's and talk off just about 5% the company lowering its full year forecast citing the strong dollar supply chain disruptions two things that are clouding the company's outlook right now. They cut their full year adjusted EPS and net revenue growth guidance for the year third quarter numbers though, we're actually not that bad. EPS coming in better than expected 40 cents. The street was looking for an estimate of 37 cents revenue just a bit like 1.5 billion estimate there was for one.",https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ahmy7qqS3zQ,97,2022-10-06 20:52:10
2779," That bad EPS coming in better than expected 40 cents. The street was looking for an estimate of 37 cents revenue just a bit like 1.5 billion estimate there was for 1.6 billion in terms of the three month movement in this stock. Not too bad up about 1% relatively speaking. That's actually pretty strong here to date though. The stock in the red off just around 36%. Let's take a look at AMD here. AMD under pressure after hour. There are some of its competitors, a company coming out cutting its third quarter revenue guidance. They cited the weak PC market and also quote significant inventory corrections throughout the PC supply chains. We're seeing AMD off just about three and a half percent right now they now see third quarter revenue at 5.6 billion. The initial estimate was for 6.7 billion. Certainly has been a tough couple of months for AMD because you can see the stock off 33% in just the past two months alone year to date of just over 52%. Right after we got this news from AMD after hour some of its biggest competitors and video Intel are also under pressure after hours following the news. So AMD cutting a third quarter revenue guidance was shares off just over 3%. Dave. All right. Thank you. Shout out to you. I'm watching for tomorrow and what the Fed is indeed watching tomorrow. All these September jobs report, the forecast is for 250,000 jobs created. The unemployment rate to hold steady at 3.7%. That's all according to definitive. Now 315,000 jobs are added in August. Still a very strong number but well below the average of more than a half million over the last 12 months. The ADP data we got yesterday and I showed private companies created 208,000 jobs in September. While earlier this week we got the Joel to the number of open positions slipped by more than 1 million. The September report also expected to show hourly earnings growth has decelerated albeit slightly to 5.1% from 5.2. And lastly we will focus on that all important labor force participation rate most recently clocking in at 62.4 as you can see below the pre pandemic level. Taking a break here but when we come back consumers may soon learn a lot about what's inside the alcoholic beverage they're consuming. Find out when we come back.

2780," We want to get to some breaking news here. Following the reporting say is going to submit for personal currencies. And then saying they had so for 20 a share this month saying that, quote, Twitter will not take yes for an answer. So again, Twitter responding here after hours, you're seeing the stock up just around 710s of a percent. All right. Well, it is about that time of day where we start thinking about what we might be drinking tonight. And it's Thursday, maybe about what you're going to be drinking this weekend. Reportedly, the Treasury Department wants to know what's in what we are drinking, responding to a lawsuit by the Consumer Federation of America. The Department may push for beer wine and spirits companies to display calorie counts involving sizes and ingredients on their labels. Indeed, there are some beer industry, some players in the beer industry that do this on a voluntary basis. There's been some pushback from wine makers. Josh, our producer, looked up, Avaco soda. That's what I like to drink when I'm out having some fun. Has 133 calories for 225 grams serving. That's a lot more than what I was expecting to be. I don't think I'm a fan of this labeling for alcohol. What do you think? I'm a huge fan of this happening. I think this is long overdue. 95% of beers already do this voluntarily. I have a problem with the spirits industry in particular, although I texted it to Stiller in my area. He said, oh, this will increase the cost of doing business more regulations, slow down product development. Here's Koss Amigos, the leading Tequila brand on the market from George Clooney. And if you turn it around, we don't know what's in it. And I talk to a lot of liquor store owners who are concerned. They want to know not only the calorie count, they want to know the ingredients. Here's another one. This is the rocks brand, Taremana, very different on the backside. He breaks it all down from what's in it to the amount of alcohol per serving, serving size. I think this is long overdue. But David, it has not stopped you from drinking. Both of those bottles almost gone, very, very little bit left. All right, that'll do it for us. For Shana, I'm Dave. We will see tomorrow at 3 o'clock Eastern time. Bye.",https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ahmy7qqS3zQ,99,2022-10-06 21:00:50

2784," The super sweet stuff. Thanks so much, Bill. Good to see you. Constellation, Brancy. Thanks. Good to see you. I want to bring you some quick breaking news on CBS. There is a report from Bloomberg that CBS is now in exclusive talks to buy Kenoe health. That's the health care provider that has clinics that is backed by Barry Stern, like the billionaire here. And there have been a lot of reports about who was in the running to buy the company. And indeed, Humana has first right of refusal through an agreement that it made with Kenoe in 2019. So that's something to keep in mind as well. But you see the Kenoe health shares are up 10%. CBS had already been following after some news on some new Medicare star ratings and how that might affect the company's profitability. But nonetheless, that move upward and I believe Kenoe is actually halted right now because of volatility after that big spike up in those shares. Coming up, Jared Bluckery is going to give us a deep dive into the out of finance interactive on this jobs report Friday as the NASDAQ leads losses down by 2%. Almost 20 minutes into this Friday's trading session here on this jobs Friday, I might add. Taking a look at the major averages, you're seeing us down across the board for the Dow, the S&P 500 and the NASDAQ here in the US major averages there with the deepest declines on a percentage basis on the NASDAQ, the tech heavy average, but the largest point decline on the Dow down by about 1.4%. For much more on today's take, let's get in with Yahoo Finance as Jared Bluckery. Yes, well, maybe a little bit too hot to handle on those jobs numbers. We're seeing red across the board here for the day. Let's check out for the week. Now we had some big gains on Monday and Tuesday, which we are now giving back, but maybe only about half of those 2% isn't bad for the first week of October. I think investors will take that. Here is the Dow up about 2 and 3% and then S&P 500 somewhat in the middle there. Let's take a look at the sector action for today. Energy has been in the forefront. Crude oil had a bid all week, but tech consumer discretionary, those two mega-capillated sectors, those are in the red for over 2% communication services, also housing a lot of those big names. That's down almost 2% followed by financials, materials, etc. Too hot to handle, I don't know.",https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NDK8QAnFNxU,1,2022-10-07 13:52:32
2785," Over 2% communication services also housing a lot of those big names. That's down almost 2% followed by financials, materials, etc. Too hot to handle, I don't know, but a lot of Fed mispricing. Let's remember the Fed doesn't want to see stocks going up too much right now. So this is actually in line with their plan. Nasdaq 100, Microsoft down 3% Tesla also Amazon also in that boat down 3% and Vidya down almost 5% Chinese stocks looks like they're taking it on the chin right now. Quick look at that board. I do want to show you something though. This is interesting. We got that news on the cannabis sector yesterday with Biden potentially pardoning a lot of people throughout the US who have been arrested for possession at least on the federal level. And we did see a big surge earlier yesterday. And we can see for the week we're seeing some nice gains right here. Other than that, let's check out our sentiment and leaders board right here. And we can see cannabis for the week. That's MJ. That's in the lead here followed by meme stocks gambling, Korean stocks, home builders. So still sitting on some gains. But let's not forget this is today's price action. This is what matters. This is jobs reports. We got to figure out where we got to think about what could happen in the days and weeks to come guys. Yeah, we'll find it soon. Jared Blicker. All right. Thanks so much, Jared. Let's get on our stab the day here and stick with a little bit of a market gloom angle. 3150. That's how low the S&P 500 could go if the Federal Reserve doesn't engineer a soft economic landing at the same time it aggressively lifts interest for a says the folks at Goldman Sachs if that level is hit, it would represent about a 17% plunge for the S&P 500 from current levels. All right. So to calm the midterm elections are going to be here before you know it will break down what history shows about investing and the midterms next. All right.",https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NDK8QAnFNxU,2,2022-10-07 13:57:20
2786," If you're going to have a job, the midterm elections will be here before you know it on November 8th. The Democrats are expected to win the Senate. The Republicans are seeing winning the House, but of course they think it could happen ultimately. And before the midterms, there will be a federal reserve meeting on interest rates on November 2nd. That decision and the stock market reaction could then affect election turnout and influence how stocks and the year. Saasie has more numbers behind all of this on the stake. Like forget about jobs, we're all focused on jobs today. You're always a step ahead Brian Saasie. Yep. Yeah well when everybody zigs I usually try to zag. So I might be the only one in financial media talking about the midterm election state, which is good because that's what we're here for. Y'all, Vance, prepare investors for what might come three, six months down line or in this case November 8th. So we're looking at the midterm elections and of course before that you have that fed meeting on November 2nd. But here's what we have up for grabs here just to set the scene for those midterm elections. Lots of for grabs and hence you will probably see the market really focus on all things midterms. We have an interesting chart too just to get a get a vibe of the economy into election day and is it it's the misery index that comes compliments for the team at Jeffries. It is essentially the unemployment rate plus the inflation rate and you've seen that spike as a result as consumers battle obviously high levels of inflation. Now in terms of stats, you know I want to just zoom in on a couple interesting ones here from US Bank that caught my attention. The S&P 500 has historically outperforming the market in the 12 month period after a midterm election with an average return. Get this guy is about 16.3 percent that is pretty good. I will also note the last time the S&P 500 produced negative returns during the 12 months after a midterm election was 1939 while was going on there as a reminder because we were not on this planet that was the great depression in World War II. So I think the market is going to become against a lot of headwinds and concerns regarding this. You know we talked to Laurie Calvin-Cyniastariate, RBC saying you know that when she talks to her clients they wouldn't mind Republicans getting a little more control of things here. Maybe some divided government, maybe some of those more aggressive areas of the Democratic agenda don't get through, maybe markets like that. But again that's a lot of ifs and that's a lot of whens and my take here going back to a lot in old school James Carvell quote it's the economy stupid and I think it will be very interesting to see how voters come out here on the eighth. Do they vote with the economy or do they find something else or another issue they're very focused on. All right a lot to continue to watch their saws. Guys appreciate that take this morning saws coming up next though everyone we're going to reset the show breakdown how the market is reacting to this in September jobs report you see it there on the screen but that's just a brief glimpse there's more within those numbers on the other side.",https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NDK8QAnFNxU,3,2022-10-07 14:01:17
2787,"沒事 Welcome back to Yahoo Finance Live, everyone. We've reached this, the top of the 10 AM hour Brad Smith here in studio with Julie Hyman, Brian Sasi on assignment, as we'll say, from home today. Happy Friday to you all here on this jobs Friday. Let's take a look at where the market's saying following that jobs report earlier, which was just a little bit hotter than expectations. We're taking a look at the Dow, the Nasdaq and the S&P 500, all lower on the day. The Dow is lower by a little more than 480 points to the downside of about 1.6%. The S&P 500, they're also seeing that deep in the red right now by roughly 2% that looks like, and then additionally, the Nasdaq composite, you're seeing that down by about 312 points. And taking a deeper dive into that jobs report, of course, later on in this show, we're going to have set criteria of labor, Marty Walsh, going to join us momentarily to get reaction from the White House. So stay tuned for that conversation. Plus, it's Jeans Friday, wherever you find yourself in the world. But Levi's under pressure this morning. After the denim maker cut its outlook, we're going to speak to the company's CFO to discuss its latest earnings report as you get ready to put the jorts away. And an unprecedented move in the movie world, Netflix, is set to show the knives, out sequel, and major theaters one month before its streaming release. We're going to discuss what that means for the streaming space. All of that, much more coming up during this 10 AM hour. But for much more on today's markets, let's get on over to Yahoo! Finances and Nez Faray is about 30 minutes into today's trading session and Nez on Over To You. And Brad, you mentioned the losses after that jobs report. And we are still seeing the S&P 500 down 2%. But if we just pull up a five day chart because of Monday and Tuesday's rally, we are set to end the week in the green for the major averages because of those days if we stay at this space. Let's see what happens throughout the day. Looking also at the 10-year treasury note, that's higher up 7 basis points at 3.9%. We saw that 10-year treasury yield go higher after that jobs report. Also the US dollar index, that moved higher after the jobs report as well. Want to point out what's happening with Bitcoin because we did see Bitcoin moving to the downside earlier. And then looking at the sector action, we're watching the high growth names that are really under pressure. So you're watching tech, consumer discretionary, materials are leading to the downside. Over on the NASDAQ 100, the mega caps, as I mentioned, Tesla down 3% Amazon also lower, Nvidia down 5% and the semiconductors are really seeing some pressure today after that revenue warning from AMD. Finally, I want to mention what's happening with the home builders because of higher interest rates and what this how this affects the home builders. Well, you're looking at them in the red right now, especially home builders and also companies that have to do with mortgages, guys. Yeah, definitely anything, interest rate sensitive is in focus here today. Thanks so much, Inez. Well, let's continue our conversation on the job.",https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NDK8QAnFNxU,4,2022-10-07 14:06:09
2788," with mortgages guys. Yeah, definitely anything interest rate sensitive is in focus here today. Thanks so much, Ynez. Well, let's continue our conversation on the job report and the market implications. Joining us now, John Tobin, Epic Investment Partners, Managing Director and Senior Equity Research Analyst. John, it's good to see you. So as we look at this, good news is bad news, kind of jobs day. I mean, that's just very simply how we should look at it here, that the Fed is going to be raising rates for the foreseeable future. I think that's right. I think the market it sees in certainly the past few days, we've seen evidence of it. It's looking for some reason, something to latch on to to justify the rally. They're hoping for some evidence that the Fed's about to pivot. The Reserve Bank of Australia's move early in the week ignited that hope. And even though the Fed speakers all week long, pushed back on that pretty hard, I think the evidence today is from the jobs report, the jobs market still remains strong, and the Fed still has work to do. Now, as we've talked about it in our shop this morning on our morning call, there is clearly evidence of deceleration here. So if you're trying to find some good news here, that the numbers are moving in the right direction. This is a 263K increase in jobs, but it shows continual deceleration over time. Average hourly earnings are up, but again, evidence of deceleration. So I think the main takeaway is, things are moving in the right direction, but the Fed still has a lot of work to do. Rates are still going higher. So John, should the other takeaway here, just looking at the market action in the early going is for investors to fade any rallies? Well, I think that's, I mean, that would be my personal view that with each attempt to rally into this, I've continued to make the case that I don't see what the foundation is, for a strong rally, for a sustainable rally. I mean, if you think about what the drivers of equity market returns are, its earnings growth, its dividends, and its multiple expansion, and if rates are going higher, that's a headwind from multiple expansion. And if the economy is slowing down and maybe headed for a recession, that's a headwind for earnings growth. So the main underpinnings that would support a sustainable rally just aren't there. I think to me, this is a market environment where investors need to keep some defensive exposure in their asset allocation. We've had a conversation, especially around the shift in the types of jobs, the employment situation really lays out, kind of sector by sector here. But for some of those businesses that are looking at the amount of people that post pandemic, they've realized they actually need to run the business, it also becomes a question of where some of those employees will find employment elsewhere and in different sectors as well as many people have upskilled over the course of the pandemic. I mean, does that drastically shape everything from wages all the way to what a solid baseline sector by sector actually looks like? Well, you're absolutely right. There are some sector trends that we're noticing here, where there's strength, where there's weakness, there's strength in leisure and hospitality, there's weakness in other sectors, there's weakness in energy, there's weakness in things related to building and construction, of course. But and it's disruptive for the economy, as you point out, that people are looking for jobs and looking to move perhaps into new areas where there is job growth. So there is that friction, but that's not really something new, that's a or necessarily a post pandemic phenomenon. I think that's historically bending case. There's always a friction as people move and try to direct themselves into the areas where there's greater employment opportunities. John, bottom line when it comes to these markets, I think people are trying to figure out what the heck to do right now. And you have some interesting stuff in your portfolio, including consumer staples, things like Home Depot and Walmart. Do you think that a company like Walmart, for example, has gotten past its inventory troubles and is still going to be able to benefit as we head towards the holiday season? So it's absolutely true that the retailers have inventory issues to grapple with. And I wouldn't want to say that for Walmart, that it's all said and done and they're behind it.

And if we're looking at a slow economic environment and we're looking at the possibility of recession and we think about where are we most likely to have the stocks and the companies that are most likely to hold up best in that environment, it is some of the defensive sectors, the traditional defensive sectors like Staples, the Walmart's healthcare, for example. We have utilities, another area where we have exposure even, but at the same time, even some financials will hold up better regional banks. There'll probably be some evidence of weakening low demand and some pick up in credit quality issues, but we think that they're at a very strong position with good credit statistics today and with very strong capital positions today. So there are several defensive sectors that we have exposure to and we think these are sectors that won't mean that they won't feel any pressure from a slowing economy, but rather that they will be more resilient in the face of a challenging market environment. Just trying to tie both inflation and employment together because one of that is an input cost into the prices that consumers are having to pay as well. For consumers and of course everybody who's in this economy and is working, there's still money that is going out the door out of your pockets both on a necessity basis or on a discretionary basis. So with that in mind, where then are we going to expect to see kind of wages stabilized at the same time that the Fed is trying to see inflation stabilized? Well, Fed is clearly trying to get inflation down and trying to get a way to growth down. And what that really means even though they don't like to say it so much out loud is they need the unemployment rate to go up and they need jobs growth to slow pretty dramatically. So but you're right, this implies pressure on the consumers. So there'll be pressure on the consumer in terms of weaker jobs growth. There'll be more people unemployed. There's more pressure on consumer pocketbooks because of inflationary pressures, what people are paying at the pump for gasoline, what they're paying for their energy bill when they get their content bill every month. So there's pressure on the consumer. This is all part of the narrative of an economy that is being forced to slow down by Fed policy. John, if I'm correct, you have some exposures to some big cap tech names. Apple, Microsoft and IBM, even a broadcom, but in light of this AMD warning, which is pretty shocking. I mean, I missed their expectations by a billion dollars on sales or even trying to rotate out of big cap tech or you're going to just try to just survive this volatility. Well, you know, the truth is in the strategy that I help run, tech is a significant underweight for us. We actually have a hard time finding tech names that fit the characteristics that we see. We're looking for companies that have growing cash, they'll pay attractive growing dividends and otherwise use cash to distribute to shareholders through share buybacks. So we do have exposure to some of those tech names that you mentioned, but we are underweight. We're underweight those names by definition underweight Apple apples over 4% of the index. So while we have Apple in the portfolio, it's an underweight apple and while we have tech in the portfolio, it's an underweight to the tech sector. I'm sure that we some names that we look at and will probably trim them and maybe even exit them. There's nothing that we're thinking about doing right this minute. All right. We'll leave it there. John Tobin, Epoch Investment Partners, Managing Director and Profoli Manager. Good to see you. Have a good weekend. Thanks for having me. Appreciate it. Yep. All right. Before we head to break, let's pull up shares of Target, which are getting a bullish call by Goldman Sachs retail analyst, Kate McShane. Shane is reiterating and bywriting on Target and issuing a $205 price target. The upbeat call comes as Target is warned on sales three times since March 1st, only to the economic slowdown. It says McShane. We think despite the missteps, Target has taken this year on both merchandising and guidance. It remains a retail, secular winner, which should support the stock. We'll take more into Target on October 17th when Target Chairman CEO Brian Cornell chats with me at the Yow Finance All Market Summit. Definitely looking forward to that chat in that day. All right. Coming up, U.S. Labor Secretary Marty Walsh will join us to talk all things. Just as Joe's report, don't go anywhere.",https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NDK8QAnFNxU,6,2022-10-07 14:14:14

2791," Seeing more and more companies want to create more and build more here in the United States, we're seeing the president really focusing on that as well, doing more in the United States. We're seeing in this particular drop month, we didn't see, we saw actually a decrease in government hiring around education. So that's one number that was low. But companies are still looking for people. You're still hearing it every day. I mean, as you mentioned earlier, I think we might have been Julie saying, some people do eye-cutting back on their employees because they're anticipating what the future might bring, but a lot of companies are still hiring. And so with a cut back on employees yet hiring also kind of decreasing or decelerating, if you will, what does that spell out for the people who, during the great resignation, had kind of put in that two-week notice and said, I've got another offer somewhere else. I've got a greater offer on the table. Is this still a job hopper's market or from your perspective, is it something where that is decelerating so much to the point where it's very much shifting and employees should be considering exactly where they make those moves? I still think it's a good market for employees to look at for better opportunities, but I think what's happening is employers are realizing now they have to do a little more to keep their employees. Employers don't want to hire somebody and then have to six months lose them to another place for higher salary or better benefits. So I think employers are starting to, when I go around talking to companies, they're really looking to hybrid work, how does that work? They're looking at opportunities, childcare, and other things to encourage people to come into their companies. And I think companies are adapting to the change in the environment around workers today. And some of the folks we're talking to are saying some of these changes are going to be long-standing, right? That we're seeing a more profound shift in the workforce because of increased flexibility of being able to work from home, because of sort of life decisions people made during the pandemic, maybe some people taking early retirement, et cetera. How is the administration thinking about some of those longer-term changes and addressing some of those longer-term trends? Well, I think one of the biggest things that President did in the bill back by the legislation that didn't go to the Senate, child care, paid family leave, sick time, medical leave, all of those issues are very important to families today. And I think a lot of companies, some of them, are getting there on their own. But child care is a very complicated issue. And I think that we as a country have to think about and rethink about the way that our child care system works because it's expensive. And we're having a high time retaining workers in that industry because we don't pay them enough to take care of our kids. So I think as we think about long-term, that's going to be one investment on a federal level, but also on the private sector. So I think, you know, pre-pandemic, we didn't hear about the changes in companies. These companies would change the way they did office space, open areas, things like that. But I think because of the pandemic, it's made us all really think about the future. And what we're doing here at the Department of Labor, we're working with companies. I don't think I have the right to tell a company how to operate that company. That's not my role. My role is to try and assist them and help with them and share best practices where I can and what other companies are doing. Mr. Secretary, last time we spoke to you about a month ago on jobs day, we're still looking to and analyzing the quiet quitting movement. Now a month later, I have a big problem is this in the country. I don't, I mean, I haven't really heard about it from companies. I know that it's being reported in the press. I've talked to a lot of companies in the country and I haven't heard about that. Certainly that's a concern if it continues on because when people hire people, they expect them to do a day's work for a day's pay. And I think that that's something that we have to continue and encourage. But when I talk, as I've gone around the country this last month and I've done a lot of trips, no company has approached me on this quiet quitting idea. And Secretary, I want to ask you about the real strike in which you intervened last month and helped avert that strike. That was sort of an 11-hour agreement. I know it was sort of a marathon process, right, of working through it with them. What are some of the lessons learned from that? For example, would you get involved earlier in the future to sort of not have a down-to-the-wire situation? If I'm asked to get involved earlier, I would certainly in the potent negotiation. I'm not involved at the table, but I certainly am talking to both sides to make sure that encouraging both sides, and they already asked them to encourage them to stay at the table and get this contract done. In the real strike, this was a two-year period that they weren't able to get an agreement where the president had to appoint an emergency board to come up with a P.E.B.",https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NDK8QAnFNxU,8,2022-10-07 14:23:15
2792," Strike, you know, this was a two-year period that they weren't able to get an agreement where the president had to appoint an emergency board to come up with a P.E.B. They came up with the recommendations and we built off of that. But certainly, you know, I think when you get to that point, there's a breakdown. So I've offered to anybody, anybody who wants if they want me to get involved or get us involved. But I think mediation is important as well. If you have two sides that kids can't get to an agreement, my recommendation is try and bring a mediator in. This is not to be me, but bring a mediator in. It's just to keep the conversation moving forward. And Labor Secretary, just while we have you, we do know that President Biden issued a presidential proclamation pardoning federal convictions for simple marijuana possession's offenses. These are people that have been barred in some cases from getting back into the workforce because of these convictions and offenses. Where will the Labor Department continue to do work at the state level, even, to ensure that there are opportunities for people to get occupations within the workforce? Yeah, we have to make sure what the President did yesterday is carried out. And too many of the people that are being pardoned by the President yesterday are people of color, and particularly the African-American community. And this has been the challenge in our country for a long time, where people were convicted of a minor marijuana offense that had a record. And I commend the President for his actions yesterday. And the folks that are out there, we're going to work with them to make sure that they can get into good employment, that this is not an impediment to their ability to get into the middle class and get a good paying job. U.S. Labor Secretary, Marty Walsh, pleasure to have you on the show. And thanks as always for taking the time. Thank you. You guys coming up.

2793," Here are some other headlines that we're watching right now. Bite Dance, the Chinese company that owns TikTok. So it's operating losses more than triple last year to $7 billion, according to a Wall Street Journal report. But Bite Dance produced an operating profit in the first quarter of 2022, signaling the company could be turning a quarter after years of losing money. The privately held company, Basin Beijing, has long closely guarded its finances. It doesn't share financial results publicly. This report, which the Wall Street Journal says, was shared internally with employees, covers the full years for 2020 and 2021, as well as that first quarter of this year. cryptocurrency exchange finance, temporarily paused its service yesterday due to a cyber attack, with hackers making off with an estimated $100 million worth of cryptocurrency. Nancy Yo, CZ Zhao tweeted this morning confirming the exploit on its cross-chain bridge and said that customer funds are safe. Cross-chain bridge hacks have become a top security risk recently. This incident is the latest in a recent rise in blockchain hacks. And Impossible Foods has laid off 6% of its workforce as part of the company's restructuring to focus on future growth, according to reports. CEO Peter McGinnis reportedly said in a memo that the reorganization has been the works for the past few months and has, quote, created clear supply and demand functions with an emphasis on research and development. Several employees will receive 12 weeks of salary, the folks who are leaving, plus an additional week for each year of tenure at the company and a one-year extension for exercising stock options. Socks? September was a rough month all around for stocks, and one company in particular saw a significant drop after withdrawing its 2023 forecast, something evolved, operating, and environment. We're talking about FedEx here, folks, and that's what Yelphine's Jarblickery joins us with today for another edition of Then and Now, Jarb. That's right. Let's turn the clock back to the 1970s where FedEx, where Federal Express got its start founded in 1971 in Little Rock, Arkansas. The company officially began operations out of Memphis in 1973, and fun fact, the name Federal Express, it actually came about because a founder hoped it would attract the business of the Federal Reserve. It always comes back to the Fed, doesn't it, guys? That original Memphis team consisted of fewer than 400 people, yet in its first night of operations, FedEx delivered 186 packages to 25 different countries. Or cities, excuse me, by 1975 FedEx started installing drop boxes, and we began accustomed to seeing those in businesses. The overnight letter was introduced in 1981, and by 1983 FedEx made American history by becoming the first company to make $1 billion in revenue within 10 years of startup, without mergers or acquisitions. In 1978, FedEx went public on the New York Stock Exchange under the ticker that we know FDX, and at IPO, at $24 per share, split adjusted, you got to divide by 32, it is 75 cents. Now, back to the present, we had that drastic mid-September drop of more than 20 percent, and now FedEx is trading around $155 per share, down more than 50 percent from its May 2021 record high, near $320 per share. So let's take a deep dive into where the company is right now. And on our Dow Jones heat map, actually this is a transports, Dow Jones transports, year to date, we can see FedEx down about 40 percent if we sort by performance. We can see kind of towards the downside, in fact only jet blue, not really appear, is down more than that, but you compare it to UPS, which is down 24 percent, and we do possibly have some execution issues. Now, Brian, I know that you've been really following FedEx, and especially it's, especially its guidance as of that last huge drop right here, and what it foretends for the earning season that we are about to jump into right now. Yeah, Jerry, you really got the sense, Alfred at FedEx, worrying that the economy is slowing down pretty sharply, but to your point, execution has been a big problem with this company, maybe to an extent that hasn't been seen over the prior 25 years. I got to tell you, you cover this space in these companies better than I do, and more closely, but I just know that FedEx kind of releases outside the normal earnings window, and perennially, quarter after quarter, they cite these dollar.",https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NDK8QAnFNxU,10,2022-10-07 14:31:37
2794," companies better than I do and more closely but I just know that FedEx kind of releases outside the normal earnings window and perennially quarter after quarter they cite these dollar effects problems and that's just not just this year this is going years back so I think there is a temptation to perhaps say that this is an idiosyncratic event this is particular to that company but you can't ignore the weight of the evidence with what we'll excuse me with what we've seen of the earnings and the projections for them that we've seen so far AMD the latest shot off the bow great work here uh... jarrely enjoy these and a lot of work goes into them thanks so much are Levi's the top training ticker on the alfine's platform this morning after cunning its outlook will go inside that outlook with Levi's cfo harmingt sing next g Leave I strut us out with the beat on earnings in its latest quarter. We're a stronger year's dollar, weakness in Europe and ongoing supply and change disruptions, let the jeans giant to cut its outlook. With more on this we have Harmeet Singh, Levi Strauss, CFO for more on this quarter. Harmeet, great to get some time with you. I want to go across the pond on Europe. I would say some surprising results at a Levi's Europe. That business, how it performs, sales and repression, that's a prize you? You know, as the high brand, good morning, as the quarter progressed it did surprise us. And as you know, we have a very strong brand. As you think about the quarter overall, our quarter was fairly solid, despite all the incremental headwinds who were up 7% in constant currency with BDPS. And the Levi's brand, just to the strongest quarter three revenues in a decade. And so as you think about our European business, the weather was fairly warm and the consumer there is under pressure.",https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NDK8QAnFNxU,11,2022-10-07 14:36:00
2795," And so as you think about our European business, the weather was fairly warm, and the consumer there is under pressure. And so what we did collectively as a team is we quickly geared up into action, and looked at discretionary costs. We focused on our direct to consumer business, because we have a diversified business model. They are parts of the world that are really strong, like Asia and Latin America, and they resisted strong growth. We also had some supply chain disruptions, especially in the US, which impacted the business. And so as we thought about the year, we said, okay, let's think about three things that impact the results. One is stronger dollar. The second is supply chain disruptions, and the third is softening consumer demand in the western part of the world. But if you think of Europe, Brian, there are parts of Europe that were fairly strong. UK and Spain were actually countries that grew. I think where we were softwares in Germany and France, the brand still fairly strong globally, as well as in Europe. When you talk about softening demand, Harmeet, is there a relative point that you think back to where this period is analogous to? You know, I would say, we've been as a company, we've been through good times and tough times. And I would say, as you think about softening demand, I was not here in 0809, but the financial crisis at that time did have an impact. As a company, our toughest period was during the pandemic, where all our stores were shut for about 90 days, and we lost a billion dollars just like that. But as a management team, and I'm really proud of the management team that's been around for a while, we actually geared up into action and said, okay, how do we manage through the crisis? But more importantly, how do we emerge stronger? And then in 2021, we registered our strongest financial year in a decade. So as we think about the next few quarters, and if things do tighten, that's what we're going to be doing. We're going to be thinking about, how do we manage through the immediate crisis, which isn't a near term. But as a company and a brand, we will get out of it and we get out of it stronger. Some of you that I invested in June, we laid out longer term targets. These are what we call not start targets. We still get to and focused and delivering them over the longer term and emerging out of this as a stronger company. I mean, I appreciate the focus on the longer term. I want more shorter term question, which is after the inventory build, which I believe was above 40% for the last quarter, are you putting things on sale? How are you guys planning to clear out that inventory? Yeah, so the inventory build has something that we have flagged externally as well as internally. So it's intentional in a way. It's basically comprised of three things. The third of the inventory growth is driven by the fact the last year was a very low base tight inventory. And the fact that inflation has increased the cost of inventory, a third is inventory that is driven by the fact that we're bringing, because of the longer lead times in supply chain, we're bringing stuff early and we're getting ready for our ERP installation in quarter two of next year. And a third is largely goods in transit. Two thirds of our inventory is core. So think the 501s, think the 511s. And we can carry that through multiple seasons. And so there's no reason to discount that. We don't have a lot of obsolete. Where we do have obsolete, we are discounting that so that we can clear it. But overall, if you think of our gross margins, our gross margins and Q3 were still, you know, 400 basis points higher than 2019. It dipped a little relative to last year, but that was, you know, largely driven by foreign exchange and a little bit more discounting. We do expect the holiday season to be a little bit more promotional. And we're going to balance growing revenue and discounting because the brands never been this strong. And that's, you know, evidence by the fact that Q3 revenues for a levi is the strongest in a decade for quarter three. When you acknowledge discounting, it's hard not to think.",https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NDK8QAnFNxU,12,2022-10-07 14:40:21
2796," who's for Levi's with the strongest in a decade for quarter three. When you acknowledge discounting, it's hard not to think about the strongest brands right now needing to move through inventory and plowing some of the promotional elements. And so when you think about the percentage of full price that's selling versus the percentage of what would actually be discounted during this period of time through the holiday season, and even perhaps thereafter as well, what does that breakdown really look like to you? Yeah, you know, still a lot of what we sell is on a full price basis. We had estimated that gross margins in the second half of the year, because we'd be selling more below full price, you know, would be impacted about 100 basis points. In quarter three, there was a little bit more, about 130, 140 basis points. We have built that into our guidance in Q4, but overall, we still think we'll end the year at about, you know, 400 basis points higher than 2019. And that just evidences the strength of the brand are AURs, for example, which is the average unit retail price in quarter three was still up in the mid to high single digit. That means pricing that we have taken to offset cost is ticking. And our revenues were up slightly, sorry, our unit growth was up slightly. So overall, the brand's really strong docker as we have diversified also grew a lot double digit. And beyond yoga is just starting. We just open our first store in Santa Monica in LA, and if that, you know, does well, then, you know, we can add a lot many stores in the active way segment. So overall, our business is fairly diversified, Brad. And our thinking is that we will, you know, you know, move through this promotional environment by ensuring that brand continues, brand equity continues to build. Hey, Harvey, it's Brian here again. You know, I'm a loyal Levi's consumer, but I don't know. I don't know if I'm buying these new baggy dad jeans that you're bringing to market. I don't know if you realize how strong I work for this physique and those pants are not going to show it off. I got to be honest with you. And, you know, the fact is that we are a democratic brand. We have something for everybody. So if the baggy dad, you know, jeez is not what you like to wear, it doesn't fit your style. You can wear the tapered look, you can wear the slimmer look. There is something for you, Brad and for everybody else, across all age demographics. You know, I'd Levi's and that's what, you know, we are proud to ensure that every consumer gets what he or she needs. Yeah, Brian, the size has got to rock the jorts to show off the gas. Also, the shoes got a sharp, the leg. I'm still the skinny, skinny jeans guy. I mean, you got to show off the glutes. You put that time in. I want to show him off for a nice, nice, nice pair of jeans. I don't know. I don't know. There's a little out of fashion here, so we'll take this offline. We'll take this offline. It's not only jeans that you can get from Levi's. You can get more of a head to toe look. I'm wearing a wonderful Levi's shirt, gives a casual look. Because we continue to bleed those becoming more casual. And the worst becoming more casual brands like ours that offer more of a head to toe look. You know, other ones that will eat the charge. Yes, no matter which of the numbers of the models that you wear on the bottom, I have to say we were expecting either the leather jacket or the jean jacket, Harmeet. So it's good to know you're still wrapping on top with the white shirt. Harmeet's saying great for catching up with the Levi's Strauss CFL. Thanks, Julie. Thanks.

2797," Drink and love. Stocks continue to push lower right now after we got that hotter than estimated, better than estimated jobs report, but that implies that the Fed is going to have no reason to stop raising rates in the short term if inflation, especially if inflation, keeps up as it has been. And indeed, we saw year over year average hourly earnings rising by 5% as part of the jobs report right now the NASDAQ leaving the declines down by more than 2.5% that is really characteristic of what we've seen as of late with big cap tech suffering on days like this. And as I just mentioned, indeed the jobs report showed continued strong employment. Let's take a front line look at those numbers and especially what it means for small businesses joining us now is John Waldman, home base founder and CEO, home base, which is a software platform for small businesses essentially manages time clocks, HR, etc. John, thanks for being here appreciate it. It's really interesting you guys did some recent survey work and you found 64% of the small businesses you talked to said their financial performance would be better a year from now than it is right now. That seems to fly in the face of everything a lot of what we're hearing right? Yeah, good morning, Julie. It's good to see you. So we did find that we serve over 100,000 small businesses we serve over 2 million workers. And when we surveyed those small businesses, they were in fact more optimistic now than they were over the summer by 6% edge points in terms of thinking about their expansion over the next year or two. Now that seems kind of weird in the face of everything that we're reading in the headlines. But when it comes to small businesses, you have to remember this is in the context of such a hard two and a half years, first with COVID and forced closures and then into this just truly dramatic labor shortage that they've been living through over the last year and a half. So it is actually great to see those signs of optimism from small businesses. What is the experience that you have with those small businesses in terms of how they are navigating this environment?",https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NDK8QAnFNxU,14,2022-10-07 14:49:07
2798," Great to see those signs of optimism from small businesses. What is the experience that you have with those small businesses in terms of how they are navigating this environment right now, especially as many of them are trying to best protect the business profitability while at the same time also trying to make sure that they are competitive with wooing the next generation of talent or just workers employees for their businesses? Yeah, I first as much as we've been talking about the labor shortage over the last year, I don't think we can talk about it. This is truly been an incredibly difficult thing for small businesses to deal with. And we see that on both sides. You have small businesses that are really healthy that can't expand in the way that they used to. You know, when we look at our data from across over 100,000 businesses, small businesses are not expanding at the rate that they were in 2019. On the flip side, it's actually gotten so bad that we've seen small businesses closed out because they can't hire. It was talking to one of our customers up in Seattle. Runs a restaurant, owns a restaurant that had been operating for 10 plus years and she shut it down, not because the demand wasn't there, not because of inflation. But because she could not hire people to work this business and she was tired. She and the other owners were tired of filling all the extra shifts. So this is real. This is a real challenge to small businesses. And if we're going to solve this, it's going to take a lot of different things, including making these jobs more attractive. John, have you had to slow hiring at home base? Yeah, that's a great question. But we like a lot of tech companies had to revisit some of our plans, hiring plans coming into this year. We haven't done a layoff or anything like that. But we certainly looked at next year and thought about our own, what can we do? How do we do more with less? You know, we see and our customers do in that for the last two years and we were asking ourselves the same question. So yeah, we slowed down our hiring plans. And John, what you just mentioned that Seattle anecdote is interesting to me because Seattle is one of the places that passed a minimum, a higher minimum wage, right? So you would think that among other things, higher wages would be getting those workers back in. Is it just not working like it used to in? If it's not, what are you hearing from your customers about why it's not? Yeah, well, we're hearing it from our customers and we're also hearing it from workers. I mean, we're serving two million plus workers and we're serving them regularly. Listen, you know, wages are always at the top of the list of things that hourly workers care about, but it's not the only thing that workers care about. And we're all staring at the same data on labor force participation and seeing that continue to take down. And I think we all have to take a hard look at this on how are we making these jobs more attractive? Wait rate is part of that and we have seen that go up with inflation. We have seen that go up in the job posts that are going out and the new hires that people are making through home base. We have a hiring tool that allows people to post jobs so we can see all of that data. But what we also see in talking to workers is it's not the only thing they care about. They care about flexibility. They care about their opportunity for learning and development. They care about the connection to the business and this is something that actually small businesses have a great advantage over larger businesses. And finally, John, full disclosure here, we were at a work dinner recently and I heard you talk about that this is not a short term problem that this sort of, especially entry level workforce is going to be a problem for. Decades, right? And I guess part of it has to do with population growth, but talk us through that. Yeah, we have been through a pretty traumatic, dramatic two and a half years in the labor market here. You know, we have seen millions of people die. We have seen immigration slow down. We have seen a lot of people leave the labor force. That is a pretty profound impact. But the net result of this of a labor shortage is not going away if you are reliant on entry level work. In 2027, we reach peak high school graduate in this country after that demographics are not on our side here for entry level work. But what that means is that the challenges that small businesses and every business are going through now.",https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NDK8QAnFNxU,15,2022-10-07 14:53:17
2799," After that, demographics are not on our side here for entry level work. What that means is that the challenges that small businesses and every business are going through now, we're going to be dealing with that for a long time. And so it comes back to how are we making these jobs more attractive? You know, there's only a couple solutions for this. Obviously, technology is one of them. How are solutions like us at home base helping teams do more with less? Obviously, immigration, but there's also labor force participation. So that's what we're really focused on. How do we make these jobs more attractive? How do we help small businesses recruit folks back into the labor force? Because ultimately, we're going to have to do that in the face of declining demographics. Absolutely. John Waldman, home base CEO and founder. Thanks so much for taking the time. Here with us this morning on Yahoo Finance. You guys coming up? The sequel of Knives Out is coming to the big screen. You've got the details on the other side. The short break. You hear the music. You know what time it is. Time for a couple of times. Two stories, one minute each. We start with this Netflix heads to the big screen. The sequel of Knives Out will be released in theaters for one week around Thanksgiving before debuting on the streaming platform. This is the first for the company which has long been against giving theaters and early release here. However, it's done tandem releases in the past. Mudbound was one of those theatrical productions that also released in tandem on Netflix. One of the first I believe they actually tested with that. Knives Out, I've seen the first one. I think this is so good. Yes. I'm excited about this. I don't know if that'll go and see it in the theater, but it's coming out one week. Right, exactly. So I don't know what the impetus is. Soz? Hey, if the James Bond guy's in an on-watchin' never heard of this thing before but of Daniel first, you never saw the last Knives Out? Never even heard of it. You guys see that. I'm excited about this. I like James Bond. I like Daniel Craig. He's a very far cry from James Bond in this movie. Let me just tell you that. I got you. Yeah. Yeah, definitely. Up. That was it. Okay, sauce. All right. Let's, I think I'm doing the attessa and trucks for the holidays.

2800," All right, let's, I think I'm doing the attessa and trucks for the holidays. Elon Musk says Tesla will deliver for semi truck ever to Pepsi Co in December. Pepsi ordered 100 trucks in 2017. Our production was expected to begin in 2019. And this is quite the truck. I remember when Tesla initially unveiled it, believe it, it's supposed to get 500 miles in a full charge. It is very, it is very intimidating looking truck. But I think really it's going to give a good snapshot to what is possible with electric trucking and how much perhaps more infrastructure charging infrastructure. We still need in this country. It's coming, but we still need it and we need it now. Yeah, and this not to be confused with the cyber truck that had a rock thrown at it and still had the window cracked. This is the semi version that Tesla back in 2017 had racked up early orders from the likes of JB Hunt, I believe it was Pepsi Walmart. They had some major purchase orders. Then it just came down to delivery. And at first I believe that timeline was more closer to 2020 that eventually got pushed out. Yeah, and the cyber truck VT's was coming too. So that's, there was also a little, a little bit of baby news on that, I guess. All right, coming up in the next hour, you got lots more jobs coverage coming your way. Even as we watch the markets go down, we will all be back in the same location on Monday as we will see whether this selling continues. I hope it's not Nikis. Yeah. Let's do that. All right. Welcome to Yahoo Finance. It's 11 a.m. in New York City. I'm Jared Blickery and here's what I am watching today.

2801," Finance, it's 11 a.m. in New York City. I'm Jared Blyckery and here's what I am watching today. Good news is bad news. Stocks slump as a jobs report misses expectations, but it's a lower unemployment rate that gives the Fed more food for thought. It may be space to hike further. The housing market increasingly looks like the first dominant of fall amid declining prices and rising mortgage rates. We're gonna speak with the wet bush securities analysts on the outlook for home builders. And could President Biden's move on marijuana change lives and will it impact his standing ahead of the midterms? We're gonna take a look at the stocks moving in that space. But first, let's take a look at the stocks after that jobs report. And this is a big one of the week here. And we can see the Dow, well, let's take a look. The Dow down just slightly here. Looks like it's off about 407 points. Maybe a little bit more than slightly. We got the Nasdaq down about two and a half percent and the S&P 500 down 1.8%. Now the bond market, another story guys. We've seen a lot of volatility in this space. Let's see if we can get some quotes here. We got the 10 year up to 3.89%. And that is a six basis point move. We got the five year at 4.13% in the 30 year at 3.86%. And we wanna get more on the market with, yeah, who finances in S foray. And in S, you are watching the report. You are charting the reaction to it live on the Wi-Fi interactive, you know, men's work by the way. You know, people's work, let me get. What are some of the numbers sticking out to you after we've had the opportunity to dig into the report? Well, I think that wage gains are still too hot. Even though wage gains came down from August, so which was 5.2 to 5%. That is still too hot. That is to say that the Fed has run way to continue hiking rates. And that's why you saw the market reaction. I also thought it was interesting. The number of people who are employed part time for economic reasons. And we've got that number there on a chart for you. And this has seen a decline for the third straight month. So these are individuals that would have preferred to work full time, but they're working part time because either their hours got cut or because they're unable to find full time work. So that number is declining. Again, assign that the labor market while it may be softening a bit, it is still not softening enough for the Fed to pivot. All right, thank you for that report here in S. And we want to continue the labor market discussion and conversation. Check on the roads ahead for the U.S. economy. And for that, we have Gus Vosher, joining us now, PNC Financial Services Group, Chief Economist. And let me just ask you your initial reaction to the report, Gus, and then anything that sticks out to you. Yeah, so this is a good report. The Fed wants to see slower job growth. I think they prefer to even see even slower job growth in this. But certainly we have seen job growth slow over the course of 2022 is the Fed has raised rates. And that should allow the labor market to cool off as we head into 2023. All right. And then we were just listening to it. And as give some of the statistics, so when you dig into the report, some of the demographic breakdowns may surprise people, maybe some reversals and trends, what did you pick out? Well, certainly we saw the labor force participation rate decline. That's bad news from the Fed's perspective. They want to see more people looking for work. Instead, we saw fewer people. And so that means a tight labor market. And so that makes it more difficult for the Fed means they may have to raise rates a bit more. On the other hand, we did see a bit softer wage growth down to, it slowed to 5% year over year, still higher than the Fed would like, but that's moving in the right direction. So what I think is we are seeing a cooling off in the labor market, but it remains too hot from the Fed's perspective. And they're going to need to raise rates more to cool off some of those inflationary pressures we're seeing in the economy right now. And I've heard some economists calling this report a Goldilocks report. You look at the stock reaction, definitely to the downside, but maybe that's the bad news as good news here, because the Fed doesn't want to see stock prices go up. As some of the, I believe it was, New Calcash Cari said definitively over a month ago, what are we to make of this in light of the bad news as good news as bad meme? And that kind of confuses people, especially some of us in the business sometimes. Yeah, so what we want is job growth that is slowing to a more sustainable pace. So even over the last.",https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NDK8QAnFNxU,18,2022-10-07 15:06:32
2802," plus in the business sometimes. Yeah, so what we want is job growth that is slowing to a more sustainable pace. So, you know, even over the last three months, we've added about 370,000 jobs per month on average. The labor force just simply can't support that. So we need to see much slower job growth that's consistent with underlying growth in the population where not there yet, we're moving in the right direction. So, you know, obviously if we're adding a lot of jobs in the economy, that means more income, that means more consumer spending, but at the same time it's contributing to high inflation. So what we want is okay news from the job market, not good news, but, you know, indications that job growth is slowing and that, you know, we are reaching an equilibrium where those wage pressures in the economy are lessening. And how about the other part of the Fed's mandate inflation? So we have maximum employment, stable prices, interpreted to mean 2% inflation, obviously far above that. But what are you expecting out of some of the readings? And how does that fit into the expectations? Everybody waiting with baited breath for that eventual Fed pivot? Yeah, no, we are starting to see inflation slow. I think it peaked over the summer. Obviously we've seen a big drop in energy prices, although we'll have to see what happens with the new OPEC production cuts. Wage growth is slowing, so that should help bring down inflation. It's gonna be difficult. You know, we probably won't see that 2% inflation until some time in early 2024, but we are moving in the right direction. I think the Fed wants to see both a slowing in the job market and indications that inflation is moving decisively towards 2% before they stop raising rates. I don't think that'll be some time until early in 2023. So, you know, if the Fed is gonna be looking at the data as they come in and we need to see that slowing in inflation and slower job growth that the Fed is going to let up. And you mentioned the energy market before. I'm stirring it at WTI crude prices at above $91 per barrel. And it was about a week or two ago that it seemed to be about $8 fewer than that. And I'm just wondering, what do the current energy prices say to you? There are people hoping that there would be some mitigation to help out the consumers here, but we had OPEC plus step in, reduce their outlook or reduce what they say they're going to pump by 2.1 million barrels per day. They're already in deficit. What are you making of the energy market and its effect on the US economy here? Yeah, so obviously the OPEC production cuts are not good news for oil prices, for inflation in the United States. That being said, a lot of OPEC members were already below their quotas. And so I don't think we're gonna see is, you know, that 2.1 barrel per day cut. But I think we, you know, we're going to get less help on inflation from lower energy prices. But I think the other impacts of the Fed rate heights in terms of a slowing in job growth, a slowing in demand for consumer durables, that type of thing, that will help reduce in those inflationary pressures we're seeing in the economy, even if OPEC keeps production low. Even if lots of ifs in this business here appreciate your insights on this jobs. Friday, Gus Foshet, PNC Financial Services Group, Chief Economist. All right, not the kind of cut you want. Let's take a look at these shares of Levi Strauss, the stock looks like it's down 9% and that's after the clothing company beat earnings estimates, although reporting a mis one revenue, Levi noting continued supply chain disruptions primarily in the U.S., and that's resulting in estimated miss sales of approximately 30 to 40 million dollars. Now we spoke with Levi Strauss, the CEO, earlier today, and here's what he had to say about the company's road ahead. Let's take a listen. But the next few quarters, and if things do tighten, that's what we're going to be doing. We're going to be thinking about how do we manage through the immediate crisis, which is in the near tail. But as a company and a brand, we will get out of it and we get out of it stronger. Now a fairly positive reaction from Levi's CFO, we're going to have to wait and see how things eventually shake up for the jeans giant, and tell you what, coming up after this collateral damage, the Fed might bring down the housing market to its knees in order to tame inflation, but does that mean a full-on crash? We're going to take a look at the investment picture for home builders next.",https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NDK8QAnFNxU,19,2022-10-07 15:10:45
2803," We're going to take a look at the investment picture for home builders next. We're going to take a look at the investment picture for home builders. We're going to take a look at the investment picture for home builders. We're going to take a look at the investment picture for home builders. We're going to take a look at the investment picture for home builders. Welcome back. You can call it the perfect storm for the housing market with high mortgage rates, a hawkish fed and recession on the horizon. The last time home prices fell this quickly was during the global financial crisis. And though home prices have fallen from peaks and most major US cities, they're still some way above the 2019 levels. But home builder sentiment has been downed dwindling. So what does the demand picture look like and what's the investment argument? Let's get into that conversation with Jamie Canless, Wedbush Securities Senior Vice President of Equity Research. Let me just ask you the headline question here. What are we to make of the latest data here and with these soaring prices and home affordability in the crosshairs? Good morning, thanks for having me. Longer term, I think the picture for shelter demand, whether that's for sale housing, for rent housing or multi-family for rent, we still think is very strong. And you look at rent growth, double-digit percentages up pretty much the entire year for single-family and for multi-family. And what we're hearing from the builders is that even with these higher mortgage rates, if they can find a way to get to the affordable payment, whether it's a function of buying down the rate a little bit, maybe taking a little bit off the base price of the home, if they can solve for that monthly payment that the buyer needs, then the buyer is still willing to purchase the home. We think also the demographic tailwind of the millennials that are strongly fully-in-household formation phase right now, along with the Gen Zs, which is also a very large population demographic. There's lots of people.",https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NDK8QAnFNxU,20,2022-10-07 15:14:25
2804," the millennials that are strongly fully in household formation phase right now, along with the Gen Z, which is also a very large population demographic. There's lots of tailwinds out there, but I think near term, you're absolutely right. This is a much trickier environment that I think the builders would have expected, especially given how strong the beginning of the year was. And there's almost a substitution effect going on that I've been able to glean from your nose, correct me if I'm wrong, but given the fact that there's not as much demand perhaps for new homes for people to buy rental properties, we're seeing a surge in demand as those as people are forced to pay a shallot money for rent instead of a mortgage. How are those trends looking? They're actually looking pretty good. And what we've heard from our home builders is that you're not going to completely replace consumer demand with the demand from the single family and the builder rent landlords, but it is a more affordable option for people. And it also for my home builder or for the home builders recover, I can give them an option to be able to sell maybe some homes that they couldn't have sold in this mortgage rate environment. So I think I'm going to fully replace the consumer, but yes, I think the demand for housing, rental housing especially is out there and it's providing affordable housing for the consumer, but also means of selling some homes that the builders have maybe built an expectation, the consumer wanting them and now they're going to sell it to these institutional landlords. Either way, it's the emergence of this new fire class over the last decade. I think it's been a win-win for both consumers as well as the building industry. That's interesting. When you say fire, talk about finance and insurance real estate, I believe, just in terms of input costs, we can look at the materials and we can get into lumber price, we can also get into wages that are paid. And I think that's appropriate to talk about because we just got a bunch of data this morning from the BLS on the job front, how about these sources of costs for these businesses? So for the, our thesis around the jobs that as long as we're seeing some type of continued job creation that is going to be good for demand, good for the industry because typically job growth leads us into recovery and job declines typically proceed tougher times for the builders. So good to see that we are still growing the jobs picture. In terms of input costs, what we've seen is that lumber prices, which have been extremely volatile for most of COVID, actually had a pretty benign quarter, this past quarter in the third quarter, lumber prices, framing prices are down about 15%. So if you think about a little bit of a tailwind there from from lower lumber costs, helping to offset some of the costs that the builders are having to pay to buy down mortgages and maybe cut prices a little bit. So a little bit of relief in a tougher environment. And then from on the wage front, what we've seen is that affordability up until this meteoric rise and mortgage rates from 3% 18 months ago to nearly 7% I think this morning is where they're sitting. Even with wage growth that we've seen out there, it's hard for affordability to keep up when you see that type of meteoric surge and mortgage rates. Yes, and let's get into some of the investment opportunities for people in the audience. You have a couple of names that I'm interested in going over. Green Break Partners, Builders for Source, Building Products, Masonite, any of those names you care to describe here and what you're seeing in those stocks. Yeah, absolutely. So Green Break, we have a new trading on it. But if you think about where some of the pain has been in housing, we've seen I think a little bit more of it outweft. Green Break actually does the majority of their business in Atlanta and Dallas, which are two markets that have held up pretty well and haven't really felt some of the effects of layoffs on the tech sector or the tech sector like a Raleigh in an Austin felt. So we're new traded on that name, but I think if you're trying to avoid some of the trouble spots in housing right now, Green Break is an interesting name. Builders for Source is a company that supplies lumber and other products that go into the home. They're about 10% of the domestic building products market now. The decline that we saw in lumber prices has passed quarter. Typically is not as good for them, but if you think about their ability to grow more.",https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NDK8QAnFNxU,21,2022-10-07 15:19:18
2805," market now. The decline that we saw in lumber prices has passed quarter. Typically is not as good for them, but if you think about their ability to grow market share and get bigger in this environment, especially because they don't just sell to single-family builders. They also sell to multi-family, selling to commercial, which we've seen commercial construction spending actually start to rebound over the last six months. So even though they may be a little bit slower to man for their single-family product, they do have other avenues that they can sell into. We're going to have to leave it there, but appreciate your insights into the housing and construction markets. Jay McCannless, White Bush, Security, and Senior Vice President of Equity Research. It's been a struggle guarding against inflation over the last year. Don't we know that crypto hasn't seen or hasn't been the hedge that some thought it could be. Gold is face, headwinds from the sky high US dollar and real estate is a long-term play. Then there's inflation protected government debt like tips and I bonds, which operate differently, but both and to guard you from asset price erosion on the ladder now, since the rate jumped up at the end of last year. There have been over $27 billion in I bond sales, but is the market still hot? Joining us to discuss is Yahoo! Finance is Carrie Hanon. Now, how is this market looking right now because I need some inflation protection? How can we get in on this? We all do. And specifically looking at I bonds. This is the time to buy it. It's safe, not sexy, right? These are backed by the US government. So you're guaranteed to get your investment back. They follow inflation. The rate is adjusted twice a year in November and may loosely based on the consumer price index. And there's a formula that they use, but that's the main one. Now, this is important to talk about right now because we're coming up on the adjustment in November. So if you buy these bonds between now and the end of October, they're paying 9.62%. Now, the experts I spoke to expect in November this to drop down to about 6%, they'll announce that probably around October 13th. There's some great things about this investment, but of course there are some limitations. I think it really is a smart idea for many people to set a little aside here. But here are the caveats that you need to know. There is a $10,000 limit each year. You can play around with that. There are a few ways to bump that up, but essentially it's $10,000. You can't buy these I bonds in your retirement accounts, right? So you can't buy it in your 401K or for your IRA, that sort of thing. This is for cash. You have other savings, right? And you need to hold it for at least one year before you cash it out. And if you cash it out before five years, you'll lose a little bit of the interest. So it's not as liquid as some investments might be, but my goodness. It's really a nice, safe opportunity that I think it's worth taking a look at right now and how we approach this thing. So those are just a couple of the caveats. Treasury direct. This is a do-it-yourself kind of thing. You go right to the US Treasury Department, to their Treasury Direct and set up an account right there. And you can get rolling again. There are ways that you can bump it up maybe by using this. You can buy gifts for your children, nice holiday gifts, and have that $10,000 amount as well. All right. If I'm buying these as gifts, is the recipient going to get some tax benefits? That's my way of backing into the next question. I want to, well, if I can reduce my tax bill at the end of the year or in April of next year, I'm all about that. Yeah, actually, this is a great investment for this reason. The interest paid out is free from state and local taxes. Now, federal tax does apply. But again, there are ways if you cash out and you redeem your bond for higher education costs, there is a way that you can save some on the taxation from a federal perspective. But it has to be for higher education costs. And you can find all those details on the Treasury Direct site in order to make sure you've got it all straight. And we know you also write about this for us here at Yahoo Finance and the Benefit of our Viewers. And thank you for that report, Carrie Hannan. All right. Time and far for our chart of the day.

I'm just gonna say what everybody's thinking we need fewer jobs we need to hire unemployment rate all the analysis I'm seeing about the September jobs rates as basically all shocks we thought we were hoping unemployment would go up and we thought the jobs number would be lower and why does everybody want that to happen. So the Federal Reserve has a reason to us.,https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NDK8QAnFNxU,23,2022-10-07 15:27:48
2807," thought we were hoping unemployment would go up and we thought the jobs number would be lower. And why does everybody want that to happen? So the Federal Reserve has a reason to slow down its interest rate hikes, but with 263,000 new jobs slower than we've seen earlier this year, but still pretty strong, very tight job market. Everybody now is almost certain the Fed's going to hike another 75 basis points or three quarters of a point in November. So you know, puzzle this one out, we get a pretty good jobs report and the stock market falls by nearly 2%. That's the kind of fun house economy we're in. I think a lot of people just wish, could we get through the slowdown and the job market we need to get inflation under control and get to the other side of this? We're just not there yet. No, we are not. But let's move on to something that we are near and that is towards a potential pardon by lots. Let's say anybody who's been convicted on possession of marijuana, at least at the federal level, with encouragement by Joe Biden for the states to do something similar. Now, cynics are going to say, well, we're a month away from the midterm elections. Others saying this is really too little too late, but very welcome nonetheless. You're take? Well, it could be too little too late and it could be political, but it still might be a smart thing for Biden to do. So important to point out, as you said, Jared, he is partening people convicted for marijuana, simple marijuana possession at the federal level. Most people who've been prosecuted for pot possession, that happens at the state level or the local level. So this will not affect most people who have those types of convictions on their record or who might actually be in jail for the time being. But you're right, Biden, you know, it's an important symbolic move. And here's the politics of it. About two-thirds of Americans now say marijuana should be legal. We're seeing many states legalize marijuana. It's destigmatized and so forth. It's not really considered a social problem anymore. And Biden's giving a nod to that. But marijuana prosecutions largely affect minorities, minority populations. And because we're our month away from the midterms, this clearly is a signal to Biden to try to get some of those. People get out and vote. This also comes after he canceled a lot of student debt. So young people tend to favor forgiveness of marijuana offenses more than older people. So Biden is trying to appeal to younger voters and minority voters and not just get them to vote Democrat, but get them to vote at all because turnout is going to be a big issue in the midterm elections. Rick, I got to call our attention here to the Wi-Fi interactive where I'm looking at our cannabis heat map. And actually as you see cannabis stocks off, we see till-rate down 14% here. Let me show you the two-day because we were looking at some monster gains yesterday. So net net we're still up, but really volatile price action here. Just wanted to bring that to everybody's attention. And I want to say thank you for that report, Rick Newman. All right, coming up, let's see. We got another blow. You can add $570 million to the crypto hack ledger as a finance back token becomes the latest victim. We discussed that and we'll hear from Lisa's crypto girl.

The S&P 500 is I'm looking at the Wi-Fi Interactive Off 2% the Nasdaq down nearly 3% right now and it is the energy market that is in the green and nothing else. Look at tech. That is down 3.25% followed by consumer discretionary and communication services. Looking at the bond market we have the 10-year Tino yield that is up by about five basis points. Rounding it out, I'm not going to call this a Goldilocks report. We'll leave that for some of the commentators. Another major hack in the world of crypto. Gen Sean Burger has the details and Gen we see these things pop up from time to time. And we have yet another one. What are the details? Hey there Jared that's right good morning to you. Binance's BNB chain is back up and running after a hacker made off with roughly 2 million in BNB tokens after exploiting a vulnerability in that network. Those tokens worth roughly $570 million were targeted by an attacker late Thursday. Binance CEO CZ saying that he thinks that only 100 million was actually stolen and BNB chain tweeting that 7 million of those assets were indeed frozen. Now CZ writing in a tweet quote an exploit on a cross chain bridge BSC token hub resulted in extra BNB. We have asked all validators to temporarily suspend BSC. The issue is contained now your funds are safe. We apologize for the inconvenience so called cross chain bridges are tools that allow the transfer of tokens from one blockchain to another that BNB chain was targeted enabling hackers to move tokens off the network. The company reportedly saying it had worked with network validators essentially people who confirm transactions on the blockchain to pause creation of new blocks and then suspending all transaction processing while that team of developers investigated. The breach take a look at that BNB token this morning it's down roughly about 3.5% Jared. 100 million 570 million pretty soon we're talking about real Satoshi's thank you for that.

More on that let's bring in visa ahead of crypto Kai Sheffield a Kai tell us about this partnership now that you have with FTX please. Thanks for having me and so we think this is a big deal for the crypto industry really moving from just speculation and trading to utility when you have one of the leading global exchanges and FTX working with visa to make it easy for consumers to spend.",https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NDK8QAnFNxU,25,2022-10-07 15:36:37
2809," came from just speculation and trading to utility when you have one of the leading global exchanges and FTX, working with Visa to make it easy for consumers to spend from a balance held on their platform at any of the 80 million merchants across the world that accept Visa. So we're incredibly excited to work with them. All right, and let me ask you about the price of Bitcoin itself. It seems like it's been floundering around $20,000 here. I'm not asking you for a one year prediction or an end-of-year prediction, but just in general, with the price of crypto assets depressed as we've seen them, maybe perhaps in a crypto winter, how has Visa been using this space to maybe institutionalize, build out its institutional base here for its customers? Yeah, I think regardless of the price of any asset on any day, we're seeing continued interest from consumers, as well as from entrepreneurs and builders and developers that are coming into the space. And we think increasingly, it's developers that are going to build the future of payments. And so we're using this time to really look at how can we help partner with them and help them access our network to build new payment products on top of these technologies. And Kai, I'm going to play Devils Advocate here because when we think about crypto and the original white paper going back to 2009, I believe it was, and the D5 movement that is decentralized finance, it was huge, it seems like a year or two ago, everybody was becoming a Bitcoin maximalist, we're a D5 maximalist, and there was supposed to be a new regime. And yet we've seen a lot of traditional finance takeover roles here. We're talking about Visa, a traditional financial finance company here. How does crypto fit into the trad-fi space and has anything fundamentally changed over the last few years? Yeah, we see decentralization as more of a spectrum rather than a binary. And we think it takes both worlds coming together for payment products to be built that can serve mainstream consumers. And so a lot of the consumers' emergence, they don't have an ideological bet around the underlying technologies that they use. They just want seamless, convenient experiences to store the value that and spend the value that they have. And so we think that this is really the next phase for the industry is having traditional networks working together with leading platforms like FTX. And when it comes to the actual use of crypto as payments and the traditional payment system, we haven't really seen full adoption just yet, even in countries like El Salvador where there's a huge government push, just how do you see this rolling out in the adoption cycle? We see a lot of opportunity for stablecoins. And I think when you combine stablecoins with global networks like Visa, it really opens up a number of new payment flows like remittances and cross-border payouts. Where now you can have a consumer that can receive a remittance cross-border, but then they can offer it by spending at any merchant down the street. So we think you kind of have to have both, but there's clear demand for these dollar digital currencies. And we think we can make them as easy to spend as any other currency that consumers use today. And you're gonna get some guidance by the Federal Reserve probably by 2030 or last a little bit of a joke there. I wanna go back actually to your rollout. Now this is a program that is being rolled out in 40 countries across Latin America, Europe and Asia, Latin America is first. We've seen big adoption there for various reasons. I don't think it's surprising or coincidental that there are huge inflation rates in a lot of these countries. But what's your experience and what's your decision at Visa and why Latin America first? Yeah, I think FTX has been excited about opportunities to bring, they have a card program live today in the US. They wanna bring it to new markets and markets that are growing very quickly for them. And I think it's very clear that there is demand for dollars outside the United States and stablecoins can become a way that people can access dollars now through the FTX card. They have a way to spend those dollars. And so we're seeing a lot of interesting growth in that market across the Latin American region. All right, we're gonna leave it there. Visa's head of crypto, Kai Sheffield. Thank you for showing us your face today. And coming up odds of a 75 basis point hike from the Fed.

As a labor market cools, some companies ease a pace of hiring to cut costs and others found it easier to hire as more people look to get into the workforce. It's small business owners, they're falling behind, who finances Danny Romero has that story, Danny, the details, please. Yeah, so small business owners are really struggling to find labor. I spoke with a small business owner here in New York City and she tells me that she's had to now hire high school students. Young as 17 years old, she says that these challenges have really prompted her to come up with creative ways to incentivize these students. Not pay them, excuse me, she feeds them two to three times a day. Teenagers eat a lot, I know this, I was once very a very large teenager. Buies groceries for them, buys them footwear, uniform, and not only that, but she's also even thrown in free movie tickets at times. She's also increased her pay about 10% for her staffing. So she is really doing anything and everything and she's not the only one. I also spoke with a franchisee owner who sells custom made tires and he tells me that the common question that he's getting from candidates is, can I do this job remotely? Tires, yes. Okay, got it. And he was telling me that it is nearly impossible for him to have a remote style business model for what he does. And so, you know, another stark data point is that from the National Federation of Independent Business found that.",https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NDK8QAnFNxU,27,2022-10-07 15:44:52
2811," motestyle business model for what he does. And so, you know, another stark data point is that from the National Federation of Independent Business found that nearly half of small businesses couldn't hire enough workers in September. And over 23% of available positions went unfilled. That is a 48 year high. So yes, data does suggest that there is a cool off in the labor market, but these smaller firms are really feeling the pinch Jared. Higher wages, all these incentives, free food. There's no free lunch, but the free food, free movie passes. This is expensive. We're experiencing inflation. So how are businesses dealing with these cost increases? Yeah. So inflation still remains a big challenge for these small business owners. You know, prices have gone up across the board. And so, for example, eggs are nearly 80% above what they were last year. So some of these business owners are actually had to take on more debt in order to stay afloat. So not a really pretty picture for Main Street right now. All right. Thank you for delivering that report. And we want to stick with the housing market here. So the labor market might be showing some signs of cooling, but there are pockets of the economy that are still proving fairly resilient. Specialty trade contractors added 18,000 jobs in September. That is one area of the workforce that has been battling with a shortfall of skilled talent and older workers eyeing the exit. Boston based company Forge is looking to change that by making the career path more accessible. It's CEO Mark Hasdorf joins me now. And Mark, just wondering what you're seeing in the latest numbers that we got from the BLS this morning on the jobs front? Yeah, Jerry, thanks for having me on. I think the latest numbers are really interesting and really unsurprising in many ways. I think what's more interesting is we've been running out of people on the trades for almost 30 years now. And the average age of people on the trades has been rising for 30 years. It's past 46 years old. The average age of only tuition is 60 now. The jobs report and what we're seeing is kind of a culmination of a huge macro trend in the economy and it's only getting worse right now. Mark, let's dig into that macro trend. I've noticed anecdotally myself and you can probably back this up with your expertise and actual data. But when the federal government started guaranteeing student loans way back, what was it the late 2000s, the odds 2008, 2009, 10, I noticed among people some of my peers, their kids weren't necessarily going into these trade schools. They were very geared and put into colleges because of those easier borrowing costs. I'm just wondering, are we seeing a shift as a result of the pandemic or maybe we're seeing a reversal of that or we're seeing people opt for these trade schools instead of that four year degree? Yeah, well, I can definitely tell you, although there is a stigma in the trades and it's been harder and harder to get young people to go into it, we run a paid apprentice program where we bring people in, we pay them to learn, we're getting hundreds of applicants for every single program. We run programs of 12 people, so I can tell you at least here in Boston, there's a lot of young people that would love a debt free career working with their hands. There's just not that many on-ramps to get into the trades for people today. And is there any sort of public-private partnership we know that these tend to accelerate interest in a lot of these programs, anything you can take advantage for better or worse in that field? Yeah, I think as part of the infrastructure package that was passed a few months ago by the Biden administration, there's absolutely workforce development dollars available. We got a small grant from Massachusetts as they look to bring more and more people into the trades. Without some kind of public partnership, public-private partnership, we're not gonna have anyone to rebuild this country in another decade. So I think something has to be done in the administration's well aware at this point. And when we get back to the university versus a trade school kind of debate here, what does it look like in terms of cost? What does somebody potentially save by going to a trade school over a four-year university? Well, so with forage, they save a lot, right? If we just kind of average out the average university education of $100,000 and say people start earning when they're 22, 23 years old, we pay people $15 an hour to do nothing but learn. When they graduate, we give them a W2 job and start them out at...",https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NDK8QAnFNxU,28,2022-10-07 15:49:42
2812," who 23 years old, we pay people $15 an hour to do nothing but learn. When they graduate, we give them a W2 job and start them out at just about a $50,000 income with health insurance. And they can start that at 18, 19 years old and we can get people to a six figure income under a decade. So I think the mantra that you have to go to college to make money is actually not true anymore and there's a ton of amazing jobs out there that lead to a six figure income in the trades. And we have a minute left here. I'll give you the floor. Anything you will, anything else that you'd like to say to our viewers? Sure. I think that, you know, we talked about the odds and some of the ships that happened then. I think what's really interesting to me is I've talked to older people in the trades. If you go back to the 50s, a doctor, a lawyer, an electrician, a plumber, they went to the same bar, they went to the same church, they were all in the Rotary Club, they were all peers, they were all master crafts people. And that really started to change in the late 1960s with the push to send everyone to college. We have to change that in America. Being in the trades is a respected thing. You create an enormous amount of value. You're rebuilding this country and Ford really hopes that we can be a big part of that going forward. One more reason to support your point. Arguably, we have too many lawyers just going to throw that out there. Ford CEO and founder of Mark Cazdorf, Cort Mark Cazdorf, excuse me, thank you for joining us today. All right, it looks like we want to take a quick check of the markets here, still seeing a down day on Wall Street. Looks like the Dow is off nearly 500 points a little bit more than last time. S&P 500 off about 1% actually a little bit more than 2% and the NASDAQ really leading the way down. That's off 345 points. Coming up ahead of schedule, it wasn't expected to happen this year, but Tesla's semi-trucks will be rolling out for Pepsi in December. Should Elon Musk thank the inflation reduction act? That's up next.",https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NDK8QAnFNxU,29,2022-10-07 15:53:55
2813," MUSIC Welcome back. Tesla founder Elon Musk tweeted out last night that the company has started production of its long, awaited, all-electric semi-truck and will make its first deliveries to Pepsi Co in December for more on the story we bring in Yago Finance's prize Supermanian Yago Finance's senior auto correspondent to break down this latest news and we didn't know this was coming this early. We saw the truck, we saw the we saw it break slightly in the demonstration but this big honking semi going to be rolled out by the end of the year. Is this just another one of those dates that we expect to be postponed or is this for real? Yeah, you know, welcome news for people that are looking forward to the semi-truck. Is it an Elon distraction here? I don't know, but because it kind of came out of nowhere. He had mentioned that the truck would go into production soon. We first saw it in 2017. So it's been over almost five years and now he's starting production and it will be delivered to Pepsi on the first of December. I reached out to Pepsi to get Con we haven't heard back from him yet but it's still a big deal for Tesla to get the semi out there. It's a big space, right? There's a lot of competition there between like Dymler and Volvo and even Nikola, right? So it's good that this truck's out there now and it's going to be some big tax incentives too. So you want Elon to push that out so fast? Well, you know, it's interesting too because Elon Musk has to raise potentially hundreds of millions of dollars just because of the higher interest rate environment. We know that he has to finance that Twitter purchase. Some people are estimating billion dollars, billions of dollars that have to be raised for this. Meanwhile, Tesla is still worth as much as the entire European banking sector. So he does have a lot of collateral there. He has a lot of stock that he could sell. Just wondering if you're a take on all of this and how it might fit together. You know, it's funny. The market is valuing the electric kind of first-movers so highly, so richly. We saw also Porsche now worth more than Volkswagen, which spun that out a few weeks ago. So you're seeing that market really reward that here. One thing I want to note though back to the truck stuff is that there's going to be this $40,000 incentive for purchasers of these trucks class eight electric vehicles. That's a big deal. You couple that with the, on the production side, the battery incentives, incentives are kind of bringing on the cost about a third. So you can see why this truck stuff is so huge. And companies that are involved with that could be kind of like a play here potentially for people looking to sell HSBC and getting to New York as level C. Well, hey, with all those rebates or credits or what have you, if December is in fact a delivery date for a bunch of these, well, then they go on this year's book. So it could be in advance, or it could be kind of a gaming and the accounting. But hey, if they get those trucks out there on the road, I'd be interested to see one as well. So for a minute here, you talked about that Porsche spin-off from Volkswagen. How is that going in anything else in the EV space that you're looking at here? Well, it sounds like the Porsche spin-off has gone quite well. The stock was up a lot yesterday. I think today must be down. But it seems like the market is rewarding that Porsche is going to have some more information on their electric platform. They're making a new platform where they can actually build a lot of these cars modulately like on this electric PPE platform. So we're going to see more about that. I think they're kind of set up there for this next transition, especially in Europe where we're talking about companies with slow growth and not much hype. Porsche was a huge story for that, not only IPO market, but also the European equity market, too. Yeah, I know. Porsche was a huge IPO for them. Just haven't heard a lot. For that matter, we haven't seen a lot of IPOs in the US this year either. All right. Thank you for that report. Pros, supermanian, got to say goodbye to you. Before we say goodbye to everybody else here, we want to recap those jobs numbers that we got this morning. As you can see on your screen, we got 263,000 jobs handily beating the Wall Street estimate of 255,000 that critical unemployment rate that the Fed maybe wants to see edge higher. Guess what? It's lower now, 3.5% versus 3.7% expected. And then 5%. That is the average hourly earnings. Your over your came in as expected, but still relatively high. Now we want to get a check out the markets where we are seeing on the Yagel Finance Interactive Nasdaq down 3%. Let's take a look at the weekly totals right now. Over the last five days, you can see that line. It wasn't the green quite a bit now a little bit less, but still looking at gains of 1.5% for the week. Let's take a look at the Dow as well. We can see that is low.",https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NDK8QAnFNxU,30,2022-10-07 15:58:27

Let's take a look at the Dow as well. We can see that is looking like it will end the week two and a half percent up. And let's get a check of the S&P 500. That is up 2% this trailing five days. That's going to do it for us right now. You can check me out on Monday morning and for more we're going to be on later this afternoon. Have a great weekend. We're going to be on Monday.

2815," A23, what are some of the major revenue obstacles you and the team are up against for next year? Look, we see opportunity. We don't look at revenue as being an obstacle. We have the youngest fleet in the industry. We have a sizable yet nimble fleet. When we look at our demand picture, our demand continues to be very, very strong. Even against the backdrop of a lot of different world events, economic events, our customer tends to be a higher level customer than that of our peers. So while not insulated from any sort of recession area issues or economic malaise, our customers tend to be more insulated and more resilient from that. So we don't look at as revenue opportunities as being obstacles. We see many opportunities. And that's really been demonstrated when you look at our first half and our second quarter pricing. I think if I recall correctly, on our first half, our net per diems were up 18%. And yes, I said 18%. And if you look at our peers for the first half, they were roughly about flat. So everything we see in all of our indicators, whether it's our booking curve, what the consumer is spending on board today, all indicators are pointing that 2023 is setting up to be a phenomenal year for us. What type of margins relative to when you were seeing full vessels, people booking on a very healthy basis? And when do you expect that you'll kind of re-assume some of those stature? Yeah, look, pre-COVID, we were setting record level margins. We had EBITDA margins roughly at about in the low 30s. And I would be naive to tell you that we're not seeing some sort of inflationary pressure today. But we believe that's short-term pressure. That's near-term pressure. And all signs that we're seeing, at least from the cost front, we're starting to see easing in all the key commodities, whether it's proteins, fruits and vegetables, consumables, the like. But the other side of that coin is we're also able to go on a very strong pricing. And again, as I said earlier, that's been evidenced by the fact of our performance in both Q1 and Q2 of this year. And if you look at Q3 and our most recent guidance, we had said that our total net revenue per diems are expected to be up in the high single digits. So again, there's inflation is real. It is starting to level off. We are going to see some near-term pressure on margins. But we don't believe that this is going to be a long-term sustainable margin issue. As we look at our trends and our business over the next year to two years, we see margin improvement significantly. And we believe we can get back to the same margin levels we saw prior to the pandemic. Marketually here, let's talk about another important cost to input that has nothing to do with commodities. And that's people, right? Which seemingly every industry has been struggling with. How many people want to get on a ship as an employee these days? And how are they interacting also with the change and rules that you guys have been making? Look, people want to travel. People want to experience the world. They want to see the world in all forms of fashion. It doesn't matter if it's a consumer. It's our employees. Anybody. We're here in New York today. We expect a full ship, the ship is sailing this evening. It's going to be almost that full capacity, limited by our own own restrictions as we launch a new vessel. But demand is off the charts. Consumers are past COVID. The world is past COVID. Right, but it's not. Employees wise. So you guys aren't having trouble finding good people to staff the ships? No, when you look at our employee base, you have to remember our employee base. They did not receive subsidies during the course of the pandemic. So they wanted to come back to work. They were excited to come back to work. We've only seen employment issues very, you know, on the very margin at best in certain areas. But overall, it has not had any impact on our experience that we offer to all of our guests. Mark, that's good to hear about the premium. I know it's a nice looking ship. And of course, it's taken a while to get to this point, given everything going on in the world. But I also want to ask you too, in terms of the debt position, you know, as you look towards next year, how do you, how you can repay some of that debt? Is it a, is it a share sale? Are you going to try to refinance? Look, we were very deliberate and proactive during the pandemic. So, you know, we had to add a lot of debt to the balance sheet. But when we added debt, we looked at it and we looked at our maturity towers down the road. We wanted to ensure that we had a very clean path coming out of COVID. So, as we look forward over the course of the next two to three years, we have about a billion dollars a year.",https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NDK8QAnFNxU,32,2022-10-07 16:07:18
2816," down the road. We wanted to ensure that we had a very clean path coming out of COVID. So, as we look forward over the course of the next two to three years, we have about a billion dollars a year, so, you know, plus or minus that's coming due. And we firmly believe, given on our trajectory today, that with our existing cash on hand and our expected organic cash flow, we are going to be able to pay off our debt in the normal course of business by just good old fashion earnings and cash generation. We have no appetite. Our board has no appetite to issue any sort of equity to pay down debt or to deliver. We have the ability. This company is a cash engine machine. And if you look at the at the performance pre-pandemic, we were generating on average about a billion and a half close to two billion dollars of free cash flow. And we were also returning capital to shareholders at the same time. So, again, as we get back to full operations, we expect to be back at full capacity for the second quarter of 2023. And that is by design. We think, given where 2023 and 24 positioning, we have ample room to pay off our debt in the normal course. So, Tesla CEO Elon Musk continues to make headlines surrounding the Twitter acquisition. Meanwhile, shares of Tesla TSA. Yeah, they are moving lower on the day right now by about 1.2 percent. Questions have swirled around the tech titan sales of Tesla shares to finance is deal making coupled with whether he might be too distracted to hit targets at Tesla. Craig Irwin, Roth Capital Partners Senior Research analyst joins us now. Craig, you have a neutral rating and a $250 price target on Tesla. Now that we got that out of the way, help us answer some of these questions here. First and foremost, is Elon Musk too distracted to run both Twitter and Tesla? And what does that mean for Tesla? Just one point for regulatory reasons. They split adjusted price target is 85. The last printed note is pre-split. So, is Elon Musk too distracted to run Tesla? You know, frankly, Tesla is his baby. This company is a great expression of his personality. And he has shown tremendous capability to manage many different things, neural link of the boring company, SpaceX, you know, and other outside ventures. And the intellectual curiosity necessary to execute pretty well there. So, will it possibly take time away from Tesla? Yes. You know, I think the question that probably needs to be asked is, you know, will he be giving enough time to Twitter? And, you know, I'm not the best judge of that. I think you already have...",https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NDK8QAnFNxU,33,2022-10-07 16:11:29
2817," to Twitter and you know I'm not the best judge of that. I think you already have some pretty clear ideas on Twitter and he does have a history with PayPal and the digital payments space which I think is part of his vision on fixing that asset. So it doesn't bother me for Tesla. I have other reasons that I'm very bearish on the company but I have tremendous respect for what they've done. Well we'll get to those reasons in a second Craig but it doesn't even matter if Elon is distracted. Who cares and I mention that because we have EV tax credits in play that are probably gonna be a big tailwind to Tesla and then we have cars that people just really seem to be obsessed about. Yeah I mean they've done age for a menace job right? They've basically made the automotive industry sexy again. The last time it was sexy was the 1950s. That was when it's would come out of the best universities in the world and say oh my gosh, I wanna work for a car company. Now those same kids are coming out and saying, I wanna work on electric vehicles. I wanna work on future drivetrain technologies. Elon must deserve a lot of that credit because it's his vision and his commitment that's allowed that to take place. Does it matter? Does it really matter for Tesla so much? Not really, the flywheel is rolling, it's running and they have very different issues to manage through over the next couple of years than what they've had to challenge through to date. And whether or not Elon Musk is the one that's the right person to make those decisions, we'll find out, I'm skeptical. I think there's some very challenging things ahead for this company. And if Musk is maybe reducing his intensity with the company, it might not be a bad thing. Craig, I know there's no imminent changes at the top of Tesla, but is there anybody else there who could run the thing besides him? Oh gosh, that's a tough question. I don't think so. I mean, I've talked to a lot of former Tesla executives. I know people that have turned down positions at Tesla that are leaders and they're respect to various. It's a difficult company to work at because Elon Musk is an unreasonable person, not in a bad way, but in a motivating way where he doesn't take no for answer. He wants to learn what you got wrong, why you got it wrong, how you got to do a different to achieve the goal? So yes or no, yes, we got it. No, we didn't. A lot of people aren't well-tooled to work in that environment. And there's a lot of burnout and a lot of turnover as people like to talk about for Tesla with heavy, heavy departures every year. Craig, I only got 30 seconds here. Cold and months, they're coming soon. China and Tesla production, that's going to remain one of the main areas to continue to track and can the company adequately mitigate any logistics impacts and factory shutdowns. As it doesn't seem China's going to change their zero COVID policy anytime soon. Yeah, China's going to be tough for them, that's going to determine whether or not they make their numbers this year. 20,000, 20,000 unit myths or 19,000 unit myths is China, right? I don't think this is what's the biggest issue for the company. It's a big issue with competition and alternative equities like Porsche and the upcoming Ford spin-off, large well-established properties that are executing well. You have other examples of some of the SPAC IPOs that are actually showing success. And Tesla has big problems on the horizon as far as this competitive environment.

2818," you you Our That is our growth And inicar andett for all, and and on bringing in and of a very visible real world impact of Fed policy, right? The rate increase that we've seen in mortgages specifically in the effect that the knock-on effect that has on the housing market. What do you think overall about the effectiveness of Fed policy with fighting this current bout of inflation? Well, we haven't had them fight about of inflation in a very long time. So whatever models we had, you know, we have to dust off and see. I think we know that their long lack of facts, yeah, it hits the markets very quickly. It's equity markets, more slowly, housing markets, but things like employment, the peak of facts can be a year off. So it's very hard. You know, it's one of the things that makes it so hard for the Fed to get to a soft or soft-ish landing, which I'm pretty skeptical about. Okay. And so with your skepticism about getting to a soft-ish landing, what would the reality of the economic detriment incurred be if we were to see what many economists are calling for a recession in mid 2023? Well, I mean, I think it could be pretty brutal if the Fed really is hell-bent on having inflation come down as quickly as possible to two or two and a half percent. We have Europe very likely going to recession China. It at least a growth recession by all measures for the amorous session. That's a lot of pressures on us, the dollar is very strong. And interest rates are rising very fast. So I think the idea that it's going to be a really mild recession if that would be lucky. I'd say it could be a tough trade-off for the Fed once the numbers start setting in. I'm a little worried that having gone the wrong way in one direction with the change in their framework and not looking at the unemployment and what that was saying about inflation, they're now going in the other direction and possibly moving too fast given the long legs. Professor, if the economy does get brutal, like you just suggested, do you think this is a Federal Reserve at some point next year that is back to unwinding these aggressive rate hikes they've been taking recently? So here's the thing, yes, but I think where we're going to land at the end of this and now I'm looking maybe two years ahead is that a level of interest rates higher than we're used to even after inflation comes down. The real interest rate, the premium of the interest rate over the inflation rates, been extraordinarily low since the financial crisis. Some people say it's secular, stagnation, demographic, low productivity inequality, what have you. I think if you look at a long horizon, in fact, it was abnormally low in that period and we're going to get some moving back to being leaning.",https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NDK8QAnFNxU,35,2022-10-07 16:19:59
2819," I think if you look at a long horizon, in fact, it was abnormally low in that period, and we're gonna get some moving back to being, meaning that interest rates, even when they start coming down, they not come down all that much. So how do we then determine what the sort of natural or stable rate should be, right? Is there any way of sort of gaming that out what that could look like? Very tough. My own research sort of speaks to the 10-year rate, which I think will end up in a higher place than we've been used to before the pandemic. But what's going on with the Fed funds rate, with all the regulation and the financial repression, is a little hard to say. So they really have no idea that's one of the things making it difficult. But if you're asking, I think it'll be higher than we're used to. For consumers right now, what should they be navigating? How can they best navigate, perhaps, even leading into the scenario that you've described? Well, I mean, it's a tough picture where probably headed towards a difficult situation, coming out of a difficult situation. Certainly, I think employment is the key. Everybody's been particularly young people moving jobs every six months or a year. They better think twice about that in this period when it might not be so easy to land on another job. Can I want to switch gears a little bit? Because you focus not just on the US, but on the globe as well. And you and some others are just out with some really interesting research on the real estate market in China. Now, so much attention on the sort of zero-COVID policy and the negative effect that's having on China. But there's some underlying risk here that you illustrate in this research. We're looking now, you look at so-called Tier 3 Chinese cities, some of the smaller cities, although still pretty large, and that there's this excessive housing stock and that there's been really a sharp slowdown in prices and housing prices in those areas. What kind of risk is this presenting for the Chinese economy? Well, I think it's a huge long-term problem with or without the zero-COVID policy. The real estate housing real estate, more generally, commercial real estate infrastructure, has been the go-to policy for China. I did some research a couple of years ago, peak China housing, showing all the factors that suggested we really have come to an end of it. And more recently, my co-author and I have shown that a lot of that is concentrated in the more hidden Tier 3 cities, you know, the Cincinnati's of China, so to speak. I'm not quite sure if you say that Cincinnati's of China could be five and ten million people, maybe Cincinnati's of a few hundred thousand. And on top of that, there are a lot of them. They account for 60% of GDP. You don't see it that people travel to the big cities. They're less visible, but they have, they really have a problem where they've been building like crazy and are sort of getting to the end of the line of that development strategy, and it's not that easy for them to pivot. So what then happens when we do see China coming out of zero COVID, at the same time that the rest of the globe is slowing down or even entering recession? I mean, do we see sort of a circular effect here where China's troubles maybe exacerbate the troubles of the rest of the globe? Oh, China's been enormously important for the rest of the globe. It's counted for, I don't know, like a quarter of all global growth over the decade before the pandemic may be going into the first year, at least according to the IMF. And those days are over. I think we're looking at much slower growth in China, who knows what the real numbers are, that much slower growth in China for years to come. And of course, it matters. I mean, it hits commodity exporters, the hardest that they have a raracious appetite for commodities, but European luxury car makers, etc. I think it's going to have a very big effect. And that's even without the Ukraine war and whatever happens there, and which side China ends up on. Ken Rogoff, professor of economics at Harvard University. Thanks so much for the insights and the forecast and calculations. It's all of it, great conversation.",https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NDK8QAnFNxU,36,2022-10-07 16:24:34
2820," And I'm ex at Harvard University. Thanks so much for the insights and the forecast and calculations. It's all of it. Great conversation. Twitter shares continue to trade below Elon Musk's $54.20 offer price as there's still fears on a deal getting done. Let's get more on this with cities senior analyst Ron Josie. Ron, good to see you here. Just based on your knowledge of the situation folks you have talked to, do you still think this deal gets done at that price? You know, we were pretty, the big news this week was around coming together both parties suggesting with Elon saying we will on our original $54.20 share offer and Twitter come out, coming out specifically and saying that it's something that we are looking to do as well. So the fact that they're both negotiating cable not in court going against each other, I think that's a positive step. And it seems to me it's just a matter of time until something happens in this deal seems to be on the path to being consummated. So that would be our view overall. What's the reality of any changes that would be made to Twitter and when that would actually take place even if and as this does kind of continue to work its way through? Yeah, I mean if something were to happen, meaning that if it is acquired by Mr. Musk and if we go through and it's a now private company, look, unfortunately this has been in the public world now that this acquisition back in force since called it March April I believe with the initial deal initial offer there. And so Twitter has gone through quite a bit of change from then until now, not only from a business perspective with advertisers potentially pulling back maybe getting a little bit more nervous, some placing ads on Twitter in addition to the macro changes that are happening out there, but then internally there's just a lot of concern in our view around morale, around basically attrition or just getting things done in new products being launched. So your question of how long would it take to sort of get the business back up to speed? Frankly, it would take probably some time to rebuild and the macro environment doesn't what would not help in the current environment where advertising continues to be a little bit of a softer subject overall. And Ron, we don't even know what he's going to do with the company, right? I have to say, man, it must be tough analyzing this company right now. You didn't know if the deal was going to get done. You don't know what Elon's going to do if he does indeed consummate the deal, right? I mean, we've gotten some hints dropped. There's been a lot of speculation. Trump's going to come back. He's talked about this, everything app X, whatever. But like, how do you, how do you even model concretely in a situation like this? Well, it'll be a lot easier for them internally as a private company. So you wouldn't have to talk to folks like myself.",https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NDK8QAnFNxU,37,2022-10-07 16:28:41
2821," Creeply in a situation like this. Well, it'll be a lot easier for them internally as a private company. So you wouldn't have to talk to folks like myself, to model and figure out what's next. But you essentially have to rebuild the business, right? So you start, I'm sure the first my order of business is to look at the product to your point, see what can be done to make it more user friendly, to get more users on the service onboarding with something that was a big focus prior to this saga that we're incurrently. And so number one would be product. Number two then is figuring out how you best monetize. And right now the model is primarily advertising. But of course, there's options around subscription, there's options around maybe payments or something along those lines purchases. So there's different things you can do. But I think day one, whenever this comes to a conclusion, has to be let's focus on the product. Let's make sure it becomes that, call it town square, open free marketplace and then everything else should follow. But it's not something that I think happens overnight. It's likely to take some time. Ron, is there an appetite in the marketplace for this super app concept that Elon is pushing here? Do consumers want to, let's say, go onto Twitter, tweet then also maybe get taken to trade some stocks on XYZ platform and then order an Uber and then a hamburger for dinner. I mean, do people really want that? Yeah, it's interesting. The super apps here in the West haven't really taken on as much as they have, taken off as much as they have over in Asia and other parts of the world. And so that definitely is a TBD overall. Partnerships to allow things along those lines that would build off of what you see on Twitter make sense. You can see that happening. But one super app, it's a change in use case, right? And the thing with Twitter that having covered the company for a while now and looking at it quarter in, quarter out, the number one thing is a product, be those monetizable daily active users. And so the more you can do to get those users on board, everybody knows Twitter. What's always surprising is you would think it would have a bigger footprint overall. And so that's the, in terms of users. And so that's probably the job number one. And if the super app does that, that's a big question. But frankly, it's still too early to even offer that. And I think you're right. It would have to be something that would at least be in line to what you are looking for and consuming while on Twitter. And there's partnerships that can make that happen. But it's definitely, I would say, the product is, that's on the roadmap for down the road once everything settles for the most part. Is it possible that after all the dust is settled, that Twitter in privacy becomes a media company? And I mean, a media company with partnerships that can actually charge people for the ability to watch video content, whether that be from the WMBA, whether that be live sports or the partnerships with even some of the entertainment companies that they've worked with over the past, creating kind of a charging premise based on that, where the social connectivity just becomes an extra add-on on top of that. Yeah, I mean, there's a lot of things that you can do with the platform when you have as many monetized or DAUs that are out there. I would say, and we've always talked about the content on Twitter is amongst the best out there. And the content is really just an amalgamation of what people are saying and doing and tweeting and whatnot. And you can get lost in Twitter for hours, the challenges that product providing those details on what you're looking for. Going more on a media strategy, working with providers and partners, we've seen success in that, right? And I think Twitter in the past has had partnerships by providing videos and highlights from the Olympics, from the NFL, from many different sports teams, as well as award shows and whatnot. So I think going down the media path is something that would continue. The question is, the model changes from primarily advertising to maybe some sort of subscription that that's a TBD. And I would say most entertainment companies on the web that have gone to paying for content, it's not an easy sort of chasm or bridge to cross. And so you really need to provide that value to get users to subscribe to it. And right now, again, Twitter has some tremendous and fantastic content in there to matter surfacing it and providing that right user experience on a personalized level.",https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NDK8QAnFNxU,38,2022-10-07 16:33:17
2822, users to subscribe to it and right now again twitter has some tremendous and fantastic content in there to matter surfacing it and providing that right user experience on a personalized level and that's really the key thing going forward the personalization well run uh... unfortunately i think this is the first time we've talked to you about twitter unfortunately maybe it'll be the last of the still goes through although perhaps it'll be a relief for you i don't know what will find some other good stocks to talk about with you though thanks so much for coming on city senior analyst run jozy appreciate it thanks rally me uh... uh... we're going to pay the from legal battles in financial wrangling to a bigger picture take on elan must potential takeover tesla cio is labeled himself a sp be a free speech absolutist and well herited heralded by some it is still fears from civil rights organizations in equal measure now from twitter as a business to the flow of information were joined by synan aral m it slow in school of management professor an author of the height machine synan always great to see you here so what's your take on the situation and it's meaning for the future of twitter great to see you thank you for having me you know i predicted that this is exactly what would happen that this deal would go uh... i actually predicted it would go through it a slightly lower price is the market uh... choosing that price for me at the fifty dollar range uh... there could be some negotiations about a slight price decrease in order to get assurances on the twitter side from us in the financiers more uh... tight language about how they could or couldn't uh... be required to go through with the deal but we'll see whether the prediction bears out exactly obviously when the investors came in it was a different climate now there's higher interest rates as inflation there's a lot of uncertainty to the uh... you crane war uh... just this week oil prices opac and russia uh... constraining supply so it's a much different environment to finance debt the banks could try to back out and could uh... trigger this escape hatch for a billion dollars uh... by elan musk but there could be some negotiations and twitter could say we want assurances and will negotiate something to get those assurances because remember for the twitter board this was a no-brainer at fifty four dollars this was a great deal for them and they'll want this deal to go through assuming the deal goes through first thing you're going to see is a mass exodus uh... due to firings and people quitting uh... people who are currently at twitter inside information says that they do not want to work for elan musk new twitter organization mostly many of them would leave on their own volition to uh... elan musk is indicated that much of the twitter leadership he does not approve of their decision-making so he,https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NDK8QAnFNxU,39,2022-10-07 16:37:16
2823," most of them would leave on their own volition. Elon Musk has indicated that much of the Twitter leadership he does not approve of their decision making so he might get rid of some people. So the compensation negotiation I think is less important because you're going to see a wholesale clean out and a wholesale change in the approach. You're going to see Donald Trump return to the platform almost immediately. You're going to see moderation rules relaxed towards this more free speech environment, although you can't get rid of moderation entirely. You're going to see attempts at the subscription model. Be more forthcoming in the short term. A lot more bot detection and bot removal as well. That's in the short term. And I think we should also talk a little bit about the long term. Expect Web three strategies to enter Elon Musk vocabulary. Will there be a Twitter coin? Will that be related to the subscription model? How will that be financing the business going forward? I think Elon Musk has made clear that he thinks that an advertising alone business model cannot save this company. There are a lot of people that agree with this opinion. I think that Twitter has struggled to succeed with an advertising only business model. Twitter blue as a subscription model was kind of a, you know, toes dangling in the water attempt to see how it would go. You can expect much more heavy commitment towards paying subscribers for premium services and or for institutional accounts to be part of the strategy of an Elon Musk Twitter. In addition, I think that you can imagine that there will be other types of subscription models. For example, selling access to particular types of institutions in terms of information that is packaged up as information services for institutions, whether it be for prediction purposes or for other types of purposes. Given that it will be a private company, there will be a lot less oversight from the public sphere over what's going on. And you can also imagine an attempt to be more inclusive of conservative voices, which would try to get at the user numbers that have been steady, but not really increasing at the rates that Elon Musk would like to see. I've got to leave it there. Sin and Al Raul, but I really appreciate you stopping by and all of those insights as always. Thank you. You have a good time. Let's stick with housing here and take a look at what's happening in the rental market because inflationary pressures and economic uncertainty are hitting that market pretty hard and your report from real damage. You found that apartment demand plunged in the third quarter. It's first a three-q drop that we've seen in 30.",https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NDK8QAnFNxU,40,2022-10-07 16:41:20
2824," I'm a uncertainty are hitting that market pretty hard. A new report from real page, you found that apartment demand plunged in the third quarter. It's first three key drop that we've seen in 30 years. We want to bring in Jake Parsons, head of the economics industry principles at real page. Jay, it's great to see you. So very unusual for us to see a drop here in the third quarter, which is typically very strong, a three-month time frame for the rental market. What do you think is behind this massive drop that we saw? Yeah, so I think the first thing everyone's looking for is signs of affordability concerns, given the number of, given the rate, the rent increases that occurred of the last couple of years. But that's just not showing up. Wages are still up. Rent collection is still very high. In fact, they're actually up year over year. And we're not seeing any kind of move down into cheaper units and cheaper areas. And so really what appears to be happening is a freeze in household formation, because there's very little leasing traffic right now. And obviously we know people aren't buying houses right now. So it tells me that people are kind of in a wait and see mode. And they've really pushed the pause button on their housing search for the time being. The pause button. Is that how you describe the entire housing sector at the moment? And is that because of mortgage rates? It seems like buyers and sellers have back to your word paused. Yeah, no, I think, you know, obviously for renters, it's not necessarily mortgage rates directly, but it's those same kind of underlying factors that are driving up mortgage rates. That's really inflation. You know, you know, we've been talking a lot about home prices and rent, but you know, one thing everyone feels every day is groceries. I mean, they're up 13% year over year. And so I think with overall inflation, we're seeing consumer confidence is way down. And you think about it, you know, when you don't feel certain about the economy and your place in it, your financial situation, human nature is to wait it out, wait and see. And so, you know, thankfully, as you know, the job market remains strong for the time being on employment slow. And so that tells me that there's a lot of pent up demand being built up right now. So if the job market remains strong, I do think demand will come back, but it's certainly not happening right now. Jay, how long until you think that demand does return to the rental market? Yeah, good question. So these next few months, you know, winners slow period for housing of all types. You know, you don't see a lot of people moving around in the winter months. And so we really won't know much until early spring. So I think it's time we get to out March. We should see that demand come back. Now, of course, if the job market turns, it could be a very different story. But at this point, I would expect to see a lot of that, particularly for rentals. I think we'll see rental demand come back first around that timeframe. What's the inventory story in the rental market? So we saw a huge drop off in vacancies in 2021, record apartment demand, record sink of rental demand. We peaked on occupancy rates in March. It has gotten a little better for renters out there. There's a little more availability. It's still low. While there was weak apartment demand in Q3, it's still a very tight market. We have very low vacancy right now. We have high retention rates. But it's gotten a little bit better. And I think the good news for renters as well is we're going to see a lot of new inventory next year. We're seeing 40 year highs in apartment construction. We're seeing a large number of single-family rental communities, built-in communities are being built. We've even heard of home sellers. We're now choosing to run out of their homes with a way out the mortgage market. And so there's definitely more inventory. And I think we'll see more next year as well. Jay, what does this do to prices? I guess that there's more inventory, more options on the table. Are we going to go and you see a pretty big drop then in rentals? I don't think we're going to see an industry drop in rents for most parts of the country. I think we could see some seasonal cuts here in the winter months, but nothing dramatic and drastic. But I think we can see more importantly, though, I think we're going to see a big moderation in rent growth next year. And to be honest, we've already seen that. I mean, the certainly the CPI does not reflect this. And most of the big rent hikes occurred in 2021. And in 2022, we've really seen more moderate rent increases. And I think we're going to see more of them return to normal in terms of rent growth next year. All right, Jay Parsons. Great to get your take. Thanks so much for joining us.",https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NDK8QAnFNxU,41,2022-10-07 16:46:23
2825," you you you Well inflation doesn't seem to be worrying car collectors bring a trailer a classic car our collector marketplace has already surpassed $1 billion in sales this year. We're joining us now to now is bring a trailer CEO, Randy Nunnberg, and our senior auto supporter prize to Romanian, joining the fund as well. Good to see you, Randy. So this is actually coming off the back of two bumper years already. What do you attribute this year's growth to? This year we've just seen people continue to be very interested in the space. And frankly, our audience has expanded into people that might never have thought about buying a collectible vehicle or a sort of hobby vehicle. And we've really expanded the audience and given people more confidence to buy online. Hey, Randy, pros here. So I kind of feel like there's two markets going on. We have the high end Pebble Beach Market that's sort of blowing away our cumulative scale sales every year. And then we have the kind of smaller niche stuff that you guys also operate in, the enthusiast modern classics. What do you think is happening in that second market? Is that second market as strong as that premier kind of high end classic car market? Yeah, when we invented and bring a trailer, a lot of people thought it would be for old-fashioned type cars. But it quickly became apparent that the model of transparency and reliability online and being able to sell a car at a very efficient fee and reliable way was interesting for modern cars. Like the ones you see on your screen right now, modern BMWs, forces, this sort of thing. People are using green trailer to buy their daily driver vehicle. And particularly in the last six months or a year with limited availability at new car dealerships and some dynamics in play like that, a lot of people look to our platform to go buy their car that they were going to drive every single day. And so that has really expanded our marketplace. Now, Rochelle mentioned you guys cross that billion dollar sale volume mark already in 2022, blowing away what you guys did last year in 2021. Now, we're kind of seeing the economy get a little bit kind of weaker here. The stock market is a bit uncertain at this point. Are you guys seeing any kind of hesitancy on your buyers and your site for now for these types of modern classics? We haven't seen a slowdown in terms of submissions for cars to be sold. It's actually up substantially over last year. The interesting part of being a marketplace is whether it's an up market or a down market, people are going to look for, again, that's sort of most efficient and reliable way to unload something if they have a special car that they paid for a year ago or a year and a half ago and now things tighten up and they say, oh, maybe I'm going to unload. I really think that we're kind of poised to be the place where they will do that. So obviously everybody loves the boom years when everybody's spending like crazy and buying rapidly. But as people decide to look for places to sell, it's actually an interesting position wherein as I think we'll see quite a bit of demand for the site's services, even if there is a plateau or a slowdown. And so Randy, obviously a lot of people think their car was worth the fortune. How do you manage expectations in this sort of environment, whether it's from what sellers can expect to get or even a oak here.",https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NDK8QAnFNxU,42,2022-10-07 16:50:26
2826," Slow down. And so, Randy, obviously a lot of people think their car was worth the fortune. How do you manage expectations in this sort of environment, whether it's from what sellers can expect to get, or even the fees that sellers and buyers can expect to pay? Yeah, well, we really just lean on that transparency, and that's what's really different. The internet was a scary place for people for a long time to try to sell a car who was going to buy it or who was going to show up at your house or how is that going to work. And our sort of community dynamic that we built for listing vehicles online really changed that. Brand new cars are sort of a commodity, but the older ones like you're seeing here, and even special interest things from five and ten years ago, you really like to have a community and sort of a cast of experts that can discuss it. And so that has really given people that confidence that they needed. And so I think we'll see that being a really attractive model going forward. And like I said, whether it's, you know, boom years or not, it's a compelling marketplace and we see increased demand that's not letting up even in this environment. You know, Randy, one of the areas you guys were focused on is in 90s recently. This era is sort of seeing a little uptick. What's behind that, do you think? Is it just sort of an nostalgia for Gen X and things like that? Yeah, I mean, when I was a kid, you know, classic cars were from the 50s and 60s and had tail fins and chrome. These days, cars from the 80s and 90s are 25 and 30 years old, just like they were back in the day. But that's sort of the era of when people like me were in high school or were kids and the kind of stuff we were looking at. Those have come into their own and it's actually the highest volume of submissions and listings we have on, bring a trailer from the 90s and 2000s, 2010. And most people never guess that in our sort of surprise when I mentioned that a collectible and special interest car marketplace focuses on those sort of eras. But that's by far the highest dollar volume. A lot of the record results that we're seeing are in that sort of area and it's different than people would have predicted. And Randy, we were looking at some images there. The 1962 Jaguar XK-E Series One Road, so that was on your site. If I had an extra $200,000 this May, I would have tried to bid on it. Is there a unicorn car out there that you would like to get your hands on? And what sort of price range are you talking? Good question. I mean, our site serves all sorts of price ranges. Yeah, that one may have been 200,000, but I tend to tell my friends, I tend to dream about 20 or 25,000 out of time. There's a lot of different opportunities out there. My favorite cars that we're still just now seeing trickle onto the website are kind of the racing cars of my youth. Again, it says 80s and 90s type cars, the ones that had the sponsor liverys. They had some famous folks like Tom Cruise and Paul Newman driving them, that sort of stuff. That stuff gets me really fired up. But we have 130 employees and all of them have their different dreams and favorite sectors. And that's part of what makes the bring a trailer community super interesting is the variety and the different types of cars. So it's really all over the map. Hey, Randy, you guys are approaching the 100,000 auction listing mark, I believe, coming up soon. What does that mean for you and the team? You guys have built their bring a trailer? Well, it's going to be a celebration. First of all, you may have been there in the early days, but when we turned on bring a trailer auctions in 2014, we did three cars. We did three cars a week for the first little watt. So talking three plus three plus three. And then now you're talking 100,000. It's just a crazy journey that we've been on. Obviously, there's been a lot of operationalizing the business to be able to do that. Like I said, with such a staff, we are still a human centered product. So when you list a car and bring a trailer, you get a person to walk you through that and you get to talk to them through the process. So it's not just an automated website. So to get to 100,000 and still offer that human level of service is really challenging. So we are we are celebrating. I think we're about to cross 88,000 or 89,000 listings this week. And so we're a couple of months out from that big milestone. And at least we'll throw a good party. But we'll hopefully be able to engage the whole Bringer Trader community as well. Well, congratulations on that upcoming landmark. Bring a trailer's Randy Nonenberg and our very own prize to Romanian.

2827," you you and The housing market is struggling, but that's not the case for the home furniture industry. The venture-funded parachute launching its line of living room furniture today, you're to tell us about it, is parachute CEO Areal. Okay? Are you all nice to see up until the Fed pauses the housing market is essentially well-possed on bullfins? How is that impacting your business? You know, we see the home ships and consumers spend, you know, definitely impacting, but what we're seeing with our customer base, which is millennials and millennial shoppers, there are 70 million millennial shoppers that are moving into their prime earning years. They are in the midst of household formation and they are still looking to shop for home and will continue to be shopping and really spending a lot of time in their in their spaces. Are you all right? Have you seen any sort of shift just in terms of consumer spending or how much people are spending or what they're willing to spend on? Yeah, I mean, we're seeing the impact of inflation and we've been certainly impacted by that as well, but you know, we have seen the business continue to grow year over year and we expect to have a good holiday season as people are preparing to host and really spend more time at home. And Areal, with that tightening economy, yet still you're on track to essentially double your store count in a 12 month period. How are you really bucking the national trend? You know, we see our customers really wanting to buy beautiful products and beautiful spaces. We have 21 stores open today. That's up from 12 at the beginning of this year. So we have nearly doubled and we'll have 25 by the end of the year. We just we see it as a relationship build. We see an impact on our econ business when we open a store and a given market and we see those customers wanting to spend more. It's also been a really important part of our growing trade business working with interior designers. That's a very localized business. People like to come in. They like to touch and fill the products and bring their clients in. So, you know, we feel really bullish to on retail. Our stores are small. They're intimate. They have pretty low operating costs. And so we're able to really build that part of our business profitably. Supply chain issues has certainly been a challenge here for a number of larger players within your space. You're expanding at a time when so many other companies just can't keep up with the demand that they have had. How are you doing this? And I guess how are you not feeling some of those challenges? So we've been really fortunate. Most of our products are made in Europe or the US and everything is shipped into New Jersey where we have our centralized distribution center. So we have been able to avoid a lot of the congestion and various ports on the west coast as well as delays and disruption in Asia. It's, you know, we've been really lucky that we've been able to work closely with our manufacturers. We have a really strong technology platform that allows us to gauge demand and really be thoughtful on how we are ordering and working alongside our our manufacturers who have become partners over the",https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NDK8QAnFNxU,44,2022-10-07 16:58:53
2828," that allows us to gauge demand and really be thoughtful on how we are ordering and working alongside our our manufacturers who have become partners over the past eight and a half years. And you mentioned millennials earlier more than 70% of your customer base. Why is that age group in particular drawn to the brand? And just to give people a sense of it, trying to figure out your price point in comparison to say Cracken Bay, Barrel or Restoration Hardware. So you're doing a nice job of showing the showroom. For example, how much is that lovely chair you're sitting in? This chair is $1,700. This chair came out today. It has a beautiful swivel and is available in a number of different fabrics. So we look at costing across the competitor as we try to make sure that we're priced with a value centered, really proposition. Our products are premium. They're super high quality. We design them all in-house, which is definitely a differentiator for the brand. But really, the customer segment that we're going after millennials are really shopping with their values. We are known as the most sustainable brand in the space. And we really speak to the customer in a new way. These are folks that shop online. They want to be inspired. And we do that through our social channels. And we've really re-imagined the way that these products are merchandise and manufactured. You can see behind our store looks like a home. It's really quite beautiful and a very different experience than when you go into a much larger shopping experience. Ariel, another thing that you're doing to expand that customer base. You've had a couple of collaborations, one of those being with Nordstrom, they are among your partnerships. I guess what is this done for your business? And are there more of those types of partnerships in the pipeline? Yeah, we love our partnership in Nordstrom. We are at a number of their stores. And we really see this as an awareness play. They have such a strong and loyal customer base. And we really want to tap into that customer and really bring our products to life. When we leverage partnerships like that, we typically do an exclusive colorway or an exclusive product to really make it feel special and really give purpose to that partnership. But we're in the early months of that partnership and we're excited to see that partnership continue to grow in the coming year. Ariel, OK. We wish you all the best. Thank you so much, Robynon, and joining us today. In this episode of influencers, Hermitage Capital Management CEO, Bill Browder. Are we ready to go to war? Is the United States ready to go to war with Russia? I think that this is going to lead to a Russian depression. I can't imagine the strangle how the stranglehold doesn't really drive the GDP down, like 20%, 25%. It's remarkable. And we're just in the early stages of this game. The Ukrainians are not going to roll over it. They're going to fight like hell. Hello, everyone, and welcome to influencers. I'm Andy Sirwer. And welcome to our guest, Bill Browder, CEO at Hermitage Capital and Head of the Global Magnitsky Justice Campaign. In the late 1990s and early 2000s, Browder's firm delivered stellar returns by exposing corruption at major Russian companies, bringing about company shakeups and boosting share prices. In 2005, Browder was denied reentry to Russia and later became a victim of a Russian government scheme to undermine his firm, he says. Sergei Magnitsky, a lawyer hired Browder to investigate Russian corruption was arrested and died in Russian custody. Bill, welcome to influencers. Thank you so much for joining us. Great to be here. So much to get to right now. I want to ask you maybe, first of all, about Vladimir Putin. And have you ever seen Putin reverse course in 25 years of Washington closely? Can you see him changing his tack now and Ukraine now that he's committed to a full-scale invasion? That's really the most...",https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NDK8QAnFNxU,45,2022-10-07 17:03:26
2829," Can you see him changing his tack now and Ukraine? Now that he's committed to a full scale invasion. That's the most important question of our discussion. And the answer is definitive no. Vladimir Putin can't. You have to imagine his world is the world of a prison yard. In a prison yard, you can't show any weakness. If someone comes at you with a shank, you got to shank them 10 times more and look around at everyone else and say, who else wants to be shanked? That's that's Vladimir Putin's mindset. That's how he operates. And so when he hasn't barked on this on this horrific military invasion, it's there's no chance that any time he announces peace talks, that's just a tactic to either split up the resolve of the West or to delay some action to resupply or something like that. And so he is going to move forward. He's going to escalate. There's no retreat. There's no compromise. There's no diplomacy. He's all in it for for victory. However, he defines that. And so a lot of people use this phrase end game build, but I'll ask you. I mean, what is the end game here specifically with Ukraine first? And does he want to occupy it or how does work in his mind? Well, this is really another important part of Vladimir Putin. There is no end game. So what you have to understand is he is not there for all the reasons that he says he's there. You can't believe a word he says. He's an inveterate liar. His credibility is zero. And so any words that he has used to describe what he's doing should be discounted. The reason that he is a Ukraine is because after 22 years as a dictator, he sees the writing on the wall. He sees the writing on the wall, meaning that the bellorussian dictator next door was almost overthrown 18 months ago by his people. The Kazakh dictator again, and next door in a different direction was overthrown. And Putin realized that it was just a matter of time before the Russians overthrew him. And so pulling straight out of the dictator's playbook 101, he said, what do you do to not get overthrown? You start a war. And he's described Ukrainians as Nazis and drug dealers. And he's described NATO as an invading force and all sorts of things. He doesn't believe any of that. He's just trying to come up with a narrative to give the Russian people something to chew on in order for him to have a war and his war is there to stay in power. And so when you say, what is his endgame, there is no endgame. His endgame is to move forward, to expand, to attack, to take territory, to declare victories. But he has to keep on going no matter what it is. And this is just part of that process. And it's not like it just started now. I mean, the most recent version of this just started now. He was feeling under pressure in 2008. And that's when he invaded Georgia in 2014, the same thing. He took Crimea. And so this is a long process of him trying to stay in power as a dictator. And the most scary part of this whole story is that I don't have any belief that he will stop. So let's just say that he's successful in Ukraine. And that's a very big question because the Ukrainians are valuably fighting back. But let's say he was successful in Ukraine. That's not the end of his story. He would then go to other countries. Maybe the easy ones, maybe the hard ones, maybe grabs Moldova at some point. But his ultimate goal for him is to show up at the border with us, which means Estonia or Latvia or Lithuania or Poland. And then to test out something that has never been tested before, which is, are we ready to go to war? Is the United States ready to go to war with Russia to protect Estonia, a country of a million people that probably, you know, 2% of Americans could locate on a map. Are we ready to do that? Or are we not? And he's taken the bat. Well, we're not. But isn't this going to be very difficult for him just to hold on to this real estate? I mean, look at Afghanistan, very different country, certainly. But look at Afghanistan under Brezhnev. And now we're ready to win.",https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NDK8QAnFNxU,46,2022-10-07 17:08:00
2830," be very difficult for him just to hold on to this real estate. I mean, look at Afghanistan, very different country, certainly, but look at Afghanistan under Brezhnev. I mean, there's a huge cost of occupying these countries, right? Absolutely. So I was just saying, I was saying that's his assumption. He's just keep on pushing out. Now, let's talk about Ukraine specifically. So he's launched an invasion of Ukraine. We don't know the exact number of casualties, but I've read various reports to say that there's 3,000 soldiers have been killed in the first four days of their occupation. I don't know if that's true or not. Maybe it's wild, the exaggerate. Maybe it's totally true. But let's just say for a moment, let's just take for a moment and say it is true. That's the total number of soldiers that died in the entire war with Chechnya. That's like a third or between a quarter and a third of the total number of soldiers that died after nine and a half years in Afghanistan. And so he's paying a hefty price, even if it's just a fraction of the 3,000, he's still paying a hefty price for what he's done so far. And we're just in the early stages of this game, the Ukrainians are not going to roll over. They're going to fight like hell. Thankfully, now, after some resistance, all of the major Western allies are going to assist them with equipment to help them fight and give them some decent chance. But at the end of the day, Vladimir Putin has way outgunned them. I mean, he's got all sorts of stuff. There was, I mean, shocking military hardware that could really be unbelievably destructive and to people in Ukraine.",https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NDK8QAnFNxU,47,2022-10-07 17:12:26
2831," you you it appears or one could argue that the Ukrainians are winning the war of social media and I'm wondering if Vladimir Putin who supposedly was this expert in disinformation and social media has underestimated the Ukrainians abilities there. So the Ukrainians had some help and as critical as I am on some aspects of US foreign policy, the Biden administration's done a fantastic job early on of sharing intelligence about what the Russians were up to and repeating it and repeating it and repeating it. But by the time the Russians invaded, there was no alternative narrative. So the way the Russians normally do this and they did this with Georgia, for example, there was like confusion to this day about who fired first in Georgia and the Russian apologists said, well, it was a Georgians who precipitated and provoked this war and so on and so forth. There's no uncertainty about this. This was a war of aggression and that's a very important term, a war of aggression is a term they use in the Nuremberg trials. This is a war of aggression that everybody can agree on. And so there's nobody who can can know sort of natural Russian apologists, nobody who's got a lot of financial interest with Russia, who can say anything other than this is a brazen attack on a peaceful neighbor. And that's an extremely important part of the narrative that has allowed all the Western countries to lock arms and do the coordinated sanctions that are that have been done right now, which are causing enormous financial pain to Vladimir Putin. Yeah, let's drill down into that bill sanctions. How effective are they right now and what you know what grade would you give them, for instance, and what do we need to do from here. So I'm a sort of connoisseur of sanctions. It's such a thing exists. And so when they first started this sanctions program about a week ago last Tuesday, I would have given the Western governments a two out of 10. It was all very, you know, too little too late. Then the atrocities started to happen and the sanctions started getting real when they added the major Russian banks, the big oil companies, et cetera, by Thursday was an eight out of 10, then they did swift. So that's a nine out of 10, and then they did Vladimir Putin and nine and a half out of 10. So there's still some gaps that need to be filled in swift is only done. So swift means disconnecting the Russian banks from the international financial system. So it's not only done 70% of the banks. And so logic would tell you that if 70% of the banks are disconnected, they'll just route all the payments through the 30% of the banks that aren't disconnected. That's just what anyone would do. And certainly the Russians will do that. So we need to sanction the other 30% of the banks and a lot of people ask me why, why are those banks protected. And I mentioned that there was some, you know, a glee back room deal with, you know, in a smoky room or somebody said we have an interest there. Don't do that. But so those other 30% of the banks need to be sanctioned disconnected from swift. And then the most important part of the whole exercise is that Vladimir Putin's own money needs to be hit. And his own money is held not by himself, but by oligarchs who look after it. And so we need to freeze the assets of the oligarchs in the West. And a lot of announcements have been made that that's that's the intention. A few oligarchs about have been added to the various EU, US, UK sanctions lists. But that needs to be done in a much more coordinated manner. Because it did.",https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NDK8QAnFNxU,48,2022-10-07 17:16:12
2832," have been added to the various EU, US, UK sanctions lists. But that needs to be done in a much more coordinated manner, because there's different oligarchs in the US that have been sanctioned in the EU and different ones in the EU than the UK. And then a list needs to be expanded dramatically. So there's 50 or 60 or 100 of the most wealthy oligarchs in Russia sanctioned. And if we get... God, let me interrupt, I'm sorry, Goa, but practically speaking, how would that be accomplished? Isn't that extremely difficult? You've got camons and countries like that. I don't mean to spare them specifically. There are all sorts of money havens around the world. Nevermind, Switzerland, which is said that actually they're up against Russia at this point. But how would that be done practically? Well, it's actually not as complicated as you think. So it's not the government's job to necessarily track down the assets. The way it works in practical terms is a person gets added to the sanctions list. Once they're on the sanctions list, then it's the job or the responsibility, not the job, but the legal responsibility of a bank that holds their money to no longer transact with that person. So that money gets frozen or a real estate agent, not to sell their property or a broker, not to sell their shares. And at that point, everything gets frozen. And so it actually gets crowdsourced. Now, you made a good point, which is, let's say their stuff is not in the United States or in the UK, but in the Cayman Islands. Well, guess what? The Cayman Islands is a crown dependency. And as a result, every one of these Gernsey, Jersey, the Isle of Man, Cayman Islands, British Virgin Islands, they copy the British sanctions list. And so you end up in a situation where whatever Britain does, all these offshore jurisdictions do. And so Britain is really punching way above its weight in terms of its importance in this whole scheme. And so just coming back to the original thought, you put a person on the sanctions list, they get sanctioned everywhere. Cayman Islands, BBI, UK, and if all the countries coordinate, then there's really no civilized place they can hide. Now, we're seeing oligarchs scrambling right now, moving yachts. I read a story about one oligarch who's parked his yacht in Saudi Arabia, as he doesn't think that the Saudi Arabians will freeze his yacht. And there are stories about mad scrambles of oligarchs trying to sell properties, give them away to family members and getting divorced from their wives, giving them property, all sorts of interesting stuff. And that will happen. And they will probably succeed in protecting some of their assets. But even if you don't get all their assets, just having a person on the sanctions list means that they're no longer, that they're pretty much out of the game. They're benched in the world, in the international financial world. Another remarkable development, or correct me if you think I'm wrong, Bill, is the response by the private sector, both in Europe and in the United States. I mean, everything from business to the shell, to the banks, curtailing or ending their financial relationships with Russia. What do you think about that, and is this effective? Well, in a certain way, I would almost argue it's more effective, because, okay, so the sanctions lists are important, government activity is important. But if every Western company stops doing business with the Russians, it's really dramatic. I remember when I started my whole campaign for justice for Sergey Magnitsky, my murdered lawyer, one of the first people I met with, I was in South Africa, and I met with a woman named Helen Zilli, who was one of the people involved in the, one of the main people involved in the anti-apartheid movement. I'd watched a movie called Cry Freedom, and she was one of the characters in the movie. And I met with her shortly after her sort of game, I guess, who was murdered, and we talked, and we talked about how they ended apartheid. And she said, it was all about disinvestment. It was all about the US and Western Europe disinvesting from South Africa, that when they became financially isolated, that's when it became too much. And so I think this is really, really important. And I think this is probably, as I look at the next steps, what can we do next when we watch these atrocities unfold in Ukraine? I think it's just to pressure every single Western business to divest, to stop doing business, to stop supplying goods, to stop supplying services to Russia. Right. Are the sanctions enough to send the Russian economy into a recession?",https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NDK8QAnFNxU,49,2022-10-07 17:20:57
2833," to stop doing business, to stop supplying goods, to stop supplying services to Russia. Right. Are the sanctions enough to send the Russian economy into recession? And is this an objective that we should try to achieve, even? Well, if you had asked me two months before this whole thing had started, I would have said, let's just go after the oligarchs and leave the Russian people alone. We have got no beef with the Russian people. They didn't do anything. They don't, the most Russian people don't want this. I would say the vast majority don't want this. They don't want to send soldiers into harm's way to be killed and mangled. They don't want to have to pay 100% more for food and imports, which they're not even going to get anymore. No more imports. I think the average Russian person doesn't want this. And so I wish that we had done this before, which, and possibly, you know, sent Putin a message, how costly this would be in a real way that he went to understand it. So he wouldn't have invaded. But we, he has invaded. And so now we have to say, okay, what's the strategy going forward? And the strategy has to be to raise the price as high as possible. And most importantly, to just deplete Vladimir Putin of resources so that this war becomes so expensive and he just doesn't have the money because the central bank reserves are frozen, the exports are not generating any income, no more foreign direct investment at all. And so we're in a situation where he just can't afford it anymore.",https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NDK8QAnFNxU,50,2022-10-07 17:25:54
2834," you You person it about sure talked about a little bit with your firm and all of your trials and tribulations in Russian investing there. After your ordeal battling the government in Russia, you became a global champion of the Magnitsky Act, which allows the U.S. and other countries to sanction foreign officials involved in human rights abuses, validating or infuriating to see the need for such laws at a time like this. Both, but most interestingly, so we, the Magnitsky Act works for human rights abusers and corrupt officials. It was passed in 2012 and it completely blew, Putin blew his top when he saw this happen. And I mean, really just like, I mean, in the most emotional way, he banned the adoption of Russian orphans by American families and retaliation. The orphans that were being adopted were the sick ones, the ones who were not well. And Americans would still take these children back to America and nursing to health and they attended to die in the orphanages. So he's effectively sentencing orphans to death in his own country as a retaliation against the Magnitsky Act. And everybody was scratching their heads and saying, why is this guy reacting so harshly? And the reason is we can see it today, literally today, which is that this was the basis for which all of future sanctions were modeled on asset freezes and travel bands. And every, every person that's now going to be sanctioned will basically be sanctioned on the basis of the Magnitsky Act. And the reason he was so upset was because he knew he's not stupid. He knew that eventually the Magnitsky Act would come for his money. And so there's a direct line between the murder of Sergey Magnitsky, my campaign for the Magnitsky Act, the sanctions that were put in place and the sanctions that are now going to go after Putin's money. In 2018, Putin mentioned you by name during a press conference with then President Trump offering to allow US investigators to interview 12 Russian intelligence agents identified by Robert Mueller's probe in exchange for allowing Russian intelligence to question you and others close to you. Trump, let her call it an incredible offer. What is your view of the way Trump reset US relations with Russia? And do you think it affects the way the world approaches Russia today? Well, thankfully, I think that the Trump situation was an aberration. I don't think it was like a permanent damage to the relations between the United States and the rest of the world. And I don't think it certainly hurt the US credibility for a short period of time. But we can see right now in the multilateral approach towards sanctioning Russia that things continue to work as they should. I mean, it's pretty horrifying the idea that an American president would hand over me and a bunch of US government officials to Putin because Putin asked for that. I mean, it's just unbelievable, really. And it also seems pretty unbelievable. It took him four days to walk it back. And it was only after the Senate planned had a vote together and not to hand us over. And they voted 98 to zero about 20 minutes before the vote Trump through his press secretary declined Putin's offer. But if Trump had been reelected, so that was during the Mueller probe. So if, and so he was sort of under the spotlight as far as Russia goes, if he was reelected, I wouldn't have been able to.",https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NDK8QAnFNxU,51,2022-10-07 17:29:16
2835," So that was during the Mueller probe. So if, and so he was sort of under the spotlight as far as Russia goes, if he was reelected, I wouldn't have been able to travel back to the United States because surely he would have handed me over to Putin. And so I, from a personal safety standpoint, I breathed an enormous sigh of relief when he was defeated. And final question, going forward, what sort of work do you see yourself doing and what sort of legacy do you see yourself leaving? Well, the legacy that I've, I'm in the process of leaving is a legacy where Sergei Magnitsky's name is on legislation, not just in the United States, but now in 34 countries, sanctioning human rights abusers, not just in Russia, but all over the world. And so the Magnitsky Act now applies to Chinese officials involved in the genocide in Jingjiang is involved in sanctions, Iranians, Myanmar officials, all sorts of bad actors all over the world. And it creates a big disincentive to human rights abusers and to kleptocrats. And it also creates some redress for victims. And for me, the Sergei Magnitsky's murder is a burden, a burden of guilt that I carry with me everywhere because he was my responsibility and he was killed in my service. And so every day that I do something to enhance his legacy and to do that in a way that potentially will offer other victims redress and save lives is sort of my project. And as more and more countries do this, then the next step is to have more and more countries use the Magnitsky Act against bad actors. And so Sergei Magnitsky will from the grave and from heaven be helping everybody else out in their terrible moments of distress.

If you've been watching influencers, I'm Andy Cerwer. We'll see you next time. Music Welcome back to Yahoo Finance Live, everyone. We've reached this the top of the 10 AM hour Brad Smith here in studio with Julie Hyman, Brian Sazi on assignment, as we'll say from home today. Happy Friday to you all here on this jobs Friday. Let's take a look at where the market sand following that jobs report earlier, which was just a little bit hotter than expectations. We're taking a look at the Dow, the Nasdaq and the S&P 500 all lower on the day. The Dow is lower by a little more than 480 points to the downside of about 1.6%. The S&P 500, they're also seeing that deep in the red right now by roughly 2% that looks like it. And then additionally, the Nasdaq composite, you're seeing that down by about 312 points and taking a deeper dive into that jobs report. Of course, later on in this show, we're going to have set criteria of labor, Marty Walsh going to join us momentarily to get reaction from the White House. So stay tuned for that conversation. Plus, it's jeans Friday, wherever you find yourself in the world. But Levi's under pressure this morning after the denim maker cut its outlook. We're going to speak to the companies CFO to discuss its latest earnings report as you get ready to put the jorts away. And an unprecedented move in the movie world, Netflix is set to show the knives out sequel in major theaters one month before it's streaming release. We're going to discuss what that means for the streaming space, all of that much more.",https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NDK8QAnFNxU,52,2022-10-07 17:34:06
2836," to show the knives, out sequel and major theaters one month before it's streaming release. We're going to discuss what that means for the streaming space. All of that much more coming up during this 10 a.m. hour. But for much more on today's markets, let's get on over to Yahoo Finance and Nez Faray as we're about 30 minutes into today's trading session and Nez on Over To You. And Brad, you mentioned the losses after that jobs report and we are still seeing the S&P 500 down 2%. But if we just pull up a five day chart because of Monday and Tuesday's rally, we are set to end the week in the green for the major averages because of those days. If we stay at this space, let's see what happens throughout the day. Looking also at the 10 year treasury note, that's higher up 7 basis points at 3.9%. We saw that 10 year treasury yield go higher after that jobs report. Also the US dollar index that moved higher after the jobs report as well. Want to point out what's happening with Bitcoin because we did see Bitcoin moving to the downside earlier. And then looking at the sector action, we're watching the high growth names that are really under pressure. So you're watching tech consumer discretionary materials are leading to the downside over on the NASDAQ 100. The mega caps, as I mentioned, Tesla down 3% Amazon also lower in video down 5% and the semiconductors are really seeing some pressure today after that revenue warning from AMD. Finally, I want to mention what's happening with the home builders because of higher interest rates and what this how this affects the home builders. Well, you're looking at them in the red right now, especially home builders and also companies that have to do with market risk. Yeah, definitely anything interest rate sensitive is is in focus here today. Thanks so much, you know, as well as continue our conversation on the job report and the market implications joining us now. John Tobin, epic investment partners managing director and senior equity research analyst. John, it's good to see you. So as we look at this good news is bad news kind of jobs day. I mean, is that just very simply how we should look at it here that the Fed is going to be raising rates for the foreseeable future? I think that's right. I think, you know, the market it seems in certainly the past few days we've seen evidence of it. It's looking for some reason, something to latch on to to justify a rally. They're hoping for some evidence that the Fed's about to pivot the Reserve Bank of Australia's move early in the week ignited that hope. And even though the Fed speakers all week long pushed back on that pretty hard, I think the evidence today is from the job report job the job's market still remains strong and the Fed still has work to do. Now, as we've talked about it in our shop this morning on our morning call, there is clearly evidence of deceleration here. So if you're trying to find some good news here, the numbers are moving in the right direction. This is a 263K increase in jobs, but it shows continual deceleration over time. Average hourly earnings are up, but again, evidence of deceleration. So I think the main takeaway is things are moving in the right direction, but the Fed still has a lot of work to do. Rates are still going higher. So, John, should the other takeaway here, just looking at the market action in the early going is for investors to fade any rallies? Well, I think that's, I mean, that would be my personal view that with each attempt to rally into this, I've continued to make the case that I don't see what the foundation is for a strong rally, for a sustainable rally. I mean, if you think about what the drivers of equity market returns are, it's earnings growth, it's dividends, and it's multiple expansion. And if rates are going higher, that's a headwind for multiple expansion. And if the economy is slowing down and maybe headed for a recession, that's a headwind for earnings growth. So, the main underpinnings that would support a sustainable rally just aren't there. I think to me, this is a market environment where investors need to keep some defensive exposure in their asset allocation. We've had a conversation, especially around the shift in the types of jobs, the employment situation really lays out, kind of sector by sector here. But for some of those businesses that are looking at the amount of people that post pandemic, they've realized they actually need to run the business. It also becomes a question of where some of those...",https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NDK8QAnFNxU,53,2022-10-07 17:38:04
2837," businesses that are looking at the amount of people that post pandemic they've realized they actually need to run the business. It also becomes a question of where some of those employees will find employment elsewhere and in different sectors as well as many people have upskilled over the course of the pandemic. I mean does that drastically shape everything from wages all the way to what a solid baseline sector by sector actually looks like? Well you're absolutely right that there are some sector trends that we're noticing here where there's strength, where there's weakness, there's strength and leisure and hospitality, there's weakness in other sectors, there's weakness in energy, there's weakness in things related to building and construction of course. But and it's disruptive for the economy as you point out that people are far looking for jobs and looking to move perhaps into new areas where there is job growth. So there is that friction but that's not really something new that's or necessarily a post-pandemic phenomenon. I think that's that's historically bend the case. There's always a friction as as people move and try to direct themselves into the areas where there's greater employment opportunities. John bottom line when it comes to these markets I think people are trying to figure out what the heck to do right now and you have some interesting stuff in your portfolio including consumer staples things like Home Depot and Walmart. Do you think that a company like Walmart for example has gotten past its inventory troubles and is still going to be able to benefit as we head towards the holiday season? So you know it's absolutely true that as the retailers have inventory issues to grapple with and I wouldn't want to say that for Walmart that it's all said and done and and they're behind it. I think our view on Walmart is more is more of a basic fundamental view that this is a business that historically is resilient in economic downturns and if we're looking at a slower economic environment and we're looking at the possibility of a recession and we think about where are we most likely to have the stocks and the companies that are most likely to hold up best in that environment. It is some of the defensive sectors, the traditional defensive sectors like staples, the Walmart's healthcare for example utilities, another area where we have exposure even but at the same time even some financials will hold up better regional banks. There'll probably be some evidence of weakening the loan demand and some pick up in credit quality issues but we think that they're at a very strong position with good credit statistics today and with very strong capital positions today. So there are several defensive sectors that we have exposure to and we think these are sectors. It won't mean that they won't feel any pressure from a slowing economy but rather that they will be more resilient in the face of a challenging market environment. Just trying to tie both inflation and employment together because one of that is an input cost into the prices that consumers are having to pay as well. For consumers and of course everybody who's in this economy and is working there's still money that is going out the door out of your pockets both on a necessity basis or on a discretionary basis so with that in mind where then are we going to expect to see kind of wages stabilized at the same time that the Fed is trying to see inflation stabilized. Well the Fed is clearly trying to get inflation down and trying to get a way to growth down and what that really means even though they don't like to say it so much out loud is they need the unemployment rate to go up and they need jobs growth to slow pretty dramatically. So but you're right this implies pressure on the consumers so there'll be pressure on the consumer in terms of weaker jobs growth. There'll be people more people unemployed. There's more pressure on consumer pocketbooks because of inflationary pressures what people are paying at the pump for gasoline what they're paying for their energy bill when they get their connet bill every month so there's pressure on the consumer. This is all part of the of the narrative of an economy that is being forced to slow down by Fed policy. John if I'm correct you have some exposures to some big cap tech names an apple Microsoft and IBM even a broadcom but in light of this AMD warning which is pretty pretty shocking I mean I missed their expectations by a billion dollars on sales are even trying to rotate out of big cap tech or you gonna just just try to just survive this this volatility. Well you know the truth is in the strategy that that I help run",https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NDK8QAnFNxU,54,2022-10-07 17:42:28
2838," rotate out of the cap tech or you're going to just try to just survive this this volatility. Well, you know, the truth is in the strategy that that I help run, tech is a significant underweight for us. We actually have a hard time finding tech names that fit the characteristics that we see. We're looking for companies that have growing cash, they attract them, growing dividends, and otherwise use cash to distribute the shareholders through share buybacks. So we do have exposure to some of those tech names that you mentioned, but we are underweight. We're underweight those names, kind of by definition, underweight Apple. Apple's over 4% of the index. So while we have Apple in the portfolio, it's an underweight apple. And while we have tech in the portfolio, it's an underweight to the tech sector. I'm sure that there's some names that we look at and will probably trim them and maybe even exit them, but there's nothing that we're thinking about doing right this minute. All right, we'll leave it there. John Tobin, Epoch, Investment Partners, Managing Director, and Profoli Manager. Good to see you. Have a good weekend. Thanks for having me. Appreciate it. Yep. All right. Before we head to break, let's pull up shares of Target, which are getting a bullish call by Goldman Sachs retail analyst Kate McShane. Shane is reiterating by rating on Target, and issuing a $205 price target. The upbeat call comes as Target is warned on sales three times since March 1st, only to the economic slowdown. It says McShane. We think despite the missteps Target has taken this year on both merchandising and diamond, it remains a retail secular winner, which should support the stock. We'll take more into Target on October 17th. When Target Chairman Seal Brian Cornell chats with me at the Yow Finance All Market Summit, definitely looking forward to that chat in that day. All right, coming up, US Labor Secretary Marty Walsh, will join us to talk all things jobs report. Don't go anywhere. Welcome back. Job growth, beating estimates by 8,000 in September as high rates and elevated costs per major US economy.",https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NDK8QAnFNxU,55,2022-10-07 17:46:44
2839," Welcome back. Job growth beating estimates by 8,000 in September as high rates and elevated costs per made the U.S. economy. But how will a stronger than expected labor report guide the Fed, all of this percolating through the markets today? Labor Secretary Marty Walsh is joining us now from Washington, D.C. Mr. Secretary, great to see you as always. And so this number showing growth today in places like labor and hospitality, I'm always curious what you're hearing in your conversations with corporate leaders around the country, where they're having still trouble, because on the other hand, we're also seeing some industries cut back. Give us a little colorist to what you're hearing. Yeah, it really depends on where we are. You know, I think one of the areas when you think about cybersecurity and the tech space, that's where a lot of companies are still growing. Some have cut back. So we talk about how do we create programs so we can get people skilled without working with community colleges in particular, working with colleges in the country, and really thinking about what employers are talking about now is not about the job market of right now, but they're talking about participation and anticipated growth in their companies and making sure they have the skill to work for us to be able to keep up with that growth. Mr. Secretary, is it a little surprising that we're still seeing some strong job growth like this in upward revisions to prior months, at the same time the Federal Reserve is really trying to slow the economy down? When you see the areas that we saw growth in this month, and we saw the hospital industry and medical growth fully recovered from pre-pandemic, you know, you're seeing that a lot of people hiring in those hospitals because there's a lot of electric elective procedures that were put off, so they're hiring more people in hospitals. We're seeing an increase in manufacturing, certainly more jobs than pre-pandemic and manufacturing, and I think a lot of that has to do with what happened during the pandemic with supply chain. We're seeing more and more companies want to create more and build more here in the United States. We're seeing the President really focusing on that as well, doing more in the United States. We're seeing in this particular drop month, we didn't see, we saw actually a decrease in governments hiring around education, so that's one number that was low, but companies are still looking for people. You're still hearing it every day. I mean, as you mentioned earlier, I think you might have been Julie saying, some people do eye-cutting back on their employees because they're anticipating what the future might bring, but a lot of companies are still hiring. So with a cut back on employees yet hiring also decreasing or decelerating, if you will, what does that spell out for the people who, during the great resignation, had put in that two-week notice and said, I've got another offer somewhere else. I've got a greater offer on the table. Is this still a job hopper's market, or from your perspective, is it something where that is decelerating so much to the point where it's very much shifting and employee should be considering exactly where they make those moves? I still think it's a good market for employees to look at for better opportunities, but I think what's happening is employers are realizing now they have to do a little more to keep their employees. Employers don't want to hire somebody and then have to six months lose them to another place for higher salary or better benefits. So I think employers are starting to, when I go around talking to companies, they're really looking to hybrid work, how does that work? They're looking at opportunities, childcare, and other things to encourage people to come into their companies. And I think companies are adapting to the change in the environment around workers today. And some of the folks we're talking to are saying some of these changes are going to be long-standing, right? That we're seeing a more profound shift in the workforce because of increased flexibility of being able to work from home, because of sort of life decisions people made during the pandemic, maybe some people taking early retirement, et cetera. How is the administration thinking about some of those longer-term changes and addressing some of those longer-term trends? Well, I think one of the biggest things that President did in the bill back better legislation that didn't go to the Senate, child care, paid family leave, sick time, medical leave, all of those issues are very important to families today. And I think a lot of companies, some of them, getting there on their own, but child care is a very complicated issue. And I think that we as a country have to think about and rethink about the way that our child care system works because it's expensive. And we're having a high-time, retaining workers in that industry because we don't pay them enough to take care of our kids. So I think as we think about long-term, that's going to be one investment on the federal level, but also on the private sector. So I think, you know, pre-piaendemic, we didn't hear about the changes in companies. These companies would change the way they did all right.",https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NDK8QAnFNxU,56,2022-10-07 17:51:24
2840," investment on a federal level, but also on the private sector. So I think, you know, pre-pandemic, we didn't hear about the changes in companies. Companies would change the way they did office space, open areas, things like that. But I think because of the pandemic, it's made us all really think about the future. And what we're doing here at the Department of Labor, we're working with companies. I don't think I have the right to tell a company how to operate that company. That's not my role. My role is to try and assist them and help with them and share best practices where I can and what other companies are doing. Mr. Secretary, last time we spoke to you about a month ago on jobs day, we're still looking to in analyzing the quiet quitting movement. Now a month later, I have a big problem is this in the country. I don't, I mean, I haven't, I haven't really heard about it from companies. I know that it's being reported in the press. I've talked to a lot of companies in the country and I haven't heard about that. Certainly, that's a concern if it continues on because when people hire people, they expect them to do, you know, days work for days pay. And I think that that's something that we have to continue and encourage. And but when I talk, when I, as I've gone around the country this last month and I've done a lot of trips, no, no, no company has approached me on this quiet quitting idea. And Secretary, watch finally, I want to ask you about the real strike in which you intervened last month and helped avert that strike. That was sort of an 11th hour agreement. I know it was sort of a marathon process, right, of working through it with them. What are some of the lessons learned from that? For example, would you get involved earlier in the future to sort of not have a down to the wire situation? If I'm asked to get involved earlier, I would certainly in the potent negotiation. I'm not involved at the table, but I certainly am talking to both sides to make sure that encouraging both sides and they already asked often encourage them to stay at the table and get this contract done. In the real strike, you know, this was a two-year period that they weren't able to get an agreement where the president had to appoint an emergency board to come up with the P.E.B. They came up with the recommendations and we built off of that. But certainly, you know, I think when you get to that point, there's a breakdown. So I've offered to anybody, anybody who wants if they want me to get involved or get us involved. But I think mediation is important as well. If you have two sides that kids can't get to an agreement, my recommendation is try and bring a mediator in. This is not to be me, but bring a mediator in just to keep the conversation moving forward. And Labor Secretary, just while we have you, we do know that President Biden issued a presidential proclamation pardoning federal convictions for simple marijuana possession defenses. These are people that have been barred in some cases from getting back into the workforce because of these convictions and offenses. Where will the Labor Department continue to do work at the state level, even, to ensure that there are opportunities for people to get occupations within the workforce? Yeah, we have to make sure what the President did yesterday is carried out. And too many of the people that are being pardoned by the President yesterday are people of color, in particular, the African-American community. And this has been a challenge in our country for a long time, where people were convicted of a minor marijuana offense that had a record. And I commend the President for his actions yesterday. And the folks that are out there, we're going to work with them to make sure that they can get into good employment, that this is not an impediment to their ability to get into the middle class and get a good paying job. U.S. Labor Secretary Marty Walsh, pleasure to have you on the show and thanks as always for taking the time. Thank you. You guys coming up.

Several employees will receive 12 weeks of salary that folks were leaving plus an additional week for each year of tenure at the company and a one-year extension for exercising stock options. So, September was a rough month all around for stocks. And one company in particular saw a significant drop after withdrawing its 2023 forecast, sending a volatile operating environment. We're talking about FedEx here, folks. And that's what Yowfine's Jaroblickery joins us with today for another edition of Then and Now Jaroblick. That's right, let's turn the clock back to the 1970s where FedEx or Federal Express got its start founded in 1971 in Little Rock, Arkansas. The company officially began operations out of Memphis in 73. And fun fact, the name Federal Express, it actually came about because a founder hoped it would attract the business of the Federal Reserve. It always comes back to the Fed, doesn't it, guys? That original Memphis team consisted of fewer than 400 people yet in its first night of operations, FedEx delivered 186 packages to 25 different countries.

2842," First night of operations, FedEx delivered 186 packages to 25 different countries. Or cities, excuse me, by 1975 FedEx started installing drop boxes, and we began accustomed to seeing those in businesses. The overnight letter was introduced in 1981, and by 1983 FedEx made American history by becoming the first company to make $1 billion in revenue within 10 years of startup without mergers or acquisitions. In 1978, FedEx went public on the New York Stock Exchange under the ticker that we know FDX and at IPO, at $24 per share. Split adjusted, you got to divide by 32, it is 75 cents. Now, back to the present, we had that drastic mid-September drop of more than 20 percent. And now FedEx is trading around $155 per share. Down more than 50 percent from its May 2021 record high, near $320 per share. So let's take a deep dive into where the company is right now. And on our Dow Jones heat map, actually this is a transports, Dow Jones transports, year to date, we can see FedEx down about 40 percent if we sort by performance. We can see kind of towards the downside. In fact, only jet blue not really appear is down more than that, but you compare it to UPS, which is down 24 percent. And we do possibly have some execution issues. Now, Brian, I know that you've been really following FedEx and especially its guidance as of that last huge drop rate here. And what it foretends for the earning season that we are about to jump into right now. Yeah, Jerry, you really got the sense, alpha, that FedEx, worrying that the economy is slowing down pretty sharply, but to your point, execution has been a big problem with this company, maybe to an extent that hasn't been seen over the prior 25 years. I got to tell you, you cover this space in these companies better than I do, and more closely, but I just know that FedEx kind of releases outside the normal earnings window and perennially, quarter after quarter, they cite these dollar effects problems. And that's just not just this year. This is going years back. So I think there is a temptation to perhaps say that this is an idiosyncratic event. This is particular to that company, but you can't ignore the weight of the evidence with what we've seen of the earnings and the projections for them that we've seen so far. AMD, the latest shot off the bow. Great work, Jerry. I really enjoy these. I know a lot of work goes into them. Thanks so much.

2843," Music Leave I strats out with the beat on earnings and its latest quarter. For a stronger year's dollar, weakness in Europe and ongoing supply and change just ruptions, let the jeans giant to cut its outlook. With more on this, we have Harmeet Singh, Levi Strauss, CFO for more on this quarter. Harmeet, great to get some time with you. I want to go across the pond on Europe. So I would say some surprising results at a Levi's Europe. Did that business how it performs sales and repression? That surprised you? As the high Brian, good morning. As the quarter progressed, it did surprise us. And as you know, we have a very strong brand. As you think about the quarter overall, our quarter was fairly solid, despite all the incremental headwinds. We were up 7% in constant currency with BDPS. And the Levi's brand, just to the strongest quarter three, revenues in a decade. And so as you think about our European business, the weather was fairly warm. And the consumer there is under pressure. And so what we did as collectively as a team is we quickly geared up into action. And looked at discretionary costs. We focused on our direct to consumer business because we have a diversified business model. They are parts of the world that are really strong like Asia and Latin America. And they resisted strong growth. We also had some supply chain disruption, especially in the US, which impacted the business. And so as we thought about the year, we said, okay, let's think about three things that impact the results. One is stronger dollar. The second is supply chain disruptions. And the third is, you know, softening consumer demand in the western part of the world. But if you think of Europe brand, there are parts of Europe that were fairly strong. UK and Spain, you know, were actually countries that grew. I think where we were softwares in Germany and France, the brand still fairly strong, you know, globally as well as in Europe. When you talk about softening demand, Harmeet, is there a relative point that you think back to where this period is analogous to? You know, I would say, you know, we've been as a company, we've been through, you know, good times and tough times. And I would say, as you think about softening demand, you know, I was not here in 0809, but you know, the financial crisis at that time did have an impact. As a company, you know, our toughest period was during the pandemic, where all our stores were shut for about 90 days. And we lost a billion dollars, you know, just like that. But we've as a management team, and I'm really proud of the management team that's been around for a while. We actually geared up into action and said, okay, how do we manage through the crisis? But more importantly, how do we emerge stronger? And then in 2021, we registered our strongest financial aid in a decade. So as we think about, you know, the next few quarters and as, you know, if things do tighten, that's what we're going to be doing. We're going to be thinking about how do we manage through the immediate crisis, which isn't the near term. But as a company and a brand, you know, we will get out of it and we get out of it stronger. You know, some of you that I invested in June, we laid out longer term targets. These are what we call not start targets, but still get to and focused and delivering them over the longer term. And emerging out of this as a stronger company. I mean, I appreciate the focus on the longer term. I want more shorter term question, which is after the inventory build.",https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NDK8QAnFNxU,60,2022-10-07 18:08:14
2844," a below full price, you know, would be impacted about 100 basis points. In Cauter 3, there will be a little bit more about 130, 140 basis points. We have built that into our guidance in Q4, but overall, we still think we will end the year at about, you know, 400 basis points higher than 2019. And that just evidences the strength of the brand. A U R, for example, which is the average unit retail price in Cauter 3, we're still up in the mid to high single digit. That means pricing that we have taken to offset cost is ticking. And our revenues were up slightly, sorry, our unit growth was up slightly. So overall, the brand's really strong. Dockerers, as we have diversified, also grew a lot double digit. And beyond yoga is just starting. We just open our first store in Santa Monica in LA. And if that does well, then we can add a lot of many stores in the active way segment. So overall, our business is fairly diversified, Brad. And our thinking is that we will move through this promotional environment by ensuring that our brand continues, brand equity continues to build. Hey, Harvey, it's Brian here again. You know, I'm a loyal Levi's consumer. But I don't know. I don't know if I'm buying these new baggy dad jeans that you're bringing to market. I don't know if you realize how strong I work for this physique. And those pants are not going to show it off. I got to be honest with you. And you know, the fact is the real democratic brand. We have something for everybody. So if the baggy dad, you know, Jesus, not what you like to wear, it doesn't fit your style. You can wear the tapered look, you can wear the slimmer look. There is something for you, Brad, and for everybody else, across all age demographics, at Levi's. And that's what we are proud to ensure that every consumer gets what he or she needs. Yeah, Brian, the size has got to rock the jorts to show off the gowns. Yeah, he's got to show off the leg. No, look, I'm still the skinny jeans guy. I mean, you got to show off the glutes. You put that time in. I want to show him off on a nice pair of jeans. I don't know. I don't know. There was a little out of fashion here, so we'll take this off like, we'll take this off like, pardon me. It's great to see it. It's not only jeans that you can get from Levi's. You can get more if I had to tell look. You know, I'm wearing a wonderful Levi's shirt, you know, gives a casual look because we continue to bleed those becoming more casual. And the worst becoming more casual brands like us that offer more of a head to toe look, you know, are the ones that will lead the judge. Yes, no matter which of the numbers of the models that you wear on the bottom, I have to say we were expecting either the leather jacket or the jean jacket, Harmeet. So it's good to know you're still wrapping on top with the white shirt. Harmeet's saying great for catching up with you, Levi Strauss, CFL. Thanks, Julie. Thanks.

2845," eyes Stocks continue to push lower right now after we got that hotter than estimated, better than estimated jobs report, but that implies that the Fed is going to have no reason to stop raising rates in the short term if inflation, especially if inflation, keeps up as it has been and indeed we saw year over year average hourly earnings rising by 5% as part of the jobs report. Right now the NASDAQ leading the decline down by more than 2.5% that is really characteristic of what we've seen as of late with big cap tech suffering on days like this. And as we just mentioned indeed the jobs report showed continued strong employment. Let's take a front line look at those numbers and especially what it means for small businesses joining us now as John Waldman, HomeBase, Founder and CEO, HomeBase which is a software platform for small businesses essentially manages time clocks, HR, etc. John thanks for being here appreciate it. It's really interesting you guys did some recent survey work and you found 64% of the small businesses you talked to said their financial performance would be better a year from now than it is right now. That seems to fly in the face of everything a lot of what we're hearing right? Yeah good morning joy it's good to see you so we did find that we serve over a hundred thousand small businesses we serve over two million workers and when we surveyed those small businesses they were in fact more optimistic now than they were over the summer by six percentage points in terms of thinking about their expansion over the next year or two. Now that seems kind of weird in the face of everything that we're reading in the headlines but when it comes to small businesses you have to remember this is in the context of such a hard two and a half years first with COVID and forced closures and then into this just truly dramatic labor shortage that they've been living through over the last year and a half so it is actually great to see those signs of optimism from small businesses. What is the experience that you have with those small businesses in terms of how they are navigating this environment right now especially as many of them are trying to best protect the business profitability while at the same time also trying to make sure that they are competitive with wooing the next generation of talent or just workers employees for their businesses. Yeah I first as much as we've been talking about the labor shortage over the last year I don't think we can talk about it this is truly been an incredibly difficult thing for small businesses to deal with and we see that on both sides you have small businesses that are really healthy that can't expand in the way that they used to you know when we look at our data from across over a hundred thousand businesses small businesses are not expanding at the rate that they were.",https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NDK8QAnFNxU,62,2022-10-07 18:19:36
2846," that can't expand in the way that they used to. You know, when we look at our data from across over 100,000 businesses, small businesses are not expanding at the rate that they were in 2019. On the flip side, it's actually gotten so bad that we've seen small businesses closed out because they can't hire. There's talking to one of our customers up in Seattle, runs a restaurant, owns a restaurant that had been operating for 10 plus years, and she shut it down, not because the demand wasn't there, not because of inflation, but because she could not hire people to work this business, and she was tired. She and the other owners were tired of filling all the extra shifts. So this is real. This is a real challenge to small businesses, and if we're going to solve this, it's going to take a lot of different things, including making these jobs more attractive. John, have you had to slow hiring at home base? Yeah, that's a great question. We like a lot of tech companies had to revisit some of our plans. Hiring plans coming into this year. We haven't done a layoff or anything like that, but we certainly looked at next year and thought about our own. What can we do? How do we do more with less? We see and our customers doing that for the last two years, and we were asking ourselves the same question. So yeah, we've slowed down our hiring plans. And John, what you just mentioned that Seattle anecdote is interesting to me, because Seattle is one of the places that passed a minimum, a higher minimum wage, right? So you would think that among other things, higher wages would be getting those workers back in. Is it just not working like it used to in? If it's not, what are you hearing from your customers about why it's not? Yeah, well, we're hearing it from our customers, and we're also hearing it from workers. I mean, we're serving two million plus workers, and we're serving them regularly. Listen, wages are always at the top of the list of things that hourly workers care about, but it's not the only thing that workers care about. And we're all staring at the same data on labor force participation and seeing that continue to take down. And I think we all have to take a hard look at this on how are we making these jobs more attractive. Wage rate is part of that, and we have seen that go up with inflation. We have seen that go up in the job posts that are going out and the new hires that people are making through home base. We have a hiring tool that allows people to post jobs, so we can see all of that data. But what we also see in talking to workers is it's not the only thing they care about. They care about flexibility. They care about their opportunity for learning and development. They care about the connection to the business. And this is something that actually small businesses have a great advantage over larger businesses. And finally, John, full disclosure here, we were at a work dinner recently, and I heard you talk about that this is not a short-term problem, that this sort of, especially entry-level workforce is going to be a problem for decades, right? And I guess part of it has to do with population growth, but talk us through that. Yeah, we have been through a pretty traumatic, dramatic two and a half years in the labor market here. You know, we have seen millions of people die. We have seen immigration slow down. We have seen a lot of people leave the labor force. That is a pretty profound impact. But the net results of this of a labor shortage is not going away if you are reliant on entry-level work. In 2027, we reached peak high school graduate in this country. After that, demographics are not on our side here for entry-level work. What that means is that the challenges that small businesses and every business are going through now, we're going to be dealing with that for a long time. And so it comes back to how are we making these jobs more attractive? You know, there's only a couple of solutions for this. Obviously, technology is one of them. How are solutions like us at home base helping teams do more with less? There's obviously immigration, but there's also labor force participation. And so that's what we're really focused on. How do we make these jobs more attractive? How do we help small businesses recruit folks back into the labor force? Because ultimately, we're going to have to do that in the face of declining demographics. Absolutely. John Waldman, home base CEO and founder. Thanks so much for taking the time.

2847," Thanks so much for taking the time. Here with us this morning on Yahoo Finance. You guys coming up? The sequel of Knives Out is coming to the big screen. We've got the details on the other side. The short break. Let's go to BOY music starts. You hear the music, you know what time it is, time for a couple of times. We're going to start with this. Netflix heads to the big screen. The cycle of knives out will be released in theaters for one week around Thanksgiving before debuting on the streaming platform. Interesting. This is the first for the company which has long been against giving theaters and early release here. However, it's done, tandem releases in the past. Mudbound was one of those theatrical productions that also released in tandem on Netflix. One of the first I believe that they actually tested with that. And knives out, I've seen the first one. I think this is so good. Yes. I'm excited about this. I don't know if that'll go and see it in the theater, but definitely what's coming out one week right? Right, exactly. So I don't know what the impetus is. As? Hey, if the James Bond guy's in it, I'm watching. Never heard of this thing before, but James Bond, I liked it. You never saw the last knives out? Never even heard of it. You guys see that. I'm excited about this. I like James Bond. I like Daniel Craig. I'm from James Bond in this movie. Let me just tell you that. I got you. Yeah. Yeah, definitely. Oh, that was it. Okay, sauce. All right. Let's, I think I'm doing the attessa and trucks for the holidays. Elon Musk says Tesla will deliver for semi truck ever to Pepsi Co in December. Pepsi ordered 100 trucks in 2017. What production was expected to begin in 2019. And this is quite the truck. I remember when Tesla initially unbelleded, believe it, it's supposed to get 500 miles in a full charge. It is a very, it is a very intimidating looking truck. But I think really it's going to give a good snap to snap shot into what is possible with electric electric trucking and how much perhaps more infrastructure charging infrastructure. We still need in this country. It's coming, but we still need it. And we need it now. Yeah. And this not to be confused with the cyber truck that had a rock thrown at it and still had the window cracked. This is the semi version that Tesla back in 2017 had racked up early orders from the likes of JB Hunter, I believe it was.",https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NDK8QAnFNxU,64,2022-10-07 18:28:32
2848," They all had the window cracked. This is the semi version that Tesla back in 2017 had racked up early orders from the likes of JB Hunt, I believe it was. Pepsi, Walmart, they had some major purchase orders. Then it just came down to delivery. And at first, I believe that timeline was more closer to 2020 that eventually got pushed out. Yeah, and the Cybertruck VT's was coming too. So there was also a little bit of baby news on that, I guess. All right, coming up in the next hour, you got lots more jobs coverage coming your way. Even as we watch the markets go down, we will all be back in the same location on Monday as we will see whether this selling continues. Welcome to Yahoo Finance. It's 11 a.m. in New York City. I'm Jared Glickery. And here's what I am watching today. Good news is bad news. Stocks slump as a jobs report misses expectations, but it's a lower unemployment rate that gives a fed more food for thought. It may be space to hike further. The housing market increasingly looks like the first dominant of fall amid declining prices and rising mortgage rates. We're going to speak with the wet bush securities analysts on the outlook for home builders. And could President Biden's move on marijuana change lives and will it impact his standing ahead of the midterms? We're going to take a look at the stocks moving in that space. But first, let's take a look at the stocks after that jobs report. And this is a big one of the week here. And we can see the Dow. Well, let's take a look. The Dow down just slightly here. Looks like it's off about 407 points, maybe a little bit more than slightly. We got the Nasdaq down about 2.5% and the S&P 500 down 1.8%. Now, the bond market, another story, guys. We've seen a lot of volatility in this space.",https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NDK8QAnFNxU,65,2022-10-07 18:32:36
2849," the NASDAQ down about 2.5% and the S&P 500 down 1.8%. Now the bond market, another story guys. We've seen a lot of volatility in this space. Let's see if we can get some quotes here. We've got the 10 year up to 3.89% and that is a six basis point move. We've got the five year at 4.13% in the 30 year at 3.86% and we want to get more on the market with, yeah, who finances, and S foray. And NAS, you were watching the report, you were charting the reaction to it live on the Wi-Fi interactive. You know, men's work by the way. You know, people's work out, let me get what are some of the numbers sticking out to you after we've had the opportunity to dig into the report? Well, I think that wage gains are still too hot, even though wage gains came down from August, so which was 5.2% to 5%. That is still too hot. That is to say that the Fed has run way to continue hiking rates. And that's why you saw the market reaction. I also thought it was interesting, the number of people who are employed part time for economic reasons. And we've got that number there on a chart for you. And this has seen a decline for the third straight month. So these are individuals that would have preferred to work full time, but they're working part time because either their hours got cut or because they're unable to find full time work. So that number is declining again, a sign that the labor market, while it may be softening a bit, it is still not softening enough for the Fed to pivot. All right. Thank you for that report here in Ness. And we want to continue the labor market discussion and conversation. Check on the roads ahead for the U.S. economy. And for that, we have Gus Vosher, joining us now, PNC Financial Services Group Chief Economist. And let me just ask you your initial reaction to the report Gus, and then anything that sticks out to you. Yeah, so this is a good report. The Fed wants to see slower job growth. I think they prefer to even see even slower job growth than this. But certainly we have seen job growth slow over the course of 2022, as the Fed has raised rates. And that should allow the labor market to cool off as we head into 2023. All right. And then we were just listening to it. And as give some of the statistics, so when you dig into the report, some of the demographic breakdowns may surprise people, maybe some reversals and trends, what did you pick out? Well, certainly we saw the labor force participation rate decline. That's bad news from the Fed's perspective. They want to see more people looking for work. Instead, we saw fewer people. And so that means a tight labor market. And so that makes it more difficult for the Fed. Means they may have to raise rates a bit more. On the other hand, we did see a bit softer wage growth down to, it slowed to 5% year over year, still higher than the Fed would like, but that's moving in the right direction. So what I think is we are seeing a cooling off in the labor market, but it remains too hot from the Fed's perspective. And they're going to need to raise rates more to cool off some of those inflationary pressures. We're seeing in the economy right now. And I've heard some economists calling this report a Goldilocks report. You look at the stock reaction. Definitely to the downside, but maybe that's the bad news. It's good news here because the Fed doesn't want to see stock prices go up. As some of the, I believe it was New Calcash Cari said definitively over a month ago, what are we to make of this in light of the bad news is good news is bad meme that kind of confuses people, especially some of us in the business sometimes. Yeah. So what we want is job growth that is slowing to a more sustainable pace. So, you know, even over the last three months, we've added about 370,000 jobs per month on average. The labor force just simply can't support that. So we need to see much slower job growth that's consistent with underlying growth in the population. We're not there yet. We're moving in the right direction. So, you know, obviously if we're adding a lot of jobs in the economy, that means more income, that means more consumer spending. But at the same time, it's contributing to high inflation. So what we want is okay news from the job market, not good news, but, you know, indications that job growth is slowing and that, you know, we are reaching an equilibrium where those wage pressures in the economy are lessening. And how about the other part of the Fed's mandate inflation? So we have maximum employment. And so, which degree to up half су – inside of big weekly. We're so sure thered. Sp Court has proven your desire to have this worse by calling it social support program on linked to government. And not going into financialaterial.",https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NDK8QAnFNxU,66,2022-10-07 18:38:06
2850," reaching an equilibrium where those wage pressures in the economy are lessening. And how about the other part of the Fed's mandate inflation? So we have maximum employment, stable prices, interpreted to mean 2% inflation, obviously far above that. But what are you expecting out of some of the readings? And how does that fit into the expectations? Everybody waiting with baited breath for that eventual Fed pivot? Yeah, no, we are starting to see inflation slow. I think it peaked over the summer. Obviously, we've seen a big drop in energy prices, although we'll have to see what happens with the new OPEC production cuts. Wage growth is slowing, so that should help bring down inflation. It's going to be difficult. We probably won't see that 2% inflation until sometime in early 2024. But we are moving in the right direction. I think the Fed wants to see both a slowing in the job market and indications that inflation is moving decisively towards 2% before they stop raising rates. I don't think that'll be some time until early in 2023. So if the Fed is going to be looking at the data as they come in and we need to see that slowing in inflation and slower job growth, if the Fed is going to let up. And you mentioned the energy market before. I'm staring at a WTI crude prices at above $91 per barrel. And it was about a week or two ago that it seemed to be about $8 fewer than that. And I'm just wondering, what do the current energy prices say to you? There are people hoping that there would be some mitigation to help out the consumers here. But we had OPEC plus step in, reduce their outlook or reduce what they say they're going to pump by 2.1 million barrels per day. They're already in deficit. What are you making of the energy market and its effect on the US economy here? Yeah, so obviously the OPEC production cuts are not good news for oil prices, for inflation in the United States. That being said, a lot of OPEC members were already below their quotas. And so I don't think we're going to see is that 2.1 barrel per day cut. But I think we're going to get less help on inflation from lower energy prices. But I think the other impacts of the Fed rate heights in terms of a slowing in job growth, a slowing in demand for consumer durables, that type of thing, that will help reduce in those inflationary pressures we're seeing in the economy, even if OPEC keeps production low. Even if lots of ifs in this business here appreciate your insights on this jobs Friday. Gus Foshe, PNC Financial Services Group, Chief Economist. All right, not the kind of cut you want. Let's take a look at these shares of Levi Strauss, the stock. Looks like it's down 9%. And that's after the clothing company beat earnings estimates, although reporting a miss on revenue, Levi noting continued supply chain disruptions primarily in the US. And that's resulting in estimated miss sales of approximately 30 to 40 million dollars. Now we spoke with Levi Strauss, the CEO, earlier today. And here's what he had to say about the company's road ahead. Let's take a listen. But the next few quarters, and if things do tighten, that's what we're going to be doing. We're going to be thinking about how do we manage through the immediate crisis, which isn't the near-term. But as a company and a brand, we will get out of it and we get out of it stronger. Now a fairly positive reaction from Levi's CFO, we're going to have to wait and see how things eventually shake up for the jeans giant. And tell you what, coming up after this collateral damage, the Fed might bring down the housing market to its knees in order to tame inflation. But does that mean a full-on crash? We're going to take a look at the investment picture for home builders next. The revenue and the use say the revenue is spreading a lot in the way we can. For the revenue, we are trying to make a big difference in that we are creating this policy. Let's look at the revenue. A production is the biggest investment in the part that hour and hour. But frankly, this is kind of a problem.",https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NDK8QAnFNxU,67,2022-10-07 18:41:39
2851," Wake up if you're okay. The blouse exhibition fades away. Because wearing a neat shirt will keep the attributes of the color grow. And it still makes sense. That was a picture of a promotional album princess Kong, which I never had figured behind it. Mom, where will I go? Of course mom. Yeah. Remember what we did for 2019 Selfie, so strong fingers after YouTube Welcome back. You can call it the perfect storm for the housing market. With high mortgage rates, a hawkish fed and recession on the horizon the last time home prices fell this quickly was during the global financial crisis. And though home prices have fallen from peaks in most major US cities, they're still some way above the 2019 levels. But home builder sentiment has been down dwindling. So what does the demand picture look like and what's the investment argument? Let's get into that conversation with Jamie Cannellus, Wed Bush Securities Senior Vice President of Equity Research. Let me just ask you the headline question here. What are we to make of the latest data here and with these soaring prices and home affordability in the crosshairs? Yeah, good morning. Thanks for having me. The longer term, I think the picture for shelter demand, whether that's for sale housing, for rent housing or multi-family for rent, we still think is very strong. And you look at rent growth, double digit percentages up pretty much the entire year for single family and for multi-family. And what we're hearing from the builders is that even with these higher mortgage rates, if they can find a way to get to the affordable payment, whether it's a function of buying down the rate a little bit, maybe taking a little bit off the base price of the home, if they can solve for that monthly payment that the buyer needs, then the buyer is still willing to purchase the home. We think also the demographic tailwind of the millennials that are strongly fully in household formation phase right now, along with the Gen Zs, which is also a very large population demographic. There's lots of tailwinds out there, but I think near term, you're absolutely right. This is a much trickier environment that I think the builders would have expected, especially given how strong the beginning of the year was. And there's almost a substitution effect going on that I've been able to glean from your nose, correct me if I'm wrong, but given the fact that there's not as much demand perhaps for new homes for people to buy rental properties, we're seeing a surge in demand as those as people are forced to pay a shall out money for rent instead of a mortgage, how are those trans looking? They're actually looking pretty good. And what we've heard from our home builders is that you're not going to completely replace consumer demand with the demand from the single family and the build of rent landlords. So youさん there today. Yep.",https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NDK8QAnFNxU,68,2022-10-07 18:46:23
2852," And what we've heard from our home builders is that, you're not gonna completely replace consumer demand with the demand from the single family and the build of rent landlords, but it is a more affordable option for people. And it also for the home builders recover. I give them an option to be able to sell maybe some homes that they couldn't sold in this mortgage rate environment. So I'm not gonna fully replace the consumer, but yes, I think the demand for housing, rental housing especially is out there, and it's providing affordable housing for the consumer. But also a means of selling some homes that the builders have, you know, maybe built an expectation, the consumer wanting them, and now they're gonna sell it to these institutional landlords. Either way, it's the emergence of this new fire class over the last decade. I think has been a win-win for both consumers as well as the building industry. That's interesting. When you say fire, talk about finance and insurance real estate, I believe, just in terms of input costs, we can look at the materials and we can get into lumber price, we can also get into wages that are paid. And I think that's appropriate to talk about because we just got a bunch of data this morning from the BLS on the job front. How about these sources of costs for these businesses? So for the, our thesis around the jobs that as long as we're seeing some type of continued job creation, that is gonna be good for demand, good for the industry because typically job growth leads us into recovery and job declines typically proceed tougher times for the builders. So good to see that we are still growing the jobs picture. In terms of input costs, what we've seen is that lumber prices, which have been extremely volatile for most of COVID, actually had a pretty benign quarter, this past quarter in the third quarter, lumber prices are down about 15%. So if you think about a little bit of a tailwind there from lower lumber cost, helping to offset some of the cost that the builders are having to pay to buy down mortgages and maybe cut prices a little bit. So a little bit of relief in a tougher environment. And then from on the wage front, what we've seen is that affordability up until, this meteoric rise in mortgage rates from 3%, 18 months ago to nearly 7%, I think this morning is where they're sitting. Even with the wage growth that we've seen out there, it's hard for affordability to keep up when you see that type of meteoric surge in mortgage rates. Yes, and let's get into some of the investment opportunities for people in the audience. So you have a couple of names that I'm interested in going over, Green Break Partners, Builders for Source, Building Products, Masonite, any of those names you care to describe here and what you're seeing in those stocks. Yeah, absolutely. So Green Break, we have a new trading on it, but if you think about where some of the pain has been in housing, we've seen I think a little bit more of it outweighed. Green Break actually does the majority of their business in Atlanta and Dallas, which are two markets that have held up pretty well. And haven't really felt some of the effects of layoffs on the tech sector, like a rally in an Austin felt. So we're new traded on that name, but I think if you're trying to avoid some of the trouble spots in housing right now, Green Break is an interesting name. Builders for Source is a company that supplies lumber and other products that go into the home. They're about 10% of the domestic building products market now. The decline that we saw in lumber prices has passed quarter. Typically is not as good for them, but if you think about their ability to grow market share and get bigger in this environment, especially because they don't just sell to single family builders, they also sell to multi-family, sell into commercial, which we've seen commercial construction spending actually start to rebound over the last six months. So even though they may be a little bit slower to man for their single family product, they do have other avenues that they can sell into. We're gonna have to leave it there, but appreciate your insights into the housing and construction markets. Jay McCannless, White Bush Securities Senior Vice President of Equity Research.

2854," Another contraband feather in the cap of fledgling bowls because as a standard wisdom goes, retail usually gets it wrong. Not in all clear by any slight of imagination, but perhaps it's a sign that institutions are done with the great flip of 2022 and perhaps are getting that long. Coming up, up in smoke, President Biden might just light up his democratic constituencies with a pardon for federal marijuana convictions and we're a month away from the midterms. That story and by theomics next. Welcome back. This week in Bidenomics, Rick Newman is focusing on jobs specifically, unemployment at that rate. Rick, you're take on the morning's numbers here. Good to see you. I'm just going to say what everybody's thinking. We need fewer jobs. We need a higher unemployment rate. All the analysis I'm seeing about the September jobs rate says, basically, all shocks we thought we were hoping unemployment would go up and we thought the jobs number would be lower. And why does everybody want that to happen? So the Federal Reserve has a reason to slow down its interest rate hikes, but with 263,000 new jobs slower than we've seen earlier this year, but still pretty strong, very tight job market. And we now is almost certain the Fed is going to hike another 75 basis points or three quarters of a point in November. So you know, puzzle this one out. We get a pretty good jobs report and the stock market falls by nearly 2%. That's the kind of fun house economy we're in. I think a lot of people just wish, could we get through the slow down in the job market we need to get inflation under control and get to the other side of this? We're just not there yet. No, we are not. But let's move on to something that we are near and that is towards a potential pardon by lots. Let's see.",https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NDK8QAnFNxU,71,2022-10-07 18:58:38
2855," I think there yet. No, we are not. But let's move on to something that we are near. And that is toward a potential pardon by lots. Let's say anybody who's been convicted on possession of marijuana, at least at the federal level with encouragement by Joe Biden for the states to do something similar. Now, cynics are going to say, well, we're a month away from the midterm elections. Others saying this is really too little too late, but very welcome nonetheless. You're take? Well, it could be too little too late, and it could be political, but it still might be a smart thing for Biden to do. So important to point out, as you said, Jared, he is partening people convicted for simple marijuana possession at the federal level. Most people who've been prosecuted for pot possession, that happens at the state level or the law. Welcome to Yahoo Finance on this Friday afternoon. I'm Sean Smith along with Dave Briggs and Richelle at Cufo. Let's get you up to speed on the market action. And as we round out the week, we are looking at selling once again today as that lower unemployment rate weighs on equities here. The Dow off 656 points in Nasdaq in the red off 400. And four points today, you can see the S&P off just around nearly a 3% drop here. The war-staylay performance that we've seen in all three, the major averages in that least three weeks, all 30 of the Dow stocks moving to the downside here, taking a look at the Russell 2000, the small cap index, off just over 2.5%. With equities under pressure, we are seeing yields push higher, the 10-year yield. Once again, moving to the upside up another five basis points to $388, the dollar index also trending to the upside well above 112. So you look at some of the sector action that we're seeing play out in the markets today, all 11 of the S&P sectors moving to the downside here, this afternoon technology by far, the worst performer consumer discretionary, not too far behind communication services, rounding out the three worst performers of the day. And take a look inside some of these sector specific stories. I want to call attention here to the semi-conductors and the selling that we're seeing in this space, AMD out last night revising its guidance here for the third quarter revenue. That initially put pressure on the sector, and then we got news from the Biden administration, new regulations on exports to China here, putting pressure on that sector, taking a look at the Bang Sock, those moving to the downside here today, the JP.",https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NDK8QAnFNxU,72,2022-10-07 19:03:30

Rough close to the week. Thanks, Jonathan. Thank you. Let's get you up to speed now on oil markets still royal by the historic production cut announcement from OPEC plus earlier this week many analysts predicting 100 plus dollars of barrel and prices headed in that direction as you can see WTI at more than 5% Brent up more than 4% and both up more than 10% for the week. Take a look at what this means for drivers gas prices continue to climb back again today they are now 11 cents higher than 1 week ago the national average 389 according to triple A. All right let's get you up to speed now on jobs we saw that September's unemployment rate dropped to 3.5% non farm payrolls were up by 263 to 63000 led by gains in leisure and hospitality but that's also the lowest monthly increase since April of 2021 wages reached up 0.3% marking a 5% increase from a year ago but also taking a look at labor force participation that ticked lower to 62.3% and the size of the labor market also shrank by 57000. Jeffrey Roach chief economist at LPR Financial calls this the nail in the coffin for another 75 basis point rate increase in November for the data dependent federal reserve that potential hawkishness weighing heavily on markets today. Well let's break some of this action down now with our guest Dana Peterson the conference for chief economist joining us now to look at some of these jobs numbers so Dana what really stands out to you as you look at the headline number but also some of the underlying trends you're seeing. Sure certainly there are mixed signals here we did see 263 K in terms of additions and yes it is the smallest that we've seen in quite some time but yet again it's still a very large number in normal times. But we would expect that the number of job gains per month would slow anyway even if we weren't expecting a recession because we're at full employment but certainly with the recession probably upon us businesses are probably starting to pull back on how many people they're hiring. We saw that the Joltz data there were less 1 million fewer job openings but again still lots of job opening so very mixed picture here in terms of yes slowing the labor market but it's still quite robust despite the fact that we're looking at the economic slowdown. Dana the number that jumped out to me was that year over year wage growth number up 5% what do you think this needs just in terms of fed policy the likelihood that the Fed is going to stay aggressive and also is that number that 5% jumped us still way too high in order to potentially bring down course CPI. Sure our thoughts of the Fed are going to continue is going to continue to raise interest rates because inflation is just too high consumer prices and also wages. And so certainly the Fed hasn't really seen much evidence of inflation coming down certainly on these ways data today and certainly not in the core CPI or the core PCE so they're still on track to raise interest rates. They're saying they're going to get closer to 5% in terms of the Fed funds rate and we think that they're pretty serious about that. Dana I'm always watching labor force participation and it was a slight down tick but how significant is any down tick in labor force participation given that we're seeing right now on our screen where was comparative to pre pandemic. Sure it's a pretty volatile number and what we like to do is break it out to two pieces one piece in terms of your prime age workers people 25 to 54 and then the folks who are 55 and over the prime group we're seeing labor force participation rise and get closer to the pre pandemic level. It's been happening in fits and starts but it is happening nonetheless a number of people who are 55 and older that participation rate continues to remain low may those people left the labor market early retired early and they're probably not coming back and so that's all telling",https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NDK8QAnFNxU,73,2022-10-07 19:07:18
2857," that participation rate continues to remain low, many of those people left the labor market early, retired early, and they're probably not coming back. And so that's all telling us that we're still going to have this tight labor market with labor shortages, still plaguing businesses here. And Danny, you're predicting a job full recession. When we talk about the economic impact of that, what does that mean? And what does the next phase of the labor market then look like with this in mind? Sure, what we're saying is that you're probably going to see negative GDP growth in particular, domestic demand being negative, but not a material increase in the unemployment rate or massive job losses. So we're thinking that the unemployment rate might rise to four, four and a half percent and top out there, which would be a very different story relative to what we saw during the pandemic, and certainly during the great recession. And that's because you have fewer workers entering a labor market relative to the number of people who are retiring. So for example, 20 years ago, you had 4.3 working age persons per retired person. That number of shrunken down to three, currently and in 20 years it's going to be just two. So labor shortages are going to be with us for a while, even if we see a little bit of cooling amid the economic downturn. Danny, just what is your assessment of the economy right now because the labor market, it's cooling a bit, although like you're saying, the headline numbers that we're seeing the unemployment rate remaining very, very strong. We've been waiting to see this part of it weekend. It sounds like you don't think it's going to weaken that extensively, but I guess when we try to, I guess figure out how deep of a recession, we could potentially see over the next 12 to 18 months. What do you think is the most likely scenario? Sure, our most likely scenario is that you have a brief and shallow recession. Meaning we have negative readings on domestic demand in the fourth quarter of this year and the first quarter of next year. Now the Fed has updates game in terms of how much it's going to raise interest rates and it's also going to keep interest rates elevated for some time. That signals that inflation, I'm sorry, that the recession could be a little bit deeper, a little bit longer, maybe three quarters instead of just two. But it seems though the rationale of the Fed is we can't drive down inflation without relatively massive job losses, at least north of a million, is that your base case? And if not, how do we drive it down? Even a million job losses wouldn't really move the unemployment rate up that much. It's still consistent with the four, four and a half percent that we're calling for. And so the Fed is not, the Fed also is looking at the same data we're looking at. They're also seeing the labor shortages and the demographic forces that are going to make it less likely for businesses to slash labor. And certainly in those in-person services and also manufacturing construction where you have to physically be on the job, many of those industries didn't even fully recoup all the people that were laid off during the pandemic. They still need workers and they're still trying to get those workers. And certainly if you affirm, if you think that this is not going to be a very long recession or very bad one, you're probably going to hoard workers and hold on to them. So for some of these companies who've not been able to replenish their labor force, what are the solutions? Is it about getting a more flexible workforce in terms of perhaps changing requirements when it comes to things like degrees or hiring people who have been incarcerated before? Is there a lot of wiggle room to get those who either haven't been in the workforce before or are on the sidelines right now? All the things you mentioned are certainly solutions that businesses have been using, but there are some really key factors here. Again, you have many, many people retiring. The baby boomers are wearing the retire anyway. The pandemic just really accelerated that trend. You still have roughly 100,000 missing child care workers. So that makes it very difficult for folks with children to return to the labor market. So certainly that's a solution that businesses can help provide. But also there are policy issues. There, you know, honestly, there are fewer legal immigrants than you might expect. And certainly that we reached a peak back in 2016 and policy is tight and set and it really hasn't changed. So you have a number of factors that are really leading against businesses finding workers, but they're trying everything they're raising, Ranges, Orange, Dudes, and the",https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NDK8QAnFNxU,74,2022-10-07 19:11:55
2858," and it really hasn't changed. So you have a number of factors that are really leading against businesses finding workers, but they're trying everything they're raising wages, lowering some of the qualifications, really trying to get marginalized workers, using remote workers a way to attract workers from lower cost to jurisdictions, and from abroad, and also persons with disabilities. But it's still going to be very difficult for businesses going forward. All right, Dean and Peterson, always great to have you. Thanks so much for joining us. Have a great weekend. Thank you, you too. Well, we are just getting started here on Yahoo Finance Live, coming up chip stocks like AMD and Nvidia are getting hammered today over demand concerns. We get analyst reaction later this hour. Plus, we'll take a closer look at the state of women in the workforce. And the new CEO of Kickstarter fills us in on the state of proud funding, amid inflation and an economic slowdown. Got all that for you coming up. Don't go in there. So, thank you so much....... Stocks falling today on signs that the labor market remains very strong all through the major averages on track for their worst days in three weeks with the Dow well off just over 600 points for more on today's action. What we're seeing we're broadly speaking, let's bring a Jewish chain, JP Morgan's chair of global research. Joyce, it's great to see you when you're taking a look at today's drop of the Dow off 672 points, SAP and NASDAQ both off pretty substantially. NASDAQ off nearly 4% does the drop or seen today make sense to you? Well, look, I think that this is very clear is that the summer of 75 lives on. The market is looking at 75 basis points again. And the labor market has been front and center of the Fed's efforts to reduce the inflationary pressures on the economy and the labor market just continues to run stubbornly hot. So when we take a look at the numbers, you know, we've seen the unemployment rate actually you know, ticking down reversing all of us is move up and that's something that the Fed has to.",https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NDK8QAnFNxU,75,2022-10-07 19:16:29
2859," hot. So when we take a look at the numbers, you know, we've seen the unemployment rate actually, you know, ticking down, reversing August's move up. And that's something that the Fed has to be very concerned about. So I think, you know, it's 75 basis points and we're still not done there. We're going to see 50 basis points in December, 25 basis points at the beginning of the year until you see a pause. So they're still further to go and it's not just the US, it's also looking at what's happening in the UK and in Europe and in oil markets as well. So I don't think you should be that surprised by what the market reaction was today. And continuing a bit of conversation from our prior segment, how can or can the Fed get inflation back to 2% without some massive job losses with a strong labor market like we're seeing? No, I think the Fed's going to be looking for the three things like is inflation anchored and do you really see that core inflation is coming down? Because you can see this big drop in headline inflation. And then I think it is, you know, war softness in the labor markets. And that's just really what we're not seeing, whether it is looking at the data like the wage growth numbers that have come out, but also just things like the ratio of job levers to job losers. That was one of Alan Green's fans favorite statistics. And that's actually at the highest level that it's been at in 30 years, it's almost 16%. So I don't think that Fed can think about time, you know, slowing at the stage in the game, given what the labor market dynamics are. So, Joyce, then what does that mean for a Fed policy in terms of what will likely get in November? Do you think a 75 basis point hike is a sure thing? And then what do you think December looks like? I think it's 75 basis points. And in November still 50 in December and in January, February, 25 basis points, you know, really seeing policy rates go to four and a half percent. And you know, it's not just the US. I mean, I think in the UK as well, just given everything that's been happening there, you're going to see 75 basis points as well. So the summer of 75, as I mentioned, it really lives on here. Summer of 75. You mentioned the UK and weakness there. There's been an ongoing debate driven by some comments from the UN earlier in the week. If at some point the Fed has to consider the impact of their increases on markets around the world, do they start to consider weakness globally at any point? Well, I think that the focus is going to be very much on the inflation numbers. And that is really even more so than some of the market conditions, something that is a global problem. I mean, if you just take a look at emerging markets, I mean, there's 36 countries where you've got food inflation, like it's about 15%. So I don't think the focus is going to come off of inflation. Financial market conditions are more involved. There's also a lot of attention on the strength of the dollar and what that means because we've seen that central banks around the world, EM emerging markets countries have been drawing down some of those reserves to intervene in the currency. So I think that this discussion is going to continue, but the market conditions of the volatility could be with us for a while. Joyce, you mentioned the strong dollar here. US dollar index moving to the upside once again, today, closing in on 1.13. I guess, how big of a headwind? Do you see the strong dollar being not only in the fourth quarter for corporate earnings, but looking ahead into 2023? No, the strong dollar is going to have a lag defect here. And we're also looking at lower US growth. I mean, we have US growth next year, sub 1%. And we've also seen this really big drop in global consumer confidence. I mean, if you take a look at global consumer confidence right now, it's about 2.8 standard deviations lower than it was in the June 2021 peak period. So that combination of slower growth, stronger dollar, a decline in household savings, a deterioration of consumer sentiment, all of that means that earnings are probably here going to have to be revised. And the dollar really does come out with more of a lag. So given all those conditions that you're stating strategically, how do you position yourself? Well, look, I think I still think one market, and it's one that you know I've talked about here before, is still the energy market. I mean, we do think that oil.",https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NDK8QAnFNxU,76,2022-10-07 19:20:27
2860," Yeah, they position yourself. Well, look, I think I still think one market, and it's one that you know, I've talked about here before, is still the energy market. I mean, we do think that oil is going to retest $100 here. And you know, some of this is looking at things like, you know, not just opact policy, but also that the US Strategic Petroleum Reserve Fund, those, you know, that also concludes where what they have been releasing, you know, at the end of October, you also have the oil price cap, you know, Russia has been threatening some former retaliation as well. So I still think that when you look at the commodity complex, agricultural commodities, we think it could be up 10 to 20% next year. That's true. I've had a little bit of an audio issue there. Up there she's back. JP Morgan's share of global research, Joyce Chang. Appreciate you being here. Have a great weekend. Come on up, Elon Musk, giving a revealing interview, covering everything from his Twitter purchase, China, Tesla. Just wait to hear what he had to say about some of his more controversial tweets. Stay tuned. Fei Hao, And that of the moment, Elon Musk, giving an interview to the Financial Times entitled,",https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NDK8QAnFNxU,77,2022-10-07 19:24:47
2861," doing Twitter for the money. It's not like I'm trying to buy some yacht and I can't afford it. I don't own any boats, but I think it's important that people have a maximally trusted and inclusive means of exchanging ideas and that it should be as trusted and transparent as possible. Elon also says of truth social. It's essentially a right-wing echo chamber. It might as well be called Trumpet. That was a big surprise for a guy who has at least apparently courted Donald Trump to return to Twitter, but let's start with the big port on Twitter there, Shana. If I'm an investor, if I'm helping him finance this and he tells me he's not doing it for the money, I'm not so thrilled about my investment or the safety of it. Yeah, not a good move right now, especially given what has transpired over the last 24 hours just in terms of getting funding for this deal. You would think that maybe that wasn't the smartest thing to say. He said he's not doing it for the money. I think it's clear that he's doing it for the attention or that place some sort of role in all this. We know that Musk, Rochelle, does not hide his feelings ever. It seems like when it comes to Twitter, he likes being able to communicate. He said he likes using the platform in order to have direct correspondence with not only his supporters and people who love Tesla, but really a platform for getting his voice heard. I don't think he adds up for debate, I guess. Whether or not he adds much positive, good, I guess when it comes to what he says on the platform, but he does certainly it's safe to say spark a lot of debate. And obviously this isn't the first time that he said he wasn't doing it for the money, but as you mentioned, if you're a shareholder or you're one of these banks that are involved in the financing, that's definitely not what you want to hear. But I think it also speaks to the fact that he does always seem to be driven by something bigger. So whether it's this plan, this, this, everything, this ex-app that he's planning on, there does seem to be a plan in mind. Because you have to remember, at one point Tesla was not profitable, and people were like, where is this company going? And he was, interestingly in this article, basically crediting himself with the amount of speed that now we've seen things like Tesla and electric charging and governments now putting money into it. So maybe there's some big plan in mind. Obviously it does not seem to be money, but a very interesting insight into how he thinks. And he certainly does set himself up for a lot of conflict and trouble when he just sort of, has that sort of verbal diary on Twitter, just says, whatever comes into his mind, because he might end up footing the bill for Twitter, which is exactly how they started. We're the tweet. And back to the, the Twitter and the things he said about it, making an open platform outsourced in the algorithm and things of that nature, we still haven't heard a real plan to actually make money to increase the ad revenue or to get people to pay for a monthly service. And that I'm sure those investors are eager to hear about. But he also said that the sun will eventually destroy all life on earth. Yeah, a little worse. So we need to move at some point, or at least be a multi-planet species. Now it says some interesting comments about President Biden and his age. He did. Yeah, what he said about his age really stuck out to me, basically saying that right now he's too old. He went on to say maybe one generation away from the average age is okay, but two generations at the point where you've got great grandchildren, I don't know how in touch with the people you are, is it even possible to be so we know he hasn't been a good, he hasn't been the biggest supporter of President Biden. He's he's talked about a couple of times how he felt snubbed when he wasn't included in a couple of things that President Biden has done to promote electric vehicles. He did say it doesn't always agree eye to eye with Trump. What he also said Dave, which was interesting to me, was what he had to say in terms of the independent and the super moderate super pack to support candidates with moderate views, which I thought was also an interesting play there. And a very surprising tone for him, strike as well. It recommended reading this article is never dull. Yeah, Richard. True, I mean even including international politics, that's a whole other kind of fish. But as we hear it to break though, we're going to take a look at the big board. The sell-off on Wall Street accelerating that you see the doubt of moving 700 points into the close. Plus an analyst downgrading lived saying that rival Uber has one big advantage. We'll tell you what it is next.",https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NDK8QAnFNxU,78,2022-10-07 19:29:06
2862," I It's time for a triple play, the three stocks that we're watching in the final 30 minutes of trading with Dexcom, Lyft and Credit Suisse. My pick is Biotech Company Dexcom, ticker DXCN. The company's focus is wearable continuous glucose monitoring or CGM associated with diabetes. Despite a market sell-off overall, the stock is still jumping up almost 7%. Fast after the Centers for Medicare and Medicaid Services issued a proposed local coverage determination. That actually paves the way for it to be covered by Medicare in certain regions. That was welcome used to analysts, including Piper Sandler's Mato Brian, who raised the price target to $120 from $110 per share, saying DXCN will reclaim its position as the highest multiple name in diabetes following this announcement. We also heard from Wells Fargo's Larry Beagle, who says if finalize this, we'll double the market opportunity for CGM to 8 million patients per year. But of course, rivals in the space, the Abbott Laboratories and SensorNics holdings under pressure following that news. And of course, it's been a bumpy year overall for those companies and for Doxcom as well. That stock down 22% year to date, Shauna. You ever show you mentioned some of the analyst commentary. They're still still out, uping its price target to 120 a share, saying that this is clearly a positive development. But quote, seemingly little in the way of proposed patient restrictions are. So big reason why we're seeing that positive analyst commentary, big reason why we're seeing the stock pop as much as it is today. And overall, the street is very bullish on this name. This stock out to me 15 buys, two holds and zero sells on the stock. So when you're taking the account that Doxcom's still off 22% year to date, yet there's zero sell ratings on the stock right now, really shows how bullish the street is at this point. All right, my play today is Lift. The stock sinking on a downgrade from RBC analyst Brad Erickson, cutting his rating on the stock to sector perform. And worry about its big rival, Uber. So Erickson warns it.",https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NDK8QAnFNxU,79,2022-10-07 19:33:45
2863," lift the stock sinking on a downgrade from RBC analyst Brad Erickson cutting his rating on the stock to sector perform. I'm worried about its big rival Uber. So Erickson warns at Uber quote has a structural supply advantage when it comes to driver setting longer wait times for lift riders. He also acknowledged that he is a little bit late to the game when it comes to this reduced outlook. Remember, lift has had a very tough go at it since it started the year. It shares off just about 70 percent. We're seeing the drop today on this downgrade. You and I have talked a number of times and it's a big theme today. The labor shortage trying to attract some people into the workforce I have remained on the sidelines. A lot of companies simply can't get the workers they need unless they're offering very, very attractive incentives. It looks like at least from RBC's perspective, lift is unable to keep up with that demand. It's not a great sector to begin with. I mean, Uber's down 5.5 percent today on a broader market to climb it down what 35 percent year to date. It's surprising to me to see any difference between Uber and lift in terms of that perspective because I don't know about you. Most of us get online and look at both day to day. At least when I fly into an airport, I compare both and they're generally in the same neck of the woods. It was the first time since May of 21 that Uber's times were actually faster than lift. So lift had been much stronger and in particular that focus is in the West Coast. Play 33 percent slower are their times according to this analyst note. So that is problematic for lift, but not a great sector either way. My play Credit Swiss, one of the stock stories of the week with many suggesting a Lehman like collapse could be in the early stages. You saw Lehman trending most of the weekend and early throughout the week. It certainly has not played out that way though. The stock surging today on a planned restructuring, the Wall Street Journal reporting 10 bidders, including six street partners have submitted offers for the bank, Securitized Product Group. CS also announcing a surprise, $3 billion buyback of its senior bonds. And list still suggests though they could need around $5 billion in fresh cash to totally stabilize things. But shares have certainly circled the wagons up more than 12 percent today, up more than 22 percent on the week. I guess for now it looks like much to do about nothing, Rochelle. I mean, when you have your company's name mentioned in the same as Lehman Brothers, that's never going to be a good side. Obviously, at least they seem to at all be making some moves in the right direction trying to cross some of the concerns here. But I don't know if this is going to be enough. Obviously, this is one of these story banks. You would think that there could be some sort of recourse here, but still early days, but obviously never great when you're mentioned against another name that's collapsed. Yeah, but I think the reaction at least at this point is it doesn't look like a Lehman, right? When you compare the strong balance sheet at Credit Suisse compared to what we saw back in 2007-2008, it certainly is a very different scenario. And also the buyback, the move there from Credit Suisse really shows the fact that the company is not, I guess, as financially distressed as maybe some of the initial fears were when we initially saw this reaction and so on a lot of the talk going back to last weekend. But again, Credit Suisse clearly has a long ways to go. We'll be interesting to see the moves that the company makes in order to better position the bank and also really it's balance sheet here for the future. All right, coming up, the Biden administration is hoping its latest announcements delivers a blow to China's chip industry, the details of the latest volley in the ongoing US-China chip war next.",https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NDK8QAnFNxU,80,2022-10-07 19:37:45
2864,"dles All right, take a look at shares of FedEx. Well, it's a little over 1% under suppressors. The company's ground division reportedly cutting its volume forecast for holiday shipping and an internal memo obtained by Reuters FedEx saying its customers planned to ship fewer packages. This news coming just two weeks after FedEx pulled its full year guidance and announced its first quarter profit fell 20% from a year ago. Well, Chip stocks are falling today after the Biden administration announced clamping down on China's access to chip technology. Meanwhile, the world's top maker of memory chips, AMD and Samsung, a sparking fears that a slump in semiconductor demand could be much worse than expected. Let's bring in Vivek Arya, Bank of America, senior semiconductor analyst to take a look at all of this. So, Vivek, welcome back to this show. What should we take from this? When we look at some of the chip makers that are down the most year to date, led by Nvidia, what is it that concerns you about the trend you're seeing right now? Yeah, thank you very much for having me. I think the semiconductor industry is one that makes us feel very profitable and productive for three years in a row. And then just makes us feel awful in that fourth year and it seems like we are in that fourth year. The specific things that are causing the headwinds this year are threefold. First, there is just enormous pressure on the consumer because of all the inflationary issues because of all the turmoil in Europe because of the lockdowns in China. Secondly, we have the specter of rising rates, which is never good for valuations in high beta, high multiple sector. And then on top of it, as you mentioned, there are some additional restrictions on semiconductor companies in terms of shipping to China and look, China is the largest customer for semiconductor. And it's never good to have friction between the largest designer of semis, which is the US and the largest customer. So I think where we are today, when I put it all in the context is the semiconductor stocks have a way of smelling the turn in the economy, you know, six to nine to 12 months before it happens. So last November, when semiconductor stock speak, there was no talk of recession. The same way there is no talk of an upturn or the next cycle today. So our assumption is that compare start to get easier for the sector next year. And if that is the assumption and if that's the right assumption, we think semiconductor stocks can try and find a bottom sometime in Q4. And meanwhile, the valuations are starting to look very interesting for what's a very profitable industry. So the fact that's interesting just in terms of what you said to export restrictions and then taking that and coupling that with you.",https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NDK8QAnFNxU,81,2022-10-07 19:42:05
2865," starting to look very interesting for what's a very profitable industry. So the fact that's interesting just in terms of what you said to export restrictions and then taking that and coupling that with your predictions, your expectations for this base going into 2023. So it sounds like you view it as a challenge here in the near term, but you don't think it's going to have a significant impact in terms of sales, is that right? Yeah, so let's talk about those restrictions. So first of all, you know, as I mentioned, friction is never good between the largest designer and the largest buyer of semiconductors. But when you take a step back, the majority of chips that are shipped to China are actually for a lot of consumer applications. Therefore smartphones, therefore PCs, therefore a lot of low and consumer speakers and so forward, like the largest buyers of semis in China are not supercomputing or military companies. They are companies like Oppo, Vivo, Xiaomi, Lenovo, ZTE. So it's not really supercomputing. In fact, if I take the entire supercomputing and military end use market for semiconductors, globally, it is not more than 5 or 10% of end demand. And even if you assume half of it is in China, which is a very big number, it still says that there is not more than a 5% or so headband. Second point I would mention is that we have to be careful when we use the term restriction. So what is happening is that there is a set of rules that now forces a lot of semiconductor companies to first go and ask for approvals. So they are not actually banned outright from shipping. They have been given this extra step to go and verify that the end customer is not a military end use customer or a supercomputing customer that might be on an entity list. Which is why we think that yes, it's a headband and it doesn't help when the sector is already facing a lot of the macro pressures, but in terms of specifically this incremental headband, we don't think it's more than 5% to 7% incremental. And that too, it's only applied to very specific set of companies. In fact, I want to draw your attention to something that we saw from tourist securities. In talking about Tesla, perhaps being a dark horse when it comes to AI and perhaps arrival for Nvidia, saying that they actually see it obviously though Nvidia is the leader in this space. They see apart the Tesla to build its own business to compete with it. What's your take on perhaps the role that some of these non-traditional chip makers like a Tesla might play in this space? Sure, absolutely. Look, first, when it comes to the field of artificial intelligence, we are still in the first innings. That means if I take all the servers that were shipped in the world in the last year, less than 15% of them actually had an AI accelerator in them and the majority of them used in Nvidia product, and then if I couple that with the automotive industry where Tesla participates, the entire automotive industry is only 8% of the semiconductor market. So I think we have to keep a lot of these things in context of what the sizes of these markets are. So we really like Nvidia. And the reason is that their specific technology of AI accelerators, it's not just a chip. They're not just designing a chip. They're actually designing a complete end-to-end system and a stack of software and a stack and a big number of developers, three and a half million developers that have been trained on using this product. So I would say the Tesla use case is a very, very specific one, maybe less than 1% of the entire semiconductor industry. But it is a rising tide. Many companies will participate. But we think Nvidia is on a different not so different planet, but I think on a different solar system, when it comes to the application and the benefits of AI. The VecGarria, always great to get your perspective. A Bank of America, thanks so much for joining us today. Well, stick with the chip makers and what we're seeing play out in the semiconductor space. The micron is the latest company to take advantage of the funding from the Biden administration's $52 billion chips act announcing plans to invest up to $100 billion for a plant in Syracuse, New York. Joining us now is a man who helped us seal that deal. You want to welcome Syracuse, Mayor Ben Walsh to the program. Mayor Walsh, it's great to see you. Congratulations on this historic deal between the city of Syracuse and a micron year. Just talked to us just about the economic implications of this and the opportunity that this presents for your region. Transformational is probably an understatement. We have been working for a long time to prepare our community for this opportunity. And this week was historic. So.",https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NDK8QAnFNxU,82,2022-10-07 19:46:25
2866," probably an understatement. We have been working for a long time to prepare our community for this opportunity. And this week was historic. So really immediately our focus shifts towards what we need to do to be prepared for this opportunity. Clearly we have to make sure we have the workforce. We're going to see significant investments in housing. But it's very exciting for an older northeastern industrial city like Syracuse. It is part of a really amazing comeback story. A story some day you'll have to write in a book how a small town or at least medium town, $400 billion in investment. How do you do it? Because other companies, other towns across the country are watching to see exactly how they can do it. What was the key? Well there are so many factors that went into it. We have a great site. The site is located about 15 to 20 minutes north of the city of Syracuse owned by the Anadogga County Industrial Development Agency. They've been investing in that site for nearly 30 years now. It is about 1400 acres now. So we had the right site. We had the support from New York State government. Governor Hoagold made a significant investment. The chips act at the federal level was critically important. And right here in the city of Syracuse, you know, we have been in the midst of our own. Renaissance a lot of investment downtown. The city is really coming back and as companies are trying to attract and retain talent. I'm having a vibrant city as a critical component. And I'm proud to say we have that here in Syracuse up to 50,000 jobs are expected to be created as a result of this. I guess how do you prepare? How do you build up the workforce in order to fill that large number of jobs? Well, it takes time and I'm pleased to say that we're not starting right now. We've been at this for quite a while now as part of our Syracuse surge strategy, which is our strategy for inclusive growth in the new economy. As we've identified opportunities in the what we call the fourth industrial revolution. We've seen certain areas where Syracuse has a competitive advantage where we have. Curriculum in our schools that we're developing that can make sure that our that our people and our workers have the right skill sets. So we have a lot of the right programs and infrastructure in place. This opportunity is just going to require us to scale them at a rate that we've never done before. So again, looking at scaling our workforce development programs, continuing to invest in housing, public transportation, all of the infrastructure that we need to accommodate this investment. So 9,000 of those jobs should make an average of $100,000 each that is remarkable. As remarkable as this achievement was spent, I'm inspired by an independent mayor winning 60% of the vote in your second term. Is this something that we can see spread across the country? What allowed you to to run as an independent because the narrative in this country is that it is a dominated two party system and you simply cannot break through? Well, I'll describe it within the context of this deal. The fact that we have an independent mayor, a Republican County executive, a Democratic governor, all working hand in hand to make this deal happen is significant. And I think does provide a model for other communities to pursue at a time when our country is very divisive. I think when when people focus on what we have in common and where we can have shared prosperity and growth. You can make things happen. So I hope in that way we are a model that we are where America is going or hopefully we want to be going. And as for me, you know, it's about it was about developing and bringing together a broad coalition, broad diverse coalition of people that had a love for this city and that we're willing to set party politics aside for the greater good. Well, speaking of being a model, making things happen clearly. This is a huge win for your city. Are you in talks with other large companies? What else are you doing to attract jobs to your city of Syracuse? Well, similar to the point about our programs in place, you know, our comeback story, our Renaissance is already underway. We have a facility on the south side of Syracuse just out the downtown local company, JMA wireless just just constructed the first 5G wireless manufacturing facility in the United States. We have other investments like that taking place, nothing to the scale of micron and we certainly see know that there will be significant.",https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NDK8QAnFNxU,83,2022-10-07 19:50:45
2867," facility in the United States. We have other investments like that taking place. Nothing to the scale of micron. And we certainly see, know that there will be significant follow-on opportunities, supply chain opportunities that come with micron. But we do hope that this also puts us on the radar of many other companies around the globe that are looking for a place where, again, you have the political alignment that allows you to do business that has the balance of a vibrant downtown, but also beautiful parks and countrysides and mountains and lakes all around us. So it's really pulling all of that together. Well, congratulations on the deal. Nice to join us, Sarah Q. Smer, Ben Walls. Appreciate it, thanks. Thank you. All right, what's old is new again. Some streaming services are feeling the chill from the lack of customer interest. So now, yep, they're considering bundling. More about that ahead. Hm. We could soon be seeing more streamers partnering for bundles. According to a new report from the Wall Street Journal, Amazon executives have been exploring selling bundles of streaming services at discounted prices through its Amazon Prime video channels. The Journal also reported that Warner Brothers' discovery has discussed participating in bundles with some of its rivals. It really does seem as if we're coming full circle, but we're seeing some analysts saying we're not going back to the days of cable not to compare. He was saying, and this was from a Devon Emory of Curiosity, he was saying that the problem with bundling wasn't that people didn't like it. They weren't liking what they were paying for a service that they weren't really using. A bit of nuance there though, Seanan. Would you agree though? Yeah, but I guess my only response to that would be, I guess if you pay for a bundle, I don't know if you would necessarily use everything that's included in that bundle.",https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NDK8QAnFNxU,84,2022-10-07 19:55:27
2868," Yeah, but I guess my only response to that would be, I guess if you pay for a bundle, I don't know if you necessarily use everything that's included in that bundle. So I'll be interesting to see. And also just in terms of the pricing that's going to be key, we don't really know from this report from the journal exactly what Amazon is thinking if Prime is going to be included in these bundles or if they're thinking of maybe partnering with some other streamers and bundling their services. It's very, very vague just in terms of where they see the direction of this going. Dave, though, I do think it is a natural step in order for us to see more of these types of bundle offers. So just given the fact that growth there within the sector has been so hard for so many of the leaders here within streaming, we certainly have seen saturation. So many companies are trying to be innovative in terms of what they're doing to drive new customers, to get new customers into their service here. Ad tier is part of that, but bundling, I think, makes sense. It'll be interesting though to see how they do it. Well, we just showed the two main bundles that do exist right now. With the leader out of the gate really is that one on your left there. Disney bundle has Disney Hulu and ESPN plus, and that makes a lot of sense for people. That's a 44% discount off of if you paid for all three of those services separately. But now some research from CR research shows that the average consumer is spending $219 a month right now between cable and their streaming services. So everything we got away from, we are now back in. And that's why the Wall Street Journal calls it the great re-bundling. Perhaps the best example of what Amazon might do is what Walmart's doing with their membership now getting a deal with Paramount Plus and partnering there. But there's no natural streamer that fits with Amazon Prime because they have everything in the space now with movies and television shows and now live sports. I can't imagine who a natural partner would be. But yes, we're getting back to exactly what we ran away from. And it's tough because when you figure in Walmart their services are already $98 so people are just going to do these sort of mini bundles. Will it be a bunch of overlap if you want a bit of something and something else? Do you have to get two bundles? It's a lot. I'm not looking forward to it. But hey, if it gives us more options we can save like 44%. I will do the bundling math. I will try. All right, we'll stick with us here coming up. We're counting down to the closing bell on Wall Street. Stick with us here. On Yacht & Finance Live.",https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NDK8QAnFNxU,85,2022-10-07 19:59:22
2869," Music I would just a couple of minutes from the closing bell on a sell off Friday, Yahoo's Jared Bliquerie's black again with another devastating Friday. Seems like I've been doing this week after week. It's a pattern with me. I don't know if it's just me. I should take off next Friday. It is my birthday. So that's what's going to happen. We need to see a turnaround. Dave, you might have one next week too. I'm not going to say anything. Anyway, here's a doubt for the week. Still up 2% over the trailing five days. I think the NASDAQ down 4% at the lows has given back almost all of that. Well, 8% of a percent. And then the S&P 500 up less or down less than 3% here, maintaining gains about 1.5% into the close. And it has been a wild week that jobs report a little bit too hot for the market. Just take a look at this. In video down 8% is it's taking lower, it's actually down 6%. The mega caps really taking it on the chin. Just take a look at the sector action. We can see with 30 seconds left. It's a tech sector. That's XLK. That is the biggest to the downside. That's down 4% followed by consumer discretionary down over 3% even energy, which has been the one buoyed stock or sector this week. That is down 3.25% and we take a look at some of the sector heat maps here. I wanted to show you a little bit of green here. Got a little bit of green, but you take a look at travel. It is the opposite story. Here's the bell. It's fine on one of the weeks. Stocks ending the day. Let's take a look at how they finished all three major indices off their session lows, but still in solidly negative territory. As we take a look here, we see the Dow there. Off its session lows though, but still ending down about 629 points. That's 2%. The S&P 500 also losing more than 100 points. The Dow is down 2.8%, and the tech heavy Nasdaq taking the heaviest losses of the day, losing 3.8% down 320 points. Let's take a closer look at those border markets with our markets panel. Let's bring in a Med Riesco in Signo Chief Investment Officer and Todd Sons, strategic managing director of technical strategy. A big welcome to you both. Let's start with you getting your reaction to where we are in terms of what we're seeing with this market rally. Obviously, this came off of the bad news that we got in the jobs markets. Now we have another swing in the opposite direction. Right. So really, I think the market's not going to be able to rally here in any sustainable way until we get a pivot from the Fed. And a pivot doesn't necessarily mean reduction in rate hikes. It also means a pause. And the jobs number today really did nothing to change that narrative or to push that timetable forward. If anything, I think what we continue to see is continuing strength in that labor market. It's one of the reasons why the Fed has to continue to time. That labor market is still quite strong. Remember, there's still 1.6 workers for every job available out there. So there's a big moat around the U.S. labor market. Todd, what do you think of that strong jobs number that we got out this morning? The fact that the unemployment rate continued to fall or fell once again. I should say the reaction that we're seeing play out in the broader markets, does this big of a drop do you think makes sense? Yeah, I think what stands out most to me right now for as much as we had strong participation in breath earlier this week and some improving economic data, speaking inflation perhaps, what hasn't changed is the very difficult macro backdrop, right? The dollar starting to re-engage itself higher. The yen after a monumental intervention by the bank in Japan, it fresh highs today, right? So the FX market continues to play the role of the villain here. You know, you have fed that's intent on continuing to tighten. And our risk barometer such as discretionary versus staples, I think.",https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NDK8QAnFNxU,86,2022-10-07 20:03:53
2870," The next market continues to play the role of the villain here. You know, you have this Fed that's intent on continuing to tighten. And our risk barometer, such as discretionary versus staples, I think this is the most important ratio right now for the market. Still it's very inconclusive coming off the March 2020 lows. It was decisively in favor of risk on for discretionary. It's a much different backdrop right now as much as we're trying to hold on to the June lows. That leaves us very skeptical despite any sort of improving economic, economic front, whether it's jobs or other data. Yeah, good news is bad news. I mean, how do you think the Fed reads today's jobs numbers? Look, I think you see it in the Fed funds futures. They are basically now saying that there's a very high chance that the Fed hikes, uh, hikes by 75 basis points at the next meeting and then 50 and then 25 subsequently. So it's really kind of given back some of the reduction in Fed hiking expectations that kind of drove the market higher earlier this week. So really, I think it kind of leaves the Fed in the same position that it was at the last meetings. Still data dependent. Remember, we still have one more CPI print before the next meeting. I think that'll be the next big economic number to watch. Um, and if we're going to see sort of any cracks, let's say in the Fed's rhetoric so far, that could be potentially one spot where that could happen. And Todd, I want to ask you that as you take us a step back, where are you seeing then some of these funds flowing into? Some people have cash on the side. Others are wondering what to do. Where are you seeing investment flowing right now? Yeah, I think the greatest asset for the market ran out is sentiment. And right, when you look at third quarter sector ETF flows, it was decisively defensive. Utility, staples, healthcare. So the most amount of inflows, conversely, you had cyclical outflows from materials and dust, fuels and energy. And those defensive flows were also paired off with a surge into cash like treasury. Now, part of that is because you're actually getting a yield on cash for the first time and what feels like ages, right? But you typically see these surge into cash like flows during crisis moments, the China devaluation, COVID, the Fed tightening in 2018. And so I like that the sentiment backdrop is supportive, but it's hard to square that away with a very difficult macro backdrop. Now, that being said, the outflows from energy are still amazes to me despite the great performance, especially this week for that sector. So if you're looking for someplace to hide where the flows are not aggressive, take a look at energy. I'm at a big story next week is going to be earning season in addition to that inflation print that we are waiting for. But big banks are set to kick it off this year. When we talk about the fact that we have seen a revision lower here in a number of estimates, had they been revised low enough? And I guess what do you expect this round of earnings to tell us just about the state of the economy right now? I think more than anything right now, we're still working on the discount rate. We're still working on the multiple because the market hasn't really settled on that. You've seen a lot of volatility there. Earnings have come down quite a bit already. Now I will tell you, we are projecting a mild recession in the United States over the next six months. And it seems to me that, and this is something that your previous guests mentioned as well, sentiment and positioning are kind of pointing to limited losses from here in case of a mild recession. In that scenario, we would see the S&P trade anywhere from 3400 to 3600, which is just about where we are today, perhaps a little bit lower. But I think the market's downside is quite limited. I think the only place or the only potential scenario where we see the market fall much further from here is in the case of a hard landing. And really that would require we think a shock in top of what we already have right now, such as something emanating from the war in Ukraine, which we're obviously not a positive right now as a base case. And Todd, your thoughts on trading sideways for the next couple of months and expectations for earnings, which get underway next week? I do think volatility is here to stay, right? You've seen FX ball, you've seen Treasury ball, and surprised the VIX is still roughly around 30, perhaps there's some other hedging derivatives what not going on. But you typically need to see the VIX at least spike to 40 or 50 before is all said and done. I think ultimately, you may need to see the S&P, especially if we're getting into recessionary territory, go back to somewhere around 3,300, right? Where the COVID, the pre-COVID highs were. Right, a lot of stocks already starting to tell you.",https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NDK8QAnFNxU,87,2022-10-07 20:08:10
2871," You may need to see the S&P, especially if we're getting into recessionary territory, go back to somewhere around 3,300, right? Where the COVID, the pre-COVID highs were. Right, a lot of stocks already start in a test, those levels, particularly in the real state area, or even look at something like meta has already below its COVIDs low. So you may ultimately need to see from a structural perspective, the S&P tests somewhere in the 3,300 area before it's all set and done. That's going to put us in rare territory in a greater than 30% decline, but it should prove to be a very strong buying opportunity, as the Struckler speaking, it's rare air if you get down that low from 52-ig high. There's something lots to keep an eye on for us and for the Fed as well. A big thank you to our market panel, Ahmed Riesco and Todd Sone. Thank you both. All right, stay with us. Coming up, nearly 400,000 women dropped out of the labour force last month. We'll find out why next. The latest job numbers are out and they show a big disparity between men and women in the workforce. 10 million more men are employed than women. And 17 million fewer women are in the labour force than men overall. We want to bring in pipeline equity CEO, Katakarroy, joining us now. It's great to have you here in the studio for the first time in quite some time. 390,000 women though in this report we've just got out this morning leaving the labour force last month. And I have talked a number of times about women staying out of the workforce. Now we have even more women leaving. Why do you think this is? Well, there's probably, there's a couple of reasons. One is that as we see fewer jobs, right? tend to be the last hired and the first fired that's certainly part of what's happening. The other piece is digital acceleration so the jobs that existed at the beginning of the pandemic don't exist not necessarily exist right now so we need to actually.",https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NDK8QAnFNxU,88,2022-10-07 20:13:02
2872," The other piece is digital acceleration. So the jobs that existed at the beginning of the pandemic don't exist, not necessarily exist right now. So we need to actually skill women into the jobs that are available. So, Karthik, event, how do we get women to get into the jobs that are now available? How do we sort of connect those dots? Yeah, there's really two pieces. One is this equitable skilling, which has two focuses. One is actually having women have access to skilling opportunities. So for instance, in the infrastructure bill, 100% of those jobs need skilling. So that's one opportunity. But the other is actually ensuring that women have the equity of opportunity to apply those skills. Because we know, for instance, in STEM, that half of all women will actually leave in the first 10 years in STEM. And Karthik, all right now, we're in a time of high inflation. The Fed has gotten very aggressive. You're digging down and telling us that rate hikes actually affect women more than men. How so? Well, there's two pieces. So we know, for instance, the inflation rate for goods and services that are targeted toward women are double that for goods and services targeted toward men. But the other thing is that as the Fed raises rates, it's actually a higher credit risk to be a woman. So we get charged higher rates for mortgages and car loans. So right now, as we hear the Fed is going to continue to remain very hawkish, potentially weakening the economy. Right now, we have 1.5 million women that still haven't returned to the workforce. What do you think that number will look like 68 months from now? That's a great question. I don't actually know. But what I know is that it will likely get worse before it gets better. And one of the things that's really unfortunate about what the Fed is doing is that it's actually harming women. If we brought those 1.5 million women back into the labor force, we could actually close the gap between the number of jobs open and then a number of people looking for jobs by almost 35%. That would cool the economy so that we don't have to continue to raise rates. And, Katika, you've talked about the Fed considering women when they look at this picture of full employment. What do you think they're missing in the picture right now? They're not looking at it through an intersectional gender equity lens. So they're not looking at it through the lens of gender plus race and ethnicity. So for instance, we talked about the 1.5 million women that are missing from the labor force. If you look at that through intersectional gender equity, so specifically for black women and Latinas, black women are currently at over 8% since the beginning of the pandemic. And Latinas are a little bit over 6%. So they have not reached full employment. If we actually put policies in place to increase their employment and their participation in the labor force, we will cool the economy. Katika, when you take a look at the breakdown of minimum wage workers between men and women, how does that stack up? And I guess how does that compare to what we saw pre-pandemic? Well, women are the majority of all minimum wage workers in the United States. It's about 56%. One of the real concerns is that this year, the wage gap is actually widened for almost every woman. So it's 5 to 11 cents. That's on top of inflation-adjusted wages we're actually earning less. And so not only do women have less money coming into their wallets, they actually have more money coming out. So then, Katika, for some of these companies who are looking at this and thinking, what is the business case for hiring more women, whether it affects their bottom line or how it affects the economy? How do you convince them that it's not just a nice to have those of smart business as well? Well, that's pipeline started with research. We did a research study across 4,000 companies in 29 countries. And what we found was that for every 10% increase in intersectional gender equity, there's a 1% to 2% increase in revenue. Here's what's interesting about that. As we're looking at the softening of the economy, the return for investing in equity during a downturn is actually double. So right now, companies should be doubling down on ensuring equity in their labor force and not just hiring and not only pay, but things like performance, potential, and development. Very important message for everyone involved, especially for those companies that are hiring right now. Katika Roy, great to have you. Thanks so much for joining us in studio.

Find out what this means for cannabis companies next. Music The pot's stock high wore off quick following President Biden's announcement of historic federal pardons from marijuana possession while most multi-state operators climb between 20 and 30% Thursday most are flat or down slightly today. So what's the level of optimism in the industry? Andrew Carter is the Steeple cannabis analyst and joins us now. It was a massive announcement and shocked the world, including the stocks, but then it seemed everything came back down to earth. What's your level of optimism and what changed as of that announcement? Well, first off, thanks for having me. The first point is though the pardons, it doesn't really accomplish much. There's very few simple marijuana charges at the federal level for just possession. Most of those are done at the states and don't have to be done there. The third thing was kind of interesting that we could, he is kind of signaling that he wants to start the process of reviewing marijuana status. That can change through the executive branch. Is more bureaucratic, it goes through the FDA, but you ask what changed. Well, yesterday nothing really changed about the category. It's a difficult category right now. I think you could see the negative of yesterday, but it didn't sustain into it today is that you do have a problem both the USA and Canada of too many players in the category. If you open up capital, that could only make things worse. So it's hard to say where things change because it best if...",https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NDK8QAnFNxU,90,2022-10-07 20:21:24

So it's hard to say where things change because it best if we do go down this process of descheduling, you're going to get, it's going to be a long process. And as we wrote, I'm not sure you're going to like the like what's at the end. The one silver lining is maybe safe act does have a better chance of happening in the late duck session out of this. Yeah, I found a notable that Kim Rivers, uh, Trulief CEO joined us, said it was better late than never as for the pardons, but called it historic and monumental as for the potential rescheduling. Uh, in terms of the investment space, though, did anything change if you are a cannabis investor? No, the category is still in a tough place. Let's go go around the world for the hydroponic stocks that we cover, which is actually kind of one of the broader classes where you best include Scott's Miracle Grow. The category still amidst a great, a really great recession when we have too much capacity, WM technology, kind of a leading cannabis tech vehicle. I think that we think that they have a strong value proposition over time. They've won the very few brands in cannabis, but retailers are still under pressure in their markets. Canada says really nothing to do with Canada, but Canada is a difficult market. It's increasing for, increasingly fragmented, very competitive and a difficult structure. And for as far as Canadians being able to invest here, well, I don't know why I'm excited about Canadians suddenly being able to invest in US if assets were to re-rate, which is they would do. MSOs, I mean, I'll defer to my colleague Andrew Partheno on that one, but the US MSOs, it doesn't change anything overnight for them, but there is that silver lining of opening up capital of being safe and if that does pass. Yeah, we still know real optimism because not a single Republican in the Senate has publicly supported safe. On what's your level of optimism? I mean, a timeline on actual federal legalization and beyond that, what could change the investor story? Yeah, sure. I'd say for the safe fact, I mean, I think odds are better. And now we know that. And I think in particular because President Biden did do the pardons. So that take potentially provides some progressives cover. Now what we'll get into the nuances of pardons versus expungements and see if see if the some of the aggressive take refuge in that. So a little bit better, but my timeline on it, I guess I'd be, we could, I think because President Biden has signal this, maybe even it could lead to Congress wanting to take up the issue themselves as to not leave this and not leave it to the attention consequences. Maybe something does happen within the next two years, but I think that, that is an optimistic case in itself. Yeah, I think we're a political win than anything else as we approach the midterms and gas actually goes back up. He needed some sort of October surprise for a win perhaps though till raise reporting gives us a better sense over all of the sector is $66 million. I lost. What did we learn there? Well, yeah, the $66 million loss you refer to as an accounting loss. We refer to the Justin EBITDA numbers were kind of right in line with our estimates. $13.5 million EBITDA, a lot of one time things in the quarter, though, was the $42 million dollar burn. I don't think we learned a lot. We know Canada is a difficult market that's weighing on their, on their profits. Even though even as they reduce their cost and try to increase their market share. It's one thing we learned. They did reiterate their EBITDA guidance for the year. I would argue with FX. They actually, the guidance is actually higher and a little bit difficult. That was encouraging. They also read their free cash flow guidance. When say we learned anything today, Canada is a difficult market. They and until raise probably as we've written, we believe that of the companies trying to go after a leading market share and position. In market share position in Canada and trying to leverage that for kind of a global state. They're probably in the best position, but you can't get away from the fact that Canada is a very difficult market and that's going to be expensive to do. Yeah, at this point more cautionary tales than success stories in Canada. It's a stifle analyst, Andrew Carter. Good to see you. Thanks. Hey, thanks for having me. Jonathan. Another hot button issue ahead of the midterms. A student loan forgiveness. The website allowing people to register is set to go alive soon. But the White House's plan is facing opposition. Joining us now we want to bring in Yahoo Finance editor in chief Andy Soror. And you recently sat down with Education Secretary Miguel. Cardona talking to him about this. What did he say about the plan? Well, he's in defense mode right now because as you said, Shana, the",https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NDK8QAnFNxU,91,2022-10-07 20:25:49
2875," Education Secretary Miguel Cardona talking to him about this. What did he say about the plan? Well, he's in defense mode right now because as you said, Sean, the plan is out. It was announced in late August, but opposition is beginning to mount and coalesce from various sides. And we'll talk a little bit about that. But he basically preempted this notion that it's a handout by saying that if you're going to criticize this plan, why are you not criticizing the PPP bailout? And why are you not criticizing tax cuts? In other words, it's always the case that the government is giving to some groups and not to others. So I think that was at least one argument he was making. Also, we spoke to Ayanna Presley, a member of the squad, a representative from Massachusetts. And she was saying that, look, this is something we need to do if we want to help Americans get a better shake from our society. So the left, her and AOC and others are more or less on board with a Biden plan, even though they wanted more at one point. To the notion that these others, I mean, two wrongs don't make a right is what our parents told us. Right? So I get pushed back on that notion. But as for the opposite, and we've got secretaries of state lining up with lawsuits, how significant is the Republican opposition to it? Well, it's significant, Dave. And we talked to Kevin Breedy, a representative from Texas. And he basically said it's inflationary. It's irresponsible. But most of all, it is unfair. And he went on, said the plumber doesn't get one. But the guy whose house he's fixing does get one and so forth. There are a number of lawsuits. And I think those six AGs from those red states, that is a significant thing. There are also a number of private lawsuits from groups in California and Wisconsin as well. And there's some that suggests that, and Ben Worshkel wrote about this, our colleague, saying that if it goes into the course and gets to the Supreme Court, it would get voted down. Some question, the constitutionality of whether Biden has actually the right to be able to do this plan. So it's a unique question on the campaign trail. But he said, I don't have the authority. Now that I'm in the seat, different thing. Yeah. Yeah. Now, obviously, student debt forgiveness is just a piece of it. But, and isn't there really much more beyond this that needs to be addressed? Yeah, that's right, Worshkel. I mean, it's a big stew. It's a big mess. And Sheila Baer, former head of the FDIC, who was president of Washington College, by the way. So this is kind of in her wheelhouse, said really that the whole thing's a big mess. And Baer said, listen, I'm a Republican. I voted for Biden. I am for some student forgiveness, but only $10,000 to the Pell Grant recipients. Not this bigger pot, not this bigger pool. And really she talks about how colleges and universities, the tuition costs, I've been exceeding inflation, the system is very opaque. It's very complex. Bar-oars don't know what they're getting into. And so to just do a bailout right here is something that is just taking one tiny little slice. And of course, we're getting towards midterms, you guys. So there's that factored in as well. And others point to the fact that this could be inflationary. Sheila Baer is saying, if we're going into recession, let's help people who are unemployed, not necessarily this group of individuals. So as you can see, just a ton of swirl around this. And it'll be interesting to see when it rolls out. And if and when it actually is going to happen even at this point. Can't wait to read your piece. The boss. Yeah. Heather and Chief Andy Server, thank you. Have a good weekend, sir. Thanks, you guys. All right, coming up, retired poker champion. Any dude joins us to explain why knowing when it's time to walk away is sometimes the best decision you can make in the workplace.",https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NDK8QAnFNxU,92,2022-10-07 20:29:47
2876," 100 meters over The great resignation may have given way to quiet quitting in the eyes of social media, but those actually quitting remain strong in number 4.2 million. Quit their jobs in August as the number remains historically high. Duke literally wrote the book on this subject, quit the power of knowing when to walk away. She joined us now and he nice to see you. So when is quitting a good thing? And did you learn this from your days at the professional poker table? Yeah, I mean, I think I definitely learned this lesson from poker. So when quitting isn't a good thing, is when the thing you're doing is no longer worthwhile, either on its own or in comparison to other things that you might do with that time instead. So this is a concept that's really important to understand in poker. You have this option to fold, which means to quit the hand. And you do that when the hand is no longer going to have a positive return on investment, at least in your sort of forecast. And that allows you to keep those chips to be able to invest in other hands that would have a positive return. And this skill for poker players is so important that I think it's actually the thing that distinguishes great players from merely good ones. Great players fold somewhere between 75 and 85% of their two cards starting cards, hands and amateurs fold less than 50% of them. So this is a big distinction between great and good. And it's interesting because quitting used to be associated with failing, but you say that's not the right way to look at it. How do you equate that with success? Yeah, I mean, I wouldn't say it used to be associated with failing. I would say it is associated with failing. I mean, if I called you a quitter, I'd be insulting you, right? So I'd be calling you a loser or something like that. The reason why it's such a key skill that we really need to get good at is because there's all these cognitive biases that stack the deck against us actually stopping things when we ought to. So we have the intuition that when we get involved in something, when we start something, we find out new information that will actually stop doing it when that information is bad, when it's a negative signal. But we actually don't, right? We will often double down, we'll increase our commitment to the cause. And the problem with that is it costs us a lot because it means that we're spending our time and our resources, our money on things that really aren't worth.",https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NDK8QAnFNxU,93,2022-10-07 20:34:28
2877," crease our commitment to the cause. And the problem with that is it costs us a lot because it means that we're spending our time and our resources are money on things that really aren't worth doing. And we want to be able to switch that to things that are because there's just huge opportunity costs to it's sticking to something that isn't worthwhile. And that's true whether it's a stock that you've bought that you bought at 50 and now it's at 40 and even though you wouldn't buy it today, you stick with it because you don't want to have to turn that loss on paper into a realized loss. And so you kind of keep the bet on hoping you can get the money back. And think what that's doing to you because you can't take that money and put it into an investment that might be worth more like better for your money. I love the analogy. I understand it. Annie, I just don't play poker. My son does. And I'm trying to teach my son you need grit. Grit will carry you through the tough times. Is there a danger in emphasizing quit over grit? I don't think I think there's a danger in emphasizing one or the other. In other words, thinking that being gritty is heroic and you know quitting is cowardice or advice versus all of a sudden saying that we should just quit things willing. I mean, the great thing about grit is it gets you to stick to hard things that are worthwhile. In other words, those worthwhile things where you encounter obstacles grit is going to allow you to sort of stick to it regardless, right? The problem is that it also gets us to stick to hard things that aren't worthwhile. So like a good example is there's this woman, Shavano Keith, who in the 2019 London marathon started experiencing pain online on mile four in her leg. And then mile eight, she had snapped her fibula bone so she literally broke her leg. But she kept running because anything sort of the finish line is failure. And so the problem is like we need to make sure these are finish lines that we should still continue to run toward. And in this particular case, she was risking very, very serious injury that could have made it so that she could never run again. Now, let's you think she's a strange story. There were three other people who did the same thing in that same marathon. And this happens in every marathon. And so when we emphasize grit and we sort of elevated above anything else, we can start climbing mountains and snowstorms when we shouldn't be or running marathons with broken legs or staying in a job with a toxic boss or sticking with an investment where the world has completely gone against your thesis just because you don't want to give it up. And you feel like you need to stick to it. I mean, and it really is true because it's so engraved in us to try and stick with things even when they aren't serving us. And it's interesting because the stats in your book, the pros play fewer than 25% of their hands before the other cards even hit the table. And most amateurs, you have it play about about 50%. And so when people are trying to think of how they can really master some of these skills and their instincts, how should they go about it? Yeah, so there's two main strategies for dealing with this because we really do need to understand that like cognitively, we have a huge bias against quitting. I think most of your listeners are probably familiar with the sunk cost fallacy that we take into account what we've already lost in trying to decide whether to continue. So that's a bias against stopping. So given that we're not going to be very good at deciding to stop once we started to accumulate those losses, like if the stock is already trading at 40 when we bought it at 50, there's two strategies. One is think ahead. So a simple example of think ahead would be a stop loss or even a take gain. These are ways that we can think ahead to what are the conditions under which we would let this particular endeavor go or this investment that we have go. The other thing you can do is get what I call a quitting coach. So like Rochelle, I mean, I assume that you've seen people who are sticking to things and from the outside looking in, it's very obvious that they should be quitting them, but they're not. And if we assume that that's true, then we can realize that that probably happens to us as well. So why not recruit those people who can see it better than you can because they're on the outside looking in and get them to help you with these decisions? I mean, it's kind of what a financial advisor is, right? They're trying to coach you. When is it right to stick to it? And when is it right to walk away? Because they understand that we're not going to be very good at making those decisions ourselves. Yes, true. Sometimes when you're too close to a situation, you can't see the forest for the trees.

2878," When you're too close to a situation, you can't see the forest with the trees. It's been great having you on. And you do. Thank you so much. Have a wonderful afternoon. Thank you. Well, shift. Good to have you now. Shifting is now to meta, which has begun notifying Facebook users that may have had their accounts compromised by third party apps. Yeah, the finances, Alie Garfingle has the latest on this. Alie, what do we need to know? Great to see you, Rachelle. So meta's been notifying 1 million Facebook users that they've been affected by these malware apps that on the face of it, look, look pretty harmless. They're often photo editors, lifestyle trackers, that sort of thing. But what meta's found is that they're available both on the Apple App Store and on the Google App Store. So they have put this forth to their users and they are now bringing it to both Apple and Google. So this is kind of coming at a time for lots of controversy for app stores, right? You have a lot of controversy surrounding how apps or fees are structured. You have a lot of controversy surrounding Apple's privacy changes that came last year, which by the way, really hit meta's bottom line hard. My take on this sort of Rachelle is that after years of being known for their privacy failures, meta's trying to show that they're turning a corner here being proactive protecting users data. And of course meta known, but when it switched this name all about the metaverse, but their flagship metaverse app Horizon Worlds has been called bug riddles by employees according to a report from the Virgis. So much that in fact, that employees aren't actually using it. How big of a problem could this be the meta? Well, it's a really big problem, right, Rachelle? It's their big bet. It's what they changed the name of the company, what they really hung out their shingle on. And you know, it's interesting. So many experts I talked to are bullish on the metaverse, but I've questions about meta's ability to lead an uncharted territory. I got a, I got a statement from meta. I was in communication with them this morning and what they said to me was, were confident that the metaverse is the future of computing and should be built around people. This is a multi-er journey and we're going to keep making what we build better. So they're pushing forth. There's no question that they keep going here. I think the question is, if they can push through and become true leaders in this space, if they can get through these bugs, if they can get to the place where Horizon Worlds is indispensable in the metaverse. And as they mentioned that, a multi-year plan, so we'll be keeping an eye on that. Ali, go through it. It's always good to see you have a great weekend, Dave. Thank you, Rachelle. Here's a look now at what to watch for next week. Monday is Indigenous Peoples Day, but markets are open on Tuesday.

On the economic front Wednesday, we'll get the producer price index and the Fed minutes as well. Earning start to trickle in with PepsiCo reporting ahead of the open on Thursday. We've got to look at inflation with the consumer price index and boys of Fed watching that. Weekly jobless claims plus quarterly results from BlackRock, Delta, and Walgreens. And we route out the week with the unofficial start to earnings. Season with bank earnings.

2879," Laughter Let's take a look at some of the biggest movers of the week investors have been on quite a roll of coaster ride here. So let's kick it off with some of the biggest moves that we've seen play out in the markets. Let's start with the chip stocks because it has been a rude awakening for investors. To thought that the sector may have bottom signs of slowing demand and supply chain issues have some worried about a prolonged downturn. You can see the semiconductor index moving to the downside here on the five day chart. Samsung reported a 32% dive in operating income AMD. Lord, it's revenue guidance for the third quarter. That was enough to drag down some of its competitors. Intel and Nvidia both moving to the downside. You can see the move over the last 48 hours or so. So part of this, a regulations from the Biden administration, clumping down on China's access to chip technology with new export rules AMD dropping 14% today. The biggest drop that we have seen in this stock since March 2020 closing the week at 5844. Next up, let's talk about Twitter this stock up just about 12% over the past five days. I'm reviving chance of Elon Musk's takeover, but this deal is very far from being over. They now seem to have stalled and part over a debt financing contingency. This is according to reports yesterday, a Delaware judge granted musks a requested delay his trial with Twitter, giving both sides until October 28 to complete the deal over the past five days. You can see it up just about 12% closing at 4918. So below that deal price that musk is what initially wanted to pay for Twitter at 5420 a share. Let's talk about oil recording the biggest weekly rally that we have seen since March as worries over supply offset some of those demand concerns on the supply side. OPEC plus announcing its biggest output cut since the start of the pandemic. The move coming ahead of the impending European sanctions on Russian oil imports. It's a massive reversal from what we've seen, and crude as of late over the past three months. You can see crude off just over 10% coming off the worst quarter that we have seen since 2020, but really rallying on the news that we got this week. It's rounded out with peloton, the sucks therging more than 20% to big announcements. We start off the week with the partnership with Hilton, and then we heard about another round of cut CEO Larry Barry McCarthy announcing plans to cut about 12% of the workforce. It's fourth round of layoffs this year saying, quote, he needs to do it to save the company. One of the ways that they're trying to save the company and increase business is through a new partnerships agreement with Hilton will put its bikes in 5400 Hilton owned hotels throughout the US. You can see peloton moving to the upside for the past five days up just around 25% you can see it did close the day.",https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NDK8QAnFNxU,96,2022-10-07 20:47:12

But for the week, closing at $8.69 a share. Michelle? All right. So what I was speaking of fresh ideas, equity crowdfunding is seeing continued growth as access to venture capital dollars becomes more and more scarce. Now, according to crowdfunding tracker Aurora Project, startups already raised more than $200 million this year. We're joining us now as an expert in crowdfunding and a new CEO of Kickstarter, Everett Taylor, Everett Gray to have you on the show. So, fresh in the job here. First off, what made you decide to take it and what sort of changes or developments are you hoping that you're going to kick off here at Kickstarter? Well, thank you first for having me. It's an honor to be here. And it was really exciting time to come to Kickstarter, right? Especially in this current macroeconomic environment where access to capital is more difficult than ever. And a lot of people that are starting new things may not fit for the traditional venture capitalists or traditional investor. And so for me, I feel very aligned with the mission of Kickstarter. I, from one of them, from South Cybers, Virginia, where I didn't have a lot of resources growing up. So to be able to be at a platform to help people's dreams come true and bring beautiful things into the world and impact so many lives, it was a no-brainer. Everett, what are you seeing just in terms of people starting businesses right now, especially in this current state of the downturn that we're seeing in the economy? So many people worried about inflation, higher prices. Is that affecting the number of people that are looking to start with their business right now? I think so. I think a lot of people are fearful of the macroeconomic environment. And you see it from big companies to small entrepreneurs that want to launch their own companies. And I think what was so exciting about coming to Kickstarter, it provides a way for people to be able to find capital for the ideas that they have. And things that may not be big businesses, like venture capitalists tend to want to have huge returns and most businesses aren't that way. And so I think it's incredible to be at a platform that can help so many entrepreneurs during a time of so much uncertainty and be able to provide them a viable way to really bring that into life. And Everett, looking at some of the companies on the screen, the Oculus and Pebble that actually started out on Kickstarter, I still remember where Kickstarter was first time to come. People were getting bids on being able to make a grilled cheese sandwich or a potato salad. But obviously, as you see these different companies advance, what do you think the evolution is going to be next? You have things like blockchain and other elements coming into play. How do you see the company evolving to some of these new technologies that are coming out? You know, it's interesting even when I was listening before, I saw you guys talking about Peloton. Peloton was even started on Kickstarter. So a lot of really, you know, technologically forward companies have started on Kickstarter. So I think we're going to embrace that. I think we're going to embrace the evolution of the world around us. And I'm really open to new types of companies, new types of projects. And I'm coming into this crowdfunding industry with a very open mind. I just really want to be able to see people bring the things that they want to into life. And have a viable platform to do so. But I think we're going to be extremely supportive of new technologies and new things that are happening around the world. Everton, in terms of your business right now, hiring plans, how you see Kickstarter growing over the years, what does that look like? And are you able to get the number of workers that you need for Kickstarter? Oh, I think so. I think what's so interesting about Kickstarter and it's exciting. Allow me to brag and flex for a second is that Kickstarter has a really great balance sheet right now. We're profitable the past couple of years in the pandemic. We're our best years yet. We actually grew 30% during the pandemic, which is a lot for such an established company. And so I think we're in a great place to aggressively hire, but it do so in the right ways. I think what we've seen in this macro economic environment is that so many companies were a little bit careless when it came to hiring and overhiring and bloated salaries and things like that. So we've been very intentional. That's why I want to continue to be intentional, but I want us to",https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NDK8QAnFNxU,97,2022-10-07 20:51:29
2881," and overhiring and bloated salaries and things like that. So we've been very intentional thus far. And I want to continue to be intentional, but I want us to see a lot more massive growth. Crowdfunding has so much potential. And I want to continue to grow the industry to support more people, especially diverse creators out there and then also welcoming more Gen Z creators as well. And everyone, as people look for transparency and what their funding and wins for these things come into fruition, what sort of investments are you making in that space to really make their place where people know exactly what they're sort of getting into with these sort of projects? Yeah, pledge management is a huge component about Kickstarter. Obviously Kickstarter is a dominant player in the space in terms of driving that demand to get to that point. But then what happens after? And that's where pledge management comes into. And so I think Kickstarter will definitely be looking into that and figuring out ways that we can make our creators more successful is because if we're helping our creators be more successful and helping with their fulfillment, then the backers on our platform are gonna have a lot better experiences. And so that is a key priority for me. All right, Everett Taylor, great to have you. Kickstarter, CEO, we wish you all the best. We hope you come back and join us again on Yoll and Finance. Well, coming up the Super Mario Brothers movie doesn't come out until next April, but fans are getting an early glimpse into what's ahead. But it's not without from controversy. We've got that for you when we come back. county.

2882," It shows the Brooklyn plumber brothers as they battle Bowser across the mushroom kingdom featuring a star-studded cast with Chris Pratt voicing Mario controversially and Charlie Day playing Luigi Anatella Joy joins as Princess Peach, Seth Rogan as Donkey Kong, Keegan Michael Key as Toad and Jack Black plays the fire-breathing Bowser. It's the first Mario Brothers movie since 1993's live action film starring Bob Hoskins and John Leguzzama and it's scheduled to hit theaters April 7, 2023 and there was massive controversy as soon as this trailer hit because nobody, Rachelle, liked the voice that Chris Pratt brought to Mario, somewhat reminiscent of what happened with Sonic the movie when they were offended by the sight of Sonic and they tweaked it, but this was pretty much universally panned. But I do feel a bit bad for Chris Pratt. You don't want to get this sort of feedback, especially since when you heard Jack Black voicing Bowser, which is perfect, it was absolutely perfectly cast for that voice acting. It's hard, won't you get so used to seeing Chris Pratt one role? That voice is very hard, you'd associate it with something else. I do feel a bit bad, but yes, the voice doesn't quite match. I'm still going to watch the movie though, I'm a big Super Mario fan, been playing it since I was a little girl, so I'm still going to watch it. You know, I read about the feedback of his voice and then when I listened to it, I didn't think it was as bad as some critics are making it out to be. It doesn't really, I guess, totally match up, but it's not terrible. I don't know, I'm going to go out and go ahead and say that, but I will say, it does surprise me how much hype there is for a film like this. I used to play this game when I was nine, ten years old. I don't think I'm going to go and watch this. So the fact that there's this much attention on it, it's making this much news, it's attracting huge names to do the movie, that's a little bit of a surprise to me. I am done with the movie category film from video games and I think we would be done if it weren't for Sonic, but it made 300 million of the box office. I know, and then Sonic too made more than 400 million of the box office, so this is just the beginning. We're going to see video game movies and a stream of pipeline, especially with all the streamers and the lack of original content out there. I would just surprise, we're show by the casting. I love Chris Pratt. I'm not one of those that thinks he's a divisive figure, although he truly is in Hollywood. I mean, guarding the galaxy's aunt standing, but how about Joe Pesci or Roberto Benini or Joe Pesci? I don't know, Steve Buscemi.

Chris Pratt, it's a little quite matching. Charlie, Charlie Daydough as Luigi. I love it, but I also love Charlie Daydough. I'm a little bit biased because I just think his voice is fantastic. I actually liked his voice as Luigi. Will you see it, though? Because we've got two languages. No, I'm going to see it. I'm going to see it. One for three is not bad.

2887," We've heard a lot of chatter about whether or not capacity will exceed demand in the near term. How would you be monitoring the electric vehicle space and especially given some of the not just newer companies but legacy companies that have made swift movements into trying to make sure that they can bring up some of that production capacity in order to meet kind of this next wave of where the consumer is moving towards in a cleaner type of automotive offering on the market. Yeah, I mean, it's a challenge. You look at a lot of different electric vehicles and you simply can't buy them right now. The F-150 Lightning, the Tesla Model 3 long range until recently massively back-ordered. The reality is that demand can move faster than supply. Supply chains from lithium production to battery production can take years to really ramp up scale. Whereas a consumer can change their mind overnight. Let's say, you know, just ride an electric car for the first time. So absolutely we have a supply and demand a balance right now. But we are seeing so much investment from car manufacturers again from the US government and the $370 billion inflation reduction act. So there's a lot of money coming into this space, but it might take a few years to see that capacity increase. Jay, thanks for being with us. Good to see you. Black Rocks, the US head of the Maddick and active equity ETFs, Jay Jacobs. Well, come up next. What investors should be watching this month? So I was going to share his top three things to be bracing yourself for right now.... You September was the worst month for stocks since March of 2020 and October may not be much better. Right? Three reasons why your money is at risk this month. At pessimism, if we refine your take, thanks a lot. Thanks a lot, folks. But just to use a term for our friend, Joe, but swells on Friday, I think investors",https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yvHvxXHIc5I,1,2022-10-10 13:58:07
2888," This this month, pessimism is where we find your take. Thanks a lot, folks. I'm a hell out of folks, but just to use a term for our friend, Joe Berswellas, on Friday, I think investors have just been pulling from the Hopium pipe a little too much here, especially after that rally to kick off this quarter. A couple of reasons why I think investors need to be a little more concerned about the markets going in the back half of the year, or back half of the month, full story on this, on the Alphine's homepage, first inflation data. Well, we're going to get the CPI and PPI this week, in addition to some inflation expectation data from the Michigan consumer sentiment. The problem is none of this data is really supposed to slow or show marked deceleration month over month. A lot of the economists on the street are looking for really the core CPI, which the market will be very focused on and try to extrapolate what that means to Fed policy. That may not slow month over month over month over month. If we get another hot read, like we saw in the jobs report last week, you could very easily see another ugly market reaction, just one guy's thoughts there. Next up, the raw earnings numbers. We've seen previews so far from AMD, micron, Nike, FedEx. They've all been bad quarters. They've all been really bad forward outlook. In fact, FedEx just flat out pulled its outlook because of various inflation. Look, you can't even look at so ugly. Can't even look at so ugly. Yeah, wow, I didn't, yeah, put on the Yahoo purple blindfold. But you look at the raw numbers, excluding the energy sector. Goldman notes, earnings are expected to fall by 3%. And margins are supposed to decline about 140 basis points year by year into third quarter. Real big shift in tone compared to the first half of this year. And then also, of course, last year, hence, you're seeing margins come down. But a big concern. Last but not least, here, just the tone on these executive earnings calls. It's going to be hard to find really any team that's willing to come up here and set the bar high into a fourth quarter where you might still see a strong dollar in the impact on sales and profits, lingering inflation, problems getting workers, you name it. The tone on these calls could be very down beat. And you might see the stocks get hit as a result. Last but not least, here comes some whiplash. That's my take. I think there's been a little calm. That is, wow, that's really aggressive. Do I have an eyes? Well, that's aggressive. But nonetheless, there's been a little calm that has come to the market. We're seeing it today. Saw it a little bit before the Jaws of Por on Friday. But just be careful here. There's some, this earnings is going to be a lot rockier than I think a lot of folks are bracing. So clearly based on their graphic, move over laser eyes that we saw last year in 2021, here come the dizzy eyes. Yes, honoree, your pillow and hope for better days. Well, as always. I know you're taking the other sides. You're looking for earnings beats today. No, well, there will be earnings beats. Come on, they're always our earnings beats. It's about outlook, bubble block. But it matters what your investment horizon is. As always, if you're retiring next year, you may have a problem. If you're looking like J. Jacobs a little bit further in the future, maybe you don't freak out. Five to 10 years from now, taxes will be hard to be a big earnings headline. I'm just really in. Yeah, it's not going to work. The larger question is, how soon will markets fully price in the biggest risks of a recession perhaps? And because they typically priced that in months ahead of time, what does that actually look like in terms of setting in a bottom and when do we bounce off of that? And we're about to find out. Yeah, guys, come here. Why are next guests says that it's likely the Fed will stay hawkish for the foreseeable future? That's not good. For that bottoming out. I was just going to start on the other side.",https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yvHvxXHIc5I,2,2022-10-10 14:02:48
2889," to Welcome back to Yow Finance on this Monday morning on Brian Saas, alongside Julie Heimann and Brad Smith. Markets or mix, this trader's gear up from important reads on inflation this week and the start of earning season with results out of the big banks. You're seeing some mixed action across the board, the Dow slightly in the green. Now here are three things we're watching for you at this moment. On high alert for a recession, we'll talk one economic expert on the road ahead for the sputtering U.S. economy. And DC heats up. Yow Finance contributor Kevin Surley stops by ahead of the annual World Bank and IMF meetings later this week. And a key great recession player wins some new hardware for his trophy shelf. We'll have the details coming up shortly. Now let's get over to Yow Finance as an S for A over at the Wi-Fi Interactive. And Saas, we are looking at a mixed picture when it comes to equities. The bond market today is closed. But the NASDAQ is the one that is really underperforming right now, down 6.10% of a percent. That's because technology stocks are under pressure so you can see tech here under pressure, healthcare and consumer discretionary as well. Over on the NASDAQ on 100, we are watching a little bit of flatness when it comes to Amazon, Tesla, up about 7.10% of a percent. And Apple, down about 1%. Do you want to point out what's happening with the Chinese ADRs? Because we are seeing some of these Chinese ADRs under pressure. And this is because of some holiday shopping data also because of COVID cases in China. So that's putting pressure on these Chinese stocks. And also putting pressure on some of the gambling stocks as well. So just looking at our gambling chart, we are seeing some of these casinos and win resorts that are under pressure as well as some of the travel stocks guys. Alright, Yow Finance is on the NASDAQ. Thanks for breaking that down for us. Appreciate it. And as we continue to look ahead to what's on tap this week with the Fed Minutes and CPI data, let's bring in the co-founder of the Economic Cycle Research Institute, Loxman to Truth and to break it down. Loxman always a pleasure to speak with you and get some of your insights. Help us tee up this week. I mean, we've got a ton of data, of course. Last week was the big kind of employment reading across the board from private payrolls all the way into some of the Joltz data that we had seen, even though that's lagging a little bit more. And of course, the Monthly Jobs report. What is that setup for what the Fed is also going to be tracking on pricing more broadly this week and what consumers are actually paying? Great question. And thank you for having me. Good morning. Jobs data, CPI data this week, Jobs data last Friday, CPI data this week. Those are all what we would call from a cyclical kind of monitoring point of view, coincident data. And the Fed has declared for many years, kind of what got us into the.",https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yvHvxXHIc5I,3,2022-10-10 14:06:51
2890," So, all what we would call from a cyclical kind of monitoring point of view, coincident data. And the Fed has declared for many years, it's kind of what got us into this pickle in the first place that they're going to be tracking coincident data in order to figure out what to do. And every once in a while, you'll hear that their data dependent. And that's a little bit of an eye into that view. And so we look at the jobs data. Yeah, it was a pretty good report on the face of it. Your year of a year job growth actually is trending down. It's about a year and a half low in the growth rate. So cyclically, we know this direction we're going in, but the jobless rate at a half century low, three and a half percent on the face of it, that's hawkish, more hawkish Fed. It's not what they want to see at this point. They need more weakness in the labor market and they've said that in various ways. And then when you look to the CPI, coincident inflation data this week, probably too sticky, probably too hot. Our cyclical view, right, forward looking cyclical view, is that actually the peak is in, right? And a cyclical peak has already happened in inflation. We are trending down. The problem is that it's going to be very sticky. You might get some relief in the pace of goods related inflation, but the services side where most of the spending happens, including rents, for example, very, very sticky. And as a result, I in the earlier segment, the point was made that, you know, core is going to be sticky. They're looking at core coincident inflation. So again, kind of a hawkish, you know, angle to the Fed, trying to make up for the earlier mistake of missing the inflation cycle upturn, continuing to slow the economy. So Lakshman, you talked about where we are in the inflation cycle. What about where we are in the overall economic cycle, right? Because what we've been hearing from guests as of late is the tenor has started to shift a little bit from being pretty darn confident that it was going to be a mild recession if we get one to maybe leaning a little bit more into, well, maybe it's going to be a little bit more severe than we thought. Thanks. Excellent question. And I, this is how we edge into the realization that, yes, there's a recession. And markets are, and analysts can be kind of manic depressive, right? So they'll be like, no, it's not happening in all of a sudden as it becomes more obvious that something's a foot, they can overdo it and get more extreme the other side. Our analysis is that, yes, there is going to be a recession. To be clear, we will need to see job losses for there to be a recession. Also, to be clear, there have been several instances historically where recessions begin before job losses begin. One of the more extreme examples would be the 73, 75 recession, which was a very severe recession, which began and then jobs actually kept growing for eight months until you actually saw jobs to start negative. So the recession itself began a little bit earlier. This is getting into the weeds about how recessions are determined. And we may be seeing some of that here because it was so hard to find the people that you needed to work that businesses are very reluctant to let them go. Even when they're starting to see difficulty on earnings and you were saying in the earlier segment also I was watching about how this earnings kind of recession feeling is coming in. And FedEx, for example, it's just like, forget it, we can't even say anything. It's a global recession and we don't know what's going to happen. And global recessions to be fair, they are more severe than your kind of garden variety recession. So I think that's a reasonable thing to be thinking about in your scenario planning. Do you think the economy next year will start shedding jobs like you mentioned? Yes, look, if we're right and there's a recession and I think that we are correct here, then by definition there must be job losses. The question will be how much structurally there's a lot of issues in tightness in the labor market so that may limit it to some degree. We have seen as I mentioned in that inflationary kind of 70s period where the nominal numbers look pretty good. The businesses were slow to let people go. I mean, it's very, very expensive to hire someone and then let them go. You have to train them up.",https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yvHvxXHIc5I,4,2022-10-10 14:11:07
2891," slow to let people go. I mean, it's very, very expensive to hire someone and then let them go. You have to train them up and then you have to let them go. That's the last thing you want to do as a business manager. So I understand why that is and they're hopeful. Certainly you see all the time. There's a lot of hope in you use that. I was watching everything this morning. You're using the hope in order this morning. And there's a lot of this this comes up in them in the market talk. Oh, maybe they're going to pivot. Maybe they're going to be able to sell. I don't think that's going to happen. But that kind of talk probably is is keeping some of the jobs growth going to. Um, Lex, man, how does the Fed then react to all of this? Right? There is the talk of pivot has faded away a little bit. Yeah. But at some point, do we see the Fed sort of quickly trying to backpedal here and fix some of the economic damage that it looks like that the policy could cause? Yeah. I mean, I think that we wrote at the beginning of the year in January. We wrote that there's that they had a choice of two mistakes. Right? And meaning that they either had to take a recession or they had to let inflation run out of control. I'm being overly simplistic and they've chosen the recession. So the intention is the pain that is the goal. And I think Powell said as much in one of the Q and A things a week or two ago. And and so will they go too far? I mean, in the sense that there'll be a recession. I think yes. Uh, and they, I think believe that they have the tools to counterman that at some point and and and ease up on the on the typing. But by their own definition, they're saying that they want to see the pace of core. CPI growth, depending on various measures of looking at it, drop down. And by all the analysis and the now casting that we're hearing, this week's CPI is still going to be sticky. And and we think we understand why it's probably more in the services side that it'll be sticky. But the Fed is saying if it's sticky, we're going to stay the course. And that's not what the market wants to hear. So we probably have this slower grinding. And again, you, you had mentioned earlier. It's tempting because prices are down to start to look for bargains longer term bargains. But you're going to have to accept a lot of volatility because this chapter isn't over yet. Okay. So with that in mind and also given that you've studied previous economic cycles, we know that the markets try to price in the risk of a recession well ahead of time. But what would that bottom bottom out period look like in relative to now relative to the declines that we've already seen over the course of 2022. And when might we see that bottom? Hard to say magnitude wise, right? So if it's a global recession and the odds are high, I think of that, it could be more severe. So the recognition of that may be mean some more downside volatility. The question of then is where else do you put your money in? It's and it's hard to figure that out. So there's a lot of maybe this isn't the worst place even though it's going down. These bigger recessions, you could see larger retransments in equity prices than we've seen so far. So that's totally in the cards. The relationship between equities and business cycles, business cycle recessions is that they do tend to sniff out the recovery before the bottom of the recession by a few months. And I have no reason to believe this cycle wouldn't be different. Looking at other leading indicators of non equity related leading indicators, it doesn't look like the bottom is in sight yet. And so that's why we were very suspicious of the soft landing bottoming narrative that developed a few months ago. So I think that the S&P was like in 3600 right around there at 3660 and it was like, that's it. We're seeing the light at the end of the tunnel. We could see across the valley. And of course that was premature. I think we have another light down here. It sounds like that is indeed what we.",https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yvHvxXHIc5I,5,2022-10-10 14:15:21
2892," I think we have another leg down here. It sounds like. That is indeed what we call a head fake. Lachman, at your time. Economics, cycle, research, institute, co-founder. Always good to see you. Have a good rest of the week. Nice to see you too. Thank you. All right, before we head to break, let's highlight some cautious analysis on IBM. By Marcus down these Eric Woodring, head of its October 19th earnings report, notably Woodring expects IBM to miss consensus margin estimates says Woodring in a note to clients. We see downside two street margins and reduce our margin estimates as we expect cost pressures to persist in 3Q. Most of those margin pressures are seen coming from IBM's consulting and infrastructure businesses. Coming up, former Fed Chair Ben Bernanke is a big winner today, Julie is back with today's top headlines next. All right, I'm going to let you know Here are some of the other headlines that we are watching at this hour, at least 11 or 60 injured in Ukraine this morning. After Russia launched its biggest widespread assault on the country since the start of its invasion, this comes after Vladimir Putin accused the country of attacking a critical bridge to Crimea and promised a harsh response if Kiev were to conduct further terrorist attacks, his words on Russian territory. Ukrainian President Vladimir Zelensky says Russia wants, quote, panic and chaos, he cited attacks on the country's electrical grid and other civilian infrastructure. Former US Federal Reserve Chair Ben Bernanke and two other US economists, Douglas Diamond and Philip Dibvig, were recognized by the Nobel, Nobel panel at the Royal Swedish Academy of Sciences in Stockholm today. The three economists sharing the Nobel Prize for their research into the fallout from bank failures. The panel said the trio's research, quote, significantly improved the understanding of the role of banks and why avoiding bank lapses is vital. Credit Tweet shares extend.",https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yvHvxXHIc5I,6,2022-10-10 14:20:02
2893," The trio's research quote significantly improved the understanding of the role of banks, and why avoiding bank lapses is vital. Credit Tweet shares extended their rally to a third day after Bloomberg reported that bidders are lining up for the bank's Securitized Products Unit. That's a key pillar in the downsizing of its investment banking operations. A sale of that unit could prove an additional catalyst for the bank, which recently offered to buy back up to $3 billion of its own debt. It's a busy week down in DC highlighted by the annual IMF and World Bank meetings. The Alphine's contributor, Kevin Surley, has some analysis for us on these events. Kevin, what's on your radar screen? T minus 30 days until the midterm elections, and this week we're going to get two crucial debates that really could be indicative not just of what's happening in Ohio and in Georgia, but the broader country as a whole. In Ohio, the late night senate, J.D. Vance, the Maga Republican, challenging former Democratic congressman Tim Ryan. Remember, he ran for president last cycle as well. This is a debate that is going to be the first of two for them leading up to the midterm elections, but let's not forget that early voting has started in multiple states. And now it is when voters are going to be paying more careful attention. And then of course down in Georgia, Rafael Warnock, the Democrat Governor incumbent, challenging being challenged rather by Herschel Walker. Now he of course has been played by a series of allegations that he denies a chief among them that he advocated for his former girlfriend to have an abortion. Walker has made being anti-abortion part of his platform. So this is really the first time and potentially the last time where these two politicians and the Georgia governor race will come face to face. And mind you, this comes at a time when abortion has risen to the top of the polls as to what Democrats are paying attention to. But this debate really could reverberate outside of Georgia. A lot of folks paying attention to what's going on there. Yeah, indeed, a lot of eyes on that state and the race there, Kevin. Also, we got to talk about jobs and how the recent jobs report that impacts Thursday's inflation print as well. Well, precisely, and not just what happened with the jobs report, record low unemployment rate, 50-year low, 3.5%. But juxtaposed with what happened with OPEC, that has many economists worried that inflation in the United States might continue to rise as consumers face more pain at the pump. But while abortion has risen to the top of issues that Democrats are paying a careful attention to, amongst independent voters and Republicans, it's all about the economy. And that's why the inflation report coming on Thursday, the final report ahead of the midterm elections will be so incredibly crucial and carefully watched. This is been something of an economy, rather, that both parties that strive to seize upon, Democrats saying that there's record low unemployment. But of course, Republicans looking at inflation and saying that it's a sign that we're heading even further into a recession. And then finally, you're watching the January 6th Committee. And this, I guess, also has implications going back to the first item you're watching the midterms potentially. When can we look for the January 6th Committee's report? Nobody knows, Jules. I mean, that's what I've been and truthfully, though, I mean, I'll be honest, I was just, you know, talking to folks yesterday, and, and Julie, that's the biggest question here is, all right, now we're having another hearing. It's going to be in the afternoon. CBS News released a poll just a couple of weeks ago ahead of this hearing where they found something like 31 percent of folks who have been paying attention to this say that this is going to make them more likely to vote for Republican 40 percent who are following the hearing. Say it's going to make them more more likely to vote for Democrats. But the timing of the release of this report and the expectation here in the beltway is that this is the final hearing ahead of the midterms. That's going to be incredibly, incredibly watched if it's after the midterms, which is looking like potentially what it could be. How will that see up 2024 candidates who are looking to to launch their campaigns? We'll be watching. All right, Kevin Sir, really, Yahoo Finance's own joining us here to really discuss and break down. We're watching in the beltway and beyond. Well, Kevin, appreciate it. Anytime. Thanks, guys. Definitely coming up. Why are next guests?",https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yvHvxXHIc5I,7,2022-10-10 14:24:09
2894," Let me go see here to really discuss and break down where we're watching in the belt way and beyond. Well, Kevin, appreciate it. Anytime. Thanks, guys. Definitely. Coming up, why are next guests that continue to uncertainty in Europe will cause the US dollar to remain strong. We'll discuss that next. The strong dollar might be here to stay as war and uncertainty in Europe and the UK abroad make the USA comparatively better place to invest. This plus a spendy consumer here at home could mean inflation is set to remain higher for longer for more. Let's bring in Joseph Lewis who is the Jeffries head of corporate hedging and FX solutions. Joe, great to have you here with us today. First and foremost, we've already heard a lot of tech companies, especially, really give their insight or at least forecast into how much FX headwinds would continue to impact them. Is it going to be in par or in line with or even greater than what they anticipated? First things to remember about companies and how they think about foreign exchanges is that it's an averaging process. What you see immediately today will take some time to flow through their earnings. I think what you'll expect is that if the dollar continues to be strong, which is generally the expectation, you're going to see this show up probably Q1, Q2 next year. As the move recently has been so quick that companies haven't had the time for that to flow completely through the income statement. Look, what we're telling companies is what I spend most of my days doing is to give people advice around strong dollars probably here to stay. You summed it up correctly, which is when you think about your alternatives, the UK, Europe, Asia, the US continues to make a ton of sense in terms of...",https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yvHvxXHIc5I,8,2022-10-10 14:28:30
2895," summed it up correctly, which is when you think about your alternatives to UK, Europe, Asia, the U.S. continues to make a ton of sense in terms of where people want to keep assets going forward. So, Joseph, you said that things, you're employing things are going to get worse because the dollar keeps on going up and there's a delayed effect. This is what companies do, right? They hedge currencies. When they're going up, they're going down. This is part of their operations. As you said, you helped them do that. What is it about this current environment that is so tricky for them? Is it the speed of the move in the dollar, the persistence of it? Is there something unique about this point in time? Well, it's two parts, right? I think it's the speed. And then what you have is the persistence, right? And I think for companies, the hard part right here is companies are hedging six to 12 months out. And for a year at most, 18 months for the companies that are a little bit more aggressive. And so the decision to make is if I go and hedge now and go and lock in what is potentially a problem that may bounce back, right? And so the hardest part for companies right now is to really determine will this persist? And when you have this discussion back and forth about, there's going to be a recession in the US which probably could mean the dollar could weaken, it's hard for companies to make decisions, right? You can take 10 economists and you've probably had two or three people on. They'll say slightly different things have slightly different forecasts. And I think that's been really challenging for my clients is sort of, there is an consistency in view. And a lot of times the views have changed so rapidly, right? Six months ago, the view was very different than it is today. And so, you know, it's summed up. I think it's just hard for companies to make decisions in this market when you have this much volatility. And, you know, the outcome is so determined, really not by fundamentals, but really by policy. Joe, what sectors are doing a good job of hedging in this environment? Well, it's funny. I would say, you know, I wouldn't say some sectors. I think it's the size of companies that are doing better. The larger companies just have much more developed policies. They're just doing more. They've got a history of hedging. They've just been global longer. I think it's the new companies that over the last five, 10 years have seen rapid growth. You know, that growth has been faster than their ability to put policy in place, right? So, you know, I wouldn't say it's a sector, right? I think it's, I would say companies that are seeing, you know, have seen meteoric growth over the last 10 years are probably a little bit behind the April. The companies that have been global for 10, 20 years and to be, then to have policies and tend to be managing effects already. Smaller companies are also a little bit troubling, right? Because they, you know, for them, they're still growing, right? And you kind of want to grow and then have hedges in place. So I would say, you know, companies that are big and have grown rapidly recently and smaller companies. I probably worry the most about. And so with the size of those companies that you're really studying across and researching around, it also comes down to their employee base in all of these countries too. What role does the workforce, the employment and the wages across those different entities? What does that play as well in some of the FX considerations? Look, if you can have earnings and costs locally, that's your best outcome, right? So if I can sell my goods in a country and hire locally, that gives me cost to offset revenue. The companies that have the most issues will tend to be companies that have a lot of intellectual capital in one country and then sell goods in the other. So think about tech. Well, if all your programmers are in one country but you're selling goods globally, you don't actually have cost to offset. So companies are starting to think about that, right? How do I create natural offset? Where do I want to have my labor force capital to offset some of my FX risks? That's the ideal situation. Most companies aren't set up that way. They tend to have what you tend to find and you look at a tech sector, you tend to have a lot of costs in the U.S. for the U.S. companies.",https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yvHvxXHIc5I,9,2022-10-10 14:32:53
2896," Most companies aren't set up that way. They tend to have what you tend to find, and you're going to tech sector, you tend to have a lot of costs in the US, for the US companies, and a lot of net income overseas. And so that's always a challenge. Just bottom line, what do you think the magnitude of the effect of stronger dollars going to be in terms of the hit to US corporate earnings? You'll look, I get the benefit, I would say, of not having to look and try to estimate that. The answer's far. That's a very hard question, because companies man it, and when you think about the market, the largest companies that dominate the S&P into Dow, they have FX policies in place, right? And so I think overall, it's probably bigger than people are going to expect. And companies will come out and tell you, they'll say on a constant currency basis, we are X, but I, you know, I wouldn't, I wouldn't have an exact number, but I would say is I do probably at this persistence the next year, that it's probably going to be larger people expect. Good analysis here. Joseph Lewis, Jeffries head of corporate hedging and FX solutions. Have a good rest of the week. We'll talk to you soon. Thank you. Coming up, Netflix stands to mint money from its new ad tier servers to awesome calls of the day. Coming up next. Welcome back. Let's fire off a few calls on the day on this Monday morning. I'm locking in on a good note at a JP Morgan on Netflix. Another note out here explaining the potential financial windfall from an ad tier service, which Netflix is expected to launch next year. And they're correctly pointing out this. This is Alan Doug Anmouth noting quote, the Netflix narrative shifted from slow to no subscriber growth in the current business to advertising and page sharing coming in 2020.",https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yvHvxXHIc5I,10,2022-10-10 14:37:12
2897," really pointing out this, this analyst Doug Anmouth noting quote, the Netflix narrative shifted from slow to no subscriber growth in the current business to advertising and page sharing coming in 2023. You can see that in the stock price. Netflix shares up about 22% in the past three months is really cut fire overall still down 63% year or a day, but still a lot of optimism around the financial potential of this ad service. Anmouth is putting this at potential almost $3 billion by 2026 and maybe 22 million subscribers just in this ad service loan by 2026 next year looking at potential 600 million ad sales from the service. Right. A tear that they moved up in terms of the launch and saying now we're pointing now to November to actually bring the launch into market and it's really going to be a question of when the subscribers really kind of in mass start to latch on to what that new offering could give them in terms of an experience that is lower price. Perhaps yeah, you're still going to get some ads. We know that. Of course, but that's been successful for launch of even the streaming landscape years back. We think back 10 years ago, even when Hulu had some of their ad supported tears, that's really what got some of the introductory members into the streaming services back then. And so now for Netflix, knowing that they've already really capitalized on that high end of pricing mechanisms. Now it's just trying to retain and not turn as many users. And so we could see potentially some of those users kind of downgrading the pricing at least that they're willing to pay at this point. I mean, expectations game for next blix has been the like roller coaster. It's been so fascinating, right? As you mentioned, the beginning like really people not expecting anything from the company. And now as as modeling for its ad platform has leaked, we've seen the expectations really go back up again. So it's hard to see where this goes if it's really going to meet or exceed those those new more sanguine estimates. Yeah, it's a big tell and that didn't exist for Netflix coming into coming into this year. That's for sure. Yeah, they're going to have to compete as well. Disney, even looking at exploring some of their own ad supported tears within Disney Plus, that could be a major competitor for a company that's already seen a massive subscription adoption and has quickly catapulted itself into one of the most powerful streaming services. And that's even pre a massive bundle from Disney too. Yeah. Also here we're tracking shares of craft hines. Yeah, we're going into the kitchen and into the, well, wherever you're starting to catch up and mustards that into the pantries perhaps. After Goldman Sachs made a bullish call on the company upgrading it to buy from neutral with a $43 price target, they're saying that this is one of the consumer staples out there where higher margins, profit margins, it's not fully baked in at this point. So for anybody who's looking to stock up on some catch ups or some mustards, perhaps craft hines is that option. But there's so many other categories that craft hines has been able to really deliver for investors, especially as consumers are really monitoring where they can either buy and bulk in some cases or just get that value that they had seen over many years. And you go back to some of the household names that have the largest brand equity. We'd seen that in some of the other fashion and apparel calls out there on the street. And craft hines is certainly one of those right now with the largest brand equity too. So for those folks last week when those conaggrant earnings numbers hit, you said watch what they said, look what they sent on prices. They had a lot of success despite people becoming more mobile again, pushing through price increases. And that is the same theme that we are seeing in this upgrade from craft hines, which is despite price increases, they're expecting all these price increases that craft took just like conagra, they are likely to stick in coming quarters. Now that comes against a backdrop of CEO Miguel Patricio, probably enough credit for taking this, getting this company off life support, being I think he's passed his two year market CEO, but he's out there cutting a lot of costs from this business. So if you have higher prices, lower costs, that's a pretty good set up for profits. Yeah, it seems that way investors are believing that today also. I'm taking a look at grab holdings. The stock has had been on the move lower down 7% right now after Barclays initiated coverage of the Asian delivery app without over its long term profitability. Now it's an equal weight rating here. It's a neutral weighting. So it's interesting to see it taking such a hit, the price target being set at $3 as you see there. And the analysis car rental costs are a substantial burden for drivers and push up fares. The analysts does say that the company is a category leader in food delivery and ride handling in Southeast.",https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yvHvxXHIc5I,11,2022-10-10 14:41:39
2898," says car rental costs are a substantial burden for drivers and push up fairs. The analyst does say that the company is a category leader in food delivery and ride-hailing in Southeast Asia with a very strong competitive position. So, hence the equal weight, a little bit of good, a little bit of bad, that said, grab also might be getting caught up to some extent in just the selling that we're seeing in Asian trading. But this is a company I believe it came public through a SPAC if I'm not mistaken. And the stock has not done very well since it did come public through that. Yeah, you think about the ride-sharing environment. Not just here in the U.S., but internationally and that's where grab really gets pulled into the conversation there in the markets that they operate where consumers right now for either the pricing that they're seeing higher or the options that are on the market in getting into micro-mobility or other forms of mobility within a broader parent app, if you will, as Uber and Lyft has tried to add on some of that micro-mobility element for grab. It's very similar, but in a market where there is much more of that micro-mobility, that is actually taken advantage of by the consumers here. So, it's going to be how do you reach profitability while building up some of the other mobility mechanisms for consumers and knowing that you still have to make a lot of investments to retain drivers in one sense, but also decrease the operating per mile costs. And that's going to be a significant headwind still for all of these companies as they try to either dabble more in autonomous technology and how quickly that comes forward is a question Mark's still up in the air at this point as well, but for grab that is going to be something that they have to consider similarly as Uber and Lyft do. Well, I haven't bothered with this. It's a $2.50 stock. Most people I would say watching this have never even heard a grab or taken a grab. If you were that hell bent on using or investing in a ride-sharing business, go with Uber. We used to have Brad Arxson saying Uber is starting to really take market share from its largest competitor in the United States lift. That might be the better way to play this space if you really want to. Well, from one mechanism of riding and ride-sharing to another one in owning a vehicle perhaps, we're also watching shares of Tesla this morning after Morgan Stanley's Adam Jonas cut his price target on Tesla from $383 to $350. Warning of continued headwinds into the fourth quarter and 2023. One of the notables here, the fiscal year 2023 delivery forecast, cut to $1.8 million versus the $2 million previously out there saying that they believe the buy-side consensus range for fiscal year 2023 in deliveries is in the $1.7 million to actually $1.9 million range there. Is that how Adam Jonas actually exists? He's got his notes. I've actually never seen his face. I've been sending him emails for over 10 years. It doesn't really get back to me at all. But look, his notes are really good. He's a market mover, auto-stocks. I appreciate his work, appreciate his diligence on Tesla, which is love to see his face. Is he a sister-shoot? Maybe. Just a few more things from the note, if I may. So he says the company is going through peak auto margins right now, which is interesting. He talks about margin headwinds from ramping up to gigafactory zone, two different continents as something that can be a negative for the company. He also says the company could be experiencing demand destruction, which is really interesting here, and also flies a little bit against what I feel like is the conventional wisdom around Tesla, which is that demand is inexhaustible, right? But that it's supply stuff that is maybe held constrained profits. So it's interesting that he's saying there is a little bit of demand destruction going on there. And while they're also trying to ramp up the capacity and production, and so even if you've got the ability to ramp up all of the output at Shanghai Gigafactory at Austin and Berlin, sure that's more capacity that's coming online, but at what cost if the consumers are either opting for a different brand that's coming into market, or if they're just saying we don't like the price of the Tesla's put out their own street. I'm actually Adam Jonas, I wrote that note. You are. All right, coming up, we're listening investment trust. You would think that they would be vulnerable in a high interest rate environment. Our next guest says they are indeed well prepared. I hope you with us next.",https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yvHvxXHIc5I,12,2022-10-10 14:45:55
2899," Good luck! Sure! you you Yeah you're National Association of Reads, Economist John Worth, joined us now. John, you know, I think of reads as a group that are vulnerable when there's a rising interest rate environment for a number of different reasons. They tend to carry relatively high levels of debt, right? So their services in costs are higher. And they're seen as sort of because of their high dividend yields as almost a competing asset for something like treasuries as their yields are going higher. So talk us through why you think they're well positioned here. Absolutely. Happy to do it. You know, I think the view of reads as being high leverage players is one that is a little bit out of date, frankly. What we've seen is that reat leverage has been coming down for basically a decade. So today we've got leverage ratios near all time lows. The debt that reads are holding is quite well termed out. They've got a weighted average term to maturity today of about seven years plus net interest expense as a share of their operating income is at all time lows. And about 85% of their debt is fixed rate. So they're really quite well positioned for a period of rising interest rates. And just as we compare them to other income-generating alternatives, it's important to keep in mind that reads provide income, but they're not fixed income, right? So they provide both income through their steady dividends as well as capital appreciation opportunities. And typically what we see is that in a period where you're coming out of a, where you're coming out of a potential period of slow growth as we might be in about a year that we see reads do quite well. So why would someone look at reads versus say high growth internet at this point, even though high growth internet is perhaps being redefined, reads still have to compete for the same attention when investors are looking to get back into the market as they do against technology or some of the other more flashy names. Yeah, and I think it's important to think about that from a point-",https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yvHvxXHIc5I,13,2022-10-10 14:49:54
2900," into the market as they do against technology or some of the other more flashy names. Yeah, and I think it's important to think about that from a portfolio construction perspective. One of the things we see is that commercial real estate is such a fundamental piece of the overall economy that's really critical for investors of all types. But is commercial real estate still as necessary if you have less people that are going into offices or there's more of a hybrid work approach? Is it still carrying the same weight? Absolutely. I think you really need to think about the breadth of commercial real estate. Commercial real estate, I think many investors think about it as office and retail, but it's a really much broader space. So for example, in REITs, you have data centers, cell phone towers, logistics facilities. So you're getting the breadth of the economy that's housing the modern, the breadth of the real estate that's housing the modern economy. So you may feel like hybrid work is going to have people in the office less. That means you're going to have more activity through data centers, cell phone towers, logistics facilities. It reads, provide a way to grab the whole breadth of the real estate space. John, maybe I'm looking at it too simplistically here, but if we are going into recession next year, that might kick people out of their homes. Doesn't that mean some of those public storage names should do well? Like they did in the Great Recession. Yeah, and I don't think public storage and the other self-storage places are really going to benefit significantly from people maybe losing their homes. What we see is that that's a sector where we saw a huge bump during COVID, a huge bump in demand as people used the space they had differently. So they cleared out the guest room. They cleared out the garage and turned those into gyms and maybe school rooms in some cases. That gave a huge bump to self-storage demand. Then that was got another dose of demand as the residential real estate market heated up. As that market falls down, we may see some diminution in demand. Whenever you have people making transitions in their lives, whether that that's moving, sending kids to school, bringing kids back into the household, what you see is that you they're using self-storage as part of that. All right, you gave me a whole new reason to rewatch storage wars. National Association of Reats Economists. John Worth, John, appreciate the time here today. Thanks. Coming up everyone, Black Friday deal season. It's kicking off. Wait a minute, it's October 10th, early a target.

2901," the It is time for Cut for Time. Three stories, one minute each. We start with this. Another controversy for Ye, the rapper formerly known as Kanye West, faced social media restrictions over the weekend after users accused the rapper of posting anti-semitic content leading to a block on both his Instagram and Twitter accounts. The reaction from this was interesting, that was reaction from Elon Musk and Elon of course has been noted to say that he is going to do more post acquisition to try and let everybody back on the platform. Raises a larger question of what Twitter will actually be if you still just have this cesspool of some of the harmful or derogatory statements that are coming back onto the platform from either Ye or even former president Donald Trump. Yeah, and I have a lot of questions about the companies that have just had to partner with Ye in various business ways. I mean, we saw it having with Gap and the fallout from that. You see now Adidas is assessing its relationship with him. And I think, you know, when they're trying to tap into his creativity, his place in the zeitgeist, right? At the same time, they have to be cognizant of some of the potential disadvantages of partnering with somebody who can be very volatile. Good point. Black Friday is coming early for target shoppers. Retailer announced it's adding an additional three weeks to its Black Friday deals, extending the discount offerings of up to 50% off to seven weeks total. This is, I think, target just being target. Also, I should mention we got some Adobe sales data out today predicting the holiday season sales rise to and a half percent. You're not great. But this will be one of the most aggressive discounting seasons yet. Holiday seasons, according to Adobe. So there's lots of big deals out there. Lot of retailers, even target Walmart, sitting on a lot inventory. They have to move this stuff. They're going to start moving it early. I mean, if you go to that target website today, Black Friday is like plastered across the deals page. It's pretty interesting. Move over Lululemon's we made too much. And here is we've got way too much over a target. And that's going to be the story for a lot of retailers over the course of this holiday season. How do they turn through inventory at a massively accelerated clip in order to get back into a decent position come the start of 2023 as well? And for the consumer, how are they spending? Is it cash that they're willing to spend right now? Or is it, hey, let's just put it on the credit card. Let's figure that out later. It's going to be great. Target gets half of my paycheck. That place is just so addicted. You go in there and you just look to spend 20 bucks and you're down 150. You don't even know what you got. Tarje. Crazy. What? All right. And I anticipate it's side effect of Apple's new crash detection features come to light. The Wall Street Journal reporting several incidents of iPhone 14 users triggering 911 calls while riding roller coasters. So what's the deal here? Is that the iPhone automatically calls 911 with like an automated message if it thinks you've gotten into a car crash? Well, I guess being on a roller coaster feels like that you've gotten into a car crash. So they keep calling 911 and police keep showing up to various amusement parks around the country. Yeah. I mean, Swift responses that we're actually seeing triggered from the devices. So we know it works. It's just a question of, okay, how do you rein that in a little bit more? Because this is some of the technology that's featured not just in Apple's new iOS for their iPhones, but also within the watch itself. So if you have enough people that have those companion devices, you're going to see a lot of those errant, triggered calls to 911. Well, it says this out real time. No, shake it, shake it. No, I don't have an auto. I don't have a new iPhone. And no, no, I don't. Well, if you like fall down, I don't know how sensitive. Police are showing up to your house. Yeah. And how is the sensor different in this case versus when you're, say, running on a treadmill or doing some other activity? All good questions. All right.

We're going to be discussing fighting the Fed with all springs, George Borey. Treasury Secretary Jenna Yellen warns about the economic impact from OPEC's latest production cut. We're tracking the fallout as Washington waves a response. Frank MacCurello with the American Petroleum Institute is going to be joining us this hour with his take on the oil cartels decision.

Named Vidya, Intel, Texas Instruments, Qualcomm, AMD, you get the picture, all of them down today on the back of that extended reaction. Of course, we sell the Chinese shipmakers down in a big way overnight in Asia trading as well. Well, there is a very busy week ahead of us for the markets. This is earning seasoned approaches and more key economic data rolls in. And we've got our very own Yahoo finances and Ned's for a kick things off for us this hour and Ned's. We're talking about earnings, economic data, certainly a lot to process in the week ahead. Yeah, that's right. A lot of data that will be watching that the markets are going to be watching. PPI, the producer price index will be coming out this week. Now this is the change in price which producers receive for their services and goods. So that's expected to come in at 7.3%. The prior reading was 7.3. But the CPI, the consumer price index, that's the really big one on Thursday which will be coming out. And that is expected to, on a year over year, expectation is that's for 8.1%. The core CPI, that's excluding food and energy, that's expected to come in at 6.5%. Now, the big thing here with this, with PPI, with CPI is that the numbers, although they may be well for the core CPI, it's actually that would be up from the previous one. But as far as the expectations, the numbers may not be coming down fast enough. And so if they're not coming down fast enough, then the Fed certainly has room to keep hiking. Also this week, you've got the FBOMC minutes that are coming out. And that will be interesting because the Kiko, we will be able to also see, if there's any discussion in those minutes about the size of the rate increases, if at any point the Fed is considering to sort of put a little bit of a break on those rate increases. Yeah, and the income is at a time, and obviously there's a debate about weather. In fact, the Fed needs to pause a bit because they've been moving so quickly, is it going to be 50 basis points? Is it going to be 75 come November? And of course, the administration's watching it closely. One more FBOMC meeting before the midterm. So a lot today, just there on that front. And as thanks so much for that. Well, U.S. Treasury Secretary Jenner Yellen is warning about the impact OPEC's oil production cut will have on the global economy, telling the financial times the decision is in her words unhelpful and unwise. This, of course, reinforcing the Biden administration's criticism over this move as questions arise on the repercussions that lie ahead. Let's bring in Frank McEarrula. He is API senior vice president of policy, economics, and regulatory affairs. Frank, it's good to talk to you today. We have heard several officials from the administration push back against OPEC's decision from last week. The White House saying it was short-sighted, saying that they will, in fact, respond moving forward. What is that decision meant for U.S. oil producers? Sure. Thanks for having me on. Look, you know, first off, it's a reminder, again, of how important it is to produce energy here in the United States and not have to rely on foreign countries like the OPEC plus nations for our energy. We have the capacity to continue to strengthen our energy security by tapping into the resources we have right here at home. And the more we do that, the less we're reliant and driven by decisions that are made somewhere else. And we did hear your president and CEO Mike Summers put out a statement on the back of that OPEC decision last week saying specifically, we urge the administration to adopt sound public policy that enables American energy to benefit Americans. What specifically does that sound policy look like? Sure. At API, we released a plan called the 10-22 that would open up federal lands and waters for oil and gas production. The Biden administration at the outset of their term closed new leasing for oil and gas development. So we would propose to open it up and continue to produce more here in the United States. The plan also calls for more energy infrastructure. Biden administration canceled critical.",https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yvHvxXHIc5I,17,2022-10-10 15:07:25
2904," those to open it up and continue to produce more here in the United States. The plan also calls for more energy infrastructure. The Biden administration canceled critical pipeline projects. We think the process for permitting of pipeline projects needs to be reformed so we can get energy from where it's produced to where it's needed. We also call on the plan to lift the barriers that are created by tariffs. We know that there is a supply chain issue currently in being able to produce more energy. And so we need to knock those barriers down. Finally, we think it's important to expedite LNG exports. The administration has made a commitment to Europe to export natural gas to provide relief from their reliance on Putin's natural gas. And so we think we need a strong policy that expedites LNG exports. And how quickly would you be able to move on that specifically on LNG? Well we're urging Congress and the administration to act quickly on all components of this plan. I think on LNG, it's really a question of a commitment from the government to expedite applications, a commitment from Europe to build down the necessary infrastructure to take the natural gas into its countries. But there is a commitment there on both sides. And so what we need is an acceleration of that. The oil and gas industry stands ready to help. There is another legislation that's been floating around for some time. And this is no pack specifically stands for no oil producing and exporting cartels act. This would essentially empower the Justice Department to go after OPEC under anti-trust rules if they are seen as setting or at least trying to attempt to control the price of oil. The Biden administration, at least in their statement, seems to suggest they want to revisit that. But I know API has specifically been very opposed to this idea. Why? This policy has been opposed on both sides of the aisle and from administrations in both parties. The real way to get OPEC is to produce more energy here in the United States. And the way to do that is to lift the pause that the administration has had on leasing. Look, at this point in the Obama administration, they had issued 60 leases for oil and gas development. This point in the Biden administration, they're just at six. And so if the administration wants to get serious about energy security and energy independence, it needs to look right here at home. And it needs to provide a pathway for more energy production here in the United States. But finally, Frank, you sort of alluded to the need for more exports coming out of the U.S. at a time when there are concerns about supply globally. You have put out a letter here saying that any kind of export ban we're talking about diesel, but also refined products would deplete inventory levels and it would put upward pressure on consumer fuel prices. Of course, the administration argument would be, we'll add a time when there was concerns about supply crunch, that supply should be left domestically. So walk me through your calculation. Why does this deplete supply in your opinion? And why would that push prices higher? Sure, it's not our opinion in July of this year, the American Council for Capital Formation studied this issue. They found that an export ban on refined product would end up cutting refinery capacity by 1.3 million barrels per day here in the United States. It would end up raising costs for fuel for consumers across the United States. It would cost jobs, about 85,000 jobs would be lost under such a policy. And finally, it would harm American GDP. And so for all of those reasons and for American energy security, the refined export product ban is a bad idea. Finally, this administration has made a commitment to our allies overseas, to other countries that we support, to Latin America, where we export an enormous amount of refined product. It's made a commitment to those allies that we're going to continue to provide the energy that we have right here in the United States. I see no reason why the administration should turn its back on that commitment. And it would certainly imposing such a policy would certainly...",https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yvHvxXHIc5I,18,2022-10-10 15:11:44
2905," here in the United States. I see no reason why the administration should turn its back on that commitment. And it would certainly, imposing such a policy would certainly not help the American consumer. And where are those conversations stand right now with the administration? I know there's been a bit of a back and forth. Oftentimes it has been reported as being a little more contentious. In terms of specifically an export ban, what's your understanding of where the administration stands? Well, we've made the case. We've laid out the data that shows that such a policy would have negative implications for the American people, for the driving public. I think the administration understands that. I think they understand that these are global products that require global markets. I think they also understand that the United States has world-class leading refineries. And they produce the fuels that the world needs. And so we're hopeful that the administration steps back from considerations of export ban, whether it's crude oil, refined product, or LNG. Frankly, looks toward American energy production as the solution. We've set all along the solution to the challenges that we face, actually lie under our feet. Because of innovation and technology, we've increased production here in the United States. From seven million barrels to 12 million barrels per day, we can do more. We need the policies in place to help us achieve that.

2906," I I am I am I am I'm We are on the cusp of yet another earning season and markets are turning to JP Morgan, City Wells Fargo and Morgan Stanley as they report during the most uncertain of economic environments for preview of what to expect. Let's bring in Yahoo finances, Alexandra Seminova. These are always, it's always a good bell leather, right? About where things are in terms of the economy, as we said, never been more uncertain. Yeah, absolutely a key go. Those four bangs among the six largest in the US by assets are set to be the opening act of the earnings season with Goldman Sachs and Bank of America set to release results next week. And some of the themes that we'll be watching closely are a slowdown in investment banking revenues, potential layoffs across their businesses, how demand for loans is holding up with higher interest rates, and any potential warnings about the economy that CEOs may deliver on earnings calls. And this quarter profits are expected to shrink, especially compared to a really robust 2021 for Wall Street. Profits are also likely to take a hit from higher loan loss provisions. Those are funds that aside by banks for any potential sour loans if customers don't make their payments. The six largest US banks are estimated to set aside a collective $4.5 billion this quarter that's according to financial times report today. And this is also a turnaround from a year ago when banks actually benefited from releasing those reserves as we were recovering from the pandemic. One notable thing to note too is that banks typically benefit from higher interest rate environments. Those often give them a nice boost on their net interest income. But investment banking revenue is likely to offset that. And some other things to look out for too are any comments that bank executives make. Jamie Diamond is always an interesting one on his earnings calls with his storm cloud warnings. Credit, Swiss, and the broad, what that means for the broader industry. And also a bank of American Morgan Stanley are estimated to lose a combined $500 million on Elon Musk's Twitter deal. You know, with noting the bar pretty low, going into earnings season, not just within banks, but overall. Thanks so much for that. I know you're going to be tracking those results really closely moving on here as we look ahead to. There you go. There's the prompt. Let's take a wider look on market. TD Ameritrade out with its investor movement index showing traders took a more risk off approach in September for more about what these results mean and what's driving the trends. Let's bring in Sean Cruz. TD Ameritrade head trading strategist Sean. These notes are always really interesting to me. A very good gauge of where the retail investor stands feels like it's pretty much tracking with the rest of the market. Things just aren't feeling very good. Yeah, I think right now, we got a little bit of a head fake back in August. There was actually recovery for the first time this year. We actually had that investor movement index tick higher. And I think that quickly got wiped off the table in September. So what we did see in what clients were buying, they were certainly being a little bit more conservative and that they weren't going out there buying some of the more speculative areas of the market, some of the more speculative names that maybe aren't profitable right now or just have some very high multiples. They're not really reaching for those right now. They're going back to some of the more familiar established names out there. In some cases, really looking at names with quality fundamentals be that solid revenues, solid cash flow, healthy balance sheets leverage was another thing that they certainly have been a little bit wary of as we're starting to see rates tick higher and higher that is going to impact.",https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yvHvxXHIc5I,20,2022-10-10 15:20:36
2907," Solid cash flow, healthy balance sheets, leverage was another thing that they certainly have been a little bit wary of as we're starting to see rates tick higher and higher that is going to impact some of those more highly leveraged companies versus the more fundamentally sound companies. So, they still found some opportunities out there, but they certainly are a little bit cautious right now and I think that makes sense. And we're going to get to some of those names we just showed on the screen there, but broadly speaking, what has led to the sell-off that you have seen exiting of positions? Is it really just about the Fed? I think that really was what drove that optimism in August and that light at the end of the tunnel from the Fed pausing or potentially even reversing some of those rate hikes gave it, drove a lot of optimism, but like I said, that light at the end of the tunnel ended up being a train coming your way instead. And that really drove that shift in sentiment in that not only were we getting some data that did indicate they haven't made significant progress, they are starting to have an effect, look at housing for instance, but the Fed kept coming out. Whenever the market would give a little bit of a pop of optimism, you would almost have a Fed speaker somewhere and somewhere come out and say, look, we're not stopping. This is something we are committed to. I think they're coming around to that notion and that's why we're trading down at these levels. I think the market's going to respond differently to maybe a hawkish Fed when we're trading at 3600 on the S&P 500 versus say trading up at 4,000 or 4,200. So I do think a lot of that is now priced in if things get significantly worse and that's why we just spoke about the bank earnings, that is going to be huge. The macro read through on what we hear from the banks, I think is really going to set the tone for the rest of earnings seasons and I think the market is also going to change their macro outlook based on what we hear. So let's talk about some of those names that we have seen big moves in. In terms of net buyers, we're seeing a lot of the chip makers, you could argue that's part of evaluation play, given just how far some of these names have pulled back. But in terms of those that are being sold, Exxon mobile and BP, an interesting one to me, because energy has been pretty strong is this sort of the expectation that we have reached the peak with some of these names and the pull back is coming. That is where we see that type of activity. I don't think anyone expects crude oil to completely fall apart anytime soon, but I do think they're looking at it from a little bit more of a valuation standpoint. And we have seen that where you get these energy companies trading towards the bottom of their range. That's where there's a lot of interest in buying when they recover and they start hitting towards the upper end of those ranges. That's where they rotate out of those. So I think it's an interesting strategy. It's more of a short term strategy. I think we see playing out, but they use those profits when they do decide to roll out and lower exposure in those names. We actually do see them going out there and trying to find opportunity elsewhere. And the semiconductors last month was that key spot. I think we saw a lot of interest on the buy side. Certainly today I think caught a lot of people off guard. If you look at the semiconductors that are really getting hit, it's the semiconductor companies that really have a lot of exposure to that relationship with China and just what goes on the entrepreneur offshore aspect of their supply chains. But I think what they were looking at, if you look at the charts, AMD, NVIDIA, Intel, all those names were hitting the support levels. And when you see the support levels, these ranges, they start to approach the lower end. That's where you get a lot of buying activity. I'm going to venture, guess what we look at this again next month. We're going to see a lot of selling as they broke through some of those. I was going to say, I wonder if some of that buying holds, especially as we get these warnings about demand, especially from a lot of these big chip makers. He has them see another one, or started to hear from this week. Sean Cruz, a TD Ameritrade, head trading strategist. Thanks so much for joining us today. Well coming up bullish call, Bernstein says Airbnb is on track to become the biggest Western travel platform. But what about recession fears? COVID and some competitors. We'll chat that next.",https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yvHvxXHIc5I,21,2022-10-10 15:24:51
2908,"... A.B. Bernstein is getting bullish on Airbnb. Initiating coverage and outperform what a $143 price target, saying it's rapid and profitable growth removes a key hurdle. It's valuation. Joining us now is Richard Clark, managing director at A.B. Bernstein. Richard, there's a number of things that you highlight here, but really the point being that this isn't just about Airbnb being able to protect its market share and the vacation rental business. Do you think they could really make a significant play on hotels and experiences as well? Walk me through that thesis. Yeah, I mean, I think that's absolutely right. So, I think the vacation rental market is still very exciting. I think it's a big market. It's going to gain share of the overall lodging market and Airbnb will think we'll gain share within that. But probably beyond that, even more exciting, is that ability to sell more than just vacation rental market. It doesn't market as much as other travel platforms, so it has a loyal customer following, as a very strong brand. And we think they can sell longer stays, hotel rooms, experiences, and they can add to its growth. The longer stays have been a real growth spot for Airbnb, something they've been highlighting, especially over the course of the pandemic. The hotels specifically, where do you see them making a play when you look at how fragmented the market is right now? Yeah, so I mean, I think actually the hotel market is fragmented. The distribution market is not that fragmented, you've got booking and expedior, they're quite dominant in their respective geography. So, I think the actual hotels are looking for other distribution channels to broaden their landscape a little bit. And I think Airbnb is unique in the sense that it does try and inspire the customer. You know, it's got this category-based search. It tries to find a way to match the customer and the product up in the way that we don't see in other companies. And I think that gives it a way to make a play in hotels. So you see the platform evolving into a place where hotels can also list their openings? Well, they're already on. I mean, there are already tens of thousands of hotels listed on Airbnb.",https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yvHvxXHIc5I,22,2022-10-10 15:29:19
2909," and also list their openings? Well, they're already on, I mean, there are already tens of thousands of hotels listed on on on Airbnb, Airbnb, bought hotels tonight. They signed a deal with side-minder. They signed a deal with OVO and that gave them probably somewhere around 70 to 80,000 hotels. But that's only just scratching the surface. There's probably 10 times that many hotels in the world. And I think through COVID, they focus on the core business. And hotels is one thing that they can try and reignite post the other side of COVID. And yet put it alongside the vacation rentals on its platform. Richard, we've been talking so much about a lot of these companies within the sharing economy, whether that's in Uber, food delivery, Airbnb, among them. You know, they all started after the financial, after the great recession. And it was sort of in earlier days used as a platform for a lot of people to make some extra cash on the side. Yeah. You know, how much of a catalyst do you think if we are looking at a further downturn in the macro picture? I mean, could that be a potential catalyst for Airbnb to bring in more hosts and really expand the platform in a way? Yeah, I think that's right. I mean, I think first of all, there's quite a lot of dormant hosts on Airbnb, like there's a lot of listings that haven't taken a booking in the last year. Maybe that's because of COVID, nervousness around that. So maybe part of it is bringing existing hosts back onto the platform. And then, yeah, I think beyond that, they're probably are other people that will need to supplement their income. They'll need to offset the fact that maybe they paid higher mortgage costs or higher rental costs. And that may bring entirely new supply to the market. Okay, Avery Bernstein, Managing Director Richard Clark, appreciate your time today. Thank you. Well, coming up, prepare for landing. The Fed attempting a controlled descent in stormy weather. This week, we'll get more clarity on the direction of travel through fresh inflation data. We've had bonds on the other side.",https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yvHvxXHIc5I,23,2022-10-10 15:34:59
2910," We'll start with the unionization movement kicking into high gear with talks, ramping up more than 200 stores nationwide have joined the movement. There's pressure on the coffee giant to engage. We're going to start scrolling from both workers, shareholders and regulators. Let's bring in Yahoo finances, Alexis Keenan. With a broad state of play right now and in many ways Friday was a big step. It was. It was. It was. It was. We're resolving. We are. Yeah, so let's talk about what happened. But first let's kind of look at the state of affairs for Starbucks and this unionization push by its baristas across its retail stores in the US. You have among its 900 or 9,000 rather corporate owned US stores. About 220 of them have unionized so far. Also the number of union votes that have been held as of Thursday, 309 ballot counts, 248 of those ending in yes votes to unionize. 54 of those saying no and seven under a challenge right now. But Friday was significant and there's two reasons for that. One is that it was the first time that workers in Arkansas have chosen to go ahead and petition to unionize and that brings the number of states that actually have unionized stores to 38 among the 50 states. And it also Friday was the first time that the NLRB, the National Labor Relations Board ruled that Starbucks illegally fired one of its workers and that was for taking part in unionization activity. So that's kind of a big deal right for the labor board to say for the first time among a lot of complaints that have been filed. There are 35 filed so far that yes Starbucks was in the wrong here. And as a consequence what Starbucks is going to have to do is going to reinstate that employees job, give that employee back pay, but also have a meeting with the Starbucks workers there and this is Ann Arbor Michigan by the way. The Starbucks workers, its management as well as government has to take part in the talks where it's going to have to read a notice about what exactly was illegal about its actions. So it's going to have to have this sort of mea culpa and get everybody together and say these are your rights. Now as for Starbucks part, we reached out to Starbucks, we haven't heard back yet but the company has told Bloomberg that these claims that were in this complaint for this Ann Arbor worker, they call them categorically false. So just a lot of changes here for Starbucks and the company is continuing to fight these challenges, these efforts by their workers across the country to unionize. So just a bit of pressure here, particularly on Friday, so kind of a big turn with this NLRB decision coming down. And you talk about the various pressure points that are sort of mounting against Starbucks. Another one coming from the New York City controller, what do we know about that? Right. So I will have to get back to you with more information on that. I haven't been focusing on that as much a key go, but certainly the New York has wanted a Starbucks to go ahead and follow the rules that the National Labor Relations Board lays out for these push, these petitions by workers to follow what is required under law for these elections to take place. Okay. Staying on top of it for us, Alexis Keenan, thanks so much for that. One of the Fed's biggest critics of late is that it again, speaking on CBS yesterday, Alianz's chief economic advisor, Muhammad Al Ariin, said he fears, quote, a very high probability of damaging a recession that was totally avoidable. He'll track higher in the aftermath of Friday's jobs, report him into indication the Fed will need to continue its hiking round. The next guest says a hard landing is likely. Let's get into the discussion with George O'Bouray. He's all spring global investments, chief investment strategies for fixed income and Georgia doesn't sound promising. Hi, Keigo. Thanks for having me on the show. It's a rough backdrop. It's a rough economic backdrop. And one of the challenges that the Fed faces is that at this juncture in the cycle, good news is effectively bad. And that's simply because the Fed is trying to fight inflation. We know that. They've been at it now for quite some time throughout this year. They still feel behind the curve. We're going to see the data. We're going to see a new set of inflation data on.",https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yvHvxXHIc5I,24,2022-10-10 15:37:51
2911," that they've been at it now for quite some time throughout this year, they still feel behind the curve. You know, we're going to see the data. We're going to see a new set of inflation data on Thursday with the CPI report. Expectations are, you know, headline CPI should come down a little, but core inflation is likely to keep rising. And it's really, when you take that inflation data, plus the strong, relatively strong employment data from Friday, it would suggest that the economy in the US is still, it's still expanding and it's still chugging along at a pretty good pace. And the Fed has told us very clearly that they want to slow that down. So from other commentators from us as well, the expectation is the Fed's going to get what they want. They need to slow growth. They will slow growth. And if you look into the first half of next year, the sort of lag defect of all these rate hikes should start to bite. And so the probability of a recession, it's going up. And we think it's actually going up fairly quickly. And that's likely to really start to unfold as we get into the beginning part of next year. So how does that set things up going into the next FOMC meeting? And there's certainly a debate on this sidelines that's happening about whether in fact the Fed should maybe pause a bit here to really allow for those rate hikes that have already been implemented to take root. Are we getting any indications of that potential pause, especially when you say the risk of a recession is growing? Well the Fed has kind of painted themselves into a box. They've said that they're going to respond to the data and they've sort of taken a much more of a near term approach. They need to see current data demonstrate that inflation is coming down on a sustained basis. That takes sort of multiple months. It's going to take time. It's also going to require a broadening out of the data. So the Fed doesn't have a lot of wiggle room in here from our perspective. They need to continue to tighten and tighten policy. The question is, is simply how fast a pivot at this point, at best case scenario from a pivot standpoint, is they're able to decelerate the pace of rate hikes. Now if, if, say Wednesday's data, surprisingly comes in below expectations on both the headline and a core basis, that might provide the window of hope or open the window, if you will, for a bit of hope that a pivot of sorts might be coming. But it's still premature in our opinion. You haven't seen that sort of clear evidence to give the Fed kind of cover to really start to pivot. Now the one thing that is not really discussed all that much is just market volatility. Volatility in the bond market is very high right now. And it's likely to stay high as long as these expectations for tighter policy continue. With high volatility, some comes sort of a lot of movement in prices by definition, but liquidity also tends to dry up. If the market kind of ceases to function, well then the Fed will have to do something. But we're not at that point yet. The market's functioning, it's functioning at a slow pace, but it is still functioning. George really quickly here, it is a holiday today, but when you look at where the 10-year yield has tracked, we're off of that level just being under four, but we're still up 3-8-8, based on Friday's close. Where do you expect it to track, at least in the near term? Sure, that's a good point. There's a big distinction between the front end of the curve and the longer end of the curve. We've repriced up, if you will, we're up about 25 basis points or so on the 10-year. As you mentioned, up around 3-88, 4% is sort of our number that we expect the 10-year to consolidate around that number. We would say plus or minus 25 basis points on each side of 4%. Is really our central case as we go into the end of the year. The front end, the Fed has also been pretty clear. They want to get the front end up to about 4.5% by year end. So a 50 basis point spread, say, between the two-year and the 10-year with the two-year above the 10-year, that would be pretty consistent with tight monetary policy, restrictive monetary policy, and that should help slow growth as we go into next year.

Thank you very much. Well, coming up, we're going to be discussing a different type of EV, probably supermanium, getting electric at the NADDA, across. Yeah, I keep going. We're here at the NADDA, a different type of EV, a solar powered one, the Sion by Sona Motors. We'll talk to the CEO after this. Well, German carmaker Sona Motors is on a mission to make mobility and growing megacities more sustainable. For more on that, the CEO of the EV startup, standing by with their very own proud supermanium, live from the NADDA. Well, German carmaker Sona Motors is on a mission to make mobility and growing megacities more sustainable for more on that, the CEO of the EV startup, standing by with our very own proud supermanium, live from the NADDA, across. That's right, if you can hear it, the NADDA, Sona Motors actually listed on the NADDA, their German company listed here. They have their Sion solar powered EV here, it's right behind us. And joining me now is CEO Lauren Han. So Lauren, talk to us about the Sion, you're hearing the states. What's going on exactly? Sure. Hi, everyone. Nice to be here. This is the first solar electric vehicle being affordable. We brought it the first time to the US, first hand, first day here. Incredible car, $25,000, family, apparently affordable solar cells in the whole car body, it's re-churching itself, and it's really meant to be that mass-market electric vehicle. So you know what I mentioned this to people before they talked to me about a solar powered car, that's not totally true, you still got to plug it into getting more power. You've got... What kind of solar power, what kind of range are we going to get capture from the sun for those GPS? Giving you an example, beautiful day here in the US, in New York. We have 12 miles per day being commuted in the city.",https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yvHvxXHIc5I,26,2022-10-10 15:48:02
2913," fun for those PPS. Giving you an example, beautiful day here in the US and New York. We have 12 miles per day being commuted in the city on average. This car is re-charging at 13 miles a day. It's 17 miles a week on average. That's amazing because that means no re-charging for most of the commuters. And that's the big assul about electric vehicles, right? Re-charging, we can park, we'll find a charging station, range anxiety, all that stuff. That's what people are worried about. And this car is sold, solving that issue. So we know, you know, this car has a total range of around 200 miles per charge. Right. But what you're saying is that given how people use the car normally, you can basically use, basically capture as much solar power as you need to use the car on a regular basis. Let's say your car needs to run by miles each way. Right. So you're saying it's for most people, it makes sense for solar. Exactly. Commuters. We're using the car to get from A to B to work, right? And they're not driving like 200, 300 miles to work. No, they're driving on average 12 miles as a set. And this car is re-searching itself. That's the biggest hurdle about electric vehicles, and we are solving it. So where are you guys going to launch in here in Germany? What's the rollout for this car, exactly? So the first launch is in Europe. We have 42,000 down payments and pre-hers in total from B2B and B2C. And we're right now, you know, bringing out the plan for the US. We have a great plan for the US. There's huge potential here. We see huge potential for suburban markets here. Family-friendly vehicles affordable $25,000. So take a kind of a step back with this car. $25,000, very affordable. Use a solar power element. Why did you guys decide that was the way to go for EVs? Not just the grid, but capturing from the solar power. We get every day. Well, because I, you know, myself asked myself, what's a great product? And I'm living in the furt floor and don't have an own house. I don't have a own garage. And I asked myself, where do I charge? Where do I charge my electric vehicle, right? And I came always through the conclusion, it's not working. I need something more than that. And that's why we integrate it solar, because we believe it's convenience. It's extending your range. It's highly affordable, because you don't have to pay for high electricity. Electricity builds there, right? And is there more incentives in places like Europe or something, or is it sort of across the board? Are you guys getting any kind of incentive? Well, there are incentives for electric vehicles, I think across the world. In every own country, you get certain incentives. There are countries starting to incentive by a solar electric vehicle. You take a Holland, in Holland, there is an incentive for solar electric vehicles. So on top of the electric vehicle centers, in centers, you get a solar electric vehicle center. So you see the whole industry is changing to solar electric vehicles. As we believe, the next big thing in the electric mobility. So what are we talking about in terms of free orders here for the car globally? And also you got some deals in the works with car sharing, right? Yes. Yes. As mentioned, 42,000 downpapers and free orders. It's 22,000 B2s BE and 20,000 B2C reservations. The B2C reservations being downpainted with amazing 2,000 euros and average. So sticky, real reservations. People putting down 2,000 euros for this car on the waiting list. Amazing. And with that, we have the full auto book already for Europe. Right now going on tour here. New York, Boston, Detroit, San Francisco, NLA. And we'll test the demand there. We already get great feedback. You also have this new fit, which I believe is a rental car company. Yes. How does that work? It's a subscription car company. They ordered just 12,600 cars. And it's an amazing order. We have so much more potential than the B2B sector. This is the perfect car for being an Uber driver, for being delivery service, for being a subscription car model. We believe there's so much more potential out there. So real quick.",https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yvHvxXHIc5I,27,2022-10-10 15:50:58
2914," In Uber driver for being delivery service, for being subscription car models, we believe there's so much more potential out there. So real quick, we talked about this, the deal with Finn. You guys using Valnet to actually snake the cars because he has cars with a third party manufacturer. How soon are we going to see these cars in the road? Our plan is to launch this car and produce this car in the second half of next year. We have a great partnership with Valnet there being very experienced over 50 years of building cars. They currently producing the Diammer GLC and GLA. So they know how to produce cars and we believe we will not have production hell as you call it. Because we have outsourced the production to someone who actually knows how to produce a electric vehicle. So second half of next year potentially in Europe and then maybe in the US we'll see the tourist happening right now across the United States. Exactly. Lauren Hunt, thanks so much for the motors. Back over to you, Kiko. I know there's a bit of a delay between us but really quickly I'm seeing people check out the car behind you. When Lauren will let you take a ride. Yeah, why don't we get a ride in this car Lauren? I'll soon. Oh yeah, you can actually tomorrow. Tomorrow. So today here's a little difficult but tomorrow we will have some test rides. So sign up on our website and you can come and grab a ride with this vehicle. All right, thanks Kiko for looking at that. Oh yeah, to deal with that. I know you've driven many of these EVs. I'm going to be curious to get your review on that. Across, thanks so much for that. A live for us from the NASDAQ Market signer thanks to Lauren as well. And for one EV maker to another Tesla's China Mates sales match their monthly record. That's at least according to the China passenger car association. For the month of September the company saw an 8% increase from August and set a record for Tesla's Shanghai Factory since production began. Back in December 2019. The plans of course was shut down in July for an upgrade although will only perform at 93% capacity through the end of the year according to Reuters. Meanwhile Elon Musk weighing in on China Taiwan relations suggesting Taiwan give China control over the island to resolve the cross-rate dispute. Taiwan officials have dismissed the comment as quote ill informs and belittling while the idea has unsurprisingly gained prey. Tesla shares currently up just slightly there about 1%. While coming up islands in the stream, maybe not for much longer as reports will at showtime could become integrated into Paramount Plus. What about the future of media on the other side?",https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yvHvxXHIc5I,28,2022-10-10 15:55:38
2915," weg Well, the streaming war has made claim another victim as reports a paramount is considering merging its showtime offering and to paramount plus the move comes as competition for eyeballs continues to mount what's bringing Yahoo finances to Ali Canal. The very latest one that alley. Hi, Kiko. That's right. And those reports have only been fueled by the latest executive departure at the company, David Nevin, who has run showtime since 2016 will be exiting his role at the end of the year. And that's shake up suggests that paramount is open to revamping showtime. Obviously has created some top series like you're seeing on your screen billions, yellow jackets, dexter among others. And the company can really leverage that programming to boost paramount plus subscribers. Currently paramount plus has 43.3 million subs with the expectation to reach 100 million by 2023. The exact number of showtime users is unknown, but across all of its properties paramount has about 64 million subscribers. So clearly paramount plus is the driving force on the streaming side paramount CEO Bob Backage confirmed last month that these talks were happening as a company looks toward the future. Court cutting obviously accelerating showtime lost about 500,000 subscribers in Q1 according to the CEO. So this is something that we've seen really across the sector as these platforms look to scale, look to compete. We have the combination of HBO Max and Discovery happening this summer. Stores is aiming to separate itself from Lionsgate to merge with other content providers. So consolidation is really just the name of the game at this point, especially as the streaming wars come to a head. But I have to shout out that next week we'll be discussing this and much more with paramount CEO Bob Backage during the young finance all markets summit. So make sure to tune into that. Kiko I'm very excited to talk to him because considering the news that we've been getting the past few weeks, there's a lot going on in this industry. Yeah, team things up for us. Ali for our big day, the all markets summit, of course set for Monday next week. Bob Backage among a long list of executives will be speaking to you throughout the day. Ali can now thanks so much for that. Let's do a final market check before we let you go. We are seeing all three majors still in the red right now. The NASDAQ coming off with the lows of the session, but we did see it hit two year lows there at least for intraday levels. The NASDAQ right now down about eight tenths of a percent. The S&P 500 down four tenths and the Dow trading pretty flat. The NASDAQ certainly in focus today in part because some of the sell-off that we've seen in those chip makers, this coming on the back of the latest export controls that were handed down by the Commerce Department on Friday, China, of course, responding to that. Certainly something we're going to continue to keep a close watch on. By the way, semiconductors have also been warning of some of the demand coming globally. So that's another thing that has been weighing on some of those names. As we said at the top of the show though, a lot to get through to this week with earnings on tap as well as economic data. We're going to continue to keep a close watch on all of that. That does it for me in this hour. We've got much more to come here. Yahoo Finance lies. Keep it right here.",https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yvHvxXHIc5I,29,2022-10-10 15:59:29
2916," POWELL Brands top earnings estimates for its most recent quarter. And so a big pop in beer sales as the Modelo and Corona maker. So net sales go 15% for the beer business. Joining us now discuss this constellation brand CEO Bill Nulens, Bill, great to see you as always. Let's lock in on depletions. That fell a little bit below arguably some high estimates on the street. Have you seen any slowdown in consumer demand? No consumer demand has been very strong, Brian. In fact, our buy rate, which is the amount of times that a consumer goes to the store by how much they buy when they're there, is actually up both for our beer business and our high-end wine and spirits business. So we're very optimistic. You know, we have the benefit in this industry, in this category of being somewhat recession-resistant. And we certainly have seen no slowdown at a consumer level of purchasing against our brands. Bill, you always give it to a straight. So you call my attention with something on the earnings call. You mentioned you're going corona non-alcoholic. When does this stuff come to market? And why are you going into the non-alcoholic segment? Who's drinking this? We'll be out with that next year. But one of the things we found, Brian, was that a number of consumers who drink non-alcoholic products also drink high-end beer and high-end spirits. And we felt that this could be a natural extension, because it gives people another option on a night or an event where they, frankly, just don't want to consume, but they want to enjoy a great tasting product like we can bring from corona. But walk us through what it's going to take to continue to improve some of the depletion for constellation brands. And particularly what timelines you're tracking against for that? As you saw, our volumetric on the beer side was up almost 9% this quarter. And we see no suggestion of slowdown whatsoever. You know, Madello had its 36th consecutive quarter of double digit growth and continues to be just on fire as we extend the demographic beyond its core Hispanic base to more general market consumers. So we see just tremendous opportunity for growth. When you then add in some of the new things, you know, we just tested in three test markets, Madello Oro, which is the goal standard of light beer. We're going to roll that nationally, the beginning of next calendar year. And that we think, again, provides a very good opportunity to bring new consumers into the fold. It was very incremental in the test markets. Belle, I'm going to take a little bit of a look.",https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yvHvxXHIc5I,30,2022-10-10 16:04:22
2917," next calendar year. And that we think, again, provides a very good opportunity to bring new consumers into the fold. It was very incremental in the test markets. Bill, I'm going to take a little bit of a left turn here and go to the cannabis issue because we did have some news on that yesterday, obviously, with President Biden issuing federal pardons for people who have been convicted of simple possession of marijuana. As you saw, pot stocks went crazy on this, on the perception that this is going to have bigger implications beyond just that. You guys own that stake in canopy growth. Can you talk me through the implications in your mind of whether this does pre-sage a bigger push towards legalization? I think Brad said something right a couple of segments ago and you talked about this before, which is it's a step on the right direction. I think it remains to be seen where it goes or how quickly it goes. The important part, I think, from our perspective is the canopy is well positioned if the legalization occurs in the United States. You know, they have deals in place with Wana and Jettie and Aikorj that will put them in a superb position when and if we see a broader legalization. But I think we've seen steps in this direction before. So, again, it's early days, but certainly it gives us some more reason for optimism. Bill, the spirits industry is just on fire, notably to Killa. When I look at your portfolio, I say, wow, they can really add something here. Are the prices for some of these brands out there? Are they just too high and that's what gives you pause? Well, we have two to kill as there were quite pleased with Casanobley at the in the luxury area and Mekapo, which frankly is just on fire at the in the sort of $20 price point. So we're quite pleased with that. But yes, certainly the values and the price points across to Killa at this point, if you were trying to acquire, have gotten quite heavy, shall we say. But our to Killa business is up double digit and we're quite pleased with where it's going. The other thing is we have a couple of messgals in our venture arm that are also doing very well. So we're keeping our eye on that subcategory as well. You said something on the something else in the earnings call bill that you're about to release a new sustainability report. What's been the feedback when you talked to institutional investors? How important is this topic and how are you thinking about that will play in just reinventing your business? It's more important to more investors every day and we've been very careful about how we think about that topic and we try to do it in ways that is beneficial for the communities in which we operate as well as for the overall environmental impact. A lot of focus on water. We've reduced our water use at our Navajo facility over the last three years by 18% per unit. We'd by 13% at our overgone operation. We've also invested within the communities that we served there to help the infrastructure and to make sure good quality water is available in those communities where we operate. So we strongly believe that this is good not only good for the world but good for business. And I think everyone we hope everyone will take a hard look at what we've done. We've worked very hard on this topic and we think and we think we're contributing to the world around us while we're still doing good business. Bill, to paraphrase Jerry McGuire and Beyonce, you had me at Miss Cowell and so as I think about some of the spirits that you've looked across the brand portfolio with and seen some strength in this environment where some businesses are looking to just show up extra cash, extra capital and perhaps some acquisitions become ripe. Are there certain companies that you're looking at and kicking the tires to see where there are more brands that you could add to constellation? We always look to see where there are opportunities and we identify the white space within our portfolio where we might be able to add some things. But we're also smart about it I think in terms of how we think about where we can get a good return. And again, as I alluded to a moment ago, the Ventur arm has been a very good way for us to put our toe in the water with some great new ideas. And we've done it in a couple of interesting ways. Our focus on female founders program as an example. We said just a few years ago that we were going to spend $100 million against women owned and women run businesses over the next 10 years. We're already 76% of the way there.",https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yvHvxXHIc5I,31,2022-10-10 16:08:21
2918," years ago that we were going to spend $100 million against women owned and women run businesses over the next 10 years. We're already 76% of the way there. So, you know, we're seeing a lot of ways that we can get our toe in the water on some new and exciting ideas early on, maybe before it hits big, but we're there and ready to go when it takes off. Bill, real quick before I let you go, box wine sales on fires at the ultimate recession signal. When I see that, I think back to my college days, I had no money, but there I was with my box wine pouring into soul cups and playing some beer pong or wine pong. Box box has been a very strong sector. In fact, in our in the wine business, our woodbridge box wine was the number two growing skew in that particular sector. So, we're pretty pleased about that. And it's going well for us. But it is. And it's also a convenience thing. You know, you see more and more consumers looking for convenience and box can go places that glass can't as an example. So, you often see that and tailgating or beaches and things of that nature. So, uh, so it it covers a lot of angles for sure. And PS box wine gets a bad wrap. I remember years ago, my sister brought back box wine from Sicily. It was fantastic. So, there you go, Bill. www.secret correspondents.com Let's continue our conversation on the Job Support and the the market implications joining us now. John Tobin, Epic Investment Partners, Managing Director and Senior Equity Research Analyst. John, it's good to see you. So as we look at this, good news is bad, news is gone in jobs day. I mean, that's just very simply how we should look at it here that the Fed is going to be raising rates for the foreseeable future. I think that's right. I think the market it seems, and certainly the past few days we've seen evidence of it, it's looking for some reason, something to latch onto to justify the rally. They're hoping for some evidence that the Fed's about to pivot, the Reserve Bank of Australia's move early in the week, ignited that hope, and even on the Fed, speakers all week long pushed back on that pretty hard. I think the evidence today is...",https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yvHvxXHIc5I,32,2022-10-10 16:13:01
2919," Bank of Australia has moved early in the week, ignited that hope, and even on the Fed, speakers all week long pushed back on that pretty hard. I think the evidence today is from the jobs report. The jobs market still remains strong, and the Fed still has work to do. Now, as we've talked about it in our shop this morning on our morning call, there is clearly evidence of deceleration here. So if you're trying to find some good news here, that the numbers are moving in the right direction. And this is a 263K increase in jobs, but it shows continual deceleration over time. Average hourly earnings are up, but again, evidence of deceleration. So I think the main takeaway is, things are moving in the right direction, but the Fed still has a lot of work to do. Rates are still going higher. So John, should the other takeaway here, just looking at the market action in the early going is for investors to fade any rallies? Well, I think that would be my personal view that with each attempt to rally into this, I've continued to make the case that I don't see what the foundation is for a strong rally, for a sustainable rally. I mean, if you think about what the drivers of equity market returns are, its earnings growth, its dividends, and its multiple expansion. And if rates are going higher, that's a headwind from multiple expansion. And if the economy is slowing down and maybe headed for a recession, that's a headwind for earnings growth. So the main underpinnings that would support a sustainable rally just aren't there. I think to me, this is a market environment where investors need to keep some defensive exposure in their asset allocation. We've had a conversation, especially around the shift in the types of jobs, the employment situation really lays out, kind of sector by sector here. But for some of those businesses that are looking at the amount of people that post pandemic, they've realized they actually need to run the business. It also becomes a question of where some of those employees will find employment elsewhere, and in different sectors as well, as many people have upskilled over the course of the pandemic. I mean, does that drastically shape everything from wages all the way to what a solid baseline sector by sector actually looks like? Well, you're absolutely right. There are some sector trends that we're noticing here, where there's strength, where there's weakness, there's strength in leisure and hospitality, there's weakness in other sectors, there's weakness in energy, there's weakness in things related to building and construction, of course. But it's disruptive for the economy as you point out that people are looking for jobs and looking to move perhaps into new areas where there is job growth. So there is that friction, but that's not really something new, and that's a necessarily a post pandemic phenomenon. I think that's historically bending case. There's always a friction as people move and try to direct themselves into the areas where there's greater employment opportunities. John, bottom line when it comes to these markets, I think people are trying to figure out what the heck to do right now. And you have some interesting stuff in your portfolio, including consumer staples, things like Home Depot and Walmart. Do you think that a company like Walmart, for example, has gotten past its inventory troubles and is still gonna be able to benefit as we head towards the holiday season? So, it's absolutely true. The retailers have inventory issues to grapple with. And I wouldn't wanna say that for Walmart, it's all said and done and then they're behind it. I think our view on Walmart is more of a basic fundamental view that this is a business that historically is resilient in economic downturns. And if we're looking at a solar economic environment and we're looking at the possibility of recession and we think about where are we most likely to have the stocks and the companies that are most likely to hold up best in that environment? It is some of the defensive sectors, the traditional defensive sectors like staples, the Walmart's healthcare, for example, utilities, another area where we have exposure, even at the same time, even some financials will hold up better regional banks. There'll probably be some evidence of weakening loan demand and some pick up in credit quality issues, but we think that they're in a very strong position with good credit statistics today and with very strong capital positions today. So there are several defensive sectors that we have exposure.",https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yvHvxXHIc5I,33,2022-10-10 16:17:08
2920," very strong position with good credit statistics today and with very strong capital positions today. So there are several defensive sectors that we have exposure to, that we think these are sectors. It won't mean that they won't feel any pressure from a slowing economy, but rather that they will be more resilient in the face of a challenging market environment. Just trying to tie both inflation and employment together because one of that is an input cost into the prices that consumers are having to pay as well. For consumers and of course everybody who's in this economy and is working, there's still money that is going out the door out of your pockets both on a necessity basis or on a discretionary basis. So with that in mind, where then are we going to expect to see kind of wages stabilized at the same time that the Fed is trying to see inflation stabilized? Well, Fed is clearly trying to get inflation down and trying to get a way to growth down. And what that really means, even though they don't like to say it so much out loud is they need the unemployment rate to go up and they need jobs growth to slow pretty dramatically. So, but you're right, this implies pressure on the consumers. So there'll be pressure on the consumer in terms of weaker jobs growth. There'll be more people unemployed. There's more pressure on consumer pocketbooks because of inflationary pressures what people are paying at the pump for gasoline with their energy bill when they get their kind bill every month. So there's pressure on the consumer. This is all part of the narrative of an economy that is being forced to slow down by Fed policy. John, if I'm correct, you have some exposures to some big cap tech names, an Apple, Microsoft, and IBM, even a Broadcom, but in light of this AMD warning, which is pretty shocking. I mean, I missed their expectations by a billion dollars on sales are even trying to rotate out of big cap tech or you're gonna just try to just survive this volatility. Well, you know, the truth is, in the strategy that I help run, tech is a significant underweight for us. We actually have a hard time finding tech names that fit the characteristics that we see. We're looking for companies that have growing cash, that will pay attractive growing dividends and otherwise use cash to distribute to shareholders through share buybacks. So we do have exposure to some of those tech names that you mentioned, but we are underweight. We're underweight those names that are kind of by definition underweight Apple. Apple's over 4% of the index. So while we have Apple in the portfolio, it's an underweight Apple. And while we have tech in the portfolio, it's an underweight to the tech sector. I'm sure there'd be some names that we look at and will probably trim them and maybe even exit them, but there's nothing that we're thinking about doing right this minute. Welcome back. Job growth beating estimates by 8,000 in September as high rates and elevated costs per major US economy. But how will a stronger than expected labor report guide the Fed, all of this percolating through the markets today? Labor Secretary Marty Walsh is joining us now from Washington DC. And the Secretary, great to see you as all.",https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yvHvxXHIc5I,34,2022-10-10 16:21:21
2921," The Fed, all of this, percolating through the markets today. Labor Secretary Marty Walsh is joining us now from Washington, D.C., Mr. Secretary, great to see you as always. And so this number showing growth today in places like labor and hospitality, I'm always curious what you're hearing in your conversations with corporate leaders around the country, where they're having still trouble. Because on the other hand, we're also seeing some industries cut back. Give us a little color as to what you're hearing. Yeah, it really depends on where we are. You know, I think one of the areas when you think about cybersecurity and the tech space, that's where a lot of companies are still growing, some have cut back. So we talk about how do we create programs so we can get people skilled out working with community colleges in particular, working with colleges in the country. And really thinking about what employers are talking about now is not about the job market of right now, but they're talking about participation and anticipated growth in their companies and making sure they have the skill to work for us to be able to keep up with that growth. Mr. Secretary, is it a little surprising that we're still seeing some strong job growth like this and upward revisions to prior months? At the same time, the Federal Reserve is really trying to slow the economy down. Well, when you see the areas that we saw growth in this month, and we saw the hospital industry and medical growth fully recovered from pre-pandemic, you know, you're seeing that a lot of people hiring in those hospitals because there's a lot of electric elective procedures that were put off so they're hiring more people in hospitals. We're seeing an increase in manufacturing, certainly more jobs than pre-pandemic and manufacturing. And I think a lot of that has to do with what happened during the pandemic with supply chain. We're seeing more and more companies want to create more and build more here in the United States. We're seeing the President really focusing on that as well, doing more in the United States. We're seeing in this particular month, we didn't see, we saw actually a decrease in governments hiring around education. That's one number that was low, but companies are still looking for people. You're still hearing it every day. I mean, as you mentioned earlier, I think you might have been Julie saying, some people do eye-cutting back on their employees because they're anticipating what the future might bring, but a lot of companies are still hiring. And so with a cutback on employees yet hiring, also kind of decreasing or decelerating, if you will, what does that spell out for the people who, during the great resignation, had kind of put in that two-week notice and said, I've got another offer somewhere else. I've got a greater offer on the table. Is this still a job hopper's market, or from your perspective, is it something where that is decelerating so much to the point where it's very much shifting and employees should be considering exactly where they make those moves? I still think it's a good market for employees to look at for better opportunities, but I think what's happening is employers are realizing now they have to do a little more to keep their employees. Employers don't want to hire somebody and then have to six months lose them to another place for higher salary or better benefits. So I think employers are starting to, when I go around talking to companies, they're really looking to hybrid work, how does that work? They're looking at opportunities, childcare, and other things to encourage people to come into their companies. And I think companies are adapting to the change in the environment around workers today. And some of the folks we're talking to are saying some of these changes are going to be longstanding, right, that we're seeing a more profound shift in the workforce because of increased flexibility of being able to work from home, because of sort of life decisions people made during the pandemic, maybe some people taking early retirement, et cetera. How is the administration thinking about some of those longer term changes and addressing some of those longer term trends? Well, I think one of the biggest things that President did in the bill back better legislation that didn't go to the Senate, child care paid family leave, sick time medically, all of those issues are very important to families today. And I think a lot of companies, some of them, getting there on their own, but child care is a very complicated issue. And I think that we as a country have to think about, rethink about the way that our child care system works because it's expensive and we're having a high time retaining workers in that industry because we don't pay them enough to take care of our kids. So I think as we think about long term, that's going to be one investment on a federal level, but also on the private sector. So I think, you know, pre-pandemic, we didn't hear about the changes in companies. These companies would change the way they did office space, open areas, things like that. But I think because of the pandemic, it's made us all really think about the future and what we're doing here at the Department of Labor, we're working with companies. I don't think I have the right to tell a company how to operate that company. I'm not my role.",https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yvHvxXHIc5I,35,2022-10-10 16:25:54
2922," But I think because of the pandemic, it's made us all really think about the future. And what we're doing here at the Department of Labor, we're working with companies. I don't think I have the right to tell a company how to operate that company. That's not my role. My role is to try and assist them and help with them and share best practices where I can and what other companies are doing. Mr. Secretary, last time we spoke to you about a month ago on jobs day, we're still looking to in analyzing the quiet quitting movement. Now a month later, how big a problem is this in the country? I don't, I mean, I haven't really heard about it from companies. I know that it's being reported in the press. I've talked to a lot of companies in the country and I haven't heard about that. Certainly, that's a concern if it continues on because when people hire people, they expect them to do, you know, a day's work for a day's pay. And I think that that's something that we have to continue and encourage. But when I talk, as I've gone around the country this last month and I've done a lot of trips, no company has approached me on this quiet quitting idea. And Secretary, I want to ask you about the real strike in which you intervened last month and helped avert that strike. That was sort of an 11th hour agreement. I know it was sort of a marathon process, right, of working through it with them. What are some of the lessons learned from that? For example, would you get involved earlier in the future to sort of not have a down to the wire situation? If I'm asked to get involved earlier, I would. Certainly in the potent negotiation, I'm not involved at the table, but I certainly am talking to both sides to make sure that encouraging both sides, and they already asked often encourage them to stay at the table and get this contract done. In the real strike, you know, this was a two-year period that they weren't able to get an agreement where the president had to appoint an emergency board to come up with a P.E.B. They came up with the recommendations and we built off of that. But certainly, you know, I think when you get to that point, there's a breakdown. So I have offered to anybody, anybody who wants, if they want me to get involved, or get us involved. But I think mediation is important as well. If you have two sides that kids can't get to an agreement, my recommendation is try and bring a mediator in. It's not to be me, but bring a mediator in. It's just to keep the conversation moving forward. And Labor Secretary, just while we have you, we do know that President Biden issued a presidential proclamation pardoning federal convictions for simple marijuana possession defenses. These are people that have been barred in some cases from getting back into the workforce because of these convictions and offenses. Where will the Labor Department continue to do work at the state level, even, to ensure that there are opportunities for people to get occupations within the workforce? Yeah, we have to make sure what the president did yesterday is carried out. And too many of the people that have been pardoned by the president yesterday are people of color, and particularly the African-American community. And this has been the challenge in our country for a long time where people were convicted of a minor marijuana offense that had a record. And I commend the president for his actions yesterday and the folks that are out there were going to work with them to make sure that they can get into good employment, that this is not an impediment to their ability to get into the middle class and get a good paying job. U.S. Labor Secretary, Marty Walsh, pleasure to have you on the show. And thanks as always for taking the time. Thank you. Thank you.",https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yvHvxXHIc5I,36,2022-10-10 16:29:51
2923, you you I'm going to be on the business. I'm going to be on the business. Levi Strauss out with the beat on earnings and it's late as quarter over a stronger yours dollar weakness in Europe and ongoing supply and change just rupfions like the jeans giant to cut its outlook. With more on this we have harming Singh Levi Strauss CFO for more on this quarter harming great to get some time with you. Want to go across the pond on Europe. So some I would say some surprising results at a Levi's brand. Good morning. As the quarter progressed it did surprise us. And as you know we have a very strong brand. As you think about the quarter overall our quarter was fairly solid despite all the incremental headwinds who were up 7% in constant currency with BDPS. And the Levi's brand was just to the strongest quarter of the revenue in a decade. And so as you think about our European business you know the weather was fairly warm and the consumer there is under pressure. And so what we did as a collectively as a team is we quickly get up into action and you know looked at discretionary costs. We focus on our direct to consumer business because we have a diversified business model. The parts of the world that are really strong like Asia and Latin America and their resistors strong growth. We also had some supply chain disruptions especially in the US which impacted the business. And so as we thought about the year we said okay let's think about three things that impact the results. One is stronger dollar. The second is supply chain disruptions. And the third is you know softening consumer demand in the western part of the world. But even think of Europe brand. The parts of Europe that were fairly strong UK and Spain you know we're actually countries that grew. I think where we were so far is in Germany and France. The brand still fairly strong you know globally as well as in Europe. When you talk about softening demand harming is there a relative point that you think back to where this period is analogous to? You know I would say you know we've been as a company we've been through you know good times and tough times. And I would say as you think about softening demand you know I was not here in 0809 but you know the financial crisis at that time did have an impact as a company. You know our toughest period was during the pandemic where all our stores were shut for about 90 days and we lost a billion dollars you know just like that. But we've as a management team and I'm really proud of the management team that's been around for a while. We actually geared up into action and said okay how do we manage through the crisis but more importantly how do we emerge stronger and then in 2021 we registered our strongest financial year in a decade. So as we think about you know the next few quarters and as you know if things do tighten that's what we're going to be doing. We're going to be thinking about how do we manage through the immediate crisis which is in the near term but as a company and a brand you know we will get out of it and we'll get out of it and we'll get out of it stronger. You know some of you that I invested in June we laid out longer term targets these are what are we call not start targets we still get to and focused in delivering them over the long term.,https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yvHvxXHIc5I,37,2022-10-10 16:34:19
2924, yesterday in june we laid out long-term targets these are what are we call not start targets we're still get to and focused in delivering them over the longer term and emerging out of this as a stronger company i mean i appreciate the focus on the longer term i'm i want more shorter term question which is after the inventory bill which i believe was above 40% for the last quarter are you putting things on sale how you guys could planning to clear out that inventory yeah so the inventory bill has you know is something that we have flagged uh... you know externally as well as internally so you know it's intentional uh... in in in a way is basically comprised of three things the for the third of the of the inventory growth is driven by the fact that last year was a very low based tight inventory and the fact that inflation has uh... increase the cost of uh... inventory a third is uh... inventory uh... that is driven by the fact that we're bringing uh... you know because of the longer lead times in supply chain we bring in stuff early and we're getting ready for our e-rp installation in the in quarter two of uh... next year and a third is largely goods in transit to a third of our inventory is called so think the five or once think the five elevens and we can carry that through multiple seasons and so there's no reason to discount that uh... we don't have a lot of obsolete where we do have obsolete we are discounting that so that we can clear it uh... but overall if you think of our gross margins are gross margins and q3 were still you know for a basis points higher than twenty nineteen it did a little relative to last year but that was you know largely driven by foreign exchange a little bit more discounting we do expect the holidays season to have to be a little bit more promotional and we're going to balance growing revenue and discounting because the brands never been this strong and that's you know evidence by the fact that q3 revenues uh... for a livid with the strongest in in in uh... in a decade for quarter three when you acknowledge discounting it's hard not to think about the strongest brands right now needing to move through inventory in ploring some of the promotional elements and so when you think about the percentage of full price that selling versus the percentage of what would actually be did uh... discounted during this period of time through the holiday season even perhaps thereafter as well what does that breakdown really look like to you yeah you know uh... still a lot of what we sell is uh... on a full price basis we had uh... estimated that uh... gross margins uh... in the second half of the year uh... because we'll be selling more uh... below full price you know would be impacted about a hundred for a hundred basis points in quarter three that a little bit more about a hundred thirty hundred forty basis points we build that into a guidance in qqq four but overall we still think we'll end the year uh... at about you know four hundred basis points higher than uh... 2019 and that just evidences the strength of the brand are you are for example uh... which is the average unit retail price in quarter three we still up in the in the mid uh... to high single digit that means pricing that we have taken to offset cost is ticking uh... and our revenues were up slightly i sorry our unit growth was up slightly so overall the brands really strong doctors uh... as we have diversified also grew uh... load double digit and beyond your guys just starting which is open up first uh... store in san amonica in heli and if uh... that uh... you know does well then you know uh... we can add a lot many stores in the active way segment so overall uh... our business is fairly diversified uh... brad and uh... thinking is that we will you know uh... you know move through this uh... promotional environment by ensuring that uh... brand continues brand equity continues to build hey harmy it's a brine here again you know i'm loyal uh... leave eyes consumer uh... but i don't know i don't know if i'm buying these new baggy dad genes uh... that you're bringing to market i i don't know if you realize how how strong i work for this physique and those kinds of the show it off i'll be honest with you and you know uh... the fact is that we're a democratic brand we have something for everybody so if the baggy dad uh... you know jesus,https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yvHvxXHIc5I,38,2022-10-10 16:38:39
2925," I gotta be honest with you. And you know, the fact is that we are a democratic brand. We have something for everybody. So if the baggy dad, you know, Jesus, not what you like to wear, it doesn't fit your style. You can wear the tapered look, you can wear the slimmer look. There is something for you, brunt and for everybody else, across all age demographics, you know, at Levi's. And that's what, you know, we are proud to ensure that every consumer gets what he or she needs. Yeah, brunt, Jesus got to rock the jorts to show off the gas. He's got to show off the leg. Oh, you know, look, I'm still the steamy skinny jeans guy. I mean, you got to show off the glutes. You put that time in. I want to show him off on a nice pair of jeans. I don't know. I don't know. There's a little out of fashion here, so we'll take this offline. We'll take this offline. Harmi, it's great to see you. It's not only jeans that you can get from Levi's. You can get more if I had to tell look. You know, I'm wearing a wonderful Levi's shirt, you know, gives a casual look. Because we continue to bleed those who are becoming more casual. And those becoming more casual brands like us that offer more of a head to toe look, you know, are the ones that will eat the judge. Yes, no matter which of the numbers of the models that you wear on the bottom, I have to say we were expecting either the leather jacket or the jean jacket, Harmi, so it's good to know you're still repping on top with the white shirt. Harmi, it's saying great for catching up with the Levi's Strauss CFL. Thanks, Julie. Thank you. And we want to continue the labor market discussion and conversation. Check on the roads ahead for the US economy. And for that, we have Gus Vosher, joining us now, PNC Financial Services Group Chief Economist. And let me just ask you your initial reaction to the report, Gus, and then anything that sticks out to you. Yeah, so this is a good report. The Fed wants to see slower job growth. I think they prefer to even see even slower job growth than this, but certainly we have seen job growth slow over the course of 2022 is the Fed has raised rates. And that should allow the labor market to cool off as we head into 2023. All right. And then we were just listening to it. And as give some of the statistics, so when you dig into the report, some of the demographic breakdowns may surprise people, maybe some reversals and trends, what did you pick out? Well, certainly we saw the labor force participation rate decline. That's bad news from the Fed's perspective. They want to see more people looking for work. Instead, we saw fewer people. And so that means a tight labor market. And so that makes it more difficult for the Fed means they may have to raise rates a bit more. On the other hand, we did see a bit softer wage growth down to, it slowed to 5% year over year, still higher than the Fed would like, but that's moving in the right direction. So what I think is where we are.",https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yvHvxXHIc5I,39,2022-10-10 16:42:58
2926," down to, it slowed to 5% year over year, still higher than the Fed would like, but that's moving in the right direction. So what I think is we are seeing a cooling off in the labor market, but it remains too hot from the Fed's perspective, and they're going to need to raise rates more to cool off some of those inflationary pressures we're seeing in the economy right now. And I've heard some economists calling this report a Goldilocks report. You look at the stock reaction definitely to the downside, but maybe that's the bad news as good news here, because the Fed doesn't want to see stock prices go up as some of the, I believe it was, Nian Kowkari said definitively over a month ago, what are we to make of this in light of the bad news as good news as bad meme, that kind of confuses people, especially some of us in the business sometimes? Yeah, so what we want is job growth that is slowing to a more sustainable pace. So, you know, even over the last three months, we've added about 370,000 jobs per month on average, the labor force just simply can't support that. So we need to see much slower job growth that's consistent with underlying growth in the population. We're not there yet, we're moving in the right direction. So, you know, obviously if we're adding a lot of jobs in the economy, that means more income, that means more consumer spending, but at the same time it's contributing to high inflation. So, what we want is okay news from the job market, not good news, but, you know, indications that job growth is slowing and that, you know, we are reaching an equilibrium where those wage pressures in the economy are lessening. And how about the other part of the Fed's mandate inflation? So we have maximum employment, stable prices, interpreted to mean 2% inflation, obviously far above that. But what are you expecting out of some of the readings? And how does that fit into the expectations? Everybody waiting with baited breath for that eventual Fed pivot? Yeah, no, we are starting to see inflation slow. I think it peaked over the summer. Obviously we've seen a big drop in energy prices, although we'll have to see what happens with the new OPEC production cuts. Wage growth is slowing, so that should help bring down inflation. It's going to be difficult. You know, we probably won't see that 2% inflation until some time in early 2024, but we are moving in the right direction. I think the Fed wants to see both a slowing in the job market and indications that inflation is moving decisively towards 2% before they stop raising rates. I don't think that'll be some time until early in 2023. So, you know, if the Fed is going to be looking at the data as they come in and we need to see that slowing in inflation and slower job growth, if the Fed is going to let up. And you mentioned the energy market before. I'm stirring it at WTI crude prices at above $91 per barrel. And it was about a week or two ago that it seemed to be about $8 fewer than that. And I'm just wondering, what do the current energy prices say to you? There are people hoping that there would be some mitigation to help out the consumers here, but we had OPEC plus step in, reduce their outlook or reduce what they say they're going to pump by 2.1 million barrels per day. They're already in deficit. What are you making of the energy market and its effect on the U.S. economy here? Yeah, so obviously the OPEC production cuts are not good news for oil prices, for inflation in the United States. That being said, a lot of OPEC members were already below their quotas. And so I don't think we're going to see is, you know, that 2.1 barrel per day cut. But I think we're going to get less help on inflation from lower energy prices. But I think the other impacts of the Fed rate hikes in terms of slowing in job growth, the slowing in demand for consumer durables, that type of thing, that will help reduce in those inflationary pressures we're seeing in the economy, even if OPEC keeps production low. Even if lots of ifs in this business here appreciate your insights on this jobs Friday.

2927," you you you say that d the semiconductor industry is one that makes us feel very profitable and productive for three years in a row and then just makes us feel awful in that fourth year and it seems like we are in that fourth year. The specific things that are causing the headwinds this year are threefold. First, there is just enormous pressure on the consumer because of all the inflationary issues because of all the turmoil in Europe because of the lockdowns in China. Secondly, we have the specter of rising rates, which is never good for valuations in high beta, high multiple sector. And then on top of it, as you mentioned, there are some additional restrictions on semiconductor companies in terms of shipping to China and look, China is the largest customer for semiconductors than it's never good to have friction between the largest designer of semis, which is the US and the largest customer. So I think where we are today, when I put it all in the context, is the semiconductor stocks have a way of smelling the turn in the economy, you know, six to nine to 12 months before it happens. So last November, when semiconductor stocks speak, there was no talk of recession. The same way there is no talk of an upturn of the next cycle today. So our assumption is that compare start to get easier for the sector next year and if that is the assumption and if that's the right assumption, we think semiconductor stocks can try and find a bottom sometime in Q4 and meanwhile, the valuations are starting to look very interesting for what's a very profitable industry. So the fact that's interesting just in terms of what you said to expert restrictions and then taking that and coupling that with your predictions, your expectations for this space going into 2023. So it sounds like you view it as a challenge here in the near term, but you don't think it's going to have a significant impact in terms of sales, is that right? Yeah, so let's talk about those restrictions. So first of all, you know, as I mentioned, friction is never good between the largest designer and the largest buyer of semiconductors. But when you take a step back, the majority of chips that are shipped to China are actually for a lot of consumer applications. Therefore, smartphones, therefore PCs, therefore a lot of low end, you know, consumer speakers and so forth, like the largest buyers of semis in China are not supercomputing or military companies. They are companies like Oppo, Vivo, Xiaomi, Lenovo, ZTE. So it's not really super computing. In fact, if I take the entire supercomputing and military end-use market for semiconductors globally, it is not more than 5 or 10% of end-of-man.",https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yvHvxXHIc5I,41,2022-10-10 16:51:14
2928," really super computing. In fact, if I take the entire super computing and military end use market for semiconductors globally, it is not more than 5 or 10 percent of end demand. And even if you assume half of it is in China, which is a very big number, it still says that there is not more than a 5 percent or so headband. Second point I would mention is that we have to be careful when we use the term restriction. So what is happening is that there is a set of rules that now forces a lot of semiconductor companies to first go and ask for approvals. So they are not actually banned outright from shipping. They have been given this extra step to go and verify that the end customer is not a military end use customer or a super computing customer that might be on an entity list. Which is why we think that yes, it's a headband and it doesn't help when the sector is already facing a lot of the macro pressures. But in terms of specifically this incremental headband, we don't think it's more than 5 to 7 percent incremental. And that too, it's only applied to very specific set of companies. In fact, I want to draw your attention to something that we saw from tourist securities. In talking about Tesla, perhaps being a dark horse when it comes to AI and perhaps arrival for Nvidia, saying that they actually see it obviously though Nvidia is the leader in this space. They see apart the Tesla to build its own business to compete with it. What's your take on perhaps the role that some of these non-traditional chip makers like a Tesla might play in this space? Sure, absolutely. Look, first, when it comes to the field of artificial intelligence, we are still in the first innings. That means if I take all the servers that were shipped in the world in the last year, less than 15 percent of them actually had an AI accelerator in them and the majority of them used an Nvidia product. And then if I couple that with the automotive industry where Tesla participates, the entire automotive industry is only 8 percent of the semiconductor market. So I think we have to keep a lot of these things in context of what the sizes of these markets are. So we really like Nvidia. And the reason is that their specific technology of AI accelerators, it's not just a chip. They're not just designing a chip. They're actually designing a complete end-to-end system and a stack of software and a stack and a big number of developers, actually and a half million developers that have been trained on using this product. So I would say the Tesla use case is a very, very specific one, maybe less than 1 percent of the entire semiconductor industry. But it is a rising tide. Many companies will participate. But we think Nvidia is on a different not-so-different planet, but I think on a different solar system when it comes to the application and the benefits of AI. The Vekarya, always great to get your perspective. A bank of America. Thanks so much for joining us today. Let's stick with the chip makers and what we're seeing play out in the semiconductor space. And micron is the latest company to take advantage of the funding from the Biden administration's $52 billion chips act announcing plans to invest up to $100 billion for",https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yvHvxXHIc5I,42,2022-10-10 16:55:47
2929," The latest company to take advantage of the funding from the Biden administration's $52 billion chips act announcing plans to invest up to $100 billion for a plant in Syracuse, New York. Joining us now is a man who helped us seal that deal. We want to welcome Syracuse, Mayor Ben Walsh to the program. Mayor Walsh, it's great to see you. Congratulations on this historic deal between the city of Syracuse and a micron year. Just talked to us just about the economic implications of this and the opportunity that this presents for your region. Transformational is probably an understatement. We have been working for a long time to prepare our community for this opportunity and this week was historic. So really, immediately, our focus shifts towards what we need to do to be prepared for this opportunity. Clearly, we have to make sure we have the workforce. We're going to see significant investments in housing, but it's very exciting for an older, northeastern industrial city like Syracuse. It is a part of a really amazing comeback story. A story, someday you'll have to write in a book how a small town or at least medium town quarter $100 billion in investment. How do you do it? Because other companies, other towns across the country are watching to see exactly how they can do it. What was the key? Well, there are so many factors that went into it. We have a great site. The site is located about 15 to 20 minutes north of the city of Syracuse owned by the Anadogga County Industrial Development Agency. They've been investing in that site for nearly 30 years now. It is about 1,400 acres now. So we had the right site. We had the support from New York State government, Governor Holt Gold made a significant investment. The CHIP SAC at the federal level was critically important. Right here in the city of Syracuse, we have been in the midst of our own Renaissance. A lot of investment downtown. The city is really coming back and as companies are trying to attract and retain talent, having a vibrant city as a critical component. I'm proud to say we have that here in Syracuse. Up to 50,000 jobs are expected to be created as a result of this. I guess how do you prepare? How do you build up the workforce in order to fill that large number of jobs? Well, it takes time. And I'm pleased to say that we're not starting right now. We've been at this for quite a while now as part of our Syracuse Surge strategy, which is our strategy for inclusive growth in the new economy. As we've identified opportunities in what we call the fourth industrial revolution, we've seen certain areas where Syracuse has a competitive advantage where we have curriculum in our schools that we're developing that can make sure that our people and our workers have the right skill sets. So we have a lot of the right programs and infrastructure in place. This opportunity is just going to require us to scale them at a rate that we've never done before. So, again, looking at scaling our workforce development programs, continuing to invest in housing, public transportation, all of the infrastructure that we need to accommodate this investment. So 9,000 of those jobs should make an average of $100,000 each that is remarkable. As remarkable as this achievement was, I'm inspired by an independent mayor winning 60% of the vote in your second term. Is this something that we can see spread across the country? What allowed you to run as an independent because the narrative in this country is that it is a dominated two-party system and you simply cannot break through? Well, I'll describe it within the context of this deal. The fact that we have an independent mayor, a Republican County executive, a Democratic governor, all working hand in hand to make this deal happen is significant. And I think does provide a model for other communities to pursue at a time when our country is very divisive. I think when people focus on what we have in common and where we can have shared prosperity and growth, you can make things happen. So I hope in that way we are a model that we are where America is going or hopefully we want to be going. And as for me, it was about developing and bringing together a broad coalition, broad diverse coalition of people that had a love for this city and that we're willing to set party politics aside for the greater good. Speaking of being a model, making things happen clearly, this is a huge win for your city. Are you in talks with other large-",https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yvHvxXHIc5I,43,2022-10-10 17:00:18
2930," politics aside for the greater good. Speaking of being a model, making things happen clearly, this is a huge win for your city. Are you in talks with other large companies? What else are you doing to attract jobs to your city of Syracuse? Well, similar to the point about our programs in place, you know, our comeback story, our Renaissance, is already underway. We have a facility on the south side of Syracuse just south of downtown, a local company, a JMA wireless, just constructed the first 5G wireless manufacturing facility in the United States. We have other investments like that taking place. Nothing to the scale of micron, and we certainly see, know that there will be significant follow-on opportunities, supply chain opportunities that come with micron. But we do hope that this also puts us on the radar of many other companies around the globe that are looking for a place where, again, you have the political alignment that allows you to do business that has the balance of a vibrant downtown, but also beautiful parks and countrysides and mountains and lakes all around us. So it's really pulling all of that together. Well, congratulations on the deal. Nice to join us, Syracuse, Mayor Ben Walls. Appreciate it, thanks. Thank you. In this episode of influencers, SEC Chair Gary Gensler. I come with a deeply markets background. I really believe in markets. I think markets are critical part of our economy but regulated markets. Events in Eastern Europe just sort of highlight once again the importance of cyber resiliency. If you're raising money from the public, and the public's anticipating some profit based on the efforts of those folks raising the money, that comes within the definitions of a security and the security's laws, and it's kind of straightforward. Hello, everyone, and welcome to influencers. I'm Andy Sirware, and welcome to our guest, Gary Gensler, Chair of the Securities and Exchange Commission. Gary Gensler was sworn into office as the 33rd Chair last April, and in a little under a year in office, he's pushed the SEC right into the middle of the conversation surrounding cryptocurrency, meme stocks, and other issues as well. Chair Gensler, thanks so much for joining us. Andy, it's so good to be with you and your viewers. Thank you. A whole lot to get to, but I want to start with the news in Ukraine, especially the reaction from the business community, the New York Stock Exchange recently moved to temporarily halt trading for Russia-based companies. Have you been monitoring that and should it be a permanent ban? So just stepping back from any one circumstance, the staff of the SEC are monitoring markets as we do through these times, throughout the whole time that I've been at the agency. It's not just about the geopolitical events in Eastern Europe, but yes, they're monitoring. We're staying close to those events. We're talking to our colleagues at the US Department of Treasurer and across the financial regulatory complex, the Federal Reserve, and other regulators, as well as globally to regulators in the banking and the securities fields across the globe. Just to stay close and monitoring events with these really unusual events out of Eastern Europe and war in Ukraine. Do you feel you have enough transparency into US corporate exposure to Russian assets and the Russian economy? Do you have worries about hidden US connections as the Russian economy may be headed for a recession or worse? Well, Andy, I'm going to stick to our remittance, the Securities and Exchange Commission, which is about overseeing yes, a hundred plus trillion dollar cap.",https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yvHvxXHIc5I,44,2022-10-10 17:04:28
2931," worse? Well, and I'm going to stick to our remittance the securities and exchange commission, which is about overseeing yes, a hundred plus trillion dollar capital markets and ensuring that they're fair and orderly, efficient and in these unusual times we're monitoring for that. But I do feel that we've had good dialogue with major market participants in the fund area, in the broker dealer area, the exchanges, the clearing houses, and at least for these handful of days so far the market functions have been operating relatively well. But what comes tomorrow, what comes in the future we're monitoring against, you know, events as they come? I understand it's not straight ahead into your remit, but obviously as you suggest yourself, there are implications potentially and potential even systemic risks to the global macro system. One last question here, Chair Gensler, about that though, are there other actions the SEC is taking or considering taking in response to what's going on in Ukraine and Russia? Again, we're staying alert and monitoring, we're staying close with the rest of the financial stability oversight council agencies and our colleagues around the globe. If you look at funds under management, the total multiples of tens of trillions of dollars of assets under management here in the US, only a very small percentage. Well, measured well below 1%, in fact only a fraction of 1% are invested in Russian securities or ADR is traded overseas and things like that. So yes, we're going to continue to monitor, especially stay alert for any cyber risks or any other market functioning risks. But I think that's what our role is and then to ensure for our three-part mission investor protection capital formation and then that in the middle, the fair orderly and efficient markets. Okay, sounds good. Let me ask you about crypto, which is part of your purview, I guess, increasingly and something you've been considering a lot lately. I know last time you were on with Yahoo Finance, the prospects for a spot Bitcoin ETF came up and you had a lot of questions about how investor protection would work there. Have your concerns been alleviated? Is approval coming, do you think? Look, we at the SEC are technology neutral, but we're anything but public policy neutral. And so this investment class, a little less than two trillion dollars of assets, valuation in crypto currencies, if you wish, or crypto tokens, Bitcoin and all the other tokens is a highly investible asset at this point in time. Many tens of millions of people around the globe have chosen to put some of their savings into this space. And so it's every bit is important to have investor protection for crypto exchanges, for the lending platforms where people are transacting, buying and selling crypto tokens, and have appropriate disclosure about the tokens themselves and protect the public from fraud and manipulation. And that's really what we're looking at. And yes, as you said, the SEC has a role to play. Other agencies do as well, but the SEC has a role to play because Congress painted with a broad brush. And if you're raising money from the public, and the public's anticipating some profit based on the efforts of those folks raising the money, that comes within the definitions of a security and the securities law.",https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yvHvxXHIc5I,45,2022-10-10 17:08:41
2932," And the public's anticipating some profit based on the efforts of those folks raising the money that comes within the definitions of a security and the securities laws and it's it's kind of straightforward. Congress saw that that was an opportunity to mislead the public to to sell to sell a shame transaction to that the public could make a decision the basic bargain the public gets to decide on their investments as long as those promoters raising money are giving full and fair disclosure. And there's basic laws about protecting against fraud in essence lies about what's going on. Right, and then sort of following up there and you also told us that you hope this this year crypto trading exchanges would come within the public policy perimeter. Yeah, look, we had just a couple of weeks ago working with one of the larger lending platforms where where a platform was taking money in. It's it's public is block by 600,000 or so. Retail accounts and institutional accounts people putting their crypto assets at risk with block five block five then saying we'll give you a return on an in an on an account. And we were trying to bring those parties in in that case that was a you know they were not following the securities laws the securities laws investment company laws and the securities act laws. So does that mean though that the exchanges will come under SEC regulation strictly speaking. Just just do a little bit of probability here i'm sort of a math guy I was when I was a kid my identical twin brother and I you know that's that's kind of who we were and everything but. These platforms often have not just dozens but hundreds or thousands of tokens on their platforms and these tokens back to the securities laws many of them without pre judging any one of them many of them may well be securities. Probabilities or that these platforms there's 10 or 15 large platforms these crypto trading platforms have 75 to 5000 tokens on probabilities or they have securities on our laws are straightforward supposed to register as an exchange where people are buying and selling those securities and yes. Many tokens many crypto tokens have been found in the past to be securities i'm not trying to prejudge any one token with probability weighted there are many of these tokens on these platforms. you you you",https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yvHvxXHIc5I,46,2022-10-10 17:12:46
2933," you you you there thank you for attending Call His Check Tower of is in exchange, it's question whether they're registered or they're operating outside of the law, and I'll leave it at that. Are you concerned, Chair Gensler, about the decrease in the number of public companies in the US? And I know there's arguments about how extreme that decrease is, and nonetheless, if you were today and there were 20 years ago. And then the fact that private companies grow into Deca Unicorns and are great investments, perhaps, but they're unavailable to ordinary investors. They're only available to the people on Sand Hill Road and how that might be exacerbating inequality in this country. So I think that we have vibrant capital markets, it's a hundred plus trillion dollar capital markets that are kind of the envy of the world, frankly. I think anyone who's honored to be in the role of the common, as you said, Andy, the 33rd Chair, and there'll be others, you know, for decades to come in this great agency. Well, central to our roles, this Chair's, past Chair's and future Chair's, is to ensure that we continue to be the envy of the world, that we have the leading capital markets. And we have a vibrant public capital markets and vibrant private markets. We are taking up a lot of projects here at the SEC about those private markets to bring greater transparency, greater efficiency. We have more efficiency and yes, competition in the middle, that's better for those private companies, whether they're small startups or the unicorns. And it's better for the investor. So we're trying to drive efficiency in the middle. We're also trying to drive for greater transparency, particularly as it relates to financial stability risk, emanating maybe out of hedge funds and the like. So we've got a lot of projects driving competition and transparency, but part of our markets is both public markets and private markets. Speaking of the envy of the world, what is the future of Chinese stocks listing in the United States? Does the SEC have a role or a position in this situation one way or the other? So we do so we're blessed in the US again with such robust and strong capital markets that between 1,500 foreign companies actually live.",https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yvHvxXHIc5I,47,2022-10-10 17:17:25
2934," So we're blessed in the US again with such robust and strong capital markets that between 1,500 foreign companies actually list their shares here in the US. It's not just China companies but a lot of Europeans Asian South American African Australian company. It just from all around the globe. But there's some basic understandings that if you want to list in the US, you need to comply with our investor protection rules. And one of the key things that came out 20 years ago. One of the key things was that if you want to be issuing and raising money in the US, that you have to be not only audited that the company has to be audited, but the auditors have to be open to inspection. Kind of simple idea, audit the auditors and Paul Sorbaine's a Maryland Senator who I had the honor to work with chairs sorbaine's past that law 20 years ago by partisan with Republicans on the hill, which Senator with Mike Oxley and with President Bush. 20 years later, 50 plus jurisdictions around the globe have allowed US entity called the public company accounting oversight board to audit the auditors, but China has not. So Congress weighed in again two years ago or year and a half ago and said, no, that's not that's not right. And they put a clock that had to happen. So where are we today. I think it's really we've had some good discussions with our counterparts from China, the public company accounting oversight board has had some good discussions, but it's really up up to the officials in China. So now the auditing firms and Beijing and Shanghai and elsewhere to be inspected and that their work papers are actually shared and not with a lot of red actions, but actually shared. And the auditors actually allowed themselves to be, you know, give interviews and testimony like 50 other countries have done right then there's a path forward otherwise Congress has spoken about 250 Chinese companies in this three year clock. And potentially as early as 2024 would be would have to suspend trading here. Another proposal on the works is specifically in response to last year's meme stock craze, I believe it would shorten the amount of time it takes to clear trades. How would last year have played out differently had that rule been in place. And events around the meme stops or as you know, the game stop led to a review by the SEC and we came up the staff came up with four areas we should take a look at. And we have in two of those areas put out proposals to we've working on some more. So one is what you talked about is the basic plumbing. Shortening how long it takes for money to move and stock to move it's called settlement period from two days to one day we've also done something around transparency around short selling and made a proposal. Last week around that as well. Shortening the settlement cycle lowers the risk in the system is the old saying goes time is money right now if you do a trade on a Monday you don't move the money or the stock until Wednesday. You shorten that to Tuesday less risk in the middle of that January the faithful January around the game stop events the broke a number of broke one line brokers and broker jobs said we can't let retail public access the market and that's that's just that access to the market is so fundamental. That part of the issue part of the issue was the settlement cycle thing but it's not the only thing and as I say we have four projects we.",https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yvHvxXHIc5I,48,2022-10-10 17:21:38
2935," that part of the issue, part of the issue was this settlement cycle thing, but it's not the only thing. And as I say we have four projects we propose to the other two looking at really the equity market structure itself and payment for order flow and the dark. And then we have the same pool of capital that are flowing without transparency. That's a major project that I'm hoping staff will make recommendations and we'll move forward. And lastly was this thing called gamification or what we've come to call digital engagement practices. The journal is reported the SEC is looking in recent sales by Tesla CEO Elon Musk and his brother Kimble whether they violated insider trading rules. I know you can't comment on a post. I'm glad you said that. I'm not sure where you're heading. I'm going somewhere. I'm going somewhere chair against her. All right. I know you can comment on possible investigation, but have you talked about the need for stronger insider trading rules generally how big an issue is this been your first year is insider trading a problem that you're focusing on. It is it is from our enforcement side or terrific enforcement efforts headed up by director of gray wall. Sanjay Wadwa the whole team just terrific team, but it's also from from the policy side we've even done something about insiders. When can corporate executives sell their shares and there was something put in place about 20 years ago, which was called a safe harbor if you might and we came on board and thought there's too many gaps in this area that the insin your management might be trading stock. And there in receipt of material non public information and we put this proposal out in I think was December or so about these so called 10 B51 plans and so both from really vigorous enforcement. Also from the policy side about insiders were taking it up in both ways and I think it's a really important part because it comes out of trust in our capital markets and and trust that there's a level playing field that when you're in the markets that that somebody doesn't have an information and banage from material non public information. you you you you",https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yvHvxXHIc5I,49,2022-10-10 17:25:42
2936, you you you you you you what are your feelings about the debate on Capitol Hill right now about lawmakers being able to trade stocks my understanding is the SEC that SEC employees have pretty tight restrictions with some stocks being off limits and trades needing to be pretty approved is that fair I mean should it be the same for everyone in all different branches of the government but I'm going to leave that as you can imagine to Congress to think through or certainly or willing and able to give them technical assistance on that the stock act that was passed about 10 years ago by Congress and set certain reporting obligations on members of Congress and also certain limitations as well we as an agency actually have a role to play in that stock act and that's that's ongoing discussions I know up on Capitol Hill and wherever they come out we stand ready to help implement our part of that if they change those laws and finally chair Gansler other recent SEC chairs including Jake Clayton and Mary Jo White came to the job for more of a legal background that you worked as a banker at Goldman once upon a time ago how has that background and the insight you garnered there changed how you approach these issues and running the commission is it any different well I'm honored to be in this job I mean that the then president elect Biden as many to it is one of the greatest honors of my life you know right up there with my three daughters I guess but my three daughters maybe higher honor and the wonderful woman I was was married to I would say this I'm the fifth chair of those 33 that is a non-murder you know from from the first chair Joe Kennedy the president Kennedy's father Arthur Levin William Donaldson some really really fantastic chairs look we all come with different backgrounds different perspectives at different experiences I'm I come with a deeply markets background I really believe in markets I think markets are a critical part of our economy but regulated markets I think that the the laws put in place in the 1930s in this eight nine decade period of the SECs that would Franklin Dylan Roosevelt laid out and and many really wonderful people at the SEC and on Capitol Hill too have augmented is we've enhanced economic growth because when you enhance trust is basic concept that if you investors get to decide but they get full and fair disclosure and we protecting them against fraud that the exchanges have to register but there's a basic rules of investor protection and this three part mission to facilitate capital formation investors in the efficient markets in the middle I think that's a really great bargain now for me I've also had the great honor to chair and I'm,https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yvHvxXHIc5I,50,2022-10-10 17:30:03
2937," efficient markets in the middle. I think that's a really great bargain. Now for me, I've also had the great honor to share another agency, so along with Mary Shapiro, Mary and I, or two people that have shared both the commodity futures trading commission and the SEC. So it's great to talk to my former chairs. There's eight, I think of eight or nine now that are still alive and I call them on a regular basis. I check in. And there's just a terrific, terrific group of commissioners, my fellow commissioners, Alison Lee, Hester Perst and Caroline Crenshaw. And we all bring a little bit different skills and perspective and we bring it together. Eric Gensler, Chair of the Securities and Exchange Commission. Thank you so much for joining us. Thank you. You've been watching influencers. I'm Andy Sirware. We'll see you next time. Welcome back to Yowl Finance on this Monday morning. I'm Brian Sasi alongside Julie Hyman and Brad Smith. Markets or mix, this trader's gear up from Porton Reads on inflation this week and the start of earning season with results out of the big banks. You've seen some mixed action across the board. The Dow slightly in the green. Now here are three things we're watching for you at this moment. On high alert for a recession, we'll talk one economic expert on the road ahead for the sputtering U.S. economy. And DC heats up. Yowl Finance contributor Kevin Sirly stops by ahead of the annual World Bank and IMF meetings later this week. And a key great recession player wins some new hardware for his trophy shelf. We'll have the details coming up shortly. Now let's get over to Yowl Finance as an S for A over the Wi-Fi Interactive. And Sasi, we are looking at a mixed picture when it comes to equities. The bottom market today is closed. But the NASDAQ is the one that is really under pressure.",https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yvHvxXHIc5I,51,2022-10-10 17:34:46
2938," We are looking at a mixed picture when it comes to equities. The bottom market today is closed, but the NASDAQ is the one that is really underperforming right now down to 6.10% of a percent. That's because technology stocks are under pressure, so you can see tech here under pressure, healthcare and consumer discretionary as well. Over on the NASDAQ 100, we are watching a little bit of flatness when it comes to Amazon, Tesla, up about 7, 10% of a percent, and Apple, down about 1%. Do you want to point out what's happening with the Chinese ADRs? Because we are seeing some of these Chinese ADRs under pressure. And this is because of some holiday-shopping data, also because of COVID cases in China. So that's putting pressure on these Chinese stocks and also putting pressure on some of the gambling stocks as well. So just looking at our gambling chart, we are seeing some of these casinos and win resorts that are under pressure as well as some of the travel stocks guys. All right, Yahoo! Finance is on the NASDAQ. Thanks for breaking that down for us. Appreciate it. And as we continue to look ahead to what's on tap this week with the Fed Minutes and CPI data, let's bring in the co-founder of the Economic Cycle Research Institute, Lakshman to Truthin to break it down. Lakshman, always a pleasure to speak with you and get some of your insights. How was T-Up this week? I mean, we've got a ton of data, of course. Last week was the big kind of employment reading across the board from private pay rolls all the way into some of the Joltz data that we had seen, even though that's lagging a little bit more. And of course, the Monthly Jobs report. What is that setup for what the Fed is also going to be tracking on pricing more broadly this week and what consumers are actually paying? Great question. And thank you for having me. Good morning. And Jobs Data, CPI data this week, Jobs Data last Friday, CPI data this week. Those are all what we would call from a cyclical kind of monitoring point of view, coincident data. And the Fed has declared for many years, it's kind of what got us into this pickle in the first place that they're going to be tracking coincident data in order to figure out what to do. And every once in a while, you'll hear that their data dependent. And that's a little bit of of a nine into that view. And so we look at the Jobs Data. It was a pretty good report on the face of it. Your year of year, Jobs Growth actually is trending down. It's about a year and a half low in the growth rate. So cyclically, we know it's direction we're going in. But the jobless rate at a half century low, three and a half percent on the face of it, that's hawkish, more hawkish Fed. It's not what they want to see at this point. They need more weakness in the labor market and they've said that in various ways. And then when you look to the CPI, coincident inflation data this week, probably too sticky, probably too hot. Our cyclical view, right, forward looking cyclical view, is that actually the peak is in, right? And a cyclical peak has already happened in inflation. We are trending down. The problem is that it's going to be very sticky. You might get some relief in the pace of goods related inflation. But the services side, where most of the spending happens, including rents, for example, very, very sticky. And as a result, I in the earlier segment, the point was made that, you know, core is going to be sticky. They're looking at core coincident inflation. So again, kind of a hawkish, you know, angle to the Fed, trying to make up for the earlier mistake of missing the inflation cycle upturn, continuing to slow the economy. So, Lakshman, you talked about where we are in the inflation cycle. What about where we are in the overall economic cycle, right? Because what we've been hearing from guests as of late is the tenor has started to shift a little bit from being pretty darn confident that it was going to be a mild recession if we get one to maybe leaning a little bit more into, well, maybe it's going to be a little bit more severe than we thought. Thanks. Excellent question. And I, this is how we edge into the realization that, yes, there's a recession. And markets are, and analysts can be kind of manic-depressive, right? So they'll be like, no, it's not happening, and all of a sudden, as it becomes more obvious that something's afoot, they can overdo it and get more extreme the other side. Our analysis is that, yes, there is going to be a recession, to be clear.",https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yvHvxXHIc5I,52,2022-10-10 17:39:22
2939," So, foot, they can overdo it and get more extreme. The other side, our analysis is that, yes, there is going to be a recession. To be clear, we will need to see job losses for there to be a recession. Also, to be clear, there have been several instances, historically, where recessions begin before job losses begin. One of the more extreme examples would be the 73, 75 recession, which was a very severe recession, which began and then jobs actually kept growing for eight months until you actually saw jobs to start negative. So, the recession itself began a little bit earlier. This is getting into the weeds about how recessions are determined. And we may be seeing some of that here because it was so hard to find the people that you needed to work, that businesses are very reluctant to let them go. Even when they're starting to see difficulty on earnings and you were saying in the earlier segment, also I was watching about how this earnings kind of recession feeling is coming in. And FedEx, for example, is just like, forget it, we can't even say anything. It's a global recession. And we don't know what's going to happen. And global recessions, to be fair, they are more severe than your kind of garden variety of recession. So, I think that's a reasonable thing to be thinking about in your scenario planning. Do you think the economy next year will start shedding jobs like you mentioned? Yes. Look, if we're right and there's a recession, and I think that we are correct here, then by definition there must be job losses. The question will be how much structurally there's a lot of issues in tightness in the labor market so that may limit it to some degree. We have seen, as I mentioned, in that inflationary kind of 70s period where the nominal numbers look pretty good, the businesses were slow to let people go. I mean, it's very, very expensive to hire someone and then let them go. You have to train them up and then you have to let them go. That's the last thing you want to do as a business manager so I understand why that is. And they're hopeful. Certainly you see all the time. There's a lot of hope in them. You use that, I was watching everything this morning. You're using the hope in more this morning. And there's a lot of this comes up in the market talk. Oh, maybe they're going to pivot. Maybe they're going to be able to sell. I don't think that's going to happen. But that kind of talk probably is keeping some of the jobs growth going too. Lachman, how does the Fed then react to all of this, right? There's the talk of pivot has faded away a little bit. Yeah. But at some point, do we see the Fed sort of quickly trying to backpedal here and fix some of the economic damage that it looks like that the policy could cause? Yeah, I mean, I think that we wrote at the beginning of the year in January, we wrote that they had a choice of two mistakes, right? Meaning that they either had to take a recession or they had to let inflation run out of control. Overleaf simplistic. And they've chosen the recession. So the intention is the pain. That is the goal. And I think Powell said as much in one of the Q&A things a week or two ago. And so will they go too far? I mean, in the sense that there'll be a recession, I think, yes. And they, I think, believe that they have the tools to counterman that at some point and ease up on the tightening. But by their own definition, they're saying that they want to see the pace of core CPI growth, depending on various measures of looking at it. Drop down. And by all the analysis and the now casting that we're hearing, this week's CPI is still going to be sticky. And we think we understand why it's probably more in the services side that it'll be sticky. But the Fed is saying if it's sticky, we're going to stay the course. And that's not what the market wants to hear. So we probably have this slower grinding. And again, you had mentioned earlier, it's tempting because prices are down to start to look for bargains, longer term bargains. But you're going to have to accept a lot of volatility, because this chapter isn't over yet. OK, so with that.",https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yvHvxXHIc5I,53,2022-10-10 17:43:40
2940," to start to look for bargains, longer term bargains, but you're going to have to accept a lot of volatility because this chapter isn't over yet. Okay, so with that in mind, and also given that you've studied previous economic cycles, we know that the markets try to price in the risk of a recession well ahead of time, but what would that bottom out period look like in relative to now, relative to the declines that we've already seen over the course of 2022, and when might we see that bottom? Hard to say magnitude wise, right? So if it's a global recession and odds are high, I think of that, it could be more severe. So the recognition of that may be mean some more downside volatility. The question of then is where else do you put your money in? It's hard to figure that out. So there's a lot of maybe this isn't the worst place even though it's going down. These bigger recessions, you could see larger retransments in equity prices than we've seen so far. So that's totally in the cards. The relationship between equities and business cycles, business cycle recessions is that they do tend to sniff out the recovery before the bottom of the recession by a few months. And I have no reason to believe this cycle wouldn't be different. Looking at other leading indicators of non equity related leading indicators, it doesn't look like the bottom is in sight yet. And so that's why we were very suspicious of the soft landing bottoming narrative that developed a few months ago. I think that the S&P was like in 3600 right around there, 3660. And it was like, that's it. We're seeing the light at the end of the tunnel. We could see across the valley. And of course, that was premature. I think we have another light down here. It sounds like that is indeed what we call a head fake. Blacksman, Atrethan, economic cycle research institute, co-founder, always good to see you. Have a good rest of the week. Nice to see you too. Thank you. All right, before we had to break, let's highlight some cautious analysis on IBM by Marcus down these Eric Woodring. Head of its October 19th earnings report, notably Woodring expects IBM to miss consensus margin estimates says Woodring. In a note, decline. We see downside two street margins and reduce our margin estimates as we expect cost pressures to persist in the 3Q. Most of those margin pressures are seen coming from IBM's consulting and infrastructure businesses. Coming up, former Fed share, Ben Bernanke is a big winner today, and we're going to be Julia's back with today's top headlines next. Thank you very much JS out of my way.",https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yvHvxXHIc5I,54,2022-10-10 17:48:34
2941," neglected Here are some of the other headlines that we are watching at this hour, at least 11 or dead and 60 injured in Ukraine this morning. After Russia launched its biggest widespread assault on the country since the start of its invasion, this comes after Vladimir Putin accused the country of attacking a critical bridge to Crimea and promised a harsh, responsive, key of where to conduct further terrorist attacks, his words on Russian territory. Ukrainian president Vladimir Zelensky says Russia wants, quote, panic and chaos, he cited attacks on the country's electrical grid and other civilian infrastructure. Former US Federal Reserve Chair Ben Bernanke and two other US economists Douglas Diamond and Philip Dibvig were recognized by the Nobel, Nobel panel at the Royal Swedish Academy of Sciences in Stockholm today. The three economists sharing the Nobel Prize for their research into the fallout from bank failures. The panel said the trio's research, quote, significantly improved the understanding of the role of banks and why avoiding bank collapses is vital. Credit Tweet shares extended their rally to a third day after Bloomberg reported that bidders are lining up for the bank's Securitized Products Unit. That's a key pillar in the downsizing of its investment banking operations. A sale of that unit could prove an additional catalyst for the bank, which recently offered to buy back up to $3 billion of its own debt. That's it. It's a busy week down in DC highlighted by the annual IMF and World Bank meetings. Yeah, we'll find it's contributor. Kevin Surley has some analysis for us on these events. Kevin, what's on your radar screen? T minus 30 days until the midterm elections. This week we're going to get two crucial debates that really could be indicative not just of what's happening in Ohio and in Georgia, but the broader country as a whole in Ohio, the late night Senate, JD Vance, the Maga Republican, challenging former Democratic Congressman Tim Ryan. Remember, he ran for president last cycle as well. This is a debate that is going to be the first of two for them leading up to the midterm elections, but let's not forget that early voting has started in multiple states. And now it is when voters are going to be paying more careful attention. And then of course down in Georgia, Rafael Warnock, the Democrat governor incumbent challenging being challenged rather by her show Walker. Now he of course has been plagued by a series of allegations that he denies a cheap among them that he advocated for his former girlfriend to have an abortion. Walker has made being anti abortion part of his platform. So this is really the first time and potentially the last time where these two politicians and the Georgia governor race will come face to face. And mind you, this comes at a time when abortion has risen to the top of the polls as to what Democrats are paying attention to. But this debate really could reverberate outside of Georgia. A lot of folks paying attention to what's going on there. Yeah, indeed. A lot of eyes on that state and the race there, Kevin. Also, we got to talk about jobs and how the recent jobs report that impacts Thursday's inflation print as well. Well, precisely, and not just what happened with the jobs report, record low unemployment rate 50 year low 3.5%. But juxtaposed with what happened with OPEC, that has many economists worried that inflation in the United States might continue to rise as consumers.",https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yvHvxXHIc5I,55,2022-10-10 17:52:17
2942," But juxtaposed with what happened with OPEC, that has many economists worried that inflation in the United States might continue to rise as consumers face more pain at the pump. But while abortion has risen to the top of issues that Democrats are paying careful attention to amongst independent voters and Republicans, it's all about the economy. And that's why the inflation report coming on Thursday, the final report ahead of the midterm elections will be so incredibly crucial and carefully watched that this is something of an economy rather that both parties that strive to seize upon. Democrats saying that there's record low unemployment, but of course Republicans looking at inflation and saying that it's a sign that we're heading even further into a recession. And then finally, you're watching the January 6th Committee and this I guess also has implications going back to the first item you're watching the midterms potentially. When can we look for the January 6th Committee's report? Nobody knows, Jules. I mean, that's what I mean, truthfully, I mean, I'll be honest, I was just talking to folks yesterday and really that's the biggest question here is, all right, now we're having another hearing. It's going to be in the afternoon. CBS News released a poll just a couple of weeks ago ahead of this hearing where they found something like 31% of folks who have been paying attention to this say that this is going to make them more likely to vote Republican 40% who are following the hearing say it's going to make them more likely to vote for Democrats. But the timing of the release of this report and the expectation here in the beltway is that this is the final hearing ahead of the midterms. That's going to be incredibly, incredibly watched if it's after the midterms, which is looking like potentially what it could be. How will that T up 2024 candidates who are looking to launch their campaigns will be watching? Kevin's really, yeah, who finances own joining us here to really discuss and break down where we're watching in the beltway and beyond. Well, Kevin, appreciate it. Anytime, thanks guys. Definitely coming up. Why are next guests says that continue to uncertainty in the UK in Europe will cause the US dollar to remain strong. We're going to discuss that next.",https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yvHvxXHIc5I,56,2022-10-10 17:56:32
2943," The strong dollar might be here to stay as war and uncertainty in Europe and the UK abroad make the USA comparatively better place to invest. This plus a spendy consumer here at home could mean inflation is set to remain higher for longer for more. Let's bring in Joseph Lewis, who is the Jeffers head of corporate hedging and FX solutions. Joe, great to have you here with us today. First and foremost, we've already heard a lot of tech companies, especially really give their insight or at least forecast into how much FX headwinds would continue to impact them. Is it going to be in par or in line with or even greater than what they anticipated? So the first things to remember about companies and how they think about foreign exchanges that it's an averaging process, right? So what you see immediately today will take some time to flow through their earnings. I think what you'll expect is that if the dollar continues to be strong, which is generally the expectation, you're going to see this show up probably Q1, Q2 next year, as the move recently has been so quick that companies haven't had the time for that to flow completely through the income statement. Look, we're telling companies that I spend most of my days doing is to give people advice around strong dollars probably here to stay. I think you summed it up correctly, which is when you think about your alternatives, the UK, Europe, Asia, the U.S. continues to make a ton of sense in terms of where people want to keep assets going forward. So Joseph, you said that your employing things are going to get worse because the dollar keeps on going up and there's a delayed effect. This is what companies do, right? They hedge currencies, whether they're going up, they're going down. This is part of their operations. As you said, you helped them do that. What is it about this current environment that is so tricky for them? Is it the speed of the move in the dollar, the persistence of it? Is there something unique about this point in time? Well, it's two parts, right? I think it's the speed. And then what you have is the persistence, right? And I think for companies, the hard part right here is companies are hedging six to 12 months out. They're managing for a year at most 18 months for the companies that are a little bit more aggressive. And so the decision to make is if I go and hedge now, go and lock in what is potentially a problem that may bounce back, right? And so the hardest part for companies right now is to really determine will this persist? And when you have this discussion back and forth about there's going to be a recession in the US which probably could mean the dollar could weaken. It's hard for companies to make decisions, right? You can take 10 economists and you've probably had two or three people on. They'll say slightly different things have slightly different forecasts. And I think that's been really challenging for my clients is sort of there is a consistency in view. And a lot of times the views have changed so rapidly, right? Six months ago the view was very different than it is today. And so, you know, it's summing up. I think it's just hard for companies to make decisions in this market when you have this much volatility. And you know, the outcome is so determined, really not by fundamentals, but really by policy. Joe, what sectors are doing a good job of hedging in this environment? Well, it's funny. I would say, you know, I wouldn't say some sectors. I think it's the size of companies that are doing better. The larger companies just have much more developed policies. They're just doing more. They've got a history of hedging. They've just been global longer. I think it's the new companies that over the last five, 10 years have seen rapid growth.",https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yvHvxXHIc5I,57,2022-10-10 18:01:05
2944," of hedging they've just been global longer. I think it's the new companies that over the last five, 10 years have seen rapid growth. That growth has been faster than their ability to put policy in place, right? So I wouldn't say it's a sector, right? I think it's, I would say companies that are seeing meteoric growth over the last 10 years are probably a little bit behind the April. The companies that have been global for 10, 20 years tend to be, tend to have policies and tend to be managing effects already. Smaller companies are also a little bit troubling, right? Because they, yeah, for them, they're still growing, right? And you kind of want to grow and then have hedges in place. So I would say, you know, companies that are big and have grown rapidly recently and smaller companies, those are the companies I probably worry the most about. And so with the size of those companies that you're really studying across and researching around, it also comes down to their employee base in all of these countries too. What role does the workforce, the employment and the wages across those different entities? What does that play as well in some of the effects considerations? Look, if you can have earnings and costs locally, that's your best outcome, right? So if I can sell my goods in a country and hire locally, that gives me costs to offset revenue. The companies that have the most issues will tend to be companies that have a lot of intellectual capital in one country and then sell goods in the other. So think about tech. Well, if all your programmers are in one country but you're selling goods globally, you don't actually have costs to offset. So companies are starting to think about that, right? How do I create natural offset? Where do I want to have my labor force, capital to offset some of my effects risk? That's the ideal situation. Most companies aren't set up that way. They tend to have what you tend to find, and you look at a tech sector, you tend to have a lot of costs in the US, for the US companies and a lot of net income overseas. And so that's always a challenge. Joe, bottom line, what do you think the magnitude of the effect of stronger dollars going to be in terms of the hit to US corporate earnings? I get the benefit, I would say, of not having to look and try to estimate that. The answer's far. That's a very hard question. Because companies man it, and when you think about the market, right? The largest companies that dominate the S&P into Dow, they have FX policies in place, right? And so I think overall, it's probably bigger than people are going to expect. And companies will come out and tell you, they'll say on a constant currency basis, we are X, but I wouldn't have an exact number, but I would say is I do probably if this persistence next year, it's probably going to be larger people expect. Good analysis here. Joseph Lewis, Jeffrey's head of corporate hedging and FX solutions. Have a good rest of the week. We'll talk to you soon. Thank you. Coming out, Netflix stands to mint money from its new ad tier servers who has some calls of the day. Coming up next week.",https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yvHvxXHIc5I,58,2022-10-10 18:05:21
2945," My Welcome back. Let's fire off a few calls on the day on this Monday morning. I'm locking in on a good note at a JP Morgan on Netflix. Another note out here explaining the potential financial windfall from an ad tear service, which Netflix is expected to launch next year. And they're correctly pointing out this. Shifted from slow to no subscriber growth in the current business to advertising and page sharing coming in 2023. You can see that in the stock price. Netflix shares of about 22% in the past three months. It's really cut fire. Overall still down 63% year-to-date. But still a lot of optimism around the financial potential of this ad service. Netflix is putting this at potential almost $3 billion by 2026 and maybe 22 million subscribers. Just in this ad service loan by 2026 next year, looking at a potential 600 million ad sales from the service. Right. A tear that they moved up in terms of the launch and saying now we're pointing out to November to actually bring the launch into market. And it's really going to be a question of when the subscribers really kind of in mass start to latch on to what that new offering could give them in terms of an experience that is lower price. Perhaps you're still going to get some ads. We know that, of course. But that's been successful for launch of even the streaming landscape years back. We think back 10 years ago, even when Hulu had some of their ad-supported tears. That's really what got some of the introductory members into these streaming services back then. And so now for Netflix, knowing that they've already really capitalized on that high end of pricing mechanisms, now it's just trying to retain and not turn as many users. And so we could see potentially some of those users downgrading the pricing at least that they're willing to pay at this point. I mean, expectations game for an X-Blic has been the roller coaster. It's been so fascinating. As you mentioned, the beginning, really people not expecting anything from the company. And now as modeling for its ad platform has leaked, we've seen the expectations really go back up again. So it's hard to see where this goes if it's really going to meet or exceed those new more sanguine estimates. Yeah, it's a big tell in that didn't exist for Netflix coming into this year. That's for sure. Yeah, they're going to have to compete as well. Disney, even looking at exploring some of their own ad-supported tears within Disney Plus, that could be a major competitor for a company that's already seen a massive subscription adoption and has quickly catapulted itself into one of the most powerful streaming services. And that's even pre a massive bundle from Disney too. Yeah. Also here, we're tracking shares of craft hines. Yeah, we're going into the kitchen and into the, well, wherever you're starting to catch up and mustard that into the pantry is perhaps after Goldman Sachs made a bullish call on the company, upgrading it to buy from neutral with a 45.",https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yvHvxXHIc5I,59,2022-10-10 18:09:53
2946," into the kitchen and into the, well, wherever you're starting to catch up and mustard's at into the pantry is perhaps after Goldman Sachs made a bullish call on the company upgrading it to buy from neutral with a $43 price target. They're saying that this is one of the consumer staples out there where higher margins profit margins. It's not fully baked in at this point. So for anybody who's looking to stock up on some catch ups or some musters perhaps graph finds is that option but there's so many other categories that that craft times has been able to really deliver for investors, especially as consumers are really monitoring where they can either buy and bulk in some cases or just get that that value that they had seen over many years and you go back to some of the household names that have the largest brand equity. We'd seen that in some of the other fashion and apparel calls out there on the street and craft times is certainly one of those right now with the largest brand equity too. Yeah we told folks. Last week when those conagren earnings numbers hit you said watch what they said on look what they said on prices they had a lot of success. Despite people becoming more mobile again pushing through price increases and that is the same theme that we are seeing in this upgrade from craft hines which is despite price increases. They're expecting all these price increases that craft took just like conagra they are likely to stick incoming quarters now that comes against a backdrop of CEO Miguel Patricio. Probably is enough credit for taking this getting this company off life support being I think he's passed his two year mark as CEO but he's out there cutting a lot of costs from this business so if you have higher prices lower costs that's a pretty good setup for profits. Yeah it seems that way investors are believing that today also. I'm taking a look at grab holdings the stock has been on the move lower down 7% right now after Barclays initiated coverage of the Asian delivery app with doubts over its long term profitability. Now it's an it's an equal weight rating here. It's a neutral waiting so it's interesting to see it taking such a hit the price target being set at $3 as you see there. And the analysis car rental costs are a substantial burden for drivers and push up fairs. The analyst does say that the company is a category leader in food delivery and ride handling in Southeast Asia with a very strong competitive position. So hence the equal weight a little bit of good little bit of bad that said grab also might be getting caught up to some extent in just the selling that we're seeing in Asian trading. But this is a company I believe it came public through us back if I'm not mistaken and the stock has not done very well since it did come public through that. Yeah you think about the ride sharing environment not just here in the US but internationally that's where grab really gets pulled into the conversation there in the markets that they operate. Where consumers right now for either the pricing that they're seeing higher or the options that are on the market in getting into micro mobility or other forms of mobility within a broader parent app if you will as uber's and lift has tried to add on some of that micro mobility element for grab it's very similar but in a market where there is much more. That's more of that micro mobility micro mobility that is actually taken advantage of by the consumers here so it's going to be how do you reach profitability while building up some of the other mobility mechanisms for consumers and knowing that you still have to make a lot of investments to retain drivers in one sense but also decrease the operating from mile costs and that's going to be a significant headwind still for all of these companies as they try to either dabble more in autonomous technology and how quickly that comes to be. And the most forward is question marks still up in the air at this point as well but for grab that is going to be something that they have to consider similarly as uber and lift do. Well I haven't bothered with this it's a $2.50 stock most people I would say watching this have never even heard a grab or taken a grab if you were that hell bent on using or investing in a ride sharing business go with uber. We just heard Brad Arickson saying uber is starting to really take market share from its largest competitor in the United States lift that might be the better way to play the space if you really want to. From one mechanism of riding and ride sharing to another one in owning a vehicle perhaps we're also watching shares of Tesla this morning after Morgan Stanley's Adam Jonas cut his price target on Tesla from $383 to $350. Warning of continued headwinds into the fourth quarter and 2023 one of the notables here the fiscal year 2023 delivery forecast cut to 1.8 million versus the 2 million previously out there saying that they believe the buy side consensus range.",https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yvHvxXHIc5I,60,2022-10-10 18:13:50
2947,". you Not a little bit of a downward push here to start the week with key earnings and inflation data on tap our next guest says investors should look to reach real estate investment trust. They haven't been immune to recent volatility, but our quote well prepared in this current environment National Association of Reeds economist John Worth joined us now John, you know I think of REITs as a group that are vulnerable when there's rising interest rate environment for a number of different reasons they tend to carry relatively high levels of debt, right? So their service and costs are higher. And they're seen as sort of because of their high dividend yields as almost a competing asset for something like treasuries as their yields are going higher. So talk us through why you think they're well positioned here. I'm absolutely happy to do it. You know, I think the view of REITs as being high leverage players is one that is a little bit out of date, frankly. What we've seen is that REIT leverage has been coming down for basically a decade. So today we've got leverage ratios near all time lows. The debt that REITs are holding is quite well termed out. They've got a weighted average term to maturity today of about seven years plus net interest expense as a share of their operating income is at all time lows. And about 85% of their debt is fixed rate. So they're really quite well positioned for a period of rising interest rates. And just as we compare them to other income generating alternatives, it's important to keep in mind that REITs provide income, but they're not fixed income. So they provide both income through their steady dividends as well as capital appreciation opportunities. And typically what we see is that in a period where you're coming out of a potential period of slow growth as we might be in about a year that we see REITs do quite well. So why would someone look at REITs versus say high growth internet at this point? Even though high growth internet is perhaps being redefined, REITs still have to compete for the same attention when investors are looking to get back into the market as they do against technology or some of the other more flashy names. Yeah, and I think it's important to think about that from a portfolio construction perspective. One of the things we see is that commercial real estate is such a fundamental piece of the overall economy. That's really critical for investors of all types. But is commercial real estate still as necessary if you have less people that are going into offices or there's more of a hybrid work approach? Is it still carrying the same weight? Absolutely. I think you really need to think about the breadth of commercial real estate. Commercial real estate, I think many investors think about it as office and retail, but it's a really much broader space. So for example, in REITs, you have data.",https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yvHvxXHIc5I,61,2022-10-10 18:20:53
2948," I think many investors think about it as office and retail, but it's a really much broader space. So, for example, in REITs, you have data centers, cell phone towers, logistics facilities. So you're getting the breadth of the economy that's housing the modern, the breadth of the real estate that's housing the modern economy. So you may feel like hybrid work is going to have people in the office less. That means you're going to have more activity through data centers, cell phone towers, logistics facilities. It reads, provide a way to grab the whole breadth of the real estate space. John, maybe I'm looking at it too simplistically here, but if we are going into recession next year, that might kick people out of their homes. Doesn't that mean some of those public storage names should do well, like they did in the Great Recession? Yeah, and I don't think public storage and the other self storage places are really going to benefit significantly from people maybe losing their homes. What we see is that that's a sector where we saw a huge bump during COVID, a huge bump in demand as people used the space they had differently. So they cleared out the guest room, they cleared out the garage and turned those into gyms and maybe school rooms in some cases. And that gave a huge bump to self storage demand. And then that that was got another dose of demand as the residential real estate market heated up as that market cools down. We may see some diminution in demand, but as whenever you have people making transitions in their lives, whether that that's moving, sending kids to school, bringing kids back into the household, what you see is that you they're using self storage as part of that. All right, you gave me a whole new reason to rewatch storage wars, national association of re-taconomists. John Worth, John, appreciate the time here today. Thanks. Coming up everyone, Black Friday deal season, it's kicking off. Wait a minute, it's October 10th, early at Target. All right, to say the least. We've got the details next. All right. All right. All right. All right. It is time for cut for time, three stories, one minute each. We start with this another controversy for you, the rapper formerly known as Kanye West.",https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yvHvxXHIc5I,62,2022-10-10 18:24:36
2949," It is time for Cut for Time, three stories, one minute each. We start with this. Another controversy for Ye, the rapper formerly known as Kanye West, faced social media restrictions over the weekend after users accused the rapper of posting anti-Semitic content leading to a block on both his Instagram and Twitter accounts. The reaction from this was interesting, that was reaction from Elon Musk and Elon of course, has been noted to say that he is going to do more post acquisition to try and let everybody back on the platform, raises a larger question of what Twitter will actually be if you still just have this cesspool of some of the harmful or derogatory statements that are coming back onto the platform from either Ye or even former President Donald Trump. Yeah, and I have a lot of questions about the companies that have just had to partner with Ye in various business ways. I mean, we saw what happened with Gap in the fallout from that. You see now Adidas is assessing its relationship with him. And I think, you know, when they're trying to tap into his creativity, his place in the zeitgeist, right? At the same time, they have to be cognizant of some of the potential disadvantages of partnering with somebody who can be very volatile. Good point. Black Friday is coming early for target shoppers. The retailer announced it's adding an additional three weeks to its Black Friday deals, extending the discount offerings of up to 50% off to seven weeks total. This is, I think, target just being target. Also, I should mention, we got some Adobe sales data out today predicting the holiday season sales rise to 1.5% and you're not great. This will be one of the most aggressive discounting seasons yet holiday seasons, according to Adobe. So there's lots of big deals out there, a lot of retailers, even target Walmart, sitting on a lot inventory. They have to move this stuff. They're going to start moving it early. I mean, if you go to that target website today, Black Friday is like plastered across the deals page. It's pretty interesting. Move over Lululemon's we made too much and here is we've got way too much over a target. And that's going to be the story for a lot of retailers over the course of this holiday season. How do they churn through inventory at a massively accelerated clip in order to get back into a decent position, come the start of 2023 as well? And for the consumer, how are they spending? Is it cash that they're willing to spend right now? Or is it, hey, let's just put it on the credit card. Let's figure that out later. It's going to be a lot better. Target gets half of my place right now. That place is just so addictive. You go in there and you just look to spend 20 bucks and you're down 150. You don't even know what you got. Tarje. Crazy. What? All right. And I don't anticipate it. It's side effect of Apple's new crash detection features come to light. The Wall Street Journal reporting several incidents of iPhone 14 users triggering 911 calls while riding roller coasters. So what's the deal here? It's that the iPhone automatically calls 911 with like an automated message. If it thinks you've gotten into a car crash, well, I guess being on a roller coaster feels like that you've gotten into a car crash. So they keep calling 911 and police keep showing up to various amusement parks around the country. Yeah. I mean, Swift responses that we're actually seeing triggered from the devices. So we know it works. It's just a question of, okay, how do you rein that in a little bit more? Because this is some of the technology that's featured not just in Apple's new iOS for their iPhones, but also within the watch itself. So if you have enough people that have those companion devices, you're going to see a lot of those errant, triggered calls to 911. Well, it says this out real time. Oh, shake it, Mike. No, I don't have an auto. I don't have a new iPhone. And no, no, I don't. But if you like fall down, I don't know how sensitive. Police are showing up to our house. Yeah. And how is the sensor different in this case versus when you're, say, running on a treadmill or doing some other activity? All good questions. All right. Coming up, Bikiko Fajita is going to speak with the latest analyst to the Airbnb, a rating this as we see stocks swamping on this Monday morning. Oh, and now really accelerated to the downside. The NASDAQ now off by 1.4% and the S&P off 8th 10th of 1%. Bikiko's gotcha company. He loves those nuts but coffee goes out this is easy for hard luck.

2950," Omega Welcome to Yahoo Finance Live. And happy Monday to all of you. It is 11 a.m. here in New York City. I'm a Kiko Fujiweta. Here's what we're watching at this hour holding pattern and inflation data and this sort of results. We're discussing fighting the Fed with all springs George Borey. Treasury Secretary Jenna L. Warren's about the economic impact from OPEC's latest production cut. Retracking to fall out as Washington Ways a response. Frank MacCurello with the American Petroleum Institute is going to be joining us this hour with his take on the oil cartels decision. And electric vehicles going solar. The CEO of German Auto Startup Sonomoto joins us later in the show to discuss his ambitions. How the car maker plans to rev up the US EV market. First though we are as always taking a look at the market action right now. 90 minutes into the trading day. We are seeing some of those losses accelerate red across the board here. But take a look at the bottom of the screen there. The NASDAQ now hitting a two year low down about 1.3%. A lot of this coming on the back of still reaction coming from the White House and the administrations very latest efforts to crack down on semi conductors or specifically crack down on Chinese ship makers. And we have seen a lot of those declines there. Take a look at that. Named video. Intel, Texas Instruments, Qualcomm, AMD, you get the picture all of them down today on the back of that extended reaction. Of course we sell the Chinese ship makers down in a big way overnight in Asia trading as well. Well there is a very busy week ahead of us for the markets. This earnings season approaches and more key economic data rolls in. And we've got our very own Yahoo finances and NAS for a to kick things off for us this hour and NAS. We're talking about earnings, economic data, certainly a lot to process in the week ahead. Yeah, that's right. A lot of data that will be watching that the markets are going to be watching. PPI that producer price index will be coming out this week. Now this is the change in price which producers receive for their services and goods.",https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yvHvxXHIc5I,64,2022-10-10 18:34:04
2951," be watching PPI that producer price index will be coming out this week. Now this is the change in price which producers receive for their services and goods. So that's expected to come in at 7.3 percent. The prior reading was 7.3. But the CPI, the consumer price index, that's the really big one on Thursday, which will be coming out. And that is expected to, on a year over year, expectation is that's 8.1 percent. The core CPI, that's excluding food and energy, that's expected to come in at 6.5 percent. Now the big thing here with this, with PPI, with CPI is that the numbers, although they may be well, for the core CPI, it's actually, that would be up from the previous one. But as far as the expectations, the numbers may not be coming down fast enough. And so if they're not coming down fast enough, then the Fed certainly has room to keep hiking. And also this week, you've got the FOMC minutes that are coming out. And that will be interesting because at Kiko, we will be able to also see if there's any discussion in those minutes about the size of the rate increases. If at any point, the Fed is considering to sort of put a little bit of a break on those rate increases. Yeah, and the income's at a time, obviously, where there's a debate about weather. In fact, the Fed needs to pause a bit because they've been moving so quickly. Is it going to be 50 basis points? Is it going to be 75 come November? And of course, the administration's watching it closely. One more FOMC meeting before the midterm. So a lot to digest there on that front. And as thanks so much for that. Well, US Treasury Secretary Jenner Yellen is warning about the impact OPEC's oil production cut will have on the global economy. Telling the financial times, the decision is in her words unhelpful and unwise. Of course, reinforcing the Biden administration's criticism over this move as questions arise on the repercussions that lie ahead. Let's bring in Frank McEarrula. He is API senior vice president of policy, economics, and regulatory affairs. Frank, it's good to talk to you today. We have heard several officials from the administration push back against OPEC's decision from last week. The White House saying it was short-sighted, saying that they will, in fact, respond moving forward, what is that decision meant for US oil producers? Sure. Thanks for having me on. Look, first off, it's a reminder, again, of how important it is to produce energy here in the United States and not have to rely on foreign countries like the OPEC plus nations for our energy. We have the capacity to continue to strengthen our energy security by tapping into the resources we have right here at home. And the more we do that, the less we're reliant and driven by decisions that are made somewhere else. And we did hear your president and CEO Mike Summers put out a statement on the back of that OPEC decision last week saying specifically, we urge the administration to adopt sound public policy that enables American energy to benefit Americans. What specifically does that sound policy look like? Sure. At API, we released a plan called the 10-22 that would open up federal lands and waters for oil and gas production. The Biden administration at the outset of their term closed new leasing for oil and gas development. So we would propose to open it up and continue to produce more here in the United States. The plan also calls for more energy infrastructure. The Biden administration canceled critical pipeline projects. We think the process for permitting of pipeline projects needs to be reformed so we can get energy from where it's produced to where it's needed. We also call on the plan to lift the barriers that are created by tariffs. We know that there is a supply chain issue currently in being able to produce more energy. And so we need to knock those barriers down. Finally, we think it's important to expedite LNG exports. The administration has made a commitment to Europe to export natural gas to provide relief from their reliance on Putin's net.",https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yvHvxXHIc5I,65,2022-10-10 18:38:00
2952," the D.I.L.N.G. exports. The administration has made a commitment to Europe to export natural gas to provide relief from their reliance on Putin's natural gas. And so we think we need a strong policy that expedites LNG exports. And how quickly would you be able to move on that, specifically on LNG? Well, we're urging Congress and the administration to act quickly on all components of this plan. I think on LNG, it's really a question of a commitment from the government to expedite applications, a commitment from Europe to build down the necessary infrastructure to take the natural gas into its countries. But there is a commitment there on both sides. And so what we need is an acceleration of that. The oil and gas industry stands ready to help. There is another, I am, a legislation that's been floating around for some time. And this is no pack, specifically stands for no oil producing and exporting cartels act. This would essentially empower the Justice Department to go after OPEC under anti-trust rules if they are seen as setting or at least trying to attempt to control the price of oil. The Biden administration, at least in their statement, seems to suggest they want to revisit that. But I know API has specifically been very opposed to this idea. Why? This policy has been opposed on both sides of the aisle and from administrations in both parties. The real way to get OPEC is to produce more energy here in the United States. And the way to do that is to lift the pause that the administration has had on leasing. Look, at this point in the Obama administration, they had issued 60 leases for oil and gas development. This point in the Biden administration, they're just at six. And so if the administration wants to get serious about energy security and energy independence, it needs to look right here at home. And it needs to provide a pathway for more energy production here in the United States. Finally, Frank, you sort of alluded to the need for more exports coming out of the US at a time when there are concerns about supply globally. You have put out a letter here saying that any kind of export ban we're talking about diesel, but also refined products would deplete inventory levels and it would put upward pressure on consumer fuel prices. Of course, the administration argument would be, we'll at a time when there was concerns about supply crunch, that supply should be left domestically. So walk me through your calculation. Why does this deplete supply in your opinion? And why would that push prices higher? Sure, it's not our opinion in July of this year, the American Council for Capital Formation studied this issue. They found that an export ban on refined product would end up cutting refinery capacity by 1.3 million barrels per day here in the United States. It would end up raising costs for fuel for consumers across the United States. It would cost jobs, about 85,000 jobs would be lost under such a policy. And finally, it would harm American GDP. And so for all of those reasons and for American energy security, the refined export product ban is a bad idea. Finally, this administration has made a commitment to our allies overseas, to other countries that we support, to Latin America, where we export an enormous amount of refined product. It's made a commitment to those allies that we're gonna continue to provide the energy that we have right here in the United States. I see no reason why the administration should turn its back on that commitment. And it would certainly, imposing such a policy would certainly not help the American consumer. And where are those conversations stand right now with the administration? I know there's been a bit of a back and forth. Oftentimes it has been reported as being a little more contentious. In terms of specifically an export ban, what's your understanding of where the administration stands? Well, we've made the case. We've laid out the data that shows that such a policy would have negative implications for the American people for the driving public. I think the administration understands that. I think they understand that these are global products that require global markets. I think they also understand that the United...",https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yvHvxXHIc5I,66,2022-10-10 18:42:21
2953," I think the administration understands that. I think they understand that these are global products that require global markets. I think they also understand that the United States has world-class leading refineries and they produce the fuels that the world needs. And so we're hopeful that the administration steps back from considerations of export ban, whether it's crude oil, refined product, or LNG. Frankly, looks toward American energy production as the solution. And we've set all along the solution to the challenges that we face, actually lie under our feet. Because of innovation and technology, we've increased production here in the United States from seven million barrels to 12 million barrels per day. We can do more, but we need the policies in place to help us achieve that. Frank MacIarola, API Senior Vice President of Policy Economics and Regulatory Affairs, I appreciate your time today. Sure, thank you. Well, time now for our trending ticker. We are seeing shares of Rivian in reverse. Getting punished after the company were called nearly all of its electric vehicles. You see that's stocked down more than 10%. The announcement affects more than 12,000 vehicles, including the Rivian R1T pickup, as well as the R1S SUV and some delivery vans that have been produced for Amazon. The carmaker says no injuries have been reported so far, but there are concerns about a fastener that wasn't tightened properly that could affect driver's ability to steer the vehicle. Rivian says the fixes will be implemented over the next 30 days. And stay tuned later in the show because we will be speaking with Sonno Motors, co-founder and CEO Lauren Hahn, live from the NASDAQ Market site, the group kicks off its nationwide solar mobility tour to debut at the Affordable Solar EV for the first time in the U.S. That is coming up a little later in just an hour.",https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yvHvxXHIc5I,67,2022-10-10 18:47:04
2954," We are on the cusp of yet another earning season and markets are turning to JP Morgan, the city, Wells Fargo and Morgan Stanley as they report during the most uncertain of economic environments for preview of what to expect. Let's bring in Yahoo finances, Alexandra Seminova. These are always, it's always a good bell leather, right? About where things are in terms of the economy, as we said, never been more uncertain. Yeah, absolutely, Akiko. Those four bangs among the six largest in the U.S. by assets are set to be the opening act of the earnings season with Goldman Sachs and Bank of America set to release results next week and some of the themes that we'll be watching closely are a slowdown in investment banking revenues, potential alias across their businesses, how demand for loans is holding up with higher interest rates, and any potential warnings about the economy that CEOs may deliver on earnings calls. And this quarter profits are expected to shrink, especially compared to a really robust 2021 for Wall Street. Profits are also likely to take a hit from higher loan loss provisions. Those are funds that aside by banks for any potential sour loans if customers don't make their payments. The six largest U.S. banks are estimated to set aside a collective $4.5 billion this quarter that's according to a financial time's report today. And this is also a turnaround from a year ago when banks actually benefited from releasing those reserves as we were recovering from the pandemic. One notable thing to note too is that banks typically benefit from higher interest rate environments. Those often give them a nice boost on their net interest income, but investment banking revenue is likely to offset that and some other things to look out for too are any comments that bank executives make. Jamie Diamond is always an interesting one on his earnings calls with his storm cloud warnings, credit suites and the broad, what that means for the broader industry, and also a bank of American Morgan Stanley are estimated to lose a combined $500 million on Elon Musk's Twitter deal. You know worth noting the bar pretty low going into earnings season, not just within banks, but overall. Thanks so much for that. I know you're going to be tracking those results really closely. Moving on here as we look ahead to there you go. There's the prompt. It looks like a wider look on market, CD Ameritrade, out with its investor movement index showing traders took a more risk off approach in September for more about what these results mean and what's driving the trends. Let's bring in Sean Cruz, TD Ameritrade, head trading strategist. Sean, these notes are always really interesting to me, a very good gauge of where the retail investor stands feels like it's pretty much tracking with the rest of the market. Things just aren't feeling very good. Yeah, I think right now we got a little bit of a head fake back in August. There was actually recovery for the first time this year. We actually had that investor movement index tick higher. And I think that quickly got wiped off the table in September. So what we did see in what clients were buying, they were certainly being a little bit more conservative and that they weren't going out there buying some of the more speculative areas of the market, some of the more speculative names that maybe aren't profitable right now or just have some very high multiples. They're not really reaching for those right now. They're going back to some of the more familiar established names out there. In some cases really looking at names with quality fundamentals, be that solid revenues, solid cash flow, healthy balance sheets, leverage was another thing that they certainly have been a little bit wary of as we're starting to see rates tick higher and higher that is going to impact some of those more highly levered companies versus the more fundamentally sound companies. So they still found some opportunities out there, but they certainly are a little bit cautious right now. And I think that makes sense. And we're going to get to some of those names we just showed on the screen there, but probably speaking, what has led to the sell-off that you have seen exiting of positions? Is it really just about the Fed? I think that really was what drove that optimism in August and that light at the end of the tunnel from the Fed, Pausian or potentially even reverse and some of those rate hikes gave it drove a lot of optimism, but like I said, that light the end of the tunnel ended up being a train coming your way instead. And that really...",https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yvHvxXHIc5I,68,2022-10-10 18:51:04
2955," or potentially even reversing some of those rate hikes gave it. Drove a lot of optimism, but like I said, that light the end of tunnel end up being a train coming your way instead. And that really drove that shift in sentiment in that not only were we getting some data that did indicate they haven't made significant progress, they are starting to have an effect, look at housing, for instance. But the Fed kept coming out. Whenever the market would give a little bit of a pop of optimism, you would almost have a Fed speaker, someone somewhere come out and say, look, we're not stopping. This is something we are committed to. I think they're coming around to that notion. And that's why we're trading down at these levels. I think the market's going to respond differently to maybe a hawkish Fed when we're trading at 3,600 on the S&P 500 versus say trading up at 4,000 or 4,200. So I do think a lot of that is now priced in. If things get significantly worse and that's why we just spoke about the bank earnings, that is going to be huge. The macro read through on what we hear from the banks, I think is really going to set the tone for the rest of earnings seasons. And I think the market is also going to change their macro outlook based on what we hear. So let's talk about some of those names that we have seen big moves in. In terms of net buyers, we're seeing a lot of the chip makers. You could argue that's part of evaluation play given just how far some of these names have pulled back, but in terms of those that are being sold. Exxon, mobile and BP, an interesting one to me because energy has been pretty strong is this sort of the expectation that we have reached the peak with some of these names and the pullback is coming? That is where we see that type of activity. I don't think anyone expects crude oil to completely fall apart anytime soon. But I do think they're looking at it from a little bit more of a valuation standpoint. And we've seen that where you get these energy companies trading towards the bottom of their range. That's where there's a lot of interest in buying. When they recover and they start hitting towards the upper end of those ranges, that's where they rotate out of those. So I think it's an interesting strategy. It's more of a short term strategy. I think we see playing out, but they use those profits when they do decide to roll out and lower exposure in those names. We actually do see them going out there and trying to find opportunity elsewhere. And I, some of the conductors last month, was that that key spot. I think we saw a lot of interest on the buy side. Certainly today, I think caught a lot of people off guard. If you look at the semiconductors that are really getting hit, it's the semiconductor companies that really have a lot of exposure to that relationship with China and just what goes on the onshore offshore aspect of their supply chains. But I think what they were looking at, if you look at the charts, AMD, NVIDIA, Intel, all those names were hitting the support levels. And when you see these support levels, these ranges, they start to approach the lower end. That's where you get a lot of buy and activity. I'm going to venture, guess we look at this again next month. We're going to see a lot of selling as they broke through some of those. I was going to say, I wonder if some of that buying holds, especially as we get these warnings about demand, especially from a lot of these big chip makers, TSMC and other one, we're expected to hear from this week. Sean Cruz, a TD Ameritrade, head trading strategist. Thanks so much for joining us today.

Joining us now is Richard Clark, managing director at A.B. Bernstein. Richard, there's a number of things that you highlight here, but really the point being that this isn't just about Airbnb being able to protect its market share and the vacation rental business, you think they could really make a significant play on hotels and experiences as well. Walk me through that thesis. Yeah, I mean, I think that's absolutely right. So I think the vacation rental market is still very exciting. I think it's a big market. It's going to gain share of the overall lodging market. And Airbnb will think we'll gain share within that. But probably beyond that, even more exciting, is that ability to sell more than just vacation rental market. It doesn't market as much as other travel platforms. So it has a loyal customer following. Has a very strong brand. Do we think they can sell longer stays, hotel rooms, experiences, and they can add to its growth? The longer stays have been a real growth spot for Airbnb, something they've been highlighting especially over the course of the pandemic. The hotels specifically, where do you see them making a play when you look at how fragmented the market is right now? Yeah, so I mean, I think actually the hotel market is fragmented. The distribution market is not that fragmented. You've got booking and expedia. They're quite dominant in their respective geographies. So I think the actual hotels are looking for other distribution channels to broaden their landscape a little bit. And I think Airbnb is unique in the sense that it does try and inspire the customer. It's got this category-based search. It tries to find a way to match the customer and the product up in the way that we don't see in other companies. I think that gives it a way to make a play in hotels. So you see the platform revolving into a place where hotels can also list their openings? Well, they're already on. I mean, there are already tens of thousands of hotels listed on Airbnb, or hotels in it. They signed a deal with Sightminder. They signed a deal with OU. And that gave them somewhere around 70 to 80,000 hotels.",https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yvHvxXHIc5I,70,2022-10-10 19:00:55
2957," you you you you triple refesions And as we see how that translates in terms of volatility, we see that the VIX above 30 here, signaling that some of the signs of a possible recession, certainly not helped today by JP Morgan Chase, CEO, Jamie Diamond, warning of a likely recession in the next six to nine months. Taking a look at what we're seeing in the sector action. We're seeing travel stocks under pressure, and that's as China reimposed COVID-19 lockdown with new daily cases tripling over the week long holiday and right before a key government meeting in Beijing next week. You can see some of the ones most under pressure. There you have trip.com. That's up. That's down about almost 6% there. And same with when they're down almost 12%. Also want to take a look at what we're seeing with the broader sector action here. As we can see, some of these mega caps under pressure, but as you break it down by sector here, we're seeing that in terms of the big winners of the day that are at least pulling ahead for now, we're seeing consumer staples in the green. Those are up about half a percent. Energy though, they're down about 2%. Sure, no? Michelle, let's take a look at the tech sector. You were just mentioning some of the underperformers there, specifically what we're seeing in energy. XlK, the technology sector not too far behind on an interday basis off just around one and a half percent. You're today clearly under pressure. As we've seen selling across almost every aspect of this industry here, you're today XlK off just around 31%. The S&P tech sector lagging the broader index by the most since 2002, that is on a year-to-date basis. Take a look at some of the individual movers within the XlK why we're seeing such losses today. A lot of that has to do with the selling that we're actually seeing in the chip stocks and take a look at the screen. You're really seeing a broad base selling here in video, Qualcomm, AMD among the worst performers in this group, Intel, AMD, Nvidia, all hitting 52 week low. So the selling that we saw all started at the end of last week continuing into today. I guess you can say that the selling has been happening since the start of the year. But we got that warning from AMD last week in terms of the third quarter revenue guidance that way on the broader chip index, the new restrict.",https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yvHvxXHIc5I,71,2022-10-10 19:03:55
2958," that the selling has been since the start of the year. But we got that warning from AMD last week in terms of the third quarter revenue guidance that way on the broader chip index, the new restrictions imposed from the Biden administration in terms of exports to China. That's a headwind here for this group heading into the fourth quarter and then into 2023. So big reason why we are seeing that selling and then I also want to pull up the Philly Semiconductor Index. You look at some of the movements that we're seeing today the Philly Semiconductor Index on the last quarter of the year. So we're seeing that just around 3% year to date off more than 40% you see that drop of just around 42% the lowest level today that we've seen since November 2020 also on track for that two day drop. If we take a look at the two day chart here off just around 9% that would be the largest two day drop date that we have seen since March of 2020. Wow. Shana. Thank you. Let's get up to speed now on the situation in the past. Last week, we were launching 84 cruise missiles on Monday along with drone attacks as well. At least 11 people were killed and powered knocked out in several regions of Ukraine. Vladimir Putin says the attacks were in retaliation for that apparent Ukrainian attack on a key supply bridge over the weekend. Ukraine is not claimed credit. President Biden condemned the quote utterly brutality of Putin's illegal war and also says that the country will continue to impose costs on Russia for its aggression. Not entirely clear of course what those costs will be. Michelle. Indeed, we're certainly a lot there for markets to digest. Let's take a look at that market reaction and we turn to Liz Young. So vice head of investment strategy. Liz, obviously the markets have a lot of information to digest and they're wondering how the Fed is going to interact to these different data points and what the Fed is going to do. Investor sentiment is pretty extended on the bearish side and it seems difficult to find really a lot of positivity in that and you can look at that a couple different ways. You can look at it as there isn't much to grasp on to as far as looking forward and getting positive about a soft landing or you can say that when things get this extreme on the bearish side we're getting closer and closer to that being over. Now what we're still looking at is that the Fed is going to be a lot more than just a few years. So what you've clearly pointed out is that there are a ton of data points rolling in many of which are telling us that the economy is softening things are slowing but it still hasn't been enough to fight that big enemy which is inflation. So it keeps the Fed on this path. The jobs numbers from last week keep the Fed on this path and that's what the market is really grappling with. What do you think has been accounted for? So if you look at just the movement in what the market expects the terminal rate to be so the rate at which the Fed will stop hiking and either pause or have to eventually cut that rate has actually moved up or that expectation has moved up just even in the last week we're looking at about 4.7% terminal rate as expected by the market by March of next year. So you could assume that that's sort of what's priced in but you're still looking at the expectation of a recession still only about 50 50 and with a market that's been down at most 25% peak to trough this year it would tell me that we still have further to go on the downside to really price in a recession and that could be what we see through October as we start to get earnings information if companies start to revise down and as economic data continues to soften we could get closer and closer to that 30% 35% down which would effectively price in the recession in my opinion. Speaking of Richell mentioned off the top the prediction from Jamie Diamond 6 to 9 months before we're tip into a recession that Europe is already there and that our markets could have another 20% to follow your thoughts on the latest comments from Jamie. So look it's not necessarily new that he's said that he's worried about economic growth so it's not the first time that he's mentioned this but it's definitely possible and you know even 6 to 9 months seems a little far out to me I think that if we do see a recession or the beginning of one that it'll happen in the first half of 2023 as far as another 20% down in the market that feels like a lot to me and look where a Caulie savings of $10330 based bring on от the balls noticed",https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yvHvxXHIc5I,72,2022-10-10 19:09:09
2959," or the beginning of one that it'll happen in the first half of 2023. As far as another 20% down in the market, that feels like a lot to me and look, nobody really knows how much further it could go and where the stopping point is, but 20% more does feel like a lot to me. And if you just think about on average to price in a recession or a drawdown during a recession, you do have to get beyond 30%. And we haven't quite gotten there yet. So at this point, the market is still sort of hoping that we can avert one. I don't know that we need to go down another 20%. I feel like 3,300 on the S&P is a pretty good stopping point, if not beyond where we might stop. But again, who knows what the future holds. There's a lot of different things that could happen. And one of the things that I think investors should really be watching is credit spreads. There hasn't been a huge blowout in spreads. They've widened, but in a really orderly fashion so far, if credit spreads start to become more troublesome and get to a level where we're worried about defaults, particularly in the corporate market or in consumer lending, that's when you have to start assuming that the stock market will go down much further. So then Liz, given those factors, then, a lot of investors, especially retail investors, one ring, should I hold onto my cash, is that the safer bet versus say other opportunities? What are you seeing in terms of opportunities? Say, what's the play here? Short term versus longer term. So in the short term look, it's not a bad idea to hold onto your cash if you're nervous, but here's what I would say. We've already done a lot of work on the valuation side. So we've done a lot of re-rating in stocks. Like I said before, we've gone down at one point from peak to trough 25% in the S&P. So if things continue to fall, it's okay to start thinking about buying that incrementally on the way down. And you can look at, many people are talking about a barbell approach. I do think that that's a good approach. So on one end of the barbell, you've got safety stocks, which are pretty expensive right now, and I would keep that in mind. You can also think about putting things in there like gold. You can think about using treasuries at this level. And then on the other end of the barbell, look at some of those growthier names or some of those cyclical sectors that are probably trading at pretty attractive valuations compared to where they were a year and a half, two years ago. So thinking about just entering into those names systematically, don't spend it all at once, but systematically as we go down and always remember the market bottoms before the economy bottoms. So by the time the market is done with its down draft, the economy still has to follow. And by the time the economy bottoms, the market usually has started to recover. Well, Liz, what you're saying right now about those growthier, more cyclical names, brings me to tech and the selling that we're seeing today. Really what we've seen since the start of the year, clearly we have seen a large drop in valuations is selling that we're seeing today. They'll bring the Nasdaq to its lowest level that we've seen in more than two years. I guess what do you think it's going to take to get investors back on board or if they are picking some of those growthier names, those cyclical plays, what should more specifically should they be looking for? So one of the things that you covered earlier in the show was semiconductors. And what I would say to people about that, it's important to think about this. The way that the economy has changed and the things that the U.S. economy is now dependent on are much more technology focused. So semiconductors have really taken over as one of those cyclical indicators in the tech space. So on a day where we're having increased recession fear and we're still worried about the fed raising rates too far and putting us into a recession, it is probably not any surprise that semiconductors are under a lot of pressure because they are that cyclical indicator for tech. Now as they continue to get hurt and as we see recession fears heat up, as the market prices that in, that's when those names start to become attractive. So I would still be waiting a little bit and maybe even beyond when the S&P gets lower than 3,500 if that's the case, but that's when you start to nibble on some of those names. But you want to be choosy about it and make sure that you've diversified your portfolio still outside of tech because rates are going to stay high for quite a period of time here until inflation is under control, which means that technology, communications and even some consumer discretionary names could have a lid on their upside because of that rate hike. But you can start to enter back into what I would call the sort of cream of the crop in each of those groups. Um, right?",https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yvHvxXHIc5I,73,2022-10-10 19:13:05

Well, one of the major railroad unions has rejected the proposed deal with freight railroads renewing the possibility of a strike. About 56% of the members of the Brotherhood of Maintenance of Way Employees Division rejected the deal, which includes 24% raises and $5,000 in bonuses. The union president saying the railroaders do not feel valued. For now, the union has agreed to delay any strike until five days after Congress reconvenes in mid-November to allow time for additional negotiations. All right, we'll say with us, we're just getting started here on Yahoo Finance Life. Coming up, automakers are getting hit hard on Wall Street following a major recall from the Rivian and a pessimistic analyst take on GM and Ford will have those details. And Kanye West's Twitter account was locked after he tweeted anti-Semitic comments. It begs the question, would that be the case if Elon Musk owns Twitter? We'll ask a long time tech investor about that. And Hulu may have just gotten a little more expensive for subscribers. We'll give you those numbers. Don't go anywhere. Rivian shares a sinking today. You can see the stock off just around 7% after voluntarily, recalling more than 12,000 vehicles over concerns of a possible steering and suspension hazard. Yahoo Finance, a senior auto reporter, Prestige Vermine, is here with more on this press. Looking at the stock reaction, Wall Street obviously very concerned about this recall.

2961," What's your take on it? It's just not a good look right now when they have this critical Q4 coming up. They've got to meet these deliveries and hit that goal of 25,000 cars a year. You know, it's a simple issue. It's a tiny bolt on an arm in front of the steering knuckle. But if it fails, it's a catastrophic steering failure. Right? So they have to do this. Safety is an utmost concern. It's good they're doing this now. But it's just sort of, you know, as one analyst, it's a black eye for them. Right? As like there's credibility issues already on the table for them. And now you have this on top of their big goal in Q4. So I think it's kind of like, you know, you see the analyst, the chart. It's just a concern there right now for them to perform. It reads like a bit of an overreaction based on the fact there are no deaths, no real serious accidents, a very small incident number as well. This is a proactive company really getting ahead of it. I want to ask you about Tesla as well, some massive numbers out of China breaking a record. And the flip side, huge numbers out of China, the Giga Shanghai 83,000 vehicles, delivered to biggest month ever. This after they sort of did these upgrades that Shanghai fac of facility over the summer, they shut down for a bit and now they're really pumping out cars there. Tesla and the latest quarter said that they can produce around 750,000 vehicles per year there now. That's like, that's the biggest factory. So huge install based right now in Giga Shanghai. Now we just got to couch that. There are new lockdowns already underway in China, not where the Tesla factory is yet, but their caseload tripled after the weekend. So new lockdowns in China could eventually impact Tesla as well. Rochelle. And, Pros, stick around because I want to turn out a Ford and GM. We saw a UBS analyst Patrick Hummel downgrading both stocks, citing an expected we can demand thanks to inflationary pressures, as well as some of these supply constraints we continue to hear about. Now, Hummel predicts, quote, that it will take three to six months for the auto industry to end up in oversupply. So, Pros, what's your reaction to this? Does it seem like one step forward, two steps back for some of these auto makers right now? It's, you know, it's a little surprising even the last two and a half years we've seen the supply be the problem for the auto makers. They were able to command huge margins, extreme pricing power because of the fact they didn't have enough supply. And now we're talking about demand actually turning down and the supply becoming a problem when you have more cars than that actually needed for the market, probably by I think the analyst saying next year. So, I'm not assuming they thought that Ford was actually in a worse place in GM because of their product portfolio and stuff like supply chain. So, I'm curious what you guys think about that. Yeah, I mean, it's interesting. I just think it's just in terms of the demand destruction, projection part of it, the fact that it's falling apart and falling apart so quickly, I think that caught me a little bit off guard. Yes, we talked about the fact that the economy is weakening. People are going to be pulling back on spending, but I didn't necessarily, I guess, expected to be to that degree so quickly. So, that's something that jumped out to me. And then also just in terms of what he does like, you be saying that they favor automakers with a luxury exposure, one of them being Mercedes just given the fact that more the higher end to consumers could potentially be more resilient if we do say a large economic downturn. Yeah, I just, it is shocking the U-turn. Yeah. It was just a couple of weeks ago that Ford told us 40, 45,000 cars did not have the parts and they'd have to park them until, and now we're talking about again, oversupply in the next three to six months, it is hard to imagine as going into a world where that is a situation. Dealers across the country, as you know, pros, are wiped out. They are still empty. So dramatic turnaround like that, I can't quite imagine. But apparently they're seeing it. We've seen it only in the used car sector. Car max got hit hard at earnings. The new car segment we haven't seen, demand destruction yet. Because there hasn't been supply. But really interesting point about the luxury demand side, because we write a lot about that. How it's insatiable demand, Rolls Royce, Bentley, Mercedes, those types of names. They can't find enough buyers, I mean, they can't find enough cars for their buyers. And on the, on the flip side, Ford and GM potentially, this analyst thinks that there's a problem for them because there's, these buyers are less able to weather the storm. I like potential downturn. But I guess the measure is interesting because of coming out at a time when we're still talking about the supply chain issues that a lot of these larger automakers make. Yes. So how is that going to be corrected so quickly that then would leave to this oversupply when we haven't been able to get our, get a better grasp of this now for over two years? I really can't see this being a prompt for this back half of next year. If you really think about it, I think that's what the analyst is kind of saying. But he's kind of putting his mark on the table right now. Ford, it said Ford.",https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yvHvxXHIc5I,75,2022-10-10 19:21:43
2962," can't see this being a problem with the back half of next year if you really think about it. I think that's what the analyst is kind of saying but he's kind of putting his mark on the table right now like Ford. He said Ford we see absolute downside for Ford. That's a direct quote. I mean that's crazy. Right now they have very very strong pricing power. I don't know maybe EBS will have the last laugh on this one. It certainly looks like Wall Street is worried about the downgrade here with Ford chairs. Sink you to air. Press. Thanks so much for that. Coming up Amazon's two-day prime early access sale.

2963," started it as their greatest prime day ever, point blank. So we'll see if they can replicate that magic in a really difficult economic environment where they have more competition, right? Amazon's leading the charge, but we've seen Target, Walmart, Best Buy, you name it, everyone's got a sale going on this month. So to that end, look for some really deep discounts. Amid the inflation squeeze, companies are doing whatever it takes to get you to buy something. And for Amazon, what that means is, yes, the Amazon, the viral Amazon code from a couple years ago has returned, but it also means connected devices are going to be the star. They just had their devices and services event. And if there's one thing you're going to see, is you're going to see the Echo, Ring, Fire TV. Those are all going to be deeply, deeply discounted. If there's one thing I've learned covering Amazon, Rochelle, those devices are key to their future. They see it as key to their future and they haven't been immune to this tech route. So it makes sense that they will be pushing these connected devices at one of their most important events of the year. That certainly makes sense, getting everyone deeper into the ecosystem indeed.

So I guess tomorrow is kind of like Black Friday on a Tuesday in early October. It's a little confusing. How much does this change everything these October sales in terms of traditional holiday sales? Well, we've been seeing this for a few years, right? Like the Black Friday, the holiday sales keep getting moved early and earlier. And that's because consumers are demanding it. They want to spread out their shopping over a longer period of time. It used to be a day after Thanksgiving through Cyber Mondays. You know, you've got about five days of deals. Now you've got a couple of months of deals. So I think we're responding to consumer demand. I think it's also really smart for a lot of these retailers, Ali mentioned it's not just Amazon, but it's Target, Walmart. You've got some of the department stores, Maysees, Coles, Bed Bath and Beyond. They're all doing this because what research and which surveys have shown is that consumers are getting a little more anxious about inflation. They feel okay about their job position. Unemployment is still very historically low, but as the year goes on, something consumers are looking at. So why not get your holiday shopping out of the way now? What does it mean for shopping later? I think it just spreads out a little more. You might actually have a chance to get more money out of consumers, but I think by front loading it, it's a very smart thing. And I think those that are, there's always got your late shoppers. There will still be people shopping throughout the rest of the year, but I think it's smart to start it earlier this year. Yeah, you're talking about me and Shana Smith. I'm usually December 23rd-ish. I'm still waking up in a pumpkin spice latte, which was like two months ago. Axios has a story today saying the traditional holiday shopping season is dead. Is that true? I don't know about that. Some people really like to do it just as an activity with their family to go in person the day after Thanksgiving. But yeah, it's certainly taking a big hit here, right? And like I said, this has been a trend that's been ongoing the last few years, but as far as the shopping online is still continuing to pick up in popularity, it doesn't mean people aren't gonna be spending, right? National Retail Federation with their holiday forecast and survey show that yeah, two-thirds of people are still gonna spend on gifts, on celebrations this year. They feel like they haven't been able to do as much the last couple of years because of COVID restrictions. So whether it means taking out of savings or redirecting money that would otherwise go somewhere else or even going into credit card debt, they will be spending money this holiday season now that we're kind of getting back to normal. The story of this retail year has been an inventory issue too much of it. Is that still the case? And is there anyone that got it right? Yeah, you know, we went into this saying, the bigger sophisticated retailers like your target, like your Walmart, they set up for last holiday season, we thought they were gonna get it right, they weren't new to this. Clearly they didn't, there was loads.",https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yvHvxXHIc5I,77,2022-10-10 19:30:19
2964," like your target, like your Wal-Mart, they set up for last holiday season. We thought they were gonna get it right. They weren't new to this. Clearly they didn't. There was loads of inventory on the shelves for many of those big retailers. I think we've had over a year now to get it right. So I think retailers setting into this holiday season are certainly in a better position. So that's not as much of a concern this year. And so I think that that's one thing we don't necessarily have to worry about. Costs are still very high, right? So we're talking a little about Amazon here. Despite the fact that this is probably gonna be a great prime event. The costs over the last few quarters have been eating into those revenues. So that's something we're gonna look out for as well. Is this a positive story, though? Will it be for the holiday season? This bulk and inventory should result in discount. Should be a deflationary and even a positive fed story, although not a great earning story. Yeah, like Ali said, it's anything to push the inventory and to give deep discounts. So it is a complex situation where you've got higher costs. Inflation is creating higher costs for everything, right? But the consumer really wants value right now. So you have to be offering discounts. And some of the ones that we've seen already as advertised from target from Amazon. We're talking 50 to 80% off of some of the most popular items. So they're actually willing to take a hit in some ways just to get to the consumer who really is looking for the deepest discounts possible right now. So promotions are going to be huge and pushing out some of that extra inventory. It's not a great investor story, but it is a good consumer story. I want to come full circle back to the story we started with where online sales rising just 2.5%. But the brick and mortar stories, the real fascinating one, more stores opened in 21 than closed for the first time since 1995, according to Morgan Stanley, what is the deal with brick and mortar making a comeback? You know, I think people miss that. They miss the brick and mortar. We've seen, like you said, e-commerce sales have come down since the peak of COVID where they were really at their highest. So I think you're going to see more of a blend this year, whereas the story that lasts like 10 years for holiday shopping has been that e-commerce. It's continuing to pick up. But I think again, it's more of an activity. It's something to do together with friends with family. And so people like going out there. They like looking at the items they're buying. And honestly, retailers like that too, because there's less things getting returned. And that's what we're seeing a third of things bought online and up getting returned because you really haven't had a chance to see and experience it. So if they can get you to buy and brick and mortar, retailers are going to be pretty happy about that. Reports of brick and mortar's death greatly exaggerated. Wall Street Horizon, VP of Research, Christine Short. Good to see you. Thanks. All right, coming up. It's been a roller coaster of a day for big tech. But it's been smooth sailing for Netflix.

2965," I'm women women women women women wearing a dress before the insurance school bus tracks onusal reimagining earlier. All right, it's time for triple play with three stocks that we're watching in the final 30 minutes of trading. We've got five, nine, craft and Netflix on deck. Now my pick is Cloud Software Provider 5.9 to get FIVN. You see the stock down more than 24 percent there. Now the share started falling after CEO Rowan Trollup announced his resignation. Now he'll be leaving at the end of November and in a tweet, Trollup said, quote, he'd accepted a position as CEO of Avenger Backed pre-IPO startup I remain very bullish about the opportunity at 5.9. Investors though digesting this change against the backdrop of better than expected preliminary third quarter financial results. Up chairman and former 5.9 CEO Mike Berkland is coming back to the role. That's after resigning in 2017 due to a cancer diagnosis. The stock did hit a 52 week low on this leadership change announcement. But Berkland said he's excited about the path forward. Saying, quote, we are still in the early innings of the shift to cloud driven by key trends such as digital transformation and the strategic importance of customer experience. Now most analysts do still have a buy rating on the stock. So there's still some bullishness here, but at least just for today on the leadership change, the stock under a lot of pressure. Show them. If I shall, nearly 25 percent, you mentioned hitting a 52 week low today, even though many analysts are still bullish, actually Morgan Stanley downgrading the stock today to equal weight from overweight. So they have some questions just about what the stock and what the returns are going to look like at least in the short term. It wasn't all bad news. I'm a little surprised to see the stock off as substantially as it is today, given those pre-limb numbers that you just went through, the fact that revenue actually coming in, they expect better than expected. $198 million adjusted EPS guidance to $0.38 or initial forecast was $31.33. But it looks like analysts have a lot of questions just about the new leadership at what $59 is going to look like looking out to 2023. All right, my play today is craft gaining a today after gold. And you can see it up just about 3 percent. When upgraded this stock to buy from neutral, lifted its price target to $43 to share from $37.26 percent upside from where it's currently trading. Now, Goldman, making the case that craft offers the highest free cash flow and dividend yields of their coverage within this space and that higher profit margins haven't fully been priced into this stock. Now, in a note to clients, the team wrote that the pace of share recovery is, quote, meaningfully slower than what they had initially anticipated in its market share. So well below those pre pandemic levels, year to date, date that coming has actually done relatively well when you take a look at the broader market. Your today, it's only off just around nearly 5 percent compared to the losses that we're seeing more broadly within this space and also with the broader market. So it looks like they think craft at least has an edge, a competitive edge in this space for now. Kind of a yeah, but note, right? I mean, I very rarely read an upgrade with the words relative valuation levels for staples are daunting. Now we've been richer than the onset of the last recession. Yeah, but they have that competitive advantage over their competitors. So though whether that storm, UBS upgraded them on Thursday as well. So they're not alone at Goldman. My play is Netflix shares up on a day.",https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yvHvxXHIc5I,79,2022-10-10 19:39:12
2966," They have that competitive advantage over their competitors. So though, whether that's storm, UBS upgraded them on Thursday as well. So they're not alone at Goldman. My play is Netflix shares up on a down day overall due to a no down from JP Morgan analyst Doug and Mew. He says the streaming giants upcoming and support ad supported tears, critical to re-accelerating revenue, expanding Netflix's serviceable available market and driving greater profitability. And with estimates, there will be 7.5 million ad supported subs in the U.S. and Canada. That generates 1.2 billion in 23 and 4.6 billion in additional revenue by 26, a 13% upside that JP Morgan analyst all has a neutral rating on the stock, a $240 price target. Netflix though has lost subs and back-to-back quarters for the first time ever. They'll report earnings one week from tomorrow. It shares down those 60 plus percent this year up on this news over 2%. A lot of people have a lot of high hopes for that ad supported tear. It is going to be all or nothing once that is implemented, Rochelle. No, it's very true. Netflix is really trying to reassure investors. We saw that ad age reporting the Netflix is tapping integral ad science and double verify to really help with these measurements when it comes to ads as well, trying to reassure investors because as you imagine, this is going to be real game change. After the subscriber number started to go down and all the other streamers jumped in as well, Netflix looking for this edge, looking for way to get perhaps billions in with some of these ad supported tears. So we'll have to see how it pans out and how much people are going to be willing to pay for each tear as well. A number of analysts bullish here, Elinick, Equity's, Oppenheimer, Evercore, all upgrading the stock over the last several weeks. So we'll see how it all pans out with our new ad supported tear. All right, coming up, early Facebook investor Roger McNeigh joins us to discuss Elon Musk, Twitter, the metaverse, and much more. I highly recommend the producers to seeinda. Kanye West getting suspended on social media over the weekend, both Twitter and Instagram moving to restrict his accounts following a string of anti-symmatic posts.",https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yvHvxXHIc5I,80,2022-10-10 19:43:21
2967," Kanya West getting suspended on social media over the weekend, both Twitter and Instagram moving to restrict his accounts following a string of anti-Semitic posts. Kanya was first locked out of Instagram, which prompted him to take to Twitter for the first time in two years. It's the latest test for social media companies' willingness to monitor hateful content on their sites. Joining us now for more on this we want to bring in Roger McNamy, elevation partners managing director and author of Zuck. Roger, it's great to see you again. Certainly there has been a large debate about content moderation. How social media companies should go about this. It's just from your perspective, what is this hellish in terms of where we are when it comes to policies and the handling of hate speech on these social media platforms? The context is that six years ago there was interference in the UK referendum around Brexit and then the US presidential election. Since then we've had ethnic cleansing in Myanmar. We've had extraordinary number of terrorist events. We've had the COVID pandemic and the undermining of the country's response to that. We've had the insurrection with stopped the steal. We've had extraordinary damage done to democracy, the public health, the public safety, the people's ability to make their own choices. And yet policy makers have done nothing. Absolutely nothing. And I think that the whole situation with Kanye West, with Elon Musk attempting to buy Twitter really highlights the extraordinary inaction. And frankly in my mind, really unpardonable inaction by Congress, by the President, to do something about what is clearly a threat, not just to safety in the country, but especially in national security. Twitter has a whistleblower who showed that there are people inside Twitter who are working for foreign governments. And for a platform that has as much influence on politics and democracy as Twitter has, that's extraordinarily dangerous. And so Roger, where does the conversation go in terms of accountability for those posting as well as those moderating and the pace at which they're able to monitor these things? So I'm not at all confident that we can fix this problem. There are three aspects of it. The first is the scale of the platforms. Facebook for example, where the worst offenses have taken place has literally billions of posts every day. So the notion that you're going to somehow effectively monitor that number of posts is a big stretch. The second problem is latency, the amount of time, even if you had enough moderators, even if the artificial intelligence worked, which it doesn't. But even if those things work perfectly, there's still going to be a lag. And the problem is the harm gets done in the first seconds after these harmful posts are put out. The third problem is one of incentives. And this is the one that's killing us because there is no reason from an economic perspective why these companies should look out for the safety of their users, much less protecting the country's national interest. Right now, the incentives are for them to make as much money as they can as quickly as they can and not worry about the consequences. And until that changes, I don't think there's a chance we're going to do anything good about this. There are exceptions when somebody's really, really bad. The way the Kanye West was this weekend, you will see politically it becomes impossible for these guys not to act, but the rest of the time they're going to do nothing. We'll see how long that ban lasts. Rodgers, you know California has acted when it comes to social media companies. And now section 230 at least is on the plate of the Supreme Court. How, if at all, do you think this could change the situation? You know, it's very, very hard to tell. Section 230 is incredibly important because what it does is it gives platforms the legal right to maintain the environment of their choosing. So that part of it's really, really good. Where I think things went off the rails is that the platforms chose because the economics were better to favor harmful content over good content. Basically hate speech, disinformation and conspiracy theories are extraordinarily profitable because they trigger flight or fight. So people have to pay attention. And in a business where attention is everything, that kind of content is going to rise to the surface repeatedly. So we have to change those incentives. I do not think 230 is the way to do that. I think the thing you have to do is to regulate the business market to Jasmine outside. Remember that's the big thing that a mayor who treats",https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yvHvxXHIc5I,81,2022-10-10 19:47:32
2968," eyes to the surface repeatedly. So we have to change those incentives. I do not think 230 is the way to do that. I think the thing you have to do is to regulate the business model, which is called surveillance capitalism, is this notion that you gather all the data about people and you use it to manipulate their choices and to manipulate their behavior. That must change. And we also have to have laws that require safety. The same way we require safety for transportation or healthcare or other things. We need to require safety around these platforms because the companies have to have an incentive to protect the people who use their systems. Roger from the conversations that you're having from people within the industry, from lawmakers, from what we're hearing, just from Capitol Hill. I guess how confident are you that we will actually see some change? And what does that mean then for some of the largest players in this space like meta and Twitter? I'm not at all confident. We are making progress, but it is incredibly slow in comparison to the damage that these companies are doing. And when I first started talking about this publicly in 2017, it was really obvious to me that that the issue was the culture, the business model and algorithms of platforms could undermine democracy and civil rights. I went to Congress in spring and summer of 2017 and then continued to push them to try to do something about it. More than five years have gone by. Several elections have gone by. An insurrection has gone by. A pandemic has been amplified. And yet nothing has been done. So I don't have a lot of confidence because the pressure from the public doesn't exist. And until people start saying, wait a minute, we rarely really value democracy. We really value our public health. We really value public safety. And we recognize that these companies are at danger. Nothing's going to happen. And Roger, as we saw with Twitter as they began badting people, we saw apps like Truth Social, some of these other more siloed avenues also pop up as well. What does that do to this picture when you're trying to monitor these different things but then having these different siloed platforms coming up as well? To be clear, I think that in the United States, people should be free to say the things that they feel and believe. But not all forms of speech are protected by the First Amendment. You're not allowed to yell fire in a crowded theater. You're not allowed to threaten elected officials. There are lines that people should not be allowed to cross. And the problem we have today is there is no enforcement of those lines. In fact, the lines, you know, I think everybody knows where they are. We just choose to not engage with it. And I don't know how we're going to solve that problem. I am hopeful. There is more progress today than there's been any time in the last five years. But it's so slow. And I do believe that politicians and frankly journalists and the citizens would rather not disrupt the convenience of the status quo to deal with hard problems like this. And I think it's a gigantic issue. And then there's the question Roger of what would Elon do? How will Elon Musk impact the situation you just described if and when he owns Twitter? So the exciting thing for investors is that it does appear that Elon Musk position in the Delaware Chance Record is very bad. So the odds of either a court decision or action by Musk to complete the deal are higher than they've been at any time in this process. And even if he finds a way to weasel out, it looks to me as though it's going to cost him more than just the breakup fee. So investors in Twitter are probably pretty well positioned in the short term. I can't say the same for America. I mean the problem with Twitter is they've done a horrible job for years in managing the discourse on the platform. And there's no evidence that Elon Musk has a plan to improve that. In fact, it's not clear what plan he has at all. And what has happened over the last couple of weeks is the disclosure by the court of the text conversations with prospective investors has been super embarrassing for those investors. And that creates some doubt about financing of the deal. And so I don't quite know how this is going to play out at the deal level. What I'm really worried about is that the company will go into a situation where not even investors will be able to have any influence on the outcome. And in that situation with somebody like Musk who seems to",https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yvHvxXHIc5I,82,2022-10-10 19:51:44
2969," situation where not even investors will be able to have any influence on the outcome. And in that situation with somebody like Musk, who seems to rejoice in trolling others and seems to think that trolling is like a really positive value, that for platform where all of politics, all of journalism, and all of celebrity, does its communication, that's just going to produce terrible outcomes. And certainly be tested again in the midterm elections coming up. A big thank you to Roger McNamee for joining us this afternoon. Thank you so much. Alright, coming up, online sports betting is looking less and less like a winning play in California. We'll tell you what companies like Fandall are doing about it. Next. Music Unlike what did or did not happen to Tom Brady, a showers day wishing to stop at Fred Davis Power in time by reaching largest Loan He할 on Saturday for two. But what did all the weed and weight you gave out during the weekend on the show were delivered to the sports gambling industry. The Wall Street Journal reporting draft kings and Fando hardware. To the real bloody I think this is an interesting moment here for drafting to the Fandall, right? So the journals reporting that drafting's in Fandall have pulled some ad spending in relation to Proposition 27 in California, which had to do with mobilizing or legalizing mobile sports gambling. And that really kind of comes from what we've seen from the polls though, guys. So a poll released last week from Cal Berkwee's Institute of Governmental Studies said that 53% of people planned to vote no, while only 27% planned to vote yes. That's two to one. That is not good a month out from this vote, right? And really the problem in California is there's two propositions. There's Prop 27, which draft kings, Fandall, Bed MGM are backing. And then there's Prop 26, which the tribes in California are backing for kind of brick and mortar betting. Sources have told me that's the problem, because it's hard for some in the industry to back both. You want to be able to back both in this industry. You want to be on both sides. And some of the lobbyists can't be on both sides. So how that's sort of impacting the stock here, you can see draft kings is down.",https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yvHvxXHIc5I,83,2022-10-10 19:56:45
2970," Back both. You want to be able to back both in this industry. You want to be on both sides. And some of the lobbyists can't be on both sides. So how that's sort of impacting the stock here. You can see draft kings is down over 13% today. And one other thing I want to add on that, I talked to Jen Kelly over at Oppenheimer. He said this could be long-term good for stocks like draft kings though. It will give them more time to get to profitability. A lot of these analysts see profitability in the end of Q4 next year. If you get to profitability quicker if you're drafting you have more money to spend on opening in California. Something to think about with the liquidity. That's what a lot of the bears think about here is that liquidity. It's an interesting twist there. I was going to say why if you didn't just explain that Pajashat. We also need to get to another big story in the gaming space today. When you look at the performance inside the S&P, some of the biggest decliner's today, when Las Vegas Sands moving to the downside on a rise in COVID cases in China. Talk to us just about why this is such a concern here for these companies. Yeah, if you take a look at the one-month chart of these two companies, when in Las Vegas Sands, it really tells you the story, right? We were talking two weeks ago about how it goes up because they think that there's going to be more opening in China. And then you see it goes down today because COVID cases are back. It's just kind of a lot of teetering and towering right now. And people don't really know where its headed city group cut their revenue forecast for gross gaming revenue in Macau today this morning. And I think that's part of why you're seeing those stocks down. But a lot of uncertainty when it comes to the casino stocks in China. You remember just overlay the COVID cases in China against the stock chart? Yeah, I think they tripled over the weekend. Josh, good to see you man. Thank you. Good stuff. Coming up, we're counting down to the closing bell on Wall Street. Stick with us right here on Yahoo Finance Law. All right. Just a couple of minutes away from the closing bell. Let's bring in Yahoo Finance this year. Blick read a breakdown today's market action. Hello, sir. Hello, not the best way to begin the week. But let's narrate it and has that down 1%. And let's get a two day rolling view. 10,575, 62 if it closes below that going to be the lowest since about the summer of 2020. And it looks like we're going to do that. So another negative headline about to be generated right here. Let's take a deep dive inside the market. Or it looks like we got a minute to go.

2971," and I get a headline about to be generated right here. Let's take a deep dive inside the market or it looks like we got a minute to go. We'll call this a shallow drive dive here to the spider sectors. We got staples in the lead, followed by industrials, materials and utilities. Those are the only ones in the green right now to the downside, energy taking up the rear spot here. That's down 2% followed by tech and real estate. You take a look at what the NASDAQ 100 is doing in some standouts, especially in the chips space with President Biden out cracking down on China once again and video down 3%. Software not doing much better. PayPal's down 6%. And let's get a check of the travel sector as well. Something a little bit non-correlated to tech. Here we see a mix board, but current will cruise lines down 5% win with that China exposure, down 12% Royal Caribbean, down 5% as we head into this closing dive. That wraps up today's trading action. Here to you look at all three of the major averages ending to the downside. The NASDAQ often just over 1% S&P off. 7% of a percent down off 93 points in terms of the sector action that Jared was just walking us through. Energy by far the worst performer in today's trading off just around 2%. We're also looking at losses from technology, real estate, and consumer discretionary. Let's talk about the recent market action and what we could expect going forward. For that, we want to bring in Deborah Cunningham, federated her knees, a chief investment officer of global liquidity markets. In Andrew Slimman, a Morgan Stanley investment management, senior portfolio manager. Andrew, let me start with you just in terms of the downside, I guess risk playing out in the market today. Once again, we are looking at losses. We saw a bit of optimism going back to a week ago today and what we saw in the trading action last Tuesday. How do you think things shake out from here between now and the end of the year? Well, I think near term, you have a very tough, competitive situation for equities, which is there's uncertainty about inflation. There's uncertainty about the Fed and there's uncertainty about earning. And on the meantime, you can go on by a two-year treasury at 4.3%. So it's tough for stock to really do well when assuredness of short-term yield curve looks pretty good. Later this year, if we get better inflation for it, so I think it's a better situation for equities. But I think it's tough near term that continues to weigh in the market. And there are as you mentioned some of that Fed uncertainty. To what degree is the Fed contributed to a lot of the uncertainty about really the path ahead that investors are now concerned about? Well, certainly I agree that inflation is ruling the roost from a standpoint of what the Fed's actions are. I think to some degree, they were very late in the game in the context of sticking with their thought that this was transitory until really just a year ago, the fourth quarter of 2021. So what you now have is a Fed, I think, that's continuing to play catch-up. And people look at mortgage rates and they say, oh, my goodness, they've doubled. And how are people, what is this going to do to the housing market? Or they look at short-term interest rates and say, just what we just heard, 4.3% for a very short-term government risk, yet when you look at something other than the last 10 to 12 years since the financial crisis, I mean, that was sort of more the norm from an interest rate perspective with inflation much less than it is today. So we got used to something with a low inflationary rate and to some degree, a zero premium over that low inflation rate that just is not continuing now. And we don't really see an end to it in the near term. So I think the Fed is in unison, whether it's chair Powell, whether it's the governors, whether it's the other voting members of the FOMC. They're in unison saying, this is our chief concern. And we are going to continue to battle this by increasing rates and releasing bonds off the...",https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yvHvxXHIc5I,85,2022-10-10 20:04:47
2972," our chief concern and we are going to continue to battle this by increasing rates and releasing bonds off the balance sheet. Both ways trying to quantitatively tighten as well as with monetary policy, tighten from an interest rate standpoint. I don't really see an end to that at this red hot moment. They're hoping for a good future. The first day, Andrew Hurricane Jamie Diamond out with his latest 69 months, the federal tippes in the recession. The markets have another 20% to fall. Your thoughts? Well, this has been the story all year. The economy has proven to be stronger than what people expected. The next day, the economy has been growing for a few months ago with all due respect. I think the real question is will it come to fruition if it does not. You know, stocks will recover. I can imagine that the tightening that the fed's done will continue. We'll not affect the stock market at some point. But the key point in maybe the stock market is, you know, there's so many stocks down 40, 50, 60%. That they're already reflecting a recession. I understand the S&P isn't at the cap-weighted index. That's because there's a few big stocks. They're only down 20% or last. But there are a lot of stocks that are reflective. I don't see that as tremendous downside for most stock could be for the S&P cap-weighted. Dipper, what do you think? How do you think this sets us up heading into earning season? We're starting to get a lot of the tech things over the next couple of weeks. When it comes to the surging dollar, the uncertainty when it comes to the fed. How do you see that impacting this round of earnings? We've been surprised quarter after quarter with earnings that we thought we were going to soften. We thought we were going to turn down. In fact, they have held out very large-scale earnings in the market. They're large global entities with lots of diversification that is working in their favor during this challenging time from an economic perspective. But that can only hold out for so long. Our expectations continues to be heading into the fourth quarter that we're going to see impact on earnings which ultimately then has a broader effect in the context of the earnings. So, we're going to see what the consequences of the issuers themselves. In this environment, you say we buy, fit, and sell greed. What does that mean in terms of the investment strategy right now? Well, I mean, the only consistency to my business right is the emotional element that brought the equity prices. Things swing to extreme. The first thing that I think of the first is that the first one was buying the travel leisure stock right into the mid to the pandemic when they prices, if no one was ever going to leave their house. Then energy futures went negative and boil boy now. Everyone loves energy. And then fast forward today, I think the fear is consumer sentiment is that of all time low. And those are those things that I think are going to be the most important part of the economy. But I don't think it's going to be tomorrow, but consumer sentiment is going to improve. But as I said before, a lot of consumer discretionary stock already priced in a recession. So, if in fact we do see some improvement, those stocks could have a lot of upside. I think greed, if flip-side, is going to be the top. I just think that there was more upside in other areas as that area has garnered and attracted a lot of money. So selling fear is all, I'm sorry, buying fear is all provide upside with the right time, probably more than",https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yvHvxXHIc5I,86,2022-10-10 20:09:16

In devil a big thank you to our market panel Deborah Cunningham and Adry Slimman thank you both for joining us this afternoon. All right coming up as the Biden administration is ramping up its battle with China over chips. A next guest says microchips are the new oil stay tuned to find out why.. Chips ox selling off today sending recent losses and video AMD Intel applied materials all hitting 52 week lows. Now US restrictions on China's access to chips and dire demand forecast. Ok those concerns out there that the sectors downturn may be longer and deeper than we initially thought. We want to bring Chris Miller the Fletcher School at Tufts Assistant Professor of International History and author of the chip war the fight for the world's most critical technology. Chris it's great to see you so these new curves from the Biden administration obviously adding to that bear sentiment out there on the street. I know you have been very closely tracking this global fight when it comes to chips. I guess what's your perspective of the new limitations that we got from the Biden administration? Well they are a sweeping set of restrictions on the sale of certain advanced chips to China as well as a whole set of chip making technologies that are really going to restrain China's advances in this sphere for some time to come. It will limit kind of ability for example to build out advanced data centers and deploy artificial intelligence. The risk of course that it also spurs China to invest even more in domesticating its own chip technology but for at least,https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yvHvxXHIc5I,87,2022-10-10 20:13:14
2974," centers and deploy artificial intelligence. And the risk, of course, that it also spurs China to invest even more in domesticating its own tip technology. But for at least the next couple of years, China will find it very difficult to get around these rules. They'll hurt some US shipforms with will hurt China even more. And what about just the risk of retaliation, too, right? As we have this escalating tension between the US and China? What's certainly a possibility we can't rule it out? It is worth noting, I think, that in the past when the US has rolled out comparable restrictions in terms of the transfer of tax to Chinese firms, like when the US restricted the sale of chips to Huawei in 2020, China did nothing in retaliation. So if that's any guide, China might not do much this time, of course. This is a more dramatic action than even the assault on Huawei in 2020. So it's possible China could change course. But the reality is that China still needs US chip, even though certain types of chips are no longer possible to sell the China, China spends more money importing chips than it spends importing oil. And that's been the case for the past decade. And so the Chinese realize they're in a weak position here. They've got, have acted chips made in the US or chips made in Taiwan or South Korea that are based on US technology. And unless the Commerce Department of the United States gives them approval, that all could be cut off. Well, and Chris, going off with that, the fact that China has spent more on chips than they have spent on oil. I guess just in terms of what is the potential fallout when we start to think about the economic consequences of this? Well, there are some foreign companies that will be hit US chip firms or chip makers in Taiwan, for example. But the biggest impact will be felt by China's own tech firms because for a long time, investors have been betting that Chinese firms in the AI space, for example, or in chip making will be able to continue to import technology from the US and other Western countries that they need to improve their capabilities. And now all of that is being called into question. The chip war has really escalated. And now it's not clear that China is going to have access to the most advanced data center technologies for the next couple of years and maybe the next decade. So in that sense, the US is really putting the choke on China's event, computing capabilities, and Chinese firms that had hoped to roll out artificial intelligence across their operations will face more and more limitations than that regard. Because the cost of AI will be very expensive, very power-intensive without the most advanced chips. And as of last week's action, China will be unable to access these semiconductors. It's clearly a massive headwind and challenge here for China. In terms of creating their own semiconductor industry, obviously, they like far behind when you compare it to where we are here in the US. How long do you think it will potentially take them to catch up? We're talking at least a fair number of years and potentially over a decade. They actually may never catch up, given the amount of capital investment involved, given the really specialized machine tools that today can only be bought from the US or Japan or the Netherlands. Today, China is a big player in the electronics market, but when it comes to chips, China is less than 10% of value at across the industry. And so if we're trying to domesticate all of this technology, it's really extraordinarily difficult and expensive prospects, which is why they've been very openly relying on chip-making technologies, as well as that chips from abroad for some time. This is not an industry you can just build from scratch overnight. Well, Chris, speaking of, I guess, of the expense of it, the cost of it to build out your own semiconductor industry. How does that compare to other sectors here in the US, just in terms of the cost and what it's going to take in order to potentially have an industry that's comparable to what we have here in the US? Well, the cost is really extraordinary. A new chip-making facility that's producing processor chips and memory chips can cost $20 billion, making them the most expensive factories in human history. There's really almost nothing that compares to a facility that's able to manufacture billions and billions of transistors each one smaller than a coronavirus. This is the most complicated, precise manufacturing in history, which is why the race to dominate this sector is so intense and so expensive. And we've seen earlier iterations of the chip war between different companies. That's why I called the book the chip war. And we found that only a couple of companies have been able to keep up thus far all relying on US and Japanese technology in particular.",https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yvHvxXHIc5I,88,2022-10-10 20:18:01
2975," that called the book The Chip War. And we found that only a couple of companies have been able to keep up thus far all relying on US and Japanese technology in particular. So for Canada to do this from scratch about access to foreign technology, would just be very tough. Well, this is clearly a priority here for the Biden administration recently passing the Chips Act of Move here in order to try and entice chip makers to manufacture chips here within the United States. I guess what's key in terms of making sure that this actually succeeds here in the US? I think it's pretty clear we're going to have more manufacturing of chips in the US. Thank to the incentive, $40 billion worth of incentives provided by the Chips Act. But the reality is that today, 90% of the most advanced processor chips can only be made in Taiwan. And so even despite that, we're spending more money to entice chip makers to build new facilities here, we're still going to be reliant on Taiwan to build our most advanced chips for some time to come. The Chips Act is a good idea. I think I support the legislation. But we need to be realistic about what it can accomplish. Given that one advanced facility can cost $20 billion, $40 billion only gets us so far in an industry where capital investment is just very expensive. It's a good point there. Chris Miller, great to have you author of Chip War, the fight for the world's most critical technology. Thanks so much for joining. Our convests, Kathy Wood, taking aim at the Federal Reserve at a new open letter saying the central bank has shocked not just the US, but the world and raised the risks of a deflationary bust. Alexander Semenova is here with more. Not entirely clear what prompted her to write this letter. What is she else to she saying? What does she want the Fed to do? Well, Dave, for starters, if Kathy Wood has something to say you better believe that she will find a creative way to get her messaging across, this time, she had something to say to Federal Reserve officials. So she did the most Kathy Wood things she can do and penned an open letter to the US central bank. She argued that they're making a big mistake by overhiking rates and that FOMC members are using lagging indicators to dictate their policy decisions, specifically citing employment and what she referred to as a downstream inflation and said that overhiking rates risks a deflationary bust. Now, even as key price measures like CPI and PCE continue to come in stubbornly high, she insists that declining prices in some commodities like lumber and copper actually suggest that we're heading toward deflation. She also notes that the Monthly Jobs report which again showed robust hiring last month isn't telling the full story and pointed to increasing jobless claims and job openings. Now, obviously the speculative text docs that comprise ARC and invest ETFs are taking a big hit from the Federal Reserve. So she's continuously been sending this message across, but the point here is that what she says in the letter is not that far off now from Wall Street appears to be thinking as well, which is that the Fed is overshooting now. She made a point that rising food prices are caused by the war in Ukraine and that these are factors that the Fed can't actually resolve by tightening monetary policy. Now, the interesting thing is BlackRock actually had a similar message. They also said that the Fed is trying to combat factors that are contributing to inflation, that they can't fix with raising interest rates. So when you have ARC invest and BlackRock on the same page, that's pretty significant here. Three straight 75s, safe to say we're gonna hear from her again after what looks like a fourth 75 point hike in a row, Alexander Seminova. Thank you, great stuff.

2977," when gas prices soared and hit $5 this year, consumer confidence went exactly the other way and just about the same proportion and then consumer confidence improved as gas prices declined. We are now seeing upward pressure again on gasoline prices. We were talking last week about this production cut that the OPEC plus nations announced that Saudi Arabia plus Russia and a bunch of others mostly in the Middle East. That is already putting upward pressure on gasoline prices and I think the Biden administration is going to be desperate to keep gas prices at least on an average basis below $4 by the time of the midterm elections on November 8. That release of oil from the US strategic reserve was supposed to end in October but without saying much about it, the Biden administration has now extended some amount of oil releases into November time clearly at the midterm elections and it's also possible they could release a little bit more oil just to keep gas prices down leading up to November 8. There is not a lot of Biden can do on this but that's one thing to look for as for overall inflation. We have one more report coming on that this week and we will see what that has to say about what prices are like and how the Federal Reserve is likely to respond. There was one costly fist bump with MBS in the long term. One of the inability for the Biden administration that will really forever haunt them Rick no matter what the issue is is an inability to sell anything in particular infrastructure and a lot of their accomplishments. What do you expect the final push to be from the Biden administration on their achievements? I think they are going to keep it simple Dave I think it's going to be 10 million jobs and then Biden gives a speech he gets into the fine print the fine print is yes we pass the inflation reduction act if it's called the inflation reduction act though why is an inflation lower. He's got some explaining to do on that he did pass some bills and I think voters on the margins do give him credit for getting some of those things done. You can see it if you get deep into the polling data but Americans just don't feel like things are going right and I think that when inflation is hot you know we forgot about the corrosive impact that inflation can have on consumer attitudes because we haven't had to deal with this really since the late 1970s. We're getting a reminder all over again that inflation is really ruinous it put it in a side to put in addition to reducing purchasing power and basically shrinking people's paychecks it just puts everybody in an nasty mood. So I think we have to see inflation come down to the range of 5% before voters start to feel better about it and there's no way that's going to happen by November. No way indeed thanks as always our very own Rick Newman thanks for joining us. Well after a series of legal challenges in recent weeks student borrowers are wondering when they'll be able to apply for President Biden's debt forgiveness program. White House says applications will open any day now and the Department of Education has shared some new information about eligibility. Well your finances will be joined us now with the details so Ronda what can borrowers expect now. Well this application releases like an album drop no one knows everyone's been reaching out to the Department of Education to the White House. You don't know so it's going to be one of these things we're unfortunately borrowers are going to be finding out probably via tweet like we did about loan forgiveness and even though the education department says that they've short up their website so it won't crash. I think this will be it in an edbreaker one of the things that borrowers need to understand is even though the loan application should come out any day in October it is highly recommended that if this long forgiveness package doesn't wipe out all your debt. That you try to complete the application by November why because forbearance ends December 31st and you resume payments in January so you want to apply early to allow your loan servicer enough time to recalculate your balance and give you your new monthly payment. You have until the end of 2023 to apply but the longer you wait the longer it takes to process so particularly if you have outstanding debt after loan forgiveness be sure to apply early. Now the other thing is people have had questions that 125 income.",https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yvHvxXHIc5I,91,2022-10-10 20:30:47
2978," and just be sure to apply early. Now, the other thing is people have had questions that 125 income cap is at AGI. We are hearing from sources that is based on your adjusted gross income. So that could change too, because there again, it hasn't been confirmed, sources say. So that's another thing. One thing that borrowers need to understand. It is not enough for you to simply go on the website and sign up for the subscription notification. You need to go on the studentaid.gov site, and make sure that your account information is in the system properly. Well, that's lots of great stuff. Hopefully everyone's screenshot it some of those dates there so they can keep track. Everyone, make sure you do that. And hopefully the website holds up as well. Rondelly, thanks so much. Guys. All right, a small advocacy group of the job creators and network foundation filing a new lawsuit aimed at halting President Biden's student debt program, the latest in a series of similar suits that we have seen in recent weeks. Shahoe Finance is Alexis Keenan. Drinks is now with the details on that. Hey, Alexis. Hi, Shana. To Rondis' point about doing this early pay attention, because this lawsuit and the others like it, could have some bearing on whether or not people actually get their hands on this money that they may be eligible for. So this particular case coming from job creators network, it is an advocacy group for small business, but it's got two named plaintiffs in the lawsuit. One of these plaintiffs is eligible for the, or partially eligible for the forgiveness. The other one, not eligible at all. So this is filed in the federal district court for the Northern District of Texas. And they're saying that at the heart of the case, that this executive order coming from President Biden to offer this forgiveness, that it violates the American Procedures Act. Now, that act requires notice and comment periods for certain rule makings, but whether it applies the executive orders that has perhaps not been challenged in this type of case. Now, the plaintiffs say that the forgiveness eligibility is arbitrary. They say it's unequal, that the measures adopted by the administration and where to draw those lines about AGI, adjusted gross income, and other factors that determine whether you're eligible. They say that those are just unequal and arbitrary. Also, these plaintiffs say that the universities should really be the ones that are held accountable for prices being so high and for students being in the position that they're in today. They also say that the order is really just a ploy to drum up support for November elections. But look, there is a stay that these plaintiffs are requesting. So what that means is they want this forgiveness to be put on hold while their lawsuit is pending. And that could be a problem because if a court grants that, then that would perhaps bring to a halt the government dishing out this money to the eligible recipients. So as Rhonda said, those single filers will be allowed to apply when this application comes out up to $125,000 married in head of household filers up to $250,000. Guys, certainly an important story to continue to watch right. Alexis Keenan, thanks so much. Coming up, the world mental health day, the CEO of Headspace Health, that tells us how it's trying to get people get the ball rolling when it comes to taking care of their own mental health. It joins us next......",https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yvHvxXHIc5I,92,2022-10-10 20:35:17
2979," Pike Today is World Mental Health Day, a day for raising awareness of mental health issues and giving us all an opportunity to rekindle our efforts to make mental health a priority. Headspace Health CEO, Russ Glass, with us now to talk about this. Good to see you, sir. The numbers are staggering. 20% of employees, according to Gallup, 20% are engaged at work. I don't know if this is the quiet quitting trend or not. Are employers doing enough to help with mental health? Clearly, they're not. I think that we saw a big spike during the pandemic where employers realized they had to focus on this. They didn't have a choice. But 25% of employees tell us now that the focus on it has gone down. That employers aren't as focused on it right now. And yet what we see is that the mental health pandemic is not slowing down, right? Even though maybe the actual pandemic, the COVID pandemic is slowing down. We're seeing a continued acceleration in need. And that's what World Mental Health Day is all about. It's how do we make sure people understand that this is still a critical need, that we need to be focusing on it. And our mission is how do we transform the mental health space to break down some of these barriers that people face in getting mental health care today? Because once there is this recognition about mental health, but it doesn't seem to translate perhaps into what some of these businesses could or should be doing. Or is there a discount also between people feeling comfortable enough using the resources that their companies are offering as well? Well, let's start with the facts. The World Health Organization estimates there's about a billion people that have a diagnosed mental health condition. And 60% of them are not getting care. And that's because of access issues. They can't find providers. It's because of cost issues. It's just too expensive when they do find a provider. And then there's all kinds of stigma issues. People are still not comfortable saying, hey, I have an issue that I really need help with. And so employers have to recognize that they have a huge percentage of their employees that are struggling right now. Some estimates are about 40% of employees are struggling with mental health. We have seen that 50% of employees are thinking about leaving work because of mental health issues right now. And so we know employers have to be focused on it. We are trying to raise awareness today.",https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yvHvxXHIc5I,93,2022-10-10 20:39:43
2980," thinking about leaving work because of mental health issues right now. And so we know employers have to be focused on it. We are trying to raise awareness today. We are running live meditations throughout the week. We're doing, ask me anything for our client base, our 4,000 companies around the world that are accessing our mental health care. We did a partnership with 24 hour fitness to create the environment for their, uh, members to access this. We did a partnership with Pinterest. We're really trying to create awareness so that employers realize this is something you have to invest in and it'll drive positive return on investment in addition to supporting their employees. And certainly is very critical and very important. You're given the numbers that you were just citing. Russ, when it comes to what companies are doing, things that do work, we've talked about mental health days. We know Nike had given all their employees a week off. And hopefully other companies are setting aside and needing free times. What's your advice just in terms of what companies can do throughout the year to make sure that they are staying on top of this? Great question. Few things. One is make sure that the leaders of the company are talking about it. If, if, if the leaders are willing to say, Hey, you know, I've had anxiety throughout my career. I've had to manage issues like this. It helps destigmatize it for everybody else. So that's number one, find leaders that are willing to talk about it. Two then is provide training for leadership for managers. One of the most uncomfortable things is having a conversation and saying, Hey, how are you doing and being afraid of the answer? Right? Someone says to you, Yeah, you know, I'm actually feeling pretty depressed. And you as a manager, don't know how to respond to that. That can be super uncomfortable. So what we find is managers don't, don't talk about it. So provide training. We're, we're providing leadership workshops, for example, the help companies figure out like, how do we have these conversations? And then number three, make sure employees understand what's available to them. What we find is 94% of CEOs say they're doing enough for mental health. Only 67% of employees agree. That's a huge gap. And mostly we believe it's due to communication that it launches once. They never talk about it again. And when an employee really needs it, they don't know it's available for them. So communication, constant reinforcement of these, these resources being available. Maybe I can help with stigma. I struggled daily with anxiety. I have no problem admitting that I meditate every single day. It helps to see world mental health day trending on Twitter all day, which tells you maybe the stigma is changing a little bit. Cost and access to the two other factors that you mentioned. What can be done about those? Well, we're trying to do a few things. One is we've launched a few programs today. One is our referral program where anybody with a headspace account can now refer to as many friends as they want for 30 days free. So that's launching today. We are also creating a my headspace campaign. And people can share their stories via social media. But they can talk about how they have handled their own anxiety, depression, mental health issues and what they've done to help solve it. Just help people feel like they're not alone out there. To your point, I love the fact that you're willing to talk about it. And because everybody has mental health, everybody needs to think about this. And the more that we can feel comfortable talking about it, the better. More broadly, we have to think about creating more resource for our communities, particularly those who are underserved. How do we get resources into those communities? You know, today, 50% of US counties have zero mental health providers within county lines. We just can't continue to operate this way. And that's where we're really focused. How do we drive up the amount of care that can be delivered per therapist, psychiatrists, provider that's out there? Definitely feeling those shortages. My dad is a psychiatrist, he retired and came back because there is such a need. So appreciate the work that you're doing and all our mental health providers out there. Thank you so much for us, glass. All right, well, coming up, hello, Alice is looking to help small businesses across the US grow.

We're looking to help small businesses across the US grow. We're looking to help small businesses across the US grow. We're looking to help small businesses across the US grow. There seems to be one unanimous truth about starting a small business. It is hard. We're looking to help small businesses grow by offering funding, education and opportunities to entrepreneurs. We're joining us now is Elizabeth Gore, hello Alice co-founder president along with Russell Jackson, restaurant owner and chef of reverence. Thank you both for joining me today. Elizabeth for people who are trying to get familiar with what your company does. How do you serve small businesses and how does the pandemic change that? It's great to be with you all. At hello Alice, we help ensure the financial health of any small business. We help you access credit, grants, information, technical assistance and most of all each other. You can learn from people like Chef Jackson who is with us today. We are here at hello Alice all about your financial health. Russell speaking of health, I mean six months before the COVID pandemic hit, you came out of retirement and opened your restaurant. I can't even imagine once the pandemic started to take hold what it was like to try and access capital in those very early stages. Walk us through that. Yeah, what was I thinking, right? I've been trying to say the least, I think that for myself as a 40 year professional actually coming out of your time and to do this, I'd never spent a single day, a single hour training to every day a day? Okay.",https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yvHvxXHIc5I,95,2022-10-10 20:47:46
2982," And for myself as a 40 year professional, actually coming out of your time and to do this, I'd never spent a single day as single hour training for what we've been through for the last two years. And thanks to Hello Allis, I mean first and foremost, they were the first people to step in beyond Nick, Nicholas and Talk to step up and help us. And if it wasn't for Hello Allis, I wouldn't be standing inside this building today. So I'm very fortunate and blessed that we found them and they found us, I guess. I mean, it seems like it's a very well-matched pair here. And Russell, I do want to just follow up because obviously a lot of restaurants struggling with things like labor shortages. We're seeing wages go up. People still trying to compete for staff. How's that affecting your business at the moment? Well, this restaurant was purpose built and we built it around the idea of creating the best efficiencies that we could. So we're a small, small house. Right now we currently got three full-time staff members and two part-time staff members. And we can provide a high level of Michelin level service and high-profile dining, a tasting menu program that you, you know, we can compete with the big boys and going in with that thought and having to deal with some of the ups and downs, we're plagued by it like the rest. You know, we've had difficulties with supply chain. We've had difficulties, we're having difficulties with inflation. Scalp for a great example, we're 16 to 20 dollars a pound, pre-pandemic. They're not, they at the height during the pandemic were $60 a pound wholesale for the quality that we deal with. Yeah, wow. This is an understatement. Should have seen the bill on that one. And, you know, we've worked very, very hard to manage our way through this entire process. And again, without the advice and the support of some teams like Hello Alice, I mean, we had a tremendous amount of difficulty getting into and getting our second PPP alone. And if we were waiting for them stepping in and advocating for us and giving us a path to that, we wouldn't have had that amount of money that helped us to bridge the gap to sort of the next early path as we've been going through all this. And don't, don't misunderstand pandemics not over. We're still reeling, you know, small businesses and especially small restaurants are still violently struggling to survive on a day-to-day basis. You know, you may drive by and see a place full, but I'll tell you, for every one place that you see full, there are 50 that are empty. And so, yeah, I mean, Elizabeth, I want to bring you in here because obviously there's a lot of restaurants and companies that you work with. And I know that you recently teamed up with Square to really explore some of the challenges and some of the unique opportunities that Hispanic businesses face. Talk about some of the findings from that study and what you hope to really achieve with that as you try and get more funding and more opportunities for Hispanic business owners. Well, Hello Alice, we are left, you know, on company ourselves. And so we obviously take great pride in women, people of color, US veterans who are leading our companies. And the Hispanic community has over 5 million businesses with 800 billion contributing to our economy. However, we continue to see a huge lack of equitable access to credit, business loans, and then, you know, the things that are hitting every small business owner like inflation, as Chef said, hiring issues and so on. So if you're really going to help these, I love the way Chef says, Lily Pads hopped for one capital continuum to the next. We really have to put forward more equitable access to capital. So what Square and Hello Alice found is that grants are still critically important. So government grants, philanthropic grants, and small business owners. Second is access to credit solutions like operational credit. We are big fans of secured credit as well. And then finally, cashflow is king. So how are we helping small business owners with technical assistance on the Hello Alice platform, ensuring money in and money out is a smart use of funds. But I will tell you the other thing we found in the Latinx Hispanic community.",https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yvHvxXHIc5I,96,2022-10-10 20:52:31
2983," the full assistance on the HELLOAS platform, ensuring money in and money out is a smart use of funds. But I will tell you the other thing we found in the Latinx Hispanic community is this huge sense of optimism. They're opening companies three times at the rate of their white male counterparts. It is an exciting time. There's also an increase sense of spend around software solutions. So there's, I think we are betting on the right groups when we look at women and people of color, particularly the black and Hispanic community. And also congratulations on teaming up with Mastercard and first national bank of Omaha as well. The way it comes to business credit because I know that is not easy. And we'll have to leave it there with a big thank you Elizabeth Gaw and Russell Jackson, chef. Great to have you on both of you. Thank you so much. I'm busy. Thank you. Appreciate it. For sure. All right, coming up the new battle for streaming platforms. Family friendly content. We have a closer look just ahead. All right. All right. Well, it's talk streaming now. Hulu raising subscription prices today. Yahoo. Finances. Ali canal here with the details. How much Ali? Yeah, Dave. So these price hides they were first announced back in August, but today they are hitting those subscriptions. So here's where you're looking at if you're a Hulu subscriber. Add supported will now cost $7.99 a month. That's up from the previous $6.99. Whereas the ad free version will run two bucks more 1499 versus 1299. Now that bundled plan that also includes Disney plus and ESPN plus that's safe for now, but it will see a price increase later this year. Now price X of course, they're not uncommon for these streaming platforms Netflix, Hiked prices in January, Hulu had a previous price hike around the same time last year. And with analyst hyper focused on profitability, this is one way to increase that revenue per user. However, the one issue is that these platforms always run the risks of increased churn. So that's something that we're going to be monitoring moving forward. But for now, if you're a Hulu subscriber, you're paying just a bit more today. And Ali, we know the box office saw some so, so, so sort of lukewarm results for Sony's Li容ide L<|fr|><|translate|> cozy and All Night People's Wat Stillers ignites you.

2984," the loser subscriber you're paying just a bit more today. And Ali, we know the box office saw some so, so, so, sort of lukewarm results for Sony's Liolile crocodile. So how does that add to the shaky outlook for some of these family-friendly titles that they get? Yeah, it's a much different landscape for these types of movies. Liolile saw a box office haul this weekend of 11.5 million. It had a production budget of 50 million. So not the best debut, especially as we often see attendance levels drop off as the weeks go on. And I think honestly, it's just a reflection of this post pandemic, theatrical environment. There are only going to be 14 family-friendly movies in 2022. We have two more to go before the end of the year. And that's a pretty significant dip versus 24 of those titles that we saw in 2019. And one big reason for that is that this genre is moving over to streaming. Paramount plus, Disney plus, even Netflix have heavily invested in this type of content in some cases, spending a heck of a lot of money to secure these types of films, focus, focus to on Disney plus was a big one recently. Disenchanted coming soon on Netflix. We'll have the school for good in evil out next week. And moving forward, I think it's just going to be a conscious decision on the part of studios when it comes to where these movies go. Streaming or the theater? Are you leaving money on the table going right to streaming or some of these movies better suited for the theatrical? I think that's going to be a constant question and there's going to be a lot more experimentation moving forward. It's true. Everyone's still trying to figure it out. A big thank you, Ali. Can now. Thanks so much. I mean, I know for me when it comes to some of these streaming things, especially kids movies, you figure you pay for the one subscription. You've got your treats at home. You just sit back. I'm one of these people. I'm going the streaming route. If I can help it, it's going to take a lot for me to go to the movies for kids. For kids movie. I'm like, if I can get it at home. Yeah, I mean, it's not a question that I am going to streaming route here. I mean, I would have done this even if the pandemic didn't happen and people didn't get more used to just streaming movies in their own home. I had never really been a huge fan of going to the movies, but from a parents perspective, bringing my kids to the movies, it's going to be a huge cost-saver. How expensive is it for the movies? Yeah. $20 a ticket? Honestly, I don't know. $17 a ticket. $17 a ticket. $17 a ticket. $17 a ticket. $17 a ticket. $17 a ticket. $17 a ticket. It's Black Panther November 11, Avatar December 16. That's it. I don't know. I don't know if it's going to get me back. All right, well, that's going to do a press today on Yahoo Finance Live. Be sure to come back tomorrow at 3 p.m. Eastern Time. See you then.",https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yvHvxXHIc5I,98,2022-10-10 21:01:11
