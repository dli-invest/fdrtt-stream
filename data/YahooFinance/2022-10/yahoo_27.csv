3091," of Fed pivot. To a certain extent, I think that's fair. And the reason why the pivot is so important is because there's still room for the Fed to actually be more hawkish. I know you've got the Fed that's settling a roughly 4.6% term rate next year, but I think the real question is, when is the federal funds rate going across CPI? And I think it's going to cross sometime at the middle of next year. The challenge is I think it crosses out a higher Fed funds rate, not a lower inflation rate. And so I think the Fed and we'll get mid sometime this afternoon, I think it's certainly going to continue to show that while some committee members are concerned about a slow down in the economy, there's still laser focused on trying to bring that inflation and more importantly, maintaining that in their credibility as an inflation fighting entity. And so I think you do kind of have to see that Fed pivot because markets don't like higher rates. And the Fed may actually be in a position to do a little bit more over the course of the first half of next year. Well, that looks like not so much fun for the markets. Thanks a lot, Jordan. Good to see you. Jordan Jackson, JB Morgan, asset management's global markets, strategist, appreciate your time coming up. So I was going to share his talk. Take on a meta's VR glasses. Apparently you got legs now when you're wearing them, which is a big deal or something. Great. I don't know what those shoes for the metaverse. Today I guess. Yesterday afternoon, meta and bail a pair of $1,500 AR headsets that go on sale on October 25th. Sausage is of course fired up about these things, but not because he's a good guy. The best way to get a $1,500 AR headset. So go on sale on October 25th. Sausage is of course fired up about these things, but not because he's excited about the technology, his frustration with these is where he's looking at the video.",https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2iE41vefT4k,1,2022-10-12 13:53:47
3092," Saas is of course fired up about these things, but not because he's excited about the technology, his frustration with these is where we find his take today. I don't even know what we're looking at video. I imagine a lot of other consumers won't know either because they're not buying these things. My take is this. I'll do a review in real time. I hate them. And I think it's an awful time for metadata becoming out with a $1,500 product at the same time. They're laying people off of their stock prices down 62%. But let me set this up here and look at some of the specs on this because we don't really need anything else. We can just have a look at this. Yeah, well, I'm getting there. I just want to give you a little flavor, flavor of what's coming up. So here's the specs on this. Big winner for Qualcomm, friends of Yahoo Finance are always on talking about their various chips. Big win for them. That is good. You're seeing 12 gigabytes of RAM. You're seeing a good bit of storage and a 90 Hertz refresh rate. Don't know what that is, but it all sounds good worth noting as well. Without being plugged in this device gets 60 to 90 minutes on a full charge. To me, that's not exactly great. You plug it in. Obviously the charge lasts a lot longer. But the specs on this are pretty impressive. That is winning high remarks. But here's why, you know, if you were investor in meta, you should view something like this very, very skeptically. And there I am with those goggles on essentially covering my eyes. First up, you're releasing an AR AR glasses while workers at meta are reportedly being purged. That is the only thing we have heard out of meta, arguably the past month on how they're calling their workforce, focusing more on expenses. And here you have Zuckerberg on a presentation yesterday. Just championing $1,500 AR glasses. It just seems totally disconnected on relative to what's happening inside of meta regarding even a product that is not a big sales driver for this company. Number two, how will these glasses help get your stock price up? That is to be determined. I would argue it is products like this that are so focused on a metaverse that doesn't even exist and may not exist for 10 years. That is hurting meta stock price continues to hurt that stock price because it's dumping so much money into products like this. And then lastly, who is spending $1500 on these glasses in front of a recession? This is far less $5,000 more than the top end of an iPhone. I think it's a very limited market at least right now. You can't wear these outside per se. You're not walking around your office in them per se. So it's a very limited, high end focus. Usually I would say dedicated to tech eaks. Overall, now there are some sales behind this as well. You know, I pulled up the IDC worldwide shipments of augmented reality headsets or forecasts to decline to decline 8.7 percent year over year to about 260,000 units by the end of this year. So here's a $1500 product into a potential recession in a market that is not really growing clearly. That is coming from IDC. And also as well in the first half of this year, the top five AR headset makers weren't meta. You can see Microsoft on their own. They weren't really making it. They had these glasses. This is just the latest generation. So the market is not growing. And this is a product that consumers are not necessarily out there buying. My take is on this maybe not a shocker. Come on, Mark Zuckerberg. Apple is going to crush you anyway. At some point, Apple is going to come out with actual glasses, whether they look like Google Glass, whatever they are, that is going to pummel anything that meta is possibly come up here. Maybe be able to wear these glasses out in public. They're going to look like glasses. They're going to do like big cool things and you're not even need these things. I mean, total waste of time. Total waste. I think I'm in the same boat and not being sold. However, I would argue that if you saw more corporate purchases because the starting point- I know, like what is the point? That's why. If the starting point at least says an entryway for them is not just going to the individual consumer, but going to the corporate consumer and saying, if you want more collaboration, you have to do it through the tools that you're giving your team. The reason that you saw, so many IBM think pads be able to be sold, especially in the era when so many companies were navigating over to whether it be a Lenovo or an Apple MacBook Pro for their employee base. It's because they were able to just say, all right, let's just buy these in wholesale, let's buy these in bulk and then we know we can run all of our applications on that. Now, we all know what the way of the IBM think pad went. But if there's an entry point, it could be more on the corporate side than an individual side. But what in the world is the value proposition? And I know this is something Zuckerberg said, you can have meetings in the metaverse. Sure. Why? I'm so happy you agree with me on this one. This is a thank you for the side. Why would you have meetings in the metaverse when you can have a Zoom? Different do it in real person. Different do it in person. Right. Right. It just, that proposition doesn't make any sense to me. Now to be clear, Zuckerberg has said this is a longer term bet. It's something that is not going to create value in a certain way.",https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2iE41vefT4k,2,2022-10-12 13:57:54
3093," I just, that proposition doesn't make any sense to me. Now to be clear, Zuckerberg has said this is a longer term bet. It's something that is not going to create value necessarily for the company in the short term. And while that may be true, in the meantime, it's causing issues for the company. Not just the points you were making, there is also reportedly a dissatisfaction with the strategy that the company is taking. And as we know, even with the cutbacks that we've seen in Silicon Valley, there's still a war for talent that goes on. So if you're losing people because they don't think they're on the right track, that's a problem. Simple analysis here. We had that Piper Sandler survey yesterday. And it showed that Instagram is in third place behind Snap and TikTok. How do these $1,500 glasses help get Instagram back into first place? How does it make Facebook more relevant again? Where it's number one? I don't see it. And that is a big problem. That is the biggest thing that is hanging over Metastock price right now. Two high expenses in slowing growth in Facebook and Instagram. Well, do you think all the grandparents who are on Facebook are going to buy these? No, I don't think they're going to buy one. I know. Not unless they need them. It's sort of a rhetorical question. Quick talk too. If you want to follow more of my product reviews, just go to LinkedIn. I have more. I really post them all there. Really? No. Oh. Guys, all right, we can continue talking about this. But coming up, why are next guests says the US economy is not immune to global uncertainty? We'll discuss next. Welcome back. I'm Brian Sussi here.",https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2iE41vefT4k,3,2022-10-12 14:01:57
3094," Welcome back. I'm Brian Sousie here with Julie Hyman and Brad Smith. We're seeing green on the screen today across the major indices. That's even as President Biden warned about a potential mild recession. Here's what we're watching for you at this moment. A caffeinated quarter PepsiCo's checker page is read hot on Yowl Finance this morning as the company blew a profit estimates excuse me and raised guidance PepsiCo's COFU Johnson told us moments ago demand continues to be very strong and they are pushing through more price increases. More big calls earning the season officially kicked off today with PepsiCo's results. So I'll look at a few pre earnings calls by analysts on Apple and Norwegian Cruisix. In the state of freelance workers we'll talk to the COFiver on the outlook for the gig economy as economic growth slows. Brad over to you at the Wi-Fi interact. I couldn't get out. I was at the Yowl Finance interactive was the Wi-Fi whatever it is there you are Brad. There we are. Here we are. All right. Taking a look at the dash show and industrial average right now we are holding onto some slight gains on the day by about half a percent right now for the average up by about 143 points. You've also got the Nasdaq composite tech heavy average in the green. It's up 310s per percent 31 minutes into today's trading session and the S&P 500. You're also seeing some green on the screen there. That's up a little more than 310s of a percent taking a look at as well. Some of the activity that we're seeing more broadly here let me navigate us over to some of the Nasdaq 100 names that we've been continuing to track throughout the day. It looks like broadly you've got more advances than declines here. An interesting move here that we're seeing especially in some of the retail names you've got a sharp move higher and Lou lemon on the day we've been tracking that stock throughout the week given some of the new bullish sentiment that's entered into the market talking about Lou lemon as well as the annexation to the Gen Z brand affinity with it. So we'll continue to watch Lou as we move forward throughout the rest of today's session. That's up by about 2 percent. Another big gainer here as well that we've got on the day ticker symbol MRN able dive into that one and just a little bit so stick around for that. Let's shift our broader market conversation after some data from the producer price index and with inflation showing no relief. Our next guest says that a recession may be coming for more. Let's welcome in the chief economist at EY Parthenon Greg Dacco. Greg great to have you here with us this morning. But first and foremost if we were to see that recession that perhaps many of the economists if they are right that it might be slight versus the more longer or protracted one where do you fall within that camp. Well I think we're certainly seeing the initial signs of a significant slowdown in terms of global activity. We are seeing an environment in which European growth is slowing point dramatically in which growth across emerging markets is also slowing and in which the US economy is also starting to see initial signs of a slowdown. We're not hearing from the executives we speak to desire to retrench in terms of capex in terms of hiring plans here in the US but I am increasingly concerned that the global waves of uncertainty and the financial market stress that we're seeing globally will eventually affect the US and lead us into a more profound recession. More profound recession Greg what does that look like in terms of GDP? Well we are in an environment where our baseline forecast is for a mild contraction in GDP growth next year that would come on the back of growth around 1.5% this year. So that would be a mild recession. I think that if we look at household finances and corporate finances today they are still rather healthy so that would pretend to a more mild type of recession but if the global waves of uncertainty, if the massive slowdown that we're expecting in Europe in emerging markets is exacerbating this slowdown in the US then you could be in for a global recession in which we could see a more pronounced contraction in GDP maybe on the order of 1% in the US. Greg it's hard to know what to think right now right because we are hearing a lot of prominent voices in markets and economics who are getting more pessimistic right. This mild recession was sort of the base case for a while now and now I feel like it's tilting more negative than that and that there are risks coming on the periphery that then could cause more contagion. How are you weighing all of this right now?",https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2iE41vefT4k,4,2022-10-12 14:06:12
3095," more negative than that. And that there are risks coming on the periphery that then could cause more contagion. How are you weighing all of this right now? How do you figure out how concerned to be? Well, you're certainly right to highlight that we are navigating a world of uncertainty and it's extremely difficult for business leaders to navigate this world of uncertainty where inflation remains a key constraint, where the labor market is extremely tight, where the cost of capital is surging, and where there's massive uncertainty as to the geopolitical landscape. So it's a highly uncertain macroeconomic environment where it's very important to look not just as one at one base case, but really at scenarios around that base case. And I think you're right, risks are tilted to the downside. The baseline scenario is currently a mild recession. The upside is a soft landing of the global economy and of the U.S. economy by the Fed. The downside scenario could have some severe ramifications. If you have an excessive and disorderly tightening of financial conditions, that can have knock on effects onto certain streams of the financial sector as we're seeing in the UK with pension funds. So there are a lot of unknowns out there, and I think that makes it very difficult to forecast with accuracy. So there is some discomfort in the fact that the baseline view is a recession, but we have to acknowledge the downside risks to global economic activity. Greg, at what point do you believe some of the Fed's activity will finally start to fully show up in the data and yield some of the results or at least the parameters that they're looking for in order to either pause or pivot? Well, I think they're going to be very attentive to what happens on the global financial conditions front. What was at the NAVE annual conference over the first part of this week and Vice Chair Brainer highlighted, again, this concern about what's happening globally in terms of global financial conditions in terms of overall economic activity globally. And she highlighted the fact that we are in an environment where most central banks are tightening aggressively. And the fact that each of these central banks is tightening that aggressively has a greater effect than the sum of the individual tightening processes would normally have. And that is something that the Fed is going to be paying very close attention to as we move into 2023. Because again, the Fed leading the way has implications in terms of the dollar strengthening quite rapidly, exporting inflation into emerging markets, increasing the burden of debt for a lot of these emerging markets. And that's a concerning backdrop when it comes to the global economic environment. We know the US is not immune to these global waves of uncertainty. No, it is not. Greg Daco, EY, Parthenon, Chief Economist, always good to see you. We'll talk to you soon. All right, before we had to break, we are keeping a close eye on shares of McDonald's on some negative comments from city analyst John Tower. Head of the company's October 27th earnings report, power sites foreign exchange headwinds, energy cost inflation, and weakening store traffic data as key risk to McDonald's earnings days as Tower. Investors have been anchored to the defensiveness of the US business despite these risks. And we believe peak valuation leaves a little room for shares to absorb a negative estimate of visions much less of a potential slowdown in the US business. Coming up, Amazon workers in California are looking to unionize. Julie's got the details on that. Plus, more top headlines next. Come on.",https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2iE41vefT4k,5,2022-10-12 14:10:49
3096," differences Let's get down to business now. Look at some of the other headlines that we are watching. Amazon potentially facing yet another front in ongoing unionization battles as workers at a California warehouse of petition the National Labor Relations Board to form a union. That moved the first step towards a formal vote and could see the warehouses 800 workers join the Amazon Labor Union. Petition comes as part of a wave of unionization efforts hitting companies around the nation, including Starbucks, Tripoli, Apple. They're not used to unionization moves in their workforce. This would be the first Amazon move by workers in California specifically. Canadian companies, Camaco and Brookfield Renewable partners both moving this morning after agreeing to buy Westinghouse Electric, which still services half of the world's nuclear power reactors. Now the deal will see Brookfield Business Partners sell Westinghouse to the two companies, both the buyer, Brookfield Renewable and seller Brookfield Business are part of the umbrella under Brookfield Asset Management. The deal comes as the world takes a renewed look at nuclear power following Russia's energy shut off to Europe and climate change problems grow. The smash hit at NASA, the agency reporting it has successfully altered the path of the asteroid di-morphus. After ramming its dark probe into it, scientists have confirmed di-morphus. Now orbits its parent asteroid in a tighter orbit that's now 32 minutes faster than before. The dark probe launched last year, sent back this video just two weeks ago before impact and it marks the first time humanity has ever altered the course of any celestial body. It also gives us one potential option for averting a planet ending catastrophe. Good to have that option. Indeed it is, it's time for our calls of the day guys. I'm at a shoot here with what is a, I would call it a blunt take on Apple head of their earnings on October 27th. Really interesting note by city analyst Jim Suvor, you see Apple shares up there slightly here in the early going. The headline of this report absolutely got me right up my alley. I love these, some of these crazier headlines and this one got me. He said we are not scared of Apple stock despite Halloween and investor fear. So he noted Apple stock, very Google SEO friendly nonetheless. He's listening, we're saying that iPhone demand continues to be very strong. They're selling more higher price products that is good. Sticky services sales, that is good. Also suggesting more of an Apple car push in 2025. So this is more of a longer term bullish take by Suvor at city. I think acknowledges some concerns here going into the quarter, some FX challenges, maybe slow amrdt beta three more up position.",https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2iE41vefT4k,6,2022-10-12 14:15:01
3097," more of an Apple car push in 2025. So this is more of a longer term bullish take by Suva at City. I think acknowledges some concerns here going into the quarter, some FX challenges, maybe some slow down China, but by and large, just trying to I think bring a sense of, hey, the guys, this is Apple. They're going to get past any rough patch brought on by the global economy. Yeah, I think one thing that we do have to note within this as well is that for the iPhone, the demand is typically going to always be there. It's just a matter of where they are in the cycle, especially because so many people are able to pay off their phones through another type of necessity, which is your telecommunications, which is your phone carrier. And so that is perhaps one of the constants. It's just a matter of how much people are willing to take on a larger contract or go after a more expensive phone if their telephone provider or their service provider is able to offer them a better deal. Now it's a larger question, of course, too, right now of where in the even the little luxuries we were talking about with Pepsi, where that also kind of dovetails on over into the technology landscape as well in the consumer tech front, do consumers look at some of the little luxuries and the wearables and say, hey, that's a little luxury. Or is my service a little luxury that I can maintain? And for Apple, they've been continuing to build out that services business can be potentially an $80 billion run rate business either by the end of this year or early next year. And so that's something they continue to watch going forward in the services and the wearables division for Apple. Yeah, even if it might see some rockiness in the short term from some of those production cuts that we've talked about. Absolutely. Also another call of the one that I'm tracking here, Norwegian Cruise Line, ticker symbol NCLH, it's smoother sailing for new region after an upgrade to buy at UBS. The analyst also setting a $15 price target on the stock here and particularly they are kind of adjusting all cruise line models. It's not just Norwegian, it's Royal Caribbean, Caribbean, Caribbean, anyway. One of the cruise line, that's pronounced the same way. They're adjusting it for all cruise line models for slightly higher expenses due to inflation. And essentially here, when you think about the broader cruise sector, of course, there's a lot of money that we've talked about goes out the door when it's a marketing type of expense that they have to look at just to re-engage with so many of the consumers out there or the voyage takers. But then it's also on the other side, how much they're actually being able to charge for tickets in this near-term period of time. And that's something that all of the analysts have continued to have to look through the profit margin models at and try to figure out exactly where that's actually going to be netting out for the cruise line operator. Yeah, interesting time to see this call because we see fuel prices back on the rise. You have been highlighting it too. We've been talking a lot about weak pricing, we ticket pricing, notably coming out of Cardinal Cruise Line. But look, we just talked to Norwegians CFO Mark Kempe last week and he said, man, is strong? We're charging higher prices. If you look at Q3 and our most recent guidance, we had said that our total net revenue per deems are expected to be up in the high single digits. So again, there's inflation is real. It is starting to level off. We are going to see some near-term pressure on margins, but we don't believe that this is going to be a long-term sustainable margin issue. As we look at our trends and our business over the next year to two years, we see margin improvements significantly. And we believe we can get back to the same margin levels we saw prior to the pandemic. There you go. Really, a bullish take-out by Kempe who came aboard on a new ship. So despite the economic slowdown, you still have Norwegian and of course all the cruise lines, they order these ships well in advance, but still delivering a mighty new, beautiful ship called, I think it was the Prima. Right. And I'll just add just very briefly here as well within this call. They said they see this as the most preferred name and it's due to relatively greater concentration of domestic passengers, strong pricing given its higher exposure to the luxury segment. And the luxury consumer, whether it's across retail, consumer tech, and then even within the cruise line operators right now, continually being cited as one of the points of strength. All right, let's talk coffee. Okay. Dutch Bros. Bit of a perk up. I'm watching shares of Dutch Brothers this morning. Dutch Bro, I think it's technically Dutch Bros. It's a Brook to Palmitrae right there. Dutch Bros. I think Dutch Bros. It's a Brook to Palmitrae right there. Dutch Bros. It's a Morgan Chase upgrade to the SAC to overweight with a $38 price target. What's interesting here is the SAC was up earlier as much as 5%, so it's actually, you know, we've seen that that gain, those gains come back a little bit. But the analysts there, JPMorgan, saying the sell-up has made it attractive.",https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2iE41vefT4k,7,2022-10-12 14:19:24
3098," Up earlier, as much as 5%, so it's actually, you know, we've seen that those gains come back a little bit, but the analyst there, JP Morgan, saying the sell-up has made it attractive, sites that change permanence over time through differentiated drinks. Some interesting stuff here. 56% of customers under 25 drink, 80% cold beverages, and 60% of sales afternoon. And that's sort of more discretionary, so maybe that's a little bit more vulnerable. Oh, I guess not. Yeah, everybody's complaining about Insomnia. Yeah, think if you're drinking a giant cold brew afternoon, it could be also you're looking at your phone for the two hours before bed. That doesn't help either. But I digress. The point is here is that the analyst at JP Morgan likes Dutch bros and says that employment and stable gas braces are key to more predictable sales here, but that the company is in decent position here, and it has the capital it needs to grow the business. I think I'm going to take off a couple days from the office. I'm just going to visit a Dutch bros. Maybe it'll be my vacation. I see all the photos posted on Instagram on Twitter. People are obsessed with Dutch bros coffee. It looks beautiful, and I think it has more caffeine in some cases depending on what you order than Starbucks. That's where I'm going vacation. I'm going to go visit a Dutch bros. Oh, wait. OK, everybody, can we clip this please? Right, and since you just promised, he is going to take out vacations. I suggest that. You can miss that. That's a promise. I suggest that. I'm going to go visit Dutch bros, and I'm going to report from outside of Dutch bros with my phone. You're not allowed to log on. It's live here. I'm not allowed to log on. You're on vacation. That's what I'm declaring here. Unilaterally. Total processing. All right, coming up, a possible shake of forgate workers. We're going to speak with the CEO of Fiverr about that, and also a new study that the company is out with next.",https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2iE41vefT4k,8,2022-10-12 14:23:59
3099," Go All On Sing With Me!! The majority of bosses won employees back in the office full time. The new survey from Fiverr found that 52% of employers want their workers back in person five days a week. But 42% workers say they would consider quitting if that were the case. Fiverr CEO, Micah Kaufman, joined us now. Fiverr by the way, a platform for freelance workers. It's good to see you. So there's obviously tension here, right? There is this ongoing tension in the market. How do you think it ends up resolving itself? Thanks for having me on the show again. We're definitely seeing a very polarized view between managers and employees. And I think that if there's something very clear is that managers want this to be 2019 again. And employees cannot move back from having the experience of the past two or three years. And wanting to have more flexibility into into the work. I think that some of that is going to be resolved. But the fact that those employees are actually going to leave. And I think in order to receive that level of flexibility a lot of them are actually going to turn into freelancing, which allows them to. Define the level of flexibility that they are looking for. Okay, so that kind of answers or begin stands are my next question at least, which is where where would they go if they if they did leave there still for a lot of the companies that are either in a hybrid or purely virtual reality. For their workplace and collaboration, there's still some of the hiring freezes that are in place. Some places looking at cutting and trimming their staff. So where would the opportunities be to still retain that virtual lifestyle, even if going to or looking for other employment opportunities. That's correct. I think that a lot of companies, those who are freezing or rethinking the way they want to employ talent. And they're really making a shift between fixed expenses and variable expenses. And when you think about variable expenses, a lot of it is being answered by free answers. So a lot of the talent that are going to continue looking for that level of flexibility are going to turn into freelancing and we're seeing. Very high levels of talent coming to us to five or in similar platforms to look for that level of flexibility. I mean, a recession would mean a just a hiring boom for freelancers. I think that at some point, yes, because again, I think that more and more companies are thinking about the shift between between fixed and variable expenses. So obviously that is going to fuel if you if you go back to the wake of the previous recession right around 2009. And we've we've saw a boom in in freelancing. We saw a boom in new business formation. And a lot of these businesses cannot actually afford full time employees. So they turn into platforms such as fiber to find this talent. Mike, at the same time, we've got now this proposal, although it's sort of vague on the part of the Biden administration to reclassify workers, which there's some thinking that it might eventually make some workers who are classified as freelance before. To come on the books full time. Any thoughts on that or the likelihood of that happening in the effect that that could have on your business. Yeah, I think that we with the fact that freelancing is becoming a huge force. In in the workplace, statistics show that by the end of this day. It by 2030. 50% of talent is going to be engaging and friend-assing in some form or the other. Policie makers are trying to figure out what to do with this huge cohort.",https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2iE41vefT4k,9,2022-10-12 14:28:17
3100," 50% of talent is going to be engaging in freelancing in some form or the other. Policy makers are trying to figure out what to do with this huge cohort. And I think that in this space we need to make a distinction between skilled and unskilled labor. So if you look at Fiverr as an example, on Fiverr, freelancers have total freedom regarding their work. What they offer, when they offer it, and from where. So that level of freedom is something that is highly sought for, but it also comes with a price. I mean, you can't lead a totally free lifestyle and then expect to be considered to be a full-time employee. In other aspect of gig economy, maybe the situation is slightly different because they have less freedom on what they offer and how much they charge for it. This has been in the making for quite a long time. And we're actually working close with policymakers to figure out how. You know, the level of how we can level the plane field for freelancers in aspects such as access to affordable medical insurance. But that said, as I said, if you want to lead the lifestyle that allows you total freedom, you can't also expect to be considered as a full-time employee when you're not. Michael, just while we have you, over the past recessions where the gig economy roles have been available, we've seen this flow into some of the roles for freelancers or even just workers who are looking to kind of take their own employment under their own control. For your business at Fiverr, given some of the investments that you've made into the business to try and unlock these larger projects, more engagement, what from the Fiverr perspective would you be kind of looking towards to really navigate a recession as well? Well, yourself as a business. Yeah. So I think that a lot of businesses we've talked about fixed versus variable expenses. I think that a lot of businesses are actually focusing on identifying their core competencies and hiring full-time around those core competencies and looking for the more peripheral areas of expertise in turning into freelancers around those those types of expertise. If your core is technology, maybe something that is not in your core is going to be marketing or design in which cases they start to think about how to integrate freelancers into their workflows. And this is why we've seen the appearance of the chief freelancer officer, which is which is a new role within companies within HR that thinks about how to integrate that level of talent into organizations. We're seeing that rising throughout the past few years and this is accelerating right now. Micah, good to see you. Thanks for being here. Micah Kaufman, who is Fiverr CEO. Appreciate it. Thank you.

3101," Please share, comment and subscribe to my channel. Thank you. share of Uber and Lyft and DoorDash are back on the rise today after getting slammed on Tuesday after the Biden administration proposed to change the classification of gig workers that could revise them from independent contractors to employees. Fox Advisors founder and CEO Stephen Fox joins us now for some analysis on this. Stephen, has this now been priced in any potential change that may come in the first half of next year? It isn't now fully priced into these stocks. You know, actually I think it's more than priced into the stocks. I think regulatory concerns have been sort of the hand-ranging event since these companies went public. And what we've seen is that the companies have been able to manage through these events and actually continue to improve their business model. So I think it's being overdone at this point. Lyft has said nothing is immediately going to change about its business model just yet. Of course, that's what the company would say. Given the fact that yeah, there's still a lot of discussion that has to take place in the near term in order to see any type of reclassification go forward. But what extent should customers at the end of the day, if this does move forward, expect their prices, their fares to also have to be adjusted? Yeah, that's a great point because all the companies obviously could still raise prices to offset any higher costs. I think it's also important to keep in mind that what happens at the federal level is independent of what happens at the state level. So companies have been in discussions with various states. I think the most encouraging thing you saw without out of the state of Washington this year, which signed into law in an independent contractor plus agreement, which basically allows for some benefits. Sort of this IC plus gives the drivers flexibility plus benefits. And the companies are working to pass those costs through the customers and also reducing other costs tied to other pieces of the business to offset. Some higher costs as well. Steven, as we potentially go into a recession, what effect will that have on the sort of driver service dynamic? In other words, could there potentially be more people who are available to be drivers? Unfortunately, if there are layoffs or just do a burn lift getaway with paying them less? Like, what are going to be all those knock on effects? Yeah, I don't think Uber and lift getaway with paying them less, especially in this political environment. And I don't think they're looking to pay them less. I think if you go back and look what the companies have done, forget about what they've said, but what they've done for their drivers specifically over the last couple of years, they've worked to make their expenses come down through various methods. They've also worked to make their time on the network much more efficient. Obviously, if they're sitting around waiting for a ride, it's not as efficient. So it's really important to step back and say, okay, in a weaker economy, how dependent it has the consumer become on these rideshare opportunities, whether to drive or also to ride, and how do the network utilization rates look? On top of that, the real on-tap market is still the enterprise. So large.",https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2iE41vefT4k,11,2022-10-12 14:36:40
3102," whether to drive or also to ride and how do the network utilization rates look. On top of that, the real on-cat market is still the enterprise. So large companies with multiple pockets of spending on transportation and food delivery. As they consolidate those things, those are real profitable opportunities for lift and uber that they can also translate into their drivers to make money. Right, a lot of focus on driver utilization to make it more incentivized in order for drivers to actually want to be on the platform and be able to take advantage of more rides. But then there's also the thought of if this goes through and that changes the classification, does that actually make it more intriguing for new drivers to sign up and increase the supply side of this broader kind of supply demand equation that ultimately has a major delta on prices here for consumers? Yeah, so one of the interesting things that I think Wall Street doesn't appreciate enough is that when you talk about these networks, the companies aren't playing checkers. It's more like three-dimensional chess. So when you look at supply versus demand, like take the UK, for instance, where uber is now providing benefits to the drivers while giving them flexibility, they're cost have gone up, but then other costs have gone down in terms of actual providing, you know, looking at driver incentives, for example, they don't have to provide as many. And so they're attracting probably more drivers now, passing on some of the cost of their customers, but competition has followed. So you're getting a little bit of that network benefit, I think. How it plays out in the US is going to be on a region by region basis. But generally speaking, I think the companies have going to manage through this and continue to march towards ebic goggles where they've been set, like at Lyft and Uber. Fox Advisors founder and CEO Steven Fox. Thanks so much for the time today, Steve. Thank you. A major head count reduction is reportedly on the horizon for Intel. Thousands of employees are expected to be laid off, according to Bloomberg. It's the chip maker looks to take cost-cutting measures. Yeah, we'll finance this Dan Hally, going to join us now for the deta. And we're going to go to Dan after the break here. We'll be right back.",https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2iE41vefT4k,12,2022-10-12 14:40:52
3103," Music Welcome back everyone. A major head count reduction reported on the horizon for Intel. Thousands of employees expected to be laid off according to Bloomberg as the chipmaker looks to take cost-cutting measures. Yahoo! Finances, Dan Howley joins us now to share the details with us. Dan, what do we know so far? It looks like we're going to see potentially thousands of layoffs at Intel. The company is basically struggling with slowing demand in the PC market, not just slowing sales across the board when it comes to things like servers, just as we started to see interest rates rise. And that's impacting its bottom line. And so there could be as many as thousands of these kinds of layoffs. The company also is dealing with those kinds of repeated slowdown that we've seen in the PC market. Gartner had said that the market actually collapsed 19.5% in Q3 2022. So it really doesn't look great for Intel at this point. Other chip companies are dealing with the same issues. But Intel is at this point kind of trying to turn itself around. They said that they're going to build that huge mega complex in Ohio. It's not going to look good for employees that they're getting laid off. It does look like the departments are going to be something along the lines of marketing and sales. And the company does have more than 100,000 employees. So it's not as though it's clearing house by any stretch of the imagination, but it could be as many as 10% 20% of employees. Yeah, and obviously this is part of the moves that we've been seeing by many of the chip makers. Thanks, Dan. Appreciate it. Earlier this week, the Board of Directors officially approved XPO logistics plan separation of its freight brokerage business. The company also named a new CFO. I had the chance to speak to the company's current CEO and founder, Brad Jacobs, about the restructuring at the company. I'm here at the Greenwich Economic Forum with Brad Jacobs, the founder and CEO of XPO logistics, although not for much longer. Brad is great to see you in person. And I say not for much longer, of course, because the company is spinning off RXO, which is logistics business. You just announced what that's effective on November 1st, I believe. So talk to me about what's happening now, what the process feels like, and what investors can expect from the two companies. It's very exciting. After 10 months of working really hard with large number of people working long hours, we're this close to the spin. And we'll create two separate companies that will be an inch wide and a mile deep in what they do. And therefore, they're likely to do it much better. So we'll have a pure play less than truck load business. That'll be XPO. And we'll have a pure play non-asset truck brokerage business called RXO, which is best in class truck broker. So it's very exciting. And you're not going to be running the day-to-day business any longer. Do you have some plans yet for what the next thing, the next Brad Jacobs chapter is going to be yet? Well, I want to try to repeat what I've done before, which is to have companies that over a 10-year period or so create at least 10 times return on the initial capital. And so I'm not a private equity firm in trying to make two or three X. And that's not my game. I go for things that are 20X, 30X, the big ones. So I'm looking for that. I'm looking for the next big thing. And where any hints of what in what industry or where you think the opportunities are, especially right now, it's tricky time, right? It's the best time. Just start a business when valuations are low and it's fear out there and there's not a lot of competition because a lot of people are nervous about not being courageous because they're nervous about where the economy is going and so forth. That's when you want to get it. That's when you want to buy. When valuations are reasonable and there's not a lot of competition. But I don't know. I'm still gainfully employed at CEO for a few more weeks. Sorry to get you to, don't mean to get you to jump ahead too soon. But let's talk a little bit more about the environment. You and I were just talking.",https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2iE41vefT4k,13,2022-10-12 14:45:16
3104," I don't know. I'm still gainfully employed at CEO for a few more weeks. Sorry to get you to, don't mean to get you to jump ahead too soon. But let's talk a little bit more about the environment. You and I were just talking before now about all of the negativity that we're hearing, right? From Redalio to Jamie Dimon, the IMF cutting, it's GDP forecast. Altruid Jones and all of it. Yeah, all of it. I mean, you have a really good figure on the pulse of what's going on in the economy because of moving things around. So what do you see? So I don't always get it right. I often get it right, but not half a percent of the time. My take is we're probably, so when you see all these really great minds that will come out and universally say, oh, it's really bad coming up. That's usually historically been the final pre-capitulation phase. So everyone agrees that, oh, it's really bad. And then you have the final plunge. That's the time to buy when everybody said, oh, it's down this, it's going to keep going down more. That's the time to do it. So I'm really having my antennas up for it because I don't think I don't think this downturn, which is likely to happen, is going to last for a long time. And don't forget, there's two things. There's the economy and there's the market. Yes. And the market is usually a couple quarters ahead of the economy. Right. So we could see, so the capitulation you're talking about is the market. In the market. Yes, the economy might lag that. Yeah, economy could lag. As the trade's go up, as quantitative tightening gets tighter, you could see a significant slowing in the economy. But the world has become such a small world and so well informed and so many people understand economics now. It didn't turn the great financial crisis. I don't think it will last long. I think there'll be such pressure to, okay, now we reduced inflation. Okay, now let's get some growth going again. I don't expect a long, long downturn. I expect a short, maybe significant downturn. Now, one of the things that was a detail in the latest jobs report made me think of you. And that had to do with trucker jobs, which fell by 11,000 in the month of September. And I'm just curious what that tells us. The number of truckers hired, I should say, fell by 11,000. A metric that we watch very closely, Julie, is for every truck driver posting that we post, how many people apply for it. That's about 45% just in the last several months. So there's a lot more people coming back into the job market as the economy gets a little tougher. So there's the pendulum is swinging on that. It's don't get me wrong. It's still very tough to hire truck drivers. It's a lot less tough than it was even a few months ago. The inventory climbs that we are seeing by a lot of not just the retailers, but in other industries as well. How is that affecting your business and the loads of things that you guys are trucking around? Well, the transportation business does better. The industry is a whole when inventory is a low, not high. There's more restocking and there's more goods being moved. But what you see right now is really interesting. As a result of all the craziness of the pandemic, people got the wrong, they have a lot of inventory, but it's often the wrong inventory. They have too much of this and too little of that. So there's still a lot of activity. So goods are still flowing. Goods are still flowing, but not as much as more. Not as much. But it's an interesting dichotomy. You observe the same thing. I observe today at the Greenwich Economic Forum. It's pretty down beat. I'm sure you die. People have their warrior face design. When you talk to my echo chambers a little bit different, my echo chamber is CEOs of large companies. They're not as large companies, entrepreneurs or small businesses who need their goods move. And they're not as negative. They're not as positive as they were say a year ago. They're less positive, but they're generally growing. They're not contracting. They're just growing less. All right. I have one final fun question for you. The Tesla semi. How much is that going to change the trucking industry? It depends on the price point. So we're a partner to one of the big OEMs for their electric vehicle semis. And actually we call them semis. The semis. The CUS be semi conductor semis. The CUS be semi conductor semis. And we call them semis. Sorry. No, we're talking about that. But the semis are, they're beautiful and the truck drivers love them and they're slick and they're well designed and they accelerate fast and they're safe and they've all kinds of gizziness in them. But they're really expensive. And so the economics aren't there yet. If the economic, if the technology advanced.",https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2iE41vefT4k,14,2022-10-12 14:49:45
3105," They accelerate fast and are safe. They've all kinds of gizmos in them. But they're really expensive. And so the economics aren't there yet. Now, if the technology advances and the manufacturing processes advances such that they become cost effective, yet can be very transformative. Makes sense. All right, Brad Jacobs of XBO, thank you so much. It was great to see you in person. Really appreciate it. Pleasure to mind. Thanks. So it was fun there because Brad was sort of an antidote to a lot of the darkness. I mean, he's not saying everything is wonky-dorian, fantastic. But part of it is the force of his personality. Part of it is what he's seeing on the ground. He was a little bit of a counterbalance to some of the worst-case scenarios that we're hearing out there. You say tomato. I say tomato. Yeah, exactly. That means it's every time I say tomato. It was interesting to what he said, though, about the Tesla semi-truck. It's going to be fascinating when those trucks eventually hit the road. Because at some point, it sets a stage for driverless semi-trucks in this country. Yes, but as he said, the price has to come down. Absolutely. It's going to make sense, which makes sense. Right. Also a critical time for the business, given the spin-off that's moving forward and Drew Wilkerson is going to be the new CEO of that spin-off. And he had, even in this most recent earnings period, talked about how the company has a long track record of growing gross profit even through economic cycles. And they're confident right now. They're going to continue to do it. I, for one, can't wait to see what Brad is going to do next. The next thing he's going to tackle. It's tough to see him leave this industry. He is this industry.

3106," Welcome back everyone. Starting for a cup of time, three stories, one minute each. We start with this today. Elon Musk really capitalizing on his last name with a fragrance launch via his infrastructure business, the boring company. Yes, the same company that sold the flame thrower is now bringing you burnt hair for just $100 here. Okay, so $100 new perfume from Elon Musk. I don't know if I'm a buyer on this. We've already talked about how well. I'm a big buyer. I'm all, I want to be a buyer. I want to smell like sweat, success, and money. And maybe that's in this bottle. I'm down. Sign me up for a hundred dollars. Boom, done. In. I want it. I actually do. I want to try it. I love clones. This goes back to when I was a child. This isn't joke thing. Do you think it's actually going to smell good? I think it's going to smell good. I'm bullish on it. Everything that the boring company has sold has basically been subtype of joke, whether it's short shorts or whether it's flame throwers. But it's more here. The flame thrower at least worked. I would have to imagine the smells somewhat kind of. I think it smells because it doesn't actually smell like burnt hair. I would say Tom Ford smells a little burnt. The pen is one you get and he spent like $300 on it. I mean, your figure is going to know some of the best scientists in the world. So somebody's got a good chemical equation perhaps out there for the best selling you're not getting this to hobby, Julie. You're not getting this to hobby. No. Not getting it to hobby. Okay.

And that's a publicly traded company with a ticker page on Y'all. And the money that says the Rumbass liquor is perfect for parents looking to Lego during the holidays. I love me, some Christmas and holiday season eggnog. I'm just confused why this took 20 plus years to get to the market. This is great. I love it. 40 proof. 40 proof. I mean, look, we need more. We need more toasty 40 proof eggnog out there. We're going to get ham. We're going to get ham right here. Do you know? No. No. No. No. I'm not getting any money from Kellogg. I don't need to know. I'm just pro eggnog. We already know what you make. I like it. Eggnog is good. I found you a eggnog on the market already. I'm not sure what makes this eggnog any different from the better than any other eggnog. I mean, this is like a ready to drink cocktail drink. Right. That exists. Does not exist already. Except this eggnog in eggnog. Like, it's really hard to buy a thing of eggnog and pour some rum in it. We just taste like waffle. It's already done for you. It's like what Cardi B did with the whip shots for us. Like, we already knew we were whipped cream. We already knew we liked shots. And then we had whip shots. Now we've got eggnog. I think it's a long take. What's the next one? Let's talk about something else to drink Starbucks. It's taking us for a awards program to new heights through a partnership with Delta Airlines. The coffee roaster is going to give app users 150 stars and 500 miles for linking accounts. Double stars and days flying with Delta and one mile per dollar spend. Good, more miles that you can't do anything with fabulous. Sorry. Are you expecting a tone for me to make eggnog? I'm feeling a little skeptical. I'm really thinking. I'm just going to use these for awards to get that eggo eggnog. So I'm excited about it. No, it doesn't go that way. It goes the other way. So I can't use eggnog. Am I misunderstanding this? I'm not understanding this. It's the Starbucks points towards Delta. Okay, here's the details. 150 stars, 500 miles when you link those accounts. Okay. So you get the double stars on Delta travel days. So like if you buy a Starbucks when you're flying on Delta at the airport, you get more stars. And you get one mile per one dollar spend at Starbucks. I have to add a special code and concur. Like, can I use this and concur? I feel like what I need right now is that GIF with like the guy with the calculations on the board behind him to figure out exactly how to do that. It's still better than Duncan. It's still better than what Duncan did this week. I'm still waiting to get my free coffee. I think I have 600 more points to go. It's terrible. I mean, but Starbucks has had one of the better rewards out there. And for the companies that have done more digital disruption for that customer touchpoint, I mean, Starbucks. All these companies should just copy Starbucks. Why try to reinvent any of the Starbucks? People love their rewards program. It's a huge driver of their business. Let's take a look at markets.

It's good to have you in person I absolutely I know I feel like we know each other. Yeah, yeah, yeah, first time we went Pretty fitting right we're talking about earning season the bar is pretty low going into this, but you see Set yourself up for even more disappointment. I do I really see them the market is hitting about 3432 I mean Pepsi don't surprise on the upside So if it maybe that's that's a little bit of an indicator that expectations have come low enough that that we but we have the dollar I mean the dollar was such a headwind in in Q3 and I think you've got a lot of tech companies that are gonna struggle So who's gonna do well probably the energy companies? We will probably see industrials do okay. We've seen some you know energy companies are gonna continue to print money here at $80 or $90 barrel oil So I think the sectors are gonna matter individual company performance is gonna matter and what their CEOs did But I think it's like you got to check a box on what EPS is But I think more so everybody wants to know guidance What does this look like going forward how much pressure is it gonna happen with the dollar? Who's doing job cuts? I mean it's expected intel is gonna announce job cuts to follow Microsoft follow snap You know, so we're seeing a lot of job cuts cutting in the technology sector Definitely nervous going to full earning season financials really kick it off and we'll see did they pick up net interest in Commer they having to put too many reserves not seeing any mortgages You know we've definitely seen the mortgages almost grind to a halt and then investment banking has been just difficult this year So banks may startle yeah, so the four looking statements are what we're looking for going into these results But also you know, it seems to be still a bit of a debate if you could argue that that you know Where exactly we are in terms of the macro picture you have those comments coming in from president Biden saying that he doesn't Expect a recession. Obviously he's the president. He's not gonna say things are gonna get worse But we also got those comments from Jamie Dimon, which seems to suggest there are more rough patches ahead How do you view that so I think the fact the president said the R word, you know if you're a a Fan of the the show West Wing with a bagel word, you know that nobody wants to say the R word is bagel time But the fact the president is acknowledging it might be a slight recession That has to mean they're even acknowledging the slowdown is coming the feds acknowledges the slowdown is coming They're trying to slow it down to slow down inflation. I'm with Jamie Dimon I actually think we're in a recession I know we can argue the definition of recession and that's technically never's job But if you look at the slowdown where we're going with growth What's happening with inflation? What's happening with the hawkish fed? Definitely on Jamie Dimon's that there's a little more pain coming not sure I'm full. I am out for right They came out with like hey expect another 20% down like this. There's more pain coming Everybody's gonna feel recession in 23 feel like that might be a tad draconian at this point But I do think we're still gonna see the effects remember the lag between rate hikes and when we feel in the labor market It's about 12 months So the question is you know, where do you position yourself if that slowdown is already underway You've been bullish on energy for quite some time and you know There's there's questions right now especially with the moves on that we saw from OPEC last week about Whether things are really going to start to take up and we have seen them take up a little Where are you positioned in some of those big names sure we we did actually pull a little bit back to energy",https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2iE41vefT4k,18,2022-10-12 15:06:59
3109," to speak about whether things are really going to start to take up. And we have seen them take up a little. Where are you positioned in some of those big names? Sure. We did actually pull a little bit back to energy, but we're still overweight. We were very, very overweight. We pulled that back a little bit in June, but we still like a lot of it. So we like the U.S. EMPs, right? The, to get it out of the ground in the Permian area is about $30, $40 a barrel. And you haven't seen the, the rig count really jump up. We're at 765 total rigs. We're still below pre-piannebic levels. And the U.S. has now become a net exporter of petroleum products, because we are picking up market share from what Russia is stepping back in. And there are some big sanctions coming in December from the EU, and it's going to hit the shipping and the tankers, because they're not going to insure them. And if nobody's insuring an oil cargo, which like I believe something like 95% of insurance is issued by the UK in the Euro area. So I see opportunity in U.S. energy producers. We liked our Devon, you know, Diamondback announced the acquisition today. We really like the Shaneer. It's a natural gas exporter. We think the gas story, because we feel like the story of energy security for the next decade. Yes, EVs are coming, yes, solar's coming. Have we hit peak oil demand? We'll see. But we also see also the slit that we need people buying energy from allies. You know, when we're dealing with that with Saudi Arabia right now, that is Saudi Arabia really an ally, or to sound like millennial self. Are they a friend of me? Like we're friends with them a little bit. But in reality, we're not really. And if you look at the geopolitical macro view, you have maimed your players that we may have massive political shifts in. We have Saudi Arabia. We have Iran. And we have Venezuela. And we're slightly not saying this is a grand decision and picking sides here, but we're slightly warming up to Venezuela, because we realize how to Arabia really is not working on our best interests right now. Yeah, I mean, we did hear the President comment on the yesterday suggesting that there could be more moves coming against Saudi Arabia on the back of that decision. So energy, it sounds like you're still, you pulled back a bit, but you're still positive on it in this environment. Yeah. What are some other names that you think are getting overlooked right now that offer real value? So, and my Costco, I'll talk about Costco anytime I can get it. I love my Costco. Not the stock itself. I'm talking about the company. But not even the $1.50 hotdog, but they are also picking up inventory. So this second Amazon Prime Day that we've gotten is not just because Amazon is trying to be nice to us. They're trying to dump inventory. Everybody's got inventory. Nike's got inventory. So the Costco's and the TJ Maxx of the world that are kind of the off brand. They're not beholden to any brand names. So they're picking up cheap inventory and they're moving it. They're a discount store. They're 75% in the US. The bulk of their international exposures, Canada, which is held up better. So I think they're going to have a little bit less currency effects. I like them. I like a really boring name, IBM. I think they're a great place to hide. They've got a strong dividend yield. I think as a service and a tech company goes tech spending, it's going to continue. And because of the way they're positioned, I think they're going to see a little bit more sustainability and revenues. Because that's what we're looking at right now. As we move forward and things get pressured, who's going to still make money and who's at risk of being cut? And so I think they're very well positioned. They're reasonably valued. But I think they still have a lot of growth. They've changed who they were. And people realize IBM is a very old company, but they've redeveloped themselves multiple, multiple times. They sold off Lenovo, got out of the PC business. And now they're in the hybrid cloud and AI and data consulting. And I see data and data and healthcare as a great place to be. And the last place playing defense is healthcare, like a United Health. Great name to be in right now. And again, a little bit less effect with the dollar. So some of these names that have more revenues coming from the US, I think also will hold up a little bit better. Yeah, names from three very different sectors. But diversification is what we keep hearing. Victoria Green, good to have you in studio today. Yeah, thank you so much for having me. Joining us from G-Scrider Private Wealth. Well, let's take a look at oil now as OPEC flashes its forecast for global crude demand. Yahoo Finance is Jared Blyckrey here with more on the price action. Jared, I guess in some ways, this is OPEC's wave justifying that cut that we got last week. I think so. That took the administration also, the Democrats by surprise. In fact, a lot of people surprised by that because a slash of 2.1 million barrels per day is a lot. Now, OPEC Plus has been operating under capacity. So it's really only an effective cut of about 1 million barrels per day. That is still a lot. And it has house Democrats up in arms and some of the Senate leaders as well, Dick Durbin, offering up some bills that have been offered previously in the year and these have to do.",https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2iE41vefT4k,19,2022-10-12 15:11:31
3110," Up in arms and some of the Senator, Senate leaders as well, Dick Durbin offering up some bills that have been offered previously in the year. And these have to do with the potential altering the relationship that the U.S. has with Saudi Arabia. We know the U.S. just visited. President Biden just visited Saudi Arabia. But all of this is one month ahead of the midterm. So we know how gas prices and energy prices factor into politics. So not surprised to see this, but I believe there is a resolution introduced by three Democrats that would suspend military operations and protections in Saudi Arabia and also some sales of arms. And that's a huge deal. There's $100 billion in active tickets with respect to the U.S. and defense systems out there with respect to Saudi Arabia. Now here are crude oil futures. In today, you can see just kind of sinking here after the 8 AM hour. But here's a year to date. We just climbed above 91 dollars per barrel, but still well in the lower end of this range. We just broke out. And so with energy as the leading sector here, you got to ask yourself, and I'm going to go to our sector action and put a year to date on it. With energy, the leading sector, what are the options here? Victoria Green, our previous guest, mentioning that a lot of these companies, these energy companies are minting money. And with respect to the supply situation of Saudi Arabia isn't playing ball. Guess what, Venezuela. She mentioned them too. They have some of the largest holdings of oil reserves in the entire world. And they are on this side of the world in the West. So maybe we're going to see some increase in terms of interest with respect to repairing those foreign relations. And maybe easing some of those sanctions. I believe Chevron still has a presence there. So we'll have to see what comes of this. Ex-L.E., by the way, still up 43% for the year. Okay, Jared Blickrey, thanks so much for that. Well, Pepsi, PepsiCo seeing a big boost after the food giant blew away profit estimates with Frito-Lay, North America powering PepsiCo's net revenue. Take a look at the stock there, up nearly 5%. The company also raising its forecast, now expecting its full year organic revenue to increase 12%. We've got our very own Brian Sasi here with outfit change from the last hour. I just put it up please. This is my outfit I watch on Sunday football. You know, I feel a little Pepsi Max, but I'm both in box and ice and you're good to go. Which is fitting because we're talking about snacks. Turns out snacks are pretty resilient even in the face of cost rises. Yeah, you know, I don't want to bury the lead here. Bottom line is we talk to PepsiCo, CFO, Hugh Johnson, he said, hey, yeah, we'll find it steam. We're pushing through price increases because we're still dealing with high levels of inflation. And despite those price increases, people are still out there buying lots of chips and lots of soda. Take a listen. Okay, I guess we don't have that. We don't have that, but still, Johnson came out, really I think struck a bullish tone. So in addition to that, really saying how he, they just implemented more price increases in the fourth quarter. What he did not want to do is really provide any 2023 guidance. That is typically what PepsiCo does. He did not provide that on the conference call, but ultimately said that's not where they're going to go yet too. We were just also showing pictures of Gatorade. I would expect a big push by Gatorade more into the energy drink category next year. They will launch that what they're calling their new fast Twitch product, 200 milligrams of caffeine in the early part of next year in partnership with the NFL. That should be the case. 200 milligrams of... Oh, right on my alley. I'm so psyched to get a walk out. You're going to have more than one of those, right? Oh, you better go. Oh, absolutely. When you talk about those cost increases, how much of it is it to offset? I mean, it's clearly there to offset the price increases they're seeing internally from the materials, everything that goes into making all these stacks, but at the same time, is it enough to offset what they're seeing internally? Yeah, I would say they have. Pepsi was out here this morning with, I think in earnings, be nobody on the street expected. That's why the stock is ripping higher here for Pepsi on earnings. They, that's a pretty big move. That's why it's the hottest ticker on the Yow Finance platform. This quarter's positively surprised a lot of folks on the street over the next coming days. I would not be surprised to see upgrades on Pepsi co-stock, upgrades in price targets, upgrades in earnings estimates because it's clear that they have pricing power. And I think the focus now turns onto Coca-Cola to see if they could report more of the same. First instinct is yes, you will probably see a very strong quarter from Coca-Cola. The only red flag I would call out is maybe more currency exposure for Coca-Cola than Pepsi-Cola, but still Coca-Cola is teed up for a very strong quarter now. Yeah, currency exposure, one, we're going to continue a year throughout the earnings season.",https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2iE41vefT4k,20,2022-10-12 15:15:49
3111," Flag I would call out as maybe more currency exposure for Coca-Cola and Pepsi code but still Coca-Cola is teed up for a very strong core now. Yeah, currency exposure one we're going to continue to hear throughout the earnings season. Brian Sasi, thanks so much. Thanks. Well, shares of Intel aren't focused today as the company reportedly considers major job cuts. That stock is up right now but it did hit a new 52-week low today. Bloomberg reporting the chipmaker plans to announce the reductions around its quarterly results on October 27th. News of the cuts come as the company sees declining demand for its products especially its PC processors. It's a key revenue driver for the company. Bloomberg reports the reductions could be as high as 20% of staff in some divisions. Well coming up from changing our office to watching the office meta labels the QuestPro a powerful device for productivity and announces tie-ups with Microsoft and NBC universal. Dan Halle is going to break down the announcement for us on the other side. Well meta has unveiled its new virtual reality headset with a price tag and I watering $1,500. The device isn't aimed at gamers it's being more positioned as a work use tool. Those credentials bolster by an appearance from Microsoft's very own CEO Satya Nadella at the big event. Yaku finances Dan Halle has all of the details Dan I guess you could argue the device is a little less clunkyer but let's talk about the technology and how this helps meta accelerate their vision of the metaverse. Does it though I don't know if it does this is a $1,500 headset it's really geared towards professionals you know as you said it's not really geared towards gamers although part of the conference or you know the developers conference that they were running had a huge focus on gamers and how",https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2iE41vefT4k,21,2022-10-12 15:19:42
3112," professionals, as you said, it's not really here towards gamers, although part of the conference or the developer's conference that they were running had a huge focus on gamers and how they want to bring more game developers in and talk about how they're offering more in that game developers are making billions or rather millions through the platform. So they really did put that heavy emphasis on gaming. The headset, though, as you said, seemed to be focused more on the idea of work and being able to have these kind of meetings in the metaverse where you can sit down with people from around the world and easily chat without having to do it via video conference, which I'm not sure that too many people will find that super appealing when they have to strap a headset on that is heavier than the current quest, albeit according to people who've used it a little bit better weighted and less hot. So it really was kind of a mixed bag. The technology is supposed to be better with better visuals, pedographics, improved lenses. There's the ability to see the outside world in color. You could do that sort of with the quest, too, but not really with full color at all. So yeah, it really does ring to be seen if this is actually going to start pushing the metaverse idea forward. It still seems like it's quite a ways off before it becomes something that the average consumer says, I got to go out and get this headset and then use it all the time because they've sold something like 10 million headsets or more, but how often are they being used? I think the real question, how often are people picking them up, going back daily and jumping into things like check email, talk to people, access kind of the big displays that you might get in the metaverse. When instead you could just fire a computer and do that quicker. Yeah, I mean, it is about that transition we talked about so much. It's not so seamless going from the real world to the virtual world, although I have to say, Dan, I'm just really excited that Avatar's getting lights. You can talk about that. I mean, that's a good sign, right? Technology's advancing. We talked about Satya Nadella making a surprise appearance there. What's this partnership about between meta and Microsoft? Yeah, so this is about their team's mesh software and it's really, you know, they're both going hard as far as the ability to get this kind of work into the metaverse where you can sit down and have meetings with people chat with them around a virtual conference table. You know, Microsoft already offers a team's chat where you can do video chatting with your colleagues through your laptop or your smart phone. So, you know, it just kind of feels odd that you can fire up something so easily that you can carry with you and have conversations with people. Sure, you're not around a virtual conference table. You're not able to virtually whiteboard the way you might want to, although there is a whiteboard feature for video chatting with Microsoft teams when you do use the laptop. But, you know, it does kind of point to how both companies don't want to miss the boat. It could potentially be a big piece of hardware and software down the line just like they did with the smartphone. You'll remember Facebook tried to launch a phone. Microsoft had their phone line, Windows OS, mobile OS wasn't as bad as people thought. But they also did lean into gaming. So part of Microsoft's X Cloud, their cloud gaming platform will be available on the quest. And so you see this kind of balance between or attempt to balance between gamers and people who are working. It feels as though they're trying to make a PC when the PC already exists. This one you just have to put on your head. All this of course coming is a medic kind of keeps a close watch in their rearview mirror, right? With Apple, it's expected to come out with their headset soon. Dan Halley is always thanks so much for that. We are continuing to monitor some of those layoffs coming out of Warner Brothers Discovery. This is all part of the company's drive to cut costs. It's now affecting the Warner Brothers TV studio. Yahoo! Finance is Ali Canal following that story for us. And Ali, do we have a sense of just how many job cuts are coming? Yeah, we do. Yesterday we got the announcement that the TV studio has been affected. That segment cut 26% of its head count, aka 125 positions across scripted, unscripted, and animation. And that translated to 82 staffers being laid off. And then the company opted not to fill an additional 43 vacant positions. But there's another big cut that the company made. They are shuttering their digital production arms, stage 13. And the 40 year Warner Brothers television workshop. And this is a big one because this fostered new diverse talent.",https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2iE41vefT4k,22,2022-10-12 15:24:13
3113, me they are shuttering their digital production arms stage 13 and the 40 year Warner Brothers television workshop and this is a big one because this fostered new diverse talent there was a lot of talk on Twitter why are they deciding to cut this when there was so much diversity that was coming out of that program so that is now done and obviously this comes at a pretty crucial time for the company they are trying to cut three billion dollars worth of costs over the next two years we saw back in August that they cut 14% of their HBO Max work for so this is just a continuation of those expected layoffs I think we will see more throughout the fall but if you take a look at the stock it's trading near 52 week lows down more than 50% year-to-date David Sazal has been very aggressive but I think investors are they still need a buying to his vision so I think once all this consolidation happens once we get that newly combined HBO Max discovery plus streaming program next summer the next step is going to be okay David Sazal where are you going to take this company and well investors ultimately buy into it yeah maybe investors are waiting for the shakedown to all play out the other company of course in the streaming space Netflix the big giant here reporting next week what are we expecting there what's interesting about this earnings report is for the first time in a long time I don't think subscriber numbers are going to be the be all and all if we take a look at the numbers here Netflix says it expects revenue at 7.85 billion adjusted EPS at two dollars and 22 cents a share they expect that subscriber number to come in at one million I actually think they might even be on that subscriber number due to the success of Dahmer that series has just been crushing it week after week on the Netflix top 10 list but going back to what's happening at the company right now at supported that is going to be a big driver there's been a lot of optimism on Wall Street we've seen a lot of upgrades the stock is up 18% over the past three months widely outpacing the broader market we still have a couple bears in there that say there's a lot of volatility there's a lot of competition we have Disney's at supported coming out in December people are saying that Netflix could come out with theirs November 1st to beat Disney to the punch but right now I think ultimately analysts are really hoping for some more clarity on the at supported and they're really banking on that to help Netflix improve their free cash flow and profitability so that's going to be probably the biggest question that investors want answered during the earnings call in the report you think that people be a little more cautious in this environment in terms of you know which advertisers would be willing to pay up but I guess that points to the attractiveness of the platform that at least you know the analysts see if they're upgrading it because the additional revenue source they expect to come in and that's been some of the bearer sentiment too because Netflix is charging a really high premium for too a lot of these advertisers so if they even want to be on the platform they're paying above industry standard and that could be a risk. Yeah an important point to point out there Ali Canal thanks so much for that. Well coming up the sustainability conundrum support for major governments trillions worth of assets and now a new report saying supply cannot keep up with the band but is their backlash against ESG we'll discuss next.,https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2iE41vefT4k,23,2022-10-12 15:28:26
3114," Fifth In the time now for our chart of the day and today we are focusing on the rise in ESG investing. And as an investor may come as a surprise, the sum that the field is actually known for sustainable debt, which has been increasing. So much so that in 2021, issuance exceeded 1.6 trillion, take a look at this chart here. The fastest growing themes in the ESG fixed income market were sustainability, linked bonds and loans. These transactions bring the total market to more than 4 trillion since inception. That's at least according to data out from Bloomberg. Well, we're sticking with the ESG investing theme here. A new study by PWC found that nearly 9 and 10 institutional investors believe that asset managers should be more proactive in developing new ESG products. But fewer than half of asset managers were planning to launch new ESG funds. So what's an investor to do? Joining us now is Bruce Usher, a Columbia Business School professor, an author of the new book, investing in the era of climate change and Bruce, you've been arguing that despite the economic backdrop, this is kind of the time to be investing in some of these green names. Walk me through that thesis. Absolutely. It's really about the macro trends, climate change. We know climate science. We know that after 300 years of building a global economy that's putting emissions into the atmosphere, we've got 30 years to decarbonize to avoid catastrophic climate change. So you've got consumers pushing to buy more sustainable goods. You've got employees saying they want to work for sustainable companies. You now have investors looking at those trends. Company leaders saying we need to meet those trends. You have government action, like the inflation reduction act, pouring support into this. And lastly, a physical risk of climate change manifesting themselves. More violent storm, heat waves. All these macro trends are all pushing the same direction. They're going to be with us for decades to come. How do you break that down, though, for investors who are looking at this and saying, well, OK, there's questions about yes, she funds and we'll get into that in just a bit. But in terms of the names, there's, you know, EVs, which some would argue that that's actually not a long term play in terms of impact on climate change. There are many other names that may be potentially being overlooked. Right. So when I looked at this sector 20 years ago, it's how long I've been in it. The big challenge then was there was nothing to invest in. If you look at the whole solar power market, everything globally, there's less solar than one coal plant. Last year, the investment in solar, more than 100 coal plants worth, and gaining. So the big picture here is that the opportunity to invest is now trillion-dollar sectors. We've got the EV sector. All the automakers are going EVs. The key question is why? The reason is that those products are better than the incumbent product there's other before. So you look at EVs specifically, it suggests, but that why the EV sales so good? Because consumers love them. Consumers prefer EV products that flying out the showrooms, in fact, the car makers can't keep up with them. They prefer the products, but it's still a very small portion. Right? He paid about 5%.",https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2iE41vefT4k,24,2022-10-12 15:33:17
3115," for EV products that flying out the showrooms, in fact, the car makers can't keep up with them. They prefer the products, but it's still a very small portion, right? We're talking roughly what, 5%, but now analysis has shown that around 5%, you get a tipping point in these markets. And that's what the automakers are seeing. You have to ask why are they all rushing into this market? What do they see? What they see is five years ahead. When they're planning new cars, they're looking five years in the future. That's how long it takes to roll out a new model. And what they see is an all-of-evee future, because it's a better product, consumers like it. And then we have these trends around climate change. So that's what's really pushing that. And that's what's creating investment opportunities. When consumers and businesses go in this direction, the market opens up to investors. We have seen incredible amount of inflows into ESG funds over the last few years. A bit of a reckoning, some of our you that's happening right now, not just this being politicized, but you've also got those like Deutsche Bank, some other names who are now being called out for greenwashing, the funds that the names that were included in these funds were not necessarily sort of green, so to speak. What do you think? I mean, what do you think is happening here? How does this manifest itself from an investor perspective, those who've been putting money behind these saying they were anticipating some impact coming from these funds? Well, turns out that's not actually what ESG investing is, right? That's correct. Exactly. And there's a real misunderstanding around ESG. ESG investing is really very simple. It's saying, look, when I look at potentially investing in asset, I look at financial numbers, I look at management, I look at all these things. And then also, to be a smarter investor, what else could put this investment at risk? What else could change the outcomes? Look at risks like flooding or hurricanes or wildfires. How could that affect my investment? If you wouldn't go out by a house, a second home on the coast, would you want to know if it's going to flood? Would you want to know that be a smart thing to know? That's what ESG investing is. It can make you a better business manager, it can make you a better investor. The challenge though, is it doesn't really address climate change. Just because you buy that, just because you're deciding on a walk away from that house, so I'm going to pay less for it because it's at flood risk, that doesn't reduce the risk of flooding. That's a challenge. So how do you invest from an impact standpoint? So from impact standpoint, it's much more important that you go beyond ESG investing. And there's really two strategies that I read about my book. One is what we call thematic. So pick a theme that you're excited about your comfort with. If you're really interested in renewable energy, invest in the solar or wind fund. There's plenty of those out there. That's a way to really channel money into the solution. Or if you're interested in EVs into either EV company stocks or funds, those are thematic funds. There's also now new funds coming out in green hydrogen, other leading technologies. So you can have a thematic focus, the equity debt venture capital, as you wish. Or you can have what we call impact first focus. Now this is very special in the sense that it's really only for high net worth investors. Impact first is not falling if I do share responsibility. It's saying, I really want to address climate change. I'm going to put my capital into that. I might get a return. Their return might be decades from now. But it's going to have great impact. And that's where you're really investing. And technologies aren't yet commercial. This goes well beyond say solar and EVs. This is some new technologies like direct air capture, for example. And really quickly, what about green bonds? So green bonds are issued by companies because they see these trends coming. They see these sustainability trends. Consumers want investors want it. It's again thinking about how is how is they world be carbonizing? And what does that mean for my business? The green bond makes perfect sense. But again, the green bond is not going to have tremendous impact on the environment. It's just a very sensible investment. Okay. Good to differentiate those two. Bruce Esther, Columbia Business School professor and author of the book, Investing in the era of climate change. Thanks for joining us today. Thank you. Well, coming up, talking down gold comments from Janet Yellen on the dollar and Loretta Mester on rate hike. So aren't exactly supporting the precious metal. As the safe and shine truly rubbed off, we're going to ask our next guest on the other side.",https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2iE41vefT4k,25,2022-10-12 15:37:19
3116," Next We'll do a quick check on the commodity space right now and looking specifically at oil. We are seeing both WTI crude and Brent crude to the downside. WTI down about 2, more than 2% Brent crude down about 1.9 there. For more on the commodity space, let's bring in Suki Cooper, a Stan chart executive director in precious metals, analysts. Suki, good to talk to you. You've specifically been looking at gold right now. Sort of, you know, what has traditionally been more of a safe haven play, but it sounds like you think there's more downside to come. Gold has really been caught in the headwinds of the strength of the dollar and the scope of further rate hikes. And while we think that the Fed is not done with its rate hikes, I don't think there's another 75 basis points that's likely to come in an November meeting and another further 50 basis points in December. I think these are going to present strong headwinds for the gold market, but we do think that the downside is quite well supported. We're seeing quite a good price elastic response in terms of demand from India and China. And there's still that concern around the session risk and perhaps the need for flight to safety that is buffering some of the downside for gold. But we do think that there's more downside risk to come as the year comes to an end and into 2023 with the gold price is heading further towards 1600 towards the end of next year. So 1600, we're at 1675 right now. Is 1600 the support level you're talking about? The key support that's coming up next is around 1650. This is a level that we've seen physical demand materialising. And now we're entering a period where we tend to see seasonal demand from India. Devali falls on the 24th this month. We have the wedding season as well. And we've seen in markets like China, the physical premium earlier last month's long to levels that we last saw in 2015. So that price drop that we initially saw below 1700 was greeted by quite strong physical interest in the gold market. So the next level to look at from here will be 1650 and then beyond that is 1600. If we breach those two levels, then we're really looking to the cost of production and where that provides a guideline for the gold market. And we tend to see in a long run basis and here I'm looking at around about 40 years that gold prices tend to trade a third above the average cost of production. And that guideline suggests to us around 1550 to 16.",https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2iE41vefT4k,26,2022-10-12 15:41:56
3117," I'm looking at around about 40 years, that gold prices tend to trade a third above the average cost of production. And that guideline suggests to us around 1550 to 1600 is where that floor from the production side should be sterilized. So much of the price moves as you point out, really driven by the stronger dollar and we have seen it climb up again today looking at something like the Japanese yen well above or below depending on how you look at it, those intervention levels. I mean, how much higher do you think the green bag goes as you track those metals and moving in tandem? It's really pivotal for the communist complex as a whole. The dollar strength has been a headwind for not just gold, but for silver, platinum and playdium. It's really dampened that upside risk. We think that there's likely that we may see further dollar strength and perhaps we'll see something of a stabilization coming in the first part of next year. And that's really when we might see some of that pressure on gold prices starting to ease. But if we look at the correlations for the gold markets, it's strongest consistent. Relationships since the start of this year has been with the US dollar. That correlations jump in above 60% at the moment. But last year that relationship had started to pivot towards real yields and nominal yields. That relationship still matters for gold. It's in close second. But at the moment, it's the strength of the dollar that's proven to be a key headwind. Now it's not to say that gold can't rise if we see dollar strength. If both dollar and gold are benefiting from safe Hayden demand, we can see them both rally. And in the current environment, it's the concerns around slowing demand over the longer term. But there's also concerns around higher rates that's really weighing on gold. And it's not been a critical safe Hayden demand at the moment. So bottom line, Tsukiya, you should investors be putting their money here or is there a better value in the precious metal space? If we look at the entire complex on a longer term basis, the industry bias, precious metals, fundamentals are set to tighten. If we look at markets like platinum and pladium, we think that towards the end of the year, we're going to see much tighter markets. As the auto market starts to recover, we were anticipating at the start of this year, a rebound around about 11% in global auto production. But we've scaled back our expectations closer to 7%. But into 2023, we're still expecting the double-digit rebounds in terms of global auto production. And PGMs are critical in terms of the growth that we see in the auto industry. So those are two markets where we expect more off-side risk towards the end of this year. But on a longer term horizon, perhaps silver is the metal where we might see more upside risk and given the demand from the solar energy, given the electrification of vehicles, this is strong growth that we're looking to see. But that demand is like to take two to three years to materialise. So over the longer run, silver has positive prospects. But over the next few months, we think there's more upside risk for platinum and pladium, at least in the short term. Suki Cooper, Stan Chart Executive Director and Precious Metals, analysts. Good to have you on today. Thank you. Well, coming up, reigning on the parade, some power announces a big move with GM on home energy storage, but a downgrade from BFA Ways on Chairs is the teeterie housing market its biggest risk. We're going to ask CEO Peter Ferrisy on the other side.",https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2iE41vefT4k,27,2022-10-12 15:45:52
3118," Music Well, the sun shined on solar stocks in the aftermath of President Biden's landmark inflation reduction act, as it showered the sector with billions in funding and tax incentives. Now a leading player in the residential space is making a big move. The sun power announcing a major tie up with General Motors to develop new home energy systems that's going to coincide with the retail launch of the Chevy Silverado EV in 2024. Let's bring in the CEO of Sun Power, Peter Ferrisy joining us live on this show. Today Peter gets to talk to you today. It's really a big announcement here that really combines the battery side of things, the solar side of things, EVs. Talk to me about how it's all connected to the new home energy system. Yeah, first of all, thank you for having me on, but we are just thrilled to partner with General Motors. As you mentioned, our partnership has two major components that are going to be critical for the future of EV sales and for clean energy. So number one, we're preferred partner for General Motors on electric vehicle charger installations. So for all the electric vehicles they sell going forward, we'll be their preferred partner. And many customers find that it's very, this is not a do-it-yourself job. You need someone's help. To set up your own home charging station, if you will. But secondly, once you get an electric vehicle, you quickly discover your home charging station is using a lot more energy than it used to. And so most customers want solar power very quickly afterwards. And we are the exclusive partner for General Motors on solar panels and batteries. And we're just thrilled to work together on changing the world as we go forward. So you're talking about installing the solar panels on homes that are looking to get the charging installed for their GM car. Exactly. So once you buy an electric vehicle, obviously there's so many wonderful parts about it. You don't use fossil fuel at the gas station. But if you just plug into your garage and you don't have solar power, you're just connecting to usually coal or gas or whatever fossil fuel the local utility uses. So your only is green is your charging source. And so most EV customers really want solar power quickly afterwards because their bills are much higher when they go to charge their car without solar power. And with solar power, they have this clean renewable energy source forever. Peter, you know one of the big concerns with EVs has been just how it's likely to strain the power grid. And there's an idea of bidirectional charging using your car to power up your home. Certainly one that's been picking up a lot of steam. How much of that demand that's anticipated for the power grid do you think can actually be, you know, picked up by these EVs? Well you're absolutely right. By directional chargers. Wow. This has really kind of changed the world for consumers. Who would have thought that?",https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2iE41vefT4k,28,2022-10-12 15:50:19
3119," by these EVs. Well, you're absolutely right. By directional chargers. Wow, this has really kind of changed the world for consumers. Who would have thought that in addition to backing up your home with a generator, that's the way it's been done traditionally, that you can either use a solar battery or actually use your vehicle? And what General Motors has announced is that we will be installing their by directional charger for the 2024 Silverado pickup launch. It launches at the end of 23 next year. And what's exciting is that for consumers to buy a Silverado, they'll have the option to back up their home with their vehicle battery, which will just be incredible. But you're actually right. The grid today doesn't have enough capacity for all the future EV sales that we expect. General Motors is expecting to sell more than a million electric vehicles in the next three years. If you believe the data by 2030, 30 million more electric vehicles will be out there on the road. And so for practical purposes, and obviously to combat climate change, more and more consumers are going to want solar power. And we're really excited to work with them because we're the number one rated residential solar power company in the United States. We have the highest customer service, we have the best products, and we're thrilled to work with GM to serve their customers. Yeah, it's certainly the idea of by directional charging, really picking up steam, especially in light of recent natural disasters like the hurricanes, fires with a lot of home owners saying, well, this could have helped with the power outages. Obviously, GM came out with this announcement yesterday. It's certainly big news, but your stock was down significantly because of a downgrade from Bank of America, specifically setting a decline in new home sales, affecting revenue outlook. I realize sales from homes aren't specifically the biggest revenue driver for Sun Power. But how big of a pullback do you anticipate into what extent have you already seen that? Well, we are the leader in new home solar. So I recognize the origin of the comment. But what I'll tell you is that overall demand for solar, outside of new homes has been so high this year that any change in new homes demand really hasn't been material to our business. So we have a very big backlog of new homes that exist today that are waiting for solar, that'll carry us through most of 2023. So although new home starts have slowed because of rising interest rates, I don't anticipate it's going to have a bunch of an impact on our overall business. We announced that we haven't announced our third quarter result yet, obviously, but in Q1 and Q2, we actually announced accelerating demand. And this year, just to give you some color, has just been terrific from a demand standpoint. More and more consumers want solar power, and we're so excited to work with them on it. Sun Power, CEO, Peter Ferrisy. I get to have you on air today, really appreciate the time. Thank you again. Coming up, building the momentum, the critics of Amazon's labor push, they argue progress is still since the big JFK 8 win, but events in California yesterday and upstate New York today could change that. We'll discuss. Until next time, bye. I'm going to do a little bit of the same. I'm going to do a little bit of the same. I'm going to do a little bit of the same. I'm going to do a little bit of the same.",https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2iE41vefT4k,29,2022-10-12 15:54:29
3120," 5. We'll see you next time. Thanks. Bye. Bye. Bye. Bye. Bye. Bye. Bye. Bye. Bye. Bye. Bye. Bye. Bye. Bye. Bye. Well some new momentum for Amazon's labor movement workers at a Southern California warehouse campaign in Georgia is. In Texas and Kristoff. A despite regrets Patty45? Not yet. A sharp stop to go in demand. Yet again, it highlights revenue. Amazon Labor Union's first out of state venture, and it is a big one. The Inland Empire, a local politician I've spoken to, is referred to it as warehouse central. It is deeply important for the logistics industry, and it's deeply important for Amazon. Amazon set to build its largest warehouse in the Inland Empire, and in the last 12 years has invested more than 19 billion in that area alone. So Union pushes have failed there in the past, but if the Amazon Labor Union can get this election authorized and succeed, it would be a major victory, and it would hit Amazon where it hurts the most. And Ali, we got that news yesterday in anticipation of another vote that's happening in the state of New York, Albany, a pivotal union election today. What are we expecting? So we're, you know, I've spoken to a couple experts who say, who all say the same thing, that the Amazon Labor Union does believe they could win an Albany despite their latest loss in Staten Island, and experts say that, you know, the odds are still not in their favor, but if they won, it would be a watershed event. And that, combined with the news coming out of California today and yesterday, makes means that they could really have momentum. And it's important to remember, Kiko, for workers, this is about inspiration and momentum. And for Amazon, long term time is absolutely on their side, but right now momentum certainly is not. Really quickly, Ali, have we heard from Amazon in response to the very latest out of California? Not yet, but I'll keep you abreast of what happens there. Okay, great. We'll be watching. Thanks so much for that. Ali Garfinkle joining us from our LA Bureau. Well, let's do a final check of the market action before we let you go. We're seeing green arrows now across the board. The Dow up 171 points, the S&P 500 up 15 and the Nasdaq up 50. We are, of course, looking ahead to the afternoon where we are expecting the FOMC minutes to come out. Sterling investors going to be passing that ahead of that big CPI print coming out tomorrow. All of this, of course, to look ahead to that FOMC meeting. And so you just how aggressively the Fed will continue to move in the face of high inflation. That does it for me in this hour. We've got much more to come here and yakking finance life. Let's move to the right here.",https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2iE41vefT4k,30,2022-10-12 16:00:00
3121,"something you you that gets Today are expressing negativity. We heard Jamie Dheim in yesterday expressing pessimism about where we're going. You obviously were former businessman, now Governor of Connecticut. What are you hearing from your constituents? And what are you seeing out there? Here at the Greenwich Economic Forum, I think people see some recession storm clouds on the horizon. And we're a small state. I can only control so much, but what I've got to do is make sure that a state like Connecticut is prepared. And I've done that by setting aside a $3.5 billion. So if we do get a recession, I don't have to erase taxes. I don't have to lay anybody off. I don't have to cut back on education. We're in a strong position to power through and make sure we keep our economy growing. And of course, you've gotten an influx of new tax income over the course of the pandemic, because people have been moving to Connecticut. Are those new constituents, do they have sort of different needs, different wants than the folks who were in Connecticut already? No, we had tens of thousands of young families moving to the state of Connecticut. There we go in the other direction 10 years ago. Right. I think they love great schools. They love maybe a little backyard. There's a good financial sector here here in the Granted Stanford area. I don't know if they have different needs, but I think they like the Connecticut lifestyle. And how confident are you that if there is a recession, as you just said, that you absolutely won't have to erase taxes or cut back on education or some of the things that they like about Connecticut.",https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2iE41vefT4k,31,2022-10-12 16:03:21
3122," And how confident are you that if there is a recession as you just said that you absolutely won't have to race taxes or cut back on education or some of the things that they like about Connecticut. It depends on the nature of what those storm clouds bring. But I wouldn't trade Connecticut's place with just about anybody right now. We have a very strong manufacturing sector with five and ten year agreements with the defense industry. I have a hundred thousand jobs or having a hard time filling right now. So I don't think it's going to be an unemployment recession. I think it might be a financial recession. That impacts our revenues. I'm going to make sure we're ready. When you talk about an unemployment recession, the unemployment rate in the state is 4.1%. So higher than the national average, how high are you prepared for that to go in a state like Connecticut? I've got well over a hundred thousand jobs that are unfilled right now. I'm training people for those jobs. If everybody took those jobs, I'd be out of people because there's that many jobs to be filled. That's an advanced manufacturing. That's an IT, not the mentioned nursing and teaching. So it's a great time to be a young person, I think, in America. And certainly right here in Connecticut, we're providing all the job training you need. So you come to Connecticut. We'll get you a training and we'll get you a job. Yeah, talk to me a little bit more about those training programs. What they look like. How many people are taking advantage of them, for example. So thousands have done it. We put together. Look, some people want two-year community college, some want four-year college. A lot of people want an 18-week certificate program so they can be a laser welder with a guaranteed job at electric boat when they're done. And so we're providing you those options going forward. And a lot of states will say, I'll pay you $10,000 if you move to my state. Connecticut, I'll train you. Make sure you get a good paying job. The other side of all of that is them being able to afford to live in Connecticut. I got, I mean, your state has reputation as being a fancy state. I think if I could say in sort of late person's terms, I was just reading about residents in Fairfield County fighting against affordable housing regulations that would increase affordable housing. How do you help with that on the state level? You're right. We haven't allowed much housing. And not much housing has been built in this state over the last 30 years. All of a sudden we're popular. A lot of people want to build housing. The right place to build it is in our downtown areas. We've had more housing starts in the last six months, you know, than anytime, you know, this century. But we have a long way to go. Every business I talk to, they ask me the same things. Workforce, what we're doing there. And will there be a place for people to live. Especially young people. So what are you saying on that ladder question? How do you guys help with fostering more of that construction, especially when the local communities don't necessarily want it? Some of the suburban communities have a little bit of NIMBY, but we've got more housing being built affordable housing, worker housing, single people housing in Stanford and Norwalk and New Haven than ever before. I was really impressed by a travel figure. I saw regarding your state that you guys provided that overnight road trips this summer to Connecticut were up 10.6% year after year. The number one state in the nation for overnight trips. And you guys have spent a lot on a big tourism campaign. Do you expect as things maybe retrench a little bit in the economy? You guys going to keep pushing the tourism spending to get people here. Yeah, it's a beautiful state and people like to visit your as your number show. It was sort of weird during the worst of COVID, 2021. We kept our beat to Zo. We kept our parks open. We had more visitors in the state of Connecticut during those two years and ever before in our history. And I think a lot of people fell in love with the state and state. What's your favorite place to visit in Connecticut? I'll tell you what I love. I love the fact that there's a park within about a 10 minute drive of any place in this state. So we have the best mix of indoor outdoor live workplace. Governor, thank you so much for talking with me today. Governor Ned Lamont of Connecticut. Back to you guys. Thank you. Thank you.",https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2iE41vefT4k,32,2022-10-12 16:07:52
3123," you you and A a vulnerable position currently above the $19,000 mark ahead of Thursday's inflation print as the Federal Reserve looks to continue its hawkish tightening cycle, joining us now to weigh in on the crypto spaces, Galaxy Digital Founder and CEO Mike Novogratz joined by Yowl Finance's crypto reporter David Hollerith. Mike, great to get some time with you. It's been a while here. Talk to us about prices here. How much, what would happen to Bitcoin if we did in fact get that Fed pivot? Liz, I think once the Fed pivots, you're going to see assets in general rally, right? You've had a tremendous sell-off across the board based on Chairman Powell being really hawkish in the Fed. And rightfully so, people always ask me, well, Bitcoin didn't work as an inflation hedge. And I'm like, are you guys crazy? It went from $10,000 to $70,000 when the Fed was producing inflation. Since the Fed has decided to try to smash inflation by raising rates aggressively, the most aggressive rate raising in our lifetime, Bitcoin sold off with other assets. It's actually done better than most. And I think if you finally get the pause, you'll start seeing Bitcoin pick back up, Bitcoin and all cryptocurrencies. Listen, are we going to get the pause? At one point, yes, we priced in a lot, but the inflation data is still lagging and hot. And the employment data we just got was pretty darn strong. And so, this normally works. You'll have to see the ISM or the manufacturing data plunge first, go from 50 to 48 to 40. What will follow that will be earnings, inflation and employment, which is a lagging indicator. And so, you know, the bearer case is we've got two to six months left of this pain. The bull case is, you know, the market starts breaking. We're seeing a lot of breakage, not in necessarily crypto, but in the rest of the world. And crypto is interesting in that, you know, three months ago after the big sell-off and the deleverging, most people that needed to sell sold. And so, you've seen price, price is much more muted. You know, things take off when there's a good story and they sell right back off when the story goes away. And so, a lot less activity in crypto, a lot less for sellers, but also a lot less new buyers. Mike, typically during some of the crypto winters, as we see the most innovation, especially within the underlying technology in blockchain as well. But we know that there are even more bills within Congress that have moved forward as well over the course of this year. That regulation is set to still go full steam ahead in some of the discussions. And so, with regard to that, the bill's giving validation. But does that also, to your perspective, pump the value of crypto? And are there some cryptos that are not created equal perhaps? In that sense. That's a great question. Listen, I think two things are happening.",https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2iE41vefT4k,33,2022-10-12 16:11:42
3124," pump the value of crypto, and are there some cryptos that are not created equal perhaps? In that sense. It's a great question. Listen, I think two things are happening, and you can't deny they're happening. One is institutions across the board are putting big resources into building for the next crypto spring. That's guys like Citadel in their exchange. It's people like BlackRock with Aladdin, it's hedge funds, it's Citibanks and Goldman Sachs getting ready for a tokenization revolution that's coming, I don't know, in two years and three years, four years, whenever. So there's almost a sense of inevitability that this is going to be a big industry. It's a shocking difference than last crypto winter. That said, buying the coins right now, there's just less enthusiasm until the macro changes. I do think Congress has done a good job of getting educated. I was just down in DC for three days and met with, I don't know, 14 different congressmen and senators and was pleasantly surprised at how up the speed they were. I got my fingers crossed that the Ag Bill gets put into committee and potentially voted on in a in the lame duck session. That would be a great first step in starting some crypto regulation. My fear is nothing happens until post election and then you're going to, then you're going to, you know, then we'll see what happens. Maybe that, depending on how the election goes, the cards change. We do need some regulation to get things moving. Mike, there's over 500 crypto exchanges and trading venues worldwide. I was just thinking in the context of what sounds like a prolonged bear market and then also these much larger traditional institutions coming in. What sort of your expectation for what happens to those 500 exchanges? You know, it's interesting. So some of the exchanges cost very little to run, right? These are basically code. And as you got closer to a regulated world, you look at what claim based costs and your building services and your building KYC and you know, they cost more and more. And so I think as you look at what I'll call regulated exchanges or exchanges that have some regulator, you probably see a consolidation and they probably still need to cut costs. And so, but you know, exchanges of funny word, most of these exchanges should be thought of as as broker dealers, right? QAIM base is closer to fidelity than it is to the New York stock exchange. I mean, it has a tens of millions of customers that it deals with that that uses app that keep things on its in its system, right? New York stock exchange does it. You go to and trade and you have a broker deal that you trades with it. And so calling them all exchanges as a misnomer, they have matching instances and they have exchanges, but their primary business is really that of collecting customers. And I think it's a consolidation there. Right. Turning to this from a sustainability report that Galaxy put out this morning. Sort of a benchmark for the industry in a sense of transparency. But I was just curious, in the report you revealed that 68% of the company's carbon footprint comes from its Bitcoin mining operations. And that long term, you're aiming for making the energy sources for those operations 80% coming from renewable energy. And so I was just curious, what is the timeline for where you when you when the company plans to hit that 80% mark? I think we're pretty close already. And so I would, you know, without actually talking to the mining team this morning, I don't want to give you a bad bad data point, but we're pretty close to 80% already. This is one of the unfortunate things that happened in the last two years of crypto is this narrative that Bitcoin uses too much electricity showed up. Reality, total Bitcoin mining uses.",https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2iE41vefT4k,34,2022-10-12 16:16:06
3125," that happened in the last two years of crypto is this narrative that Bitcoin uses too much electricity showed up. Reality, total Bitcoin mining uses less electricity than hair dryers or Christmas lights. You know, it's not zero. It's certainly a significant amount, but it's a fraction of global power supply. And so, you know, when you think about the fewer the master of the galaxy, you would allocate electricity to things you think are valuable. Like YouTube uses a lot more electricity than Bitcoin mining. Listen, I think YouTube is an unbelievable innovation and it deserves some electricity budget. And so, it's Bitcoin because it can exactly specify how much electricity it uses and it produces those reports on a monthly basis. You know, the community says this is what what has gone into mining. It's an easy target, but it shouldn't be a target. And so, listen, we are moving towards a greener footprint because I think all companies should. But I don't want to, in essence, condone the fact that I feel like Bitcoin is being singled out as an industry, because a few people pointed at it and said, oh, this is an easy state though. Thanks for giving me a viable reason not to put up Christmas slice this year, Mike. I definitely appreciate that. And alternative, perhaps. Also, while we have you here though, considering a lot of companies, CEOs, executives, they're implementing their recession playbooks and kind of dusting that off right now, given that you've seen this before. You've seen this in the past, but for crypto this time and the amount of holdings that you do have, do you plan on kind of selling any of that, liquidating any of that in order to just show up the coffers of cash in order to make sure that your businesses can also navigate. You know, we luckily sold over a billion dollars of stuff last year at better prices and certainly don't want to get into the business of burning the furniture to run the business. And so, we're going to try to manage our business towards what we think our rational revenue targets. Listen, revenue is coming down in the industry. Volumes are down. Excitement is down. In this winter could last longer than people think. It might be shorter. It's hard to predict when these crypto winners, how long they go. You know, we're a couple years from a having cycle. I do think the Fed flinching creates some enthusiasm around Bitcoin as a store of value Bitcoin as a recession as an inflation hedge as a hard money when the rest of the world keeps printing money. But we're going to manage our business to what we think is a rational revenue stream for our five operating businesses is trying to try to keep the balance sheet separate. And Mike, if we sort of think of the 1980 period in the 1960s to 1980 for the stock market, this sort of a worst case scenario for what this bear market could look like across the equities market and crypto. I was sort of curious, you know, how do you think a crypto investor should operate in this environment? That period of time sort of likened as sort of excellent for stock pickers. What do you think? How are you evaluating crypto currencies? Yeah, listen, in some ways, this is the most challenging macro environment for any investor. And if you had all the foresight of the sages, you would have just been in US dollar cash all year long, right? When the whole world was saying cash is trash, cash is trash, was time to just go along, you know, one week T-bills and wait, or go short markets. We're in a mess globally, right? Japan has got a monster imbalance intervening in their currency market while supporting an interest rate market as inflation slowly creeps higher. That is a potential real problem. You saw what happened in the UK and they're trying to get this genie back in the box. But once confidence breaks down, it's really hard to get it back. And so what the Fed is doing is trying to preserve confidence in the US system. Now, what they need, and we'll see if you get it, is a congress that is willing to take some pain. Politicians are not normally...ko...",https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2iE41vefT4k,35,2022-10-12 16:20:43
3126," Now, what they need, and we'll see if you get it, is a Congress that is willing to take some pain, politicians are not normally coded to take pain, right? So you already see in France, hey, we're going to do a hundred billion dollar subsidy because energy prices are too high and hence that's driving inflation. So we're going to give more money to the system. Like that's counterintuitive. I understand where it comes from, people are suffering, but as you use printed dollars or printed euros in this case, you know, it creates this inflation cycle. And so it's a really treacherous market, you know, could the S&P, what's it, 30, whatever, 3600 today, could it end the year at 3,300, 3,300, kind of looks like where the chart would go? What's hard about these environments is they don't get there a straight line, right? There is a tremendous amount of fear in the market right now. And so like on Monday, we already saw 6% rally in it got reversed. It doesn't feel to me that the stock market low is in, that we're going to have more pain before we see clear sailing. And you know, there is a chance that even when the Fed thinks it's finished, they pause at if the federal government doesn't tighten its belt and starts feeling this populism surge, you know, the cycle picks up again. And so I would say for now until the next, you know, until further notice, at least 12 months, these are going to be really complicated markets to trade and complicated markets to make money in. And in some ways, just preserving your wealth is a huge win, right? Not actually having monster gains, but not losing money could be a huge win. All right. I need to grab my parfer and Bill DeBare Teddy, you're my appreciated. Maybe I'll mark the low for you guys. Good stuff there. Alex, a digital founder, NCEO, Mike Novigratz, Mike, I have you back here sometime soon. Appreciate the conversation. As well as Yahoo Finance's own David Hollerith. Thank you both. Luxury brand Golden Goose is doubling down on control of its supply chain with the purchase of its top supplier. This as it looks to boost its $227 million in sales from the first half of the year. Golden Goose CEO Silvio Compower joins us now alongside Yahoo Finance's Brook Dupama. Silvio, good to see you here. Help us understand the, I would say infatuation with your brand. What drives that? First of all, thank you so much for being here for a former small company from Venice. He's a big achievement. He's always nice for me when I can represent all my people and trying to explain the magic behind our, I would say, special story. This is probably part of the magic.",https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2iE41vefT4k,36,2022-10-12 16:24:51
3127," the magic behind our, I would say, you know, special story. And this is probably part of the magic, not in the miracle that you were talking about. People perceive that and the magic is we need to be able to put in our product what then the people perceive as something special because for people it's sort of how special today is not about how much or how much this mancy is a product. And speaking of that allure among consumers right now you're in LA for a Golden Goose event. You're going to have contact creators there. We've seen the likes of Taylor Swift and Reese Witherspoon wear Golden Goose sneakers. How important has it been for influencers like those to wear your brand and ultimately drive to your success? It's a great question and I have a simple answer. What's magical is that we never place this product to be celebrities because Golden Goose is made it is made in order to make everyone feel special. So the fact that every shoe is made, every shoe is unique is making our customer become you know a lover and the fact that this celebrity has been wearing it has been just a great amplifier to a message that is simple and is not limited just for us more community while it's really open to a wider community. What are we seeing in the style trends right now? I mean for Kanye West and Gap it's been about some of the kind of more I won't say basic or kind of dirty looks out there but there is something that's out there to like making things look lived in already even before they sell. What is it with the trends right now that you're seeing how much do you expect to kind of be able to lean further into that and where the customer is actually continuing to take price despite hey looks like a shoe has a scuff on it. What's up with that? Thank you Brian for this question because this is technically the first time that I'm answering to this question line to someone and it has been you know quite a question for a couple of years because you should remember that Golden Goose has been the first brand ever to this dress for sneakers and at the beginning people were a little bit like skeptic go why like why do I have to spend 500 bucks you know for the early shoe while the it was part of the magic again Golden Goose never wanted to promote the product of now we always want to know the people to talk about our product so there was a space of an undefined space where the people were not really getting about that but the reality is that simply what we try to do is to inject in life to our product is to unleash the sense of uniqueness of every product we offer to our communities and it's a little bit like you know your old device it is always the most special because you really taking with it your memories no so every item that keep with you and keep with it you know his memories is then more special than something just because it's more extensive you know so there's a new notion of going from product to purpose product to values rather than just the product so this is what is going on right now in the industry and I think the example of Kanye is very interesting quite far from Golden Goose because Kanye is still you know quite fashion focused why Golden Goose is consumer obsessed so these position Golden Goose in a very special angle of being the same and speaking of just the long term goal of Golden Goose you've been in this industry since 2000 you've been through three different investment groups here latest premier took a majority stake in Golden Goose so I have to ask here there are also the owners of Doc Mardin's Valentino could we see Golden Goose go public in the near future I mean it's part of course you know of the options and the most important to us where we we may focus our two things first creating value every day to our consumers second to stay flexible because the market outside is very complicated and very complex and as you can imagine you know consumers is really one of the first angles that the market and these difficulties and opportunities came that we they reflected on so it is very important in this process of education to stay flexible now that's extremely important to bring up especially in this conversation and especially in this timing right now given your kind of consumer base that you go after the more affluent consumer that is kind of flocking to the Golden Goose product",https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2iE41vefT4k,37,2022-10-12 16:29:15
3128," especially in this timing right now, given your kind of consumer base that you go after, the more affluent consumer that is kind of flocking to the golden goose product, if you will, even with some of the anticipated recessionary concerns that many consumers have, are you seeing that show up in any of the sales figures and any of the relationship with that consumer right now? It's a great question. So as you can imagine, for sure, you know that almost 42, 44% of our businesses are driven by Americas. And so, you know, I have a really special angle to be in Italian brand because now we need many Italian brands have the lucky that Golden Gooses. And I can tell you that on the American point of view, we didn't see any recession. Last year we achieved something around 78% plus versus the 2020. And this year we are in the zone of plus 40 versus next year, versus last year in America. And in general, the company, the first semester that's been performing like in creative, but you know, like last year, why? Because again, we don't really look at the trend in fashion. We really look in trend in consumer. And there's something that is for sure. The KPIs that consumers look at are not a bidder or no cost conversion is no revenues, but are really like MPS customer acquisition is really the ability that the company and the brand has to retain and compensate with these communities. So this is where Golden Gooses really representing an excellence. And I really think that we are really representing a kind of new frontier for the consumer industry on this side. Really fascinating. I've seen so many of your products on some of the high end kind of fashion retailers and resailers out there as well. And so I'm excited to see where the brand goes from here. Golden Goose CEO, Sylvia Kamparr joining us here today. Thanks so much for the time as well as Yahoo finances on Brook to Alma. Welcome back to Yahoo Finance Live. I'm Julie Heimann live at the Greenwich Economic Forum in Greenwich, Connecticut. A big focus here of the speakers today and of the subjects of conversation is on alternative investments. Those outside sort of stocks and bonds. And my next guest knows a lot about this area. He's Matt Brown, founder and CEO of Case, which is a firm that basically provides a technology.",https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2iE41vefT4k,38,2022-10-12 16:33:35
3129," sort of stocks and bonds and my next guest knows a lot about this area. He's Matt Brown, founder and CEO of Case, which is a firm that basically provides a technology platform for many of those alternative investments. So before we dig into it, can you just tell me a little bit more about what you guys do? Absolutely. First of all, thanks for having me. It's great to be here. Case, as you said, is a technology platform and what we do is we connect the very fragmented a universe of financial advisors across America with the leading alternative investment funds. So I think private equity, private credit, hedge fund strategies, real estate strategies. And the reason that's valuable is because those two communities really didn't have access to each other prior to a technology that allows it to be easy and simple to connect. Well, and I feel like retail investors writ large didn't really have access to these kinds of investment. The thinking always was, you have to be an accredited investor, which means, among other things, that you have to have a certain amount of money. Do you think all of that needs to change? Do you think we need to have sort of radical accessibility to these kinds of investments? Well, the world is changing. And there's really a moment in time now that we're seeing a lot of forces come to play. There's really four major trends that are coming together and you mentioned one of them. So we want to start there, which is the regulatory environment on who governs who can access alternative investments. I think previously, as you said, the bar was quite high. The SEC's view was, if you invest in alternatives, we want you to have a lot of capital just in case it doesn't work out. I think where they realized over the last 10 years is that all of them have really done their job. What they've done is to be able to take advantage of unique opportunities that the public markets don't offer while protecting the downside of investors in turbulent times like we're having now. And the SEC now is kind of saying, wait a second, maybe we've excluded too many people and not made it more broadly available. So they're changing and modifying their stance on that, which is creating a much more inclusive investing environment and very much along the themes of democratization of access. Yeah, and to your point, it's not as if you're insulated from downside if you're in the equity market. Well, I mean, that's the 60, 40 portfolio I can say it here, I think is officially over. I think markets like this have really just once again demonstrated that you can't just have a portfolio that is only equities and fixed income. The modern portfolio is really a three-dimensional portfolio. It's stocks, bonds, and alternative investments. And most people are talking that it's going to be 50, 50, 30, 20, 20 being, of course, alternative investments. What said do you think that there is a risk with more people getting involved in alternative investments? I see just the opposite. We look at some of the greatest asset managers in the alternative space, many of which are on our platform and available. You know, decade after decade, they've delivered. I would argue that if you're a financial advisor and you're not allocating your clients capital in alternative investments, you're at risk of losing your business. That's the impact positive impact all it's are having. I mean, at the same time, if we are headed into a downturn during the financial crisis, certainly all of us were not immune. If anything, some of them were the sources of some of the, you know, fractures that we saw within the system. Well, I think when you look at the track record of how portfolios perform in good times, and in times like we have right now with high volatility, they're added value, far exceeds, any kind of negative impact that one or two could have. You know, you look at the largest and most sophisticated investors in the world, institutional investors, average allocation rates to alternative investments, 30 to 50 percent of their portfolio overall. Interestingly, look at that same lens on wealth management in America, which controls $40 trillion, less than 5 percent, probably closer to 2 to 3 percent, but it's rising. Advisor demand is picking up. Economic managers see wealth as a huge market of new clients for them and new investors. Regulation, as we mentioned, is changing. And now with this technology, that's going to make it all easier. So all of this implies that even if we're seeing a pullback generally, potentially in things like software spending, that maybe you're not seeing that in your business, or are you? What are you seeing right now among your clients at a time where we're seeing that increased volatility? No, it's just, superior.",https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2iE41vefT4k,39,2022-10-12 16:38:15
3130," ex-op or spending that maybe you're not seeing that in your business. Or are you? What are you seeing right now among your clients at a time where we're seeing that increased volatility? So it's interesting as a platform provider, we're neutral. So we don't really have a dog in the fight, we observe. We want to provide the service. Well, you're neutral, but your clients who make their money on it are not necessarily neutral. Right. So are they pulling, are they new trenching? Yes. So what we're seeing is three or four really defined areas. With the European uncertainty, with the Ukraine situation, with an energy crisis, with the political environment here in the US, all that rising interest rates, rising inflation, all that's factoring into the psyche of the advisor and the end client. So what we are observing on our platform is where the money's going. So we're actually standing back and saying, okay, where are the advisors allocating? So they're allocating to macro strategies right now. Edge fund strategies that are nimble and opportunistic. They're allocating to private credit and real assets. So it's quite interesting to see the ebbs and flows of capital flows into different strategies based on the current economic environment. Well, we'll have to catch up with you again in a few months and see where those flows are going. Matt Brown, Founder and CEO of Case. Thank you so much. Thank you so much. Thank you. you you I'm梅 The new global outlook continuing to stall. On inflation, the fund sees price rises peaking late this year, but remaining at elevated levels. Joining us to discuss the report is Pierre Olivier Grinchas, the IMF's chief economist. We've also got Yahoo Finance's Gen Chamburger joining in on the conversation. Pierre, it's good to talk to you today. You know, I'm thinking about these so-called stormy waters you've described in the report, whether it's the Russian invasion of Ukraine, the cost of living crisis, what's happening in China. These have all been headwinds that you've been watching throughout the year. To what extent have they accelerated in the second half of the year that leads you to this downgrade? Well, it's certainly the case that some of the risks that we had flagged in earlier projection rounds, particularly in July, but even if you go back to April, have started to materialize. I mean, the energy crisis that results from the Russian invasion of Ukraine is perhaps the clearest one where we see this incredible toll that's taking on European economies right now. And also the fight against inflation that is proving quite challenging. Inflation keeps going up still. I mean, we're expecting that it's going to peak soon and then start going down as a result in part of actions by central banks, but it's proven both more persistent, more elevated.",https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2iE41vefT4k,40,2022-10-12 16:42:08
3131," that it's going to peak soon and then start going down as a result in part of actions by central banks, but it's proven both more persistent, more elevated, and also broader. It's not just energy prices that are going up. It's what we call core inflation that excludes energy and food prices. It is also pushing upwards. And so that's something that complicates the task for central banks around the world. The final factor in our forecast is of course the slowdown in China. There is a little bit less of a downward revision there. I mean, that's something that we saw a sharp slowdown in the second quarter of the year. And going forward, zero COVID policy is certainly leading to some localized lockdowns and confinement, or affecting activity and the weakness in the property sector is also another factor. Here, Jennifer Seanberger here, it's great to see you. It seems like the global economy is really being stretched here. Perhaps on a string, you mentioned that a third of the countries will contract and grow this year or next. We've got the war in Ukraine. We've got interest rates going up globally. You mentioned the slowdown in China. We just saw the services sector contract in September for the first time in four months. So it just seems that it's not going to take much to push it over the edge. What do you see as the odds of the global economy tipping into recession next year? Well, we certainly flag a number of downside risks in our report. Some of them you mentioned, I mean, the fight against inflation could prove more difficult than we expected this point. We could have more energy-priced shocks. Markets could certainly experience a lot of stress. And associated with that in parts of the world, the strength of the dollar is an important factor. So we try to put all of this in an assessment of the risks around our baseline. And what we found out is that there is about a 25% probability that growth in 2023, global growth, could be at about 2%. And 2% is a very low number. We only had that about five times since 1970. And every time we had this, if you look, it's 1973, the oil price shocked 1981 and the fall curve disinflation, the 2008 financial crisis, all of them are sort of they are stuck in our collective memory as times of difficulties. And there's a 10 to 15% chance that actually output growth could be even lower than 1%. Now 1% is an interesting marker because this is at the level at which global output would remain stagnant per capita. And so that would be an economy that is not growing at all globally. Up here, you mentioned the strength of the dollar, a big concern, something we've been watching. I mean, what we're seeing are major economy currencies here, whether that is the yen, the euro, the sterling, see huge swings on the back of the dollar strength, but it's the EMs that get hit even harder, given the dollar's nominated debt. How are you looking at that risk being elevated even further, given that it doesn't look like the dollar is going to pull back anytime soon? Yes, there's been a lot of strength in the dollar. Actually, what's interesting there also to point out is the strength of the dollar has been particularly important against other advanced economies. So the Japanese yen or the euro or the sterling. So more so than against many emerging market economies. In fact, even some emerging market economies, if you look at Brazil or Mexico or Peru, their currencies are appreciated against the US dollars. So it's more against advanced economies and emerging market economies. But in part, this is also because appreciation of the dollar is very painful in emerging market economies. So a number of them had already started tightening monetary policy, raising their policy rates, adjusting course if you want for their own economies and found themselves in a different position compared to, say, the European Central Bank or the Bank of Japan or the Bank of England. But this stress coming from the dollar are really important. They play out through multiple channels. They increase inflation in the rest of the world because a lot of goods are invoiced in dollars. And they also increase financial stress because countries or corporations that have debt in dollars find that it becomes harder to service them. Now, if you want to think about how countries should address that, our recommendation to this point.",https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2iE41vefT4k,41,2022-10-12 16:46:48
3132," corporations that have debt in dollars find that it becomes harder to service them. Now, if you want to think about how countries should address that, our recommendation at this point is that these movements in the dollar are really reflecting fundamental forces that are at play, the fight against inflation, the energy crisis. And so countries should try to sort of let the exchange rate adjust and accommodate because it reflects the sort of underlying change in the economy. Pierre, Olivia Garene-Jas, the IMF's chief economist, really appreciate your time today. And our thanks to Yahoo Finance is Jen Chamburger as well. We have a clean energy, a stark report from the IEA last year outlined the need for concerted efforts to deliver sustainable energy to the developing world. It said annual clean energy investment in these economies needs to increase by more than 7 times if net zero by 2050 is to become a reality. One group working towards this goal is the climate investment funds. One of the world's biggest multilateral funds for climate action and developing nations last week it received a fresh $950 million loan from the U.S. Treasury joining us now for a weekly charging forward segment brought to you by BMW is Daniel Morris, CIF, senior climate change specialist. Good to talk to you today. Let's start with that big injection. It is a loan not necessarily a capital injection, but how do you plan to deploy that capital? Yeah, thanks, Akiko. The loan that we received from the U.S. really helps support our new accelerating coal transition program. It's a program that's been developed over the past couple of years to help some of the key emerging economies that are very reliant on coal accelerate and move away from using that power source and toward more renewable power sources. So within the program there are kind of four major countries that are participating, India, Indonesia, South Africa and the Philippines. And this large loan will help execute projects that are under design now. Right now those countries are putting together investment plans that will lay out how they intend to deploy investments and bring co-finance years into support over the next few years. And that will be a big part of that. Daniel, we're just a few weeks out from COP27 over in Egypt. I'm thinking back to the big pledges that were made on climate financing a year ago. The argument would be that certainly a lot of these governments as well as companies haven't really put their backs up their actions with the pledges they've made. When you look globally where the need is right now, where do you see it? You know, when it comes to tackling a problem like climate change, there are so many needs that it's hard to isolate them.",https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2iE41vefT4k,42,2022-10-12 16:50:57
3133," Yeah. You know, when it comes to tackling a problem like climate change, there are so many needs that it's hard to isolate them. So I think you need to deploy a broad approach. You know, I work in the clean energy and clean tech sector. And we have a lot of resources that we can bear on different things, you know, investments in different types of technologies. That's established technologies like solar and wind and emerging technologies like say energy storage, e-mobility, green hydrogen. That needs a lot. And we're starting to see more and more of that. Of course, we need a lot more if we want to reach the goals that the international community has set out. But we also need to see a lot more investment in adaptation and resilience. A lot of countries, especially lower income countries, those that haven't really contributed much to the climate crisis of feeling the effects in really catastrophic ways. The most tangible example right now is Pakistan, where the flooding in August resulted in over 30 million being displaced. We need to build more climate resilient communities and the international finance community really needs to start to focus on those with a lot of large scale and a lot of power brought to bear to try and protect people from what will continue to be a change in climate. Daniel, really quickly, we've got the World Bank IMF meetings happening over in DC. This comes at a time when we had an op-ed coming out from former Treasury Secretary Larry Summers saying that the World Bank just is not doing enough in terms of financing some of these projects. When you think about the need globally, how much of this falls on the development banks? How much of it is on government? How much of it is on the private sector? How do you look at that breakdown? Yeah, I mean, it's a great question. I think I can talk a little bit about our experience in the climate investment funds. We are a fund that uses six multilateral development banks as our implementing entities. So we work with the World Bank. We work with the International Finance Corporation, the Regional Development Banks. And when you look at our overall portfolio, about a third of our co-finance in comes from the private sector. Another third comes from the MDVs themselves. And then we also have national governments in their bilateral institutions. It really is all hands on deck. I think that public financing really needs to pave the way to support communities that are in danger. OK. And kind of men and bring their power to their. Daniel Morris, climate investment funds, senior climate change specialists. Good to talk to you today. Thank you.",https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2iE41vefT4k,43,2022-10-12 16:55:17
3134," All right, well, Yahoo! Finances, Julie Hyman is live from the Greenwich Economic Forum. Now qué you will, you've had some ETFs that are anti ESG. So kind of how are you thinking about that environment right now? Well, there is a distinction, as you said, between what just capital does and the ESG movement. You know, I've been in that space a long time. And I think, you know, there is a lot of criticism around the ESG, the ESG investing that is valid. You know, any ESG is sort of not really addressed. A lot of issues like standardization, you know, quality of data and meaning and things like that. What just does is we pull the public on what issues matter. We track big publicly traded corporations on how they're doing on those things. And then we bring that to market in the form of investment products, indices, data, media, content, and so on and so forth. So for us, we're really in the business of tracking what are companies actually doing? And then when you pull the public and ask them what they think about this, you know, Americans are actually united, not divided. We see a huge amount of agreement across political lines as well, but by income, by geographic location, et cetera, on companies doing more. And the last thing I'll point out, which is really important, given where we are right now, is that it's good for business. You know, all the just indices have outperformed their benchmarks since inception and live trading. We've got the spread between the top 10% and bottom 10% over the, you know, since January 2018, it's a spread of over 40%. So we think it's good for business. But do companies think it's good for business? And especially do they think it's good for business? I mean, it's easy to say something's good for business and do something when everything's going well, right? It's when times are getting tougher that that's when it's a true test of a new way of looking at your corporate balance sheet, for example, and your spending, et cetera, all of that. So is that sort of holding up and do expect to continue to hold up if we go into a recession? I do. I'll tell you why. I think we saw during COVID, how many companies responded during a complete shock to the system, turned out companies that were leaders on investing in their workforce, for example, were much more resilient during that period of time. We haven't seen a pullback from the companies that we work with. So we engage probably over 500, maybe 600 companies. If anything this year, we've seen an intensification of their engagement with us, working with us on the underlying issues. That's kind of interesting. So no, I think companies that believe that this is good for business are in it for the long haul and probably see it as a way to actually more effectively manage your recession. The other thing I wanted to ask you about is, during this period of time when the workforce has been so tight, right, you have seen this surge in power of the worker. You've seen a surge in unionization. You've seen people sort of saying, I want to be hybrid and getting that. As the job market starts to change and shift and we start to see maybe layoffs pick up, do you think they'll retain that power? Well, I think it's constantly shifting, who wear that power really resides. But it doesn't take away from the fundamental issue of companies that invest.",https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2iE41vefT4k,44,2022-10-12 16:59:48
3135," Who wear that power really resides, but it doesn't take away from the fundamental issue of companies that invest in their workforce, provide great training, good benefits, they have better retention, better productivity. The business rationale is very strong, and company leaders, CEOs and boards that get that, believe that that's part of their competitive advantage. So, I don't think you become a good employer one day, and then a bad employer the next day, depending on how the labor market's moving. I think you, that's part of your business credo, or it's not. But I guess there are more companies sort of making that part of their business credo by necessity over the past couple of years, right? And I just wonder, is that necessity that impetus going to be taken away a little bit? I mean, we'll find out. I think we didn't really see it during COVID, like I said, and the economic shockwave that happened after that. I think companies today are beginning to see human capital as a real source of alpha. We see that in our own research. And so, if you're really trying to protect from the downside, batting down the hatches, you know, you might feel like you've got, you know, more of an ability to control wages, for example, or the amount of money you spend on benefits. But, you know, and maybe short-term, you have to pull some of those levers. But for the most part, I like to think that companies that we've seen so far are who believe that human capital is part of what makes them special will continue with that. Here's hoping. Here's hoping. Martin, it's good to see you in person, especially Martin Whitaker of Just Capital. Thank you. In this episode of Influencers, Dice Founder and CEO Phil Hutchin, along with Tony Fidel, Dice Board Member, Ness Founder, and inventor of the iPod. Humans need to be around other people. I mean, it's one of the things that make us, like, human and seeing it like an amazing performer. It's one of the things that you remember for the rest of your life. There's always unintended consequences in everything, and I, you know, technology's neutral. It's what we choose to do with and how we regulate and what we socially accept. I think we got a lot of fish to fry, and we are frying ourselves. So I think we need to spend more time on fixing the climate, and we need to worry about getting into the metaverse. Hello, everyone, and welcome to Influencers. I'm Andy Surwer. And welcome to our guest Phil Hutchin, the founder and CEO of Dice. Also, Tony Fidel, a board member of Dice, Tony, as you may know, former Apple executive iPod and inventor iPhone Co-Inventer, also Ness Founder, and a principal at future shape, which is an investment and advisory firm work within engineers and scientists, developing deep, well, foundational deep technology, I should say, got all that. Okay, we want to talk about Dice and Phil. Why don't you start us off by telling us what Dice is all about and what you guys are doing. Yeah, no problem. And I see you, Andy. Well, first of all, Andy, have you ever bought a ticket? Yes, I have. And how was that? Not so good, Phil. And so I think that every time I kind of asked someone over the board of ticket, they'd never come back to me and with like this, like, oh my God, it was amazing. It was always like, I bought a ticket. I thought it was one price, and it was another price, or I couldn't buy a ticket and was thousands of dollars, or whatever it was, or you know, I'd missed it. I'd miss it out on the show, whatever it is. And so there's lots of problems around it, you know, the opaque nature of the industry. So Dice is a super simple way to find out what shows are going on. Two taps and you bought the ticket. You know, it's killed, scalping. And if you can't turn up to the show, you tap a button and you go, refund it. It's just making all these things traditionally associated with, you know, going to a live experience. They've gone on, and now it's, it's just very easy. I have a million more follow-up questions that we'll get to them. But Tony, I got to ask you, you joined the board of Dice in September. What made you a believer? And why join it?",https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2iE41vefT4k,45,2022-10-12 17:04:08
3136," Million more follow-up questions will get to them. But Tony, I got to ask you, you joined the board of Dyson September. What made you a believer? And why join at a time when the live music industry is still getting back on its feet with COVID? Very sure, Andy, as well. It's great to see you. So for me, you know, music's in my blood, you know, given my past and I'm from Detroit, right? So when I was in Detroit, exactly, you know, ticket master first came out and it was like a revolution. I could go walk down the local store and get a printed ticket. You'd have to go to the box office. And so that was an incredible innovation for me. But since that part, they haven't innovated a lot. It's still like, okay, what can we do to extract more money from the fans? Really is what it is. And it hasn't been about more convenience, about more access, making it easy. You know, you can say what you want about airline ticketing or other travel ticketing. At least you can exchange tickets, upgrade, then change the dates. I'm going to say, you don't have any of those conveniences at all in the ticketing, in the entertainment ticketing world or sports ticketing world. Well, that's what DICE is trying to solve. And because I'm such a music fanatic and have been suffering with these six for years, I met Phil and I didn't just get involved with DICE this year. I've been involved with Phil and DICE. I don't know, five, six years now. So this was like literally when they were like 10, 12, 15 people. So we've been working together with them and just been because of the experience that they really want to bring. Fans first, it's all about the fans. Even the artists, the venues, everyone understands that. More fans and especially today when bands are not making any money except for merchandise and for entertainment events. Other than that, they're not making any money on streaming. We see that unless you're the top 100 artists, they don't make any money. So where are they going to make their money? And how are they going to make sure the fan has a great experience? That's what DICE is all about. Phil, I got to ask you about the competitive set. I mean, Tony mentioned ticket master. They're still around, stub hub, event bright. What sets you guys to part from those companies? And how are you going to build your brand? Right. So I think I kind of touched on it. Like our any customers, the fans. And that was something that we established on day ones. Everything that we built is for that fine experience. When we're building things with partners, or venues, or artists, or anything else, we always ask the question, is it good for the fan? And I think that the second thing is that DICE is just software. So if you're looking at the live nation, they do huge productions, they do all these things. You're a ticket master as part of it. We're just using software to bring fans and artists closer together, like helping them decide which cities they are, and how much they should be charging. All these things to make it super efficient. And I think that the third is that we're able to scale much quicker around the globe. So maybe we started off in London, but now we're in the US, in France, Spain, Italy, and India, Australia, moving into Southeast Asia. So it's like, it's kind of there's a global network. In fact, that happens as well, because you're giving that data to artists to help them plan global strategies themselves. So it's just really, when we're talking about empowering artists, it's like helping them control the cash that they own, the cash they can pay people and do things, instead of waiting for someone to pay them. How do you mitigate against scalpers? You mentioned that. Can you drill down a little bit more there? Yeah, cool. So this is, I mean, it's like things where in hindsight, it's like so simple, but there's nothing to sell. Can you buy a ticket on DICE? There's no ticket. And so there's nothing. There's nothing to screenshot. There's nothing to pass on to somebody else or anything else. Just moments before the show, there's like an animated QR code that goes around, which is there. But it's a very elegant, simple solution, but it's a way that if you've got nothing to sell, then it's impossible for scalpers to put on any platform, because they don't have anything. And how much of the business bills rely on upon the return of live music to pre-pandemic levels? And what is your prediction about when that'll happen? So we've spent 18 months or, you know, we're going to take. And like sort of stuck in our homes, we've been in Tali Digital and...",https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2iE41vefT4k,46,2022-10-12 17:08:34
3137," So your prediction about when that'll happen? So we've spent 18 months or give a take. And like sort of stuck in our homes been entirely digital. And you're thinking about the one of the things that I didn't appreciate at the beginning of Dyson kind of really kicked in sort of just before the pandemic. Because that we saw some data on terms of loneliness for people aged between 17 and 21. And a third of them expressed that they had intense periods of loneliness, even before the pandemic. You put the pandemic on everyone kind of living digitally. The return to live since summer, it's been insane. I mean, every record has been broken at Dyson in the last five months. When we're looking at the data, still now, shows are completely packed, like the venues are packed, everything else. You're in the newspapers that people have become hesitant about stuff, and then you go to live concerts and they're absolutely full. And I think it's kind of going back into what I was talking about with learners, that humans need to be around other people. I mean, it's one of the things that make us like human and seeing like an amazing performer. And it's one of the things that you remember for the rest of your life. So you know, live experiences, I think that people are actually appreciating them even more as a result of the pandemic.",https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2iE41vefT4k,47,2022-10-12 17:13:34
3138," I feel like I've been giving Tony a brief about musical preferences. I'm going to pitch you a little bit. Like I don't know if it's a DL or Coldplay. You know, I'm doing the UK thing with you. So do you work with the artists or do you work with the venues? So in other words, here in New York City, MSG, Madison Square Garden, are you selling tickets for them or are you selling tickets for Adele? So we do for both, but the focus is largely on venues because many artists play venues. But we have an artist development team and that's part of the idea of the global network because that DICE has venues all around the world and then artists want to play those venues. And we help them kind of connect them with those venues by the agents of the book or whatever else. And then part of that is, so I've got an example. So as an artist in London, pulled by the Internet. They started off with us from the very first show, 200 people and made the deal with them like called, sell exclusively through DICE, let's kind of build up this live story. And then from that, you know, you're not allowed to spend any money on social media advertising, you've got to trust it to your audience, but get the story right. Now they can sell 50,000 tickets in London and it's kind of like taking them at each of those steps all the way through. And throughout the whole time, Bicep understood their audience, they knew what they wanted where they wanted to play, they had control over, you know, their live strategy. And this is what we're doing at scale now. Right. And so do you cover all the venues in the world or do you have to, are there some venues that are not a part of your ecosystem yet? Yeah. So we wish we had, we have all the best ones, most of the best ones. So there's some holdouts. There's other people who have the ticketing rights for those venues. But we have, there's 3,600 venues sort of around the world, which is increasing day by day. And we also work largely in major cities. So the, you know, in New York, over a million people used DICE last month. And so it's quite a big spread of venues in New York. And for that, it's the same in Paris and Barcelona, all these things, because there's lots of events happening there. So the discovery engine is really kicking off. And our thing is that if you want to see a show once a month, and let's get you to show once a week, how to reduce the friction for you to actually get there. So, you know, our competition is like people stay in the home, which and Netflix is like, well, how do we make it as easy and compelling to kind of get out and see something in books? I don't think anyone's been to a great show and said, well, not doing that again. So it's the exact opposite. Tony, while I have a year, I got to ask you a few questions about Apple and the iPhone, Silicon Valley. So you were on the cutting edge and designing the iPhone, but it's been around for a while. What do you think is kind of the next big thing in terms of consumer tech? Thoughts on the metaverse? Those are two big questions happening right now. Well, the big things on the horizon for consumer electronics, you know, we're hearing more about, you know, augmented reality of these kinds of things. We're hearing about the metaverse, you know, frankly, I think we got a lot of fish to fry, and we are frying ourselves. So I think we need to spend more time on fixing the climate than we need to worry about getting into the metaverse. So let's make sure we have an environment to live in before we find another environment that, you know, keeps us in like refrigerated chambers and, you know, so that we can breathe and eat. So that's how I feel about the metaverse, you know, but on consumer electronics, I think, you know, a lot of this stuff, people think that this is going to be the next big thing, like augmented reality. I think it will be for certain very niche verticals, but not necessarily like the consumer thing that you need because, you know, we saw this before, you got to need the technology, and then you have to understand that the consumers want it, right? And they want to live in that. It live with these things on it. And it's social acceptance. It's not just you.",https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2iE41vefT4k,48,2022-10-12 17:17:06
3139," And they want to live in that. It live with these things on it. And it's social acceptance. Not just you accepting it, but the people around you accepting it. And that I've learned all the time is the technology might be right. But it's the social timing right. Is there a social acceptance? And are you truly delivering a pain killer because there's a clear need? There's a clear pain. The iPhone solved the need, right? It was on the go internet email media, these kinds of things. We don't see the need yet for the metaverse. And then to have the metaverse wherever you go on you, we already tried that with Google Glass. I think it's going to take a little while. Yeah. And speaking of Google, you invented, helped create the iPhone, the iPod Nest, which was bought by Google. And these products are networked now in a huge way. What does your take on both the upside and the downside of this massive amount of networking that some people say leads to dystopian possibilities, but also tremendous upside? Well, look, there's always unintended consequences in everything. And I, you know, technology's neutral. It's what we choose to do with it and how we regulate and what we socially accept. So we have to do things that are promote social bonding, like what Bill's doing with dice, right? Not letting the ticket bots in there, not letting the scalpers in there, doing all the things necessary. And that's what I love what Bill and Dice is doing is they're trying to bring all the best things to connect the artists to the fans, right? And getting rid of all of those middlemen who are just stealing along the way. So that's what we want to do. And I so I love the network. It can have better shows, have the artists make more things for their fans so that the fans have a better and better experience. And maybe through that, we can create even more social movements to fix some more of these problems. But it's about bringing people together and not about a network of intermediaries stealing along the way. Or just one more way back machine question. OK. Really OK. And that's you work with Steve Jobs. Apple built a music business when you were there. What did you learn from Steve? And what do you think he'd be thinking about the world today and the technology that we're using? Well, I think for me, what it was all about in the music story and the iPod, it was always about what do the customers really want? What is going to give them that social or next to me, that emotional experience that they crave, that they want, and a rational part of that, making it simple and all those other things? And that's kind of, that's like dice. So when you see something like this, you're like, wow. I think that if Steve was here today, he would go, we need to get artists more money. I think if he looked at the streaming services out there, I know how much he loved musicians, bands, and wanted to support them. I remember way back when he was looking and buying certain media companies, that kind of stuff, because he really wanted to revolutionize that. And so as far as I'm concerned, if he woke up today and saw the streaming services the way they are today and where the artists are not getting fairly paid, he would fix that. Absolutely. I remember too many infill when he came by and demoed the iPad at timing when I worked there and he played music and he played friend of the devil. And I said, oh, the grateful dead and he goes, I love the grateful dead. You can see he really meant it, right? Yeah, oh yeah. Really passionate about that.",https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2iE41vefT4k,49,2022-10-12 17:21:30
3140," you you you you You come from a musical background and music industry background i should say but jeez What made you decide to get in a ticketing? Yeah i mean, i wasn't tech before going into the music and I've not knowing anything about the music industry so very naive but it's very lucky in the music industry were getting bigger and bigger. And actually didn't care about ticketing. Didn't understand it because you spend so much time working with the artist and making an amazing album to make an amazing artwork, looking at their life. So, and didn't think about the ticketing until the artist got bigger in North America. And that was when it suddenly was like, hang on a minute, we did a deal for 40 bucks. And now the tick at 65, where's this 25 going? It sold out and it's been sold for hundreds of thousands of dollars and all the fans are angry at the artist. Like, why is anyone fixing this? And so then I went back into sort of all world new world together and just analyzed all the ticket companies and tried them all out. Didn't want to just try and deceive. There was a solution and that was the thing well, if no one else is going to fix it, I guess that we have to do it. So I'm kind of just touching on to the last question as well. I think that's, you know, take a lot of inspiration from what Tony created. You know, really thinking about the small things, you know, the experience when someone sees it, small little animations within the app, the ticket, the imagery, you're talking about brand before like people wear dice t-shirts and have the bags and everything else like all these things, like things which we really care about, because you know, you need to make a revolution and all this stuff like pays off because eventually, because of all these things being put together, artists make more money in the right way. I didn't really ask you about the business model or your P&L, how are you doing? How's the company doing? So can you dive into that a little bit quickly? Sure, as I mentioned before, it was the, you know, we, you know, the pandemic and coming out of it was like, it was a shock. I mean, we went from no one going out to everyone going out. And, you know, from zero people in New York, like sort of going out to, you know, a million people going out.",https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2iE41vefT4k,50,2022-10-12 17:25:27
3141," went from no one going out to everyone going out. And from zero people in New York, like sort of going out to a million people going out. So we have a, you know, it's over a million in New York in the last month, a million in London, half a million Paris, like all these people sort of coming together. How we make money is that we charge the venues or the artists for using dice as their partner to sell the tickets. So it's like, we're very pro privacy. And so the, you know, again, just protecting the fans from this, but also everyone knows like how we make money, make money from selling the ticket. There's no advertising, nothing else. That's that's that's on there. And in terms of the, you know, the volume is like, it's, it's accelerating. It's turning out like every week. Right? Let me be clear. We're right. We're happily writing checks and we're backing these guys. And even in the darkest of times, we see, we see the light and we see the growth and we see the fans and they're coming back, right? It's sticky. People love it. They're telling their friends about it. We do very little advertising. I meet a ton of people go, I go, yeah, I'm in the investor in dice. It's like, oh, I'm a user. Like there's so many people. If you actually ask people in the regions where we operate, there's a lot of people using it. We just don't sit there and market it. And, you know, it's self-market because the fans love it. And so that's why we keep investing because we know this is the future and it already is here today. Word of mouth seems to be working. So are you guys venture back, build IPO in the future, perhaps? Yeah. So yeah, we venture back and and public listing in the future. Yeah. Great. And Tony, how did you guys meet? So interestingly enough, I had friends in London and they said, oh, you have to meet Phil. You guys would get along, you love music. He's doing something really cool. And Phil and I just were at a hotel, I think it was a ham yard. And we just had a drink and we just started talking. And we talked all about music. And then we started talking about books and started sharing titles and just getting into, you know, psychology of like a fan and what does it mean? And why do we love shows? And really just hit it off. And it was just there was like, okay, that's it. And Dice was tiny. It was just a vision. And so it was really about a team and a mission. And you know, and Phil as an entrepreneur and visionary. And Phil, where do you see the company five years, 10 years from now? I mean, doesn't it have to become part of one of the, well, they used to call it fangs. I guess they're mangs now. You know, part of an ecosystem. Everything's got to be part of an ecosystem. Or can it be a standalone? Do you think going to be a standalone? I think that live entertainment, you know, how people look at the, the, the, the, the market right now. I think it's, I think it's undercooked. I think that it's huge. I think that you've, you know, if you've got 90% of the population of the world liking music, maybe half the population loving music and 30% people love music so much that they pay to go see it. And that's a massive market. And I think that, you know, what we're seeing is growing this around the world. I mean, like for example, just starting off in India, that market could be as big as the US within 10 years. Right. I love the Pam thing. You know, that is a truly small set. People who hate music. I hate music. Right. I'm sorry about that. That's a pretty small group of people. Right? It's pretty cool. It was the same time for the iPod. It was the same time for the iPod. Right. Yeah, that's not right. That's about right. And final couple of last questions here. Phil, what do you think that you want to be your legacy? Wow. Absolutely. I was thinking about that one. OK. You know what? It's the idea. One of the things I love the most, yeah, is the idea that we're in Mumbai and there's a scene happening in Mumbai. And there's this new music that's happening in Mumbai. And through the connections of DICE, that artist goes straight into the US and Asia and through Europe and blows up. And we do that time, time again. That the idea of bringing culture sort of around the world, that would be awesome.",https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2iE41vefT4k,51,2022-10-12 17:30:21
3142," Europe and blows up and we do that time time again. The idea of bringing culture around the world, that would be awesome. Tony, same question over to you. You've got all of these things you've accomplished, working here with DICE and I'm sure you got some all kinds of other things percolating your brain. What do you hope to accomplish over the following years? For me, it's really about mentoring and investing my time with the entrepreneurs who are truly changing the world for the better, whether that's environmentally, socially, or for health. Those are the three big things and DICE is doing that for the social experience all around the world. It's amazing and that's what I hope. Phil is able to fulfill and bring this mission and I think he's well along the way to deliver it. Well, it'd be great to watch the company grow as we hope we emerge from COVID and live comes back and people get interested in your business. So I want to thank Phil Hutchins founder and CEO of DICE and Tony Phil Board Member there and entrepreneur and executive extraordinaire. Thank you guys very much for your time. Thank you so much, Andy. Thanks, Andy. Great to see you. You've been watching influencers. I'm Andy Sirwork. We'll see you next time. Welcome back. I'm Brian Sousie here with Julie Hyman and Brad Smith. We're seeing green on the screen today across the major indices. That's even as President Biden warned about a potential mild recession. Here's what we're watching for you at this moment. A caffeinated quarter, PepsiCo's checker page is read hot on Yow Finance this morning as the company blew away profit estimates, excuse me, and raised guidance. PepsiCo's CFL Hugh Johnson told us moments ago demand continues to be very strong and they are pushing through more price increases. More big calls. Earning the season officially ticked off today with PepsiCo's results. So, I'll have a look at a few pre-earnings calls by analysts on Apple and Norwegian cruise line. In the state of freelance workers, we'll talk to the CO5er on the outlook for the gig economy as economic growth slows. Brad, over to you at the Wi-Fi interactive. Can we get out? I was at the Yow Finance interactive. Was the Wi-Fi, whatever it is, there you are, Brad. There we are. All right. Taking a look at the dash-shones industrial average. Right now, we are holding onto some slight gains on the day by about half a percent right now for the average up by about 143 points. You've also got the NASDAQ composite tech heavy average in the green. It's up 3.10 per percent, 31 minutes into today's trading session, and the S&P 500. You're also seeing some green on the screen there. That's up a little more than 3.10 per percent. Taking a look at as well. Some of the activity that we're seeing more broadly here. Let me navigate us over to some of the NASDAQ 100 names that we've been continuing to track throughout the day. It looks like broadly you've got more advances than declines here. An interesting move here that we're seeing, especially in some of the retail names, you've got a sharp move higher in Louis Lemon on the day. We've been tracking that stock throughout the week, given some of the new bullish sentiment that's entered into the market, talking about Louis Lemon as well as the annexation to the Gen Z brand affinity with it. So we'll continue to watch Louis as we move forward throughout the rest of today's session. That's up by about 2 percent. Another big gainer here as well that we've got on the day. Ticker symbol, MRN, they will dive into that one in just a little bit. So stick around for that. Let's shift our broader market conversation after some data from the producer price index and with inflation showing. No relief. Our next guest says that a recession may be coming for more. Let's welcome in. The Chief Economist at EY Parthenon. Greg Dacco. Greg, great to have you here with us this morning. First and foremost, if we were to see that recession that perhaps many of the economists, if they are right, that it might be slight versus the more longer or protracted one, where do you fall within that camp? Well, I think we're certainly seeing the initial signs of a significant slowdown in terms of global activity. We are seeing an environment in which.",https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2iE41vefT4k,52,2022-10-12 17:34:37
3143," Well, I think we're certainly seeing the initial signs of a significant slowdown in terms of global activity. We are seeing an environment in which European growth is slowing quite dramatically, in which growth across emerging markets is also slowing, and in which the U.S. economy is also starting to see initial signs of a slowdown. We're not hearing from the executives we speak to desire to retrench in terms of capex, in terms of hiring plans here in the U.S., but I am increasingly concerned that the global waves of uncertainty and the financial market stress that we're seeing globally will eventually affect the U.S. and lead us into a more profound recession. More profound recession, Greg. What does that look like in terms of GDP? Well, we are in an environment where our baseline forecast is for a mild contraction in GDP growth next year that would come on the back of growth around 1.5% this year. So that would be a mild recession. I think that if we look at household finances and corporate finances today, they are still rather healthy, so that would pretend to a more mild type of recession. But if the global waves of uncertainty, if the massive slowdown that we're expecting in Europe in emerging markets is exacerbating this slowdown in the U.S., then you could be in for a global recession in which we could see a more pronounced contraction in GDP, maybe on the order of 1% in the U.S. Greg, it's hard to know what to think right now, right? Because we are hearing a lot of prominent voices in markets and economics who are getting more pessimistic, right? This mild recession was sort of the base case for a while now, and now I feel like it's tilting more negative than that, and that there are risks coming on the periphery that then could cause more contagion. How are you weighing all of this right now? How do you figure out how concerned to be? Well, you're certainly right to highlight that we are navigating a world of uncertainty, and it's extremely difficult for business leaders to navigate this world of uncertainty where inflation remains a key constraint where the labor market is extremely tight, where the cost of capital is surging, and where there's massive uncertainty as to the geopolitical landscape. So it's a highly uncertain macroeconomic environment where it's very important to look not just at one base case, but really at scenarios around that base case. And I think you're right, risks are tilted to the downside. The baseline scenario is currently a mild recession. The upside is a soft landing of the global economy and of the U.S. economy by the Fed. The downside scenario could have some severe ramifications. If you have an excessive and disorderly tightening of financial conditions, that can have knock-on effects on to certain streams of the financial sector as we're seeing in the UK with pension funds. So there are a lot of unknowns out there, and I think that makes it very difficult to forecast with accuracy. So there is some discomfort in the fact that the baseline view is a recession, but we have to be acknowledged. We have to acknowledge the downside risks to global economic activity. Greg, at what point do you believe some of the Fed's activity will finally start to fully show up in the data and yield some of the results or at least the parameters that they're looking for in order to either pause or pivot? Well, I think they're going to be very attentive to what happens on the global financial conditions front. What was at the Naval Annual Conference over the first part of this week and Vice Chair Brainer highlighted, again, this concern about what's happening globally in terms of global financial conditions in terms of overall economic activity globally. And she highlighted the fact that we are in an environment where most central banks are tightening aggressively. And the fact that each of these central banks is tightening that aggressively has a greater effect than the sum of the individual tightening processes would normally have. And that is something that the Fed is going to be paying very close attention to as we move into 2023 because, again, the Fed leading the way has implications in terms of the dollar strengthening quite rapidly, exporting inflation into emerging markets, increasing the burden of debt for a lot of these emerging markets. And that's a concerning backdrop when it comes to the global economic environment. We know the U.S. is not immune to these global waves of uncertainty. No, it is not. Queues, no. Fuck off.",https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2iE41vefT4k,53,2022-10-12 17:38:56
3144," and backdrop when it comes to the global economic environment. We know the U.S. is not immune to these global waves of uncertainty. No, it is not. Greg Daco, EY, Parthenon, Chief Economist, always good to see you. We'll talk to you soon. All right, before we head to break, we are keeping a close eye on shares of McDonald's on some negative comments from City Analyst John Tower. Head of the company's October 27th earnings report. Tower site's foreign exchange headwinds, energy cost inflation, weakening store traffic data as key risk to McDonald's earnings days as tower. Investors have been anchored to the defensiveness of the U.S. business to spike these risks. And we believe peak valuation means a little room for shares to absorb a negative estimate of visions much less potential slowdown in the U.S. business. Coming out Amazon workers in California looking to unionize, Julie's got the details on that. Plus, more top headlines next. Let's get down to business now. Look at some of the other headlines that we are watching. Amazon potentially facing yet another front in ongoing unionization battles as workers at a California warehouse of petition the National Labor Relations Board to form a union. That moved the first step towards a formal vote and could see the warehouses 800 workers join the Amazon Labor Union. Petition comes as part of a way of unionization efforts hitting companies around the nation, including Starbucks, Chipotle, Apple. They're not used to unionization moves in their workhorse. This would be the first Amazon move by workers in California specifically.

3145," in California specifically. Canadian companies, Camaco and Brookfield Renewable partners, both moving this morning after agreeing to buy Westinghouse Electric, which still services half of the world's nuclear power reactors. Now the deal will see Brookfield Business Partners sell Westinghouse to the two companies, both the buyer, Brookfield Renewable and seller, Brookfield Business are part of the umbrella under Brookfield Asset Management and the deal comes as the world takes a renewed look at nuclear power following Russia's energy shut off to Europe and climate change problems grow. And the smash hit at NASA, the agency reporting it has successfully altered the path of the asteroid, dimorphous. After ramming its dark probe into it, scientists have confirmed dimorphous. Now orbits its parent asteroid in a tighter orbit that's now 32 minutes faster than before. The dark probe launched last year, sent back this video just two weeks ago before impact and it marks the first time humanity has ever altered the course of any celestial body. It also gives us one potential option for averting a planet ending catastrophe. Good to have that option. Indeed it is. All right, it's time for our calls of the day guys. I'm out of the shoot here with what is a I would call a blunt take on Apple head of their earnings on October 27th. Really interesting note by city analyst Jim Suvor, you see Apple shares up there slightly here in the early going. The headline of this report absolutely got me right at my alley. I love these, some of these, these crazier headlines and this one got me. He said, we are not scared of Apple stock despite Halloween and investor fears. So you know that Apple stock very Google SEO friendly nonetheless. He's listening or he's saying that iPhone demand continues to be very strong. They're selling more higher price products. That is good. Sticky services sales. That is good. Also suggesting more of an Apple car push in 2025. So this is more of a longer term bullish take by Suvor at city. I think acknowledges some concerns here going into the quarter. Some FX challenges. Maybe some slow down China but by and large. Just trying to I think bring a sense of hey guys this is Apple. They're going to get past any rough patch brought on by the global economy. Yeah, I think one thing that we do have to note within this as well is that for the iPhone the demand is typically going to always be there. It's just a matter of where they are in the cycle. Especially because so many people are able to pay off their phones through another type of necessity which is your telecommunications which is your phone carrier. And so that is perhaps one of the constants. It's just a matter of how much people are willing to take on a larger contract or go after a more expensive phone. If their telephone provider or their service provider is able to offer them a better deal. Now it's a larger question of course to right now of where in even the little luxuries we were talking about with Pepsi. Where that also kind of dovetails on over into the technology landscape as well in the consumer tech front. Do consumers look at some of the little luxuries and the wearables and say hey that's a little luxury or is my service a little luxury that I can maintain. And for Apple they've been continuing to build out that services business can be potentially an 80 billion dollar run rate business either by the end of this year or early next year. And so that's something they continue to watch going forward in the services and the wearables division for Apple. Yeah even if it might see some rockiness in the short term from some of those production cuts that we've talked about. Absolutely. Also another call of the one that I'm tracking here. Norwegian Cruise Line ticker symbol NClH. It's smoother sailing for new region after an upgrade to buy at UBS. The analyst also setting a $15 price target on the stock here and particularly they are kind of adjusting all cruise line models. It's not just Norwegian. It's Royal Caribbean Caribbean Caribbean anyway. Carnival Cruise Line that's pronounced the same way. They're adjusting it for all cruise line models for slightly higher expenses due to inflation and essentially here when you think about the broader cruise sector of course there's a lot of money that we've talked about goes out the door when it's a marketing type of expense that they have to look at just to reengage with so many of the consumers out there or the voyage takers. But then it's also on the other side how much they're actually being able to charge for tickets in this near-term period of time. And that's something that all of the analysts have continued to have to look through the profit margin models at and try to figure out exactly where that's actually going to be netting out for the cruise line operator. Yeah interesting time to see this call because we see fuel prices back on the rise. You have been highlighting it too. We've been talking a lot about weak pricing, we ticket pricing, notably coming out of Cardinal Cruise Line. But we just talked to Norwegians.",https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2iE41vefT4k,55,2022-10-12 17:47:32
3146," Fuel prices back on the rise. You've been highlighting it too. We've been talking a lot about weak pricing, weak ticket pricing, notably coming out of Cardinal Cruise Line. But look, we just talked to Norwegians CFO Mark Kempe last week and he said, man, is strong? We're charging higher prices. If you look at Q3 and our most recent guidance, we had said that our total net revenue per diems are expected to be up in the high single digits. So again, there's inflation is real. It is starting to level off. We are going to see some near term pressure on margins. But we don't believe that this is going to be a long term sustainable margin issue. As we look at and look at our trends and our business over the next year to two years, we see margin improvement significantly. And we believe we can get back to the same margin levels we saw prior to the pandemic. There you go. Really a bullish take-off. I kind of came aboard on a new ship. So despite the economic slowdown, you still have Norwegian and of course, all the cruise lines, they order these ships well in advance, but still delivering it a mighty new beautiful ship called, I think it was the Prima. Right. And I'll just add just very briefly here, as well within this call, they said, they see this as the most preferred name and it's due to relatively greater concentration of domestic passengers, sourced strong pricing given its higher exposure to the luxury segment. And the luxury consumer, whether it's across retail, consumer tech, and then even within the cruise line operators right now, continually being cited as one of the points of strain. All right, let's talk coffee, okay? Dutch Bros, bit of a perk up. I'm watching shares of Dutch Brothers this morning. Dutch Bro, I think it's a technically Dutch Bro. I think it's a Brooklyn palm tree right there. Dutch Bros. Dutch Bro's right. It is up a little bit after JP Morgan Chase upgraded the stock to overweight with a $38 price target. What's interesting here is the stock was up earlier as much as 5%, so it's actually, we've seen that those gains come back a little bit, but the analyst there at JP Morgan saying the sell-up has made it attractive, sites that change permanence over time through differentiated drinks. Some interesting stuff here. 56% of customers under 25 drink, 80% cold beverages, and 60% of sales afternoon. And that's sort of more discretionary, so maybe that's a little bit more vulnerable. Oh, I guess not. Yeah, everybody's complaining about Insomnia. Yeah, think if you're drinking a giant cold brew afternoon, could be also, you're looking at your phone for the two hours before bed. That doesn't help either. But I digress. The point is here is that the analyst at JP Morgan likes Dutch Bros and says that employment and stable gas prices are key to more predictable sales here, but that the company is in decent position here and it has the capital it needs to grow the business. I think I'm gonna, I need to take off a couple days from the office, just visit a Dutch Bros. Maybe to be my vacation. I see all the photos posted on Instagram, on Twitter. People are obsessed with Dutch Bros coffee. It looks beautiful and I think it has more caffeine in some cases depending on what you order than Starbucks. That's where I'm going vacation. I'm gonna go visit a Dutch Bros. Oh, wait, okay, everybody, can we clip this please? Ryan, it's how you just promise, he is going to take out vacation. I suggest it. Thank you, man. That's a promise. I suggest it. I'm gonna go visit Dutch Bros and I wanna report from outside of Dutch Bros with my phone. You're not allowed to log on. It's live view. I'm not gonna do it. While you're on vacation. Fair enough, fair enough, Dutch Bros. How depressing. Unilaterally. So depressing. All right, coming up, possible shakeup for good workers. We're gonna speak with the CEO of Fiverr about that and also a new study that the company's out with next.

3147," Here we go! The majority of bosses won employees back in the office full time. The new survey from Fiverr found that 52% of employers want their workers back in person five days a week. But 42% workers say they would consider quitting if that were the case. Fiverr CEO, Micah Kaufman, joined us now. Fiverr by the way, a platform for freelance workers. Micah, it's good to see you. So there's obviously tension here, right? There is this ongoing tension in the market. How do you think it ends up resolving itself? Thanks for having me on the show again. We're definitely seeing a very polarized view between managers and employees. And I think that if there's something very clear is that managers want this to be 2019 again. And employees cannot move back from having the experience of the past two or three years. And wanting to have more flexibility into the work, I think that some of that is going to be resolved, but the fact that those employees are actually going to leave. And I think in order to receive that level of flexibility, a lot of them are actually going to turn into freelancing, which allows them to define the level of flexibility that they are looking for. OK, so that kind of answers or begins to answer my next question at least, which is where would they go if they did leave? There are still for a lot of the companies that are either in a hybrid or purely virtual reality for their workplace and collaboration. There's still some of the hiring freezes that are in place. Some places looking at cutting and trimming their staff. So where would the opportunities be to still retain that virtual lifestyle, even if going to or looking for other employment opportunities? That's correct. I think that a lot of companies, those who are freezing or rethinking the way they want to employ talent, are really making a shift between fixed expenses and variable expenses. OK.",https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2iE41vefT4k,57,2022-10-12 17:56:36
3148," companies, those who are freezing or rethinking the way they want to employ talent are really making a shift between fixed expenses and variable expenses. And when you think about variable expenses, a lot of it is being answered by free answers. So a lot of the talent that are going to continue looking for that level of flexibility are going to turn into freelancing and we're seeing very high levels of talent coming to us to five or in similar platforms to look for that level flexibility. So Micah, does that mean a recession would mean just a hiring boom for freelancers? I think that at some point yes because again I think that more and more companies are thinking about the shift between fixed and variable expenses. So obviously that is going to fuel. If you go back to the wake of the previous recession right around 2009, we've saw a boom in freelancing. We saw a boom in new business formation and a lot of these businesses cannot actually afford full-time employees. So they turn into platforms such as Fiverr to find this talent. Micah, this evening we've got now this proposal, although it's sort of vague on the part of the Biden administration to reclassify workers, which there's some thinking that it might eventually make some workers who are classified as freelance before us to come on the books full-time. Any thoughts on that or the likelihood of that happening and the effect that that could have on your business? Yeah, I think that with the fact that freelancing is becoming a huge force in the workplace, statistics show that by the end of this decade by 2030, 50% of talent is going to be engaging in freelancing in some form or the other. Policy makers are trying to figure out what to do with this huge cohort. And I think that in this space we need to make a distinction between skilled and unskilled labor. So if you look at Fiverr as an example, on Fiverr, freelancers have total freedom regarding their work, what they offer when they offer it and from where. So that level of freedom is something that is highly sought for, but it also comes with a price. I mean, you can't lead a totally free lifestyle and then expect to be considered to be full-time employee. In other aspects of gig economy, maybe the situation is slightly different because they have less freedom on what they offer and how much they charge for it. This has been in the making for quite a long time and we're actually working close with policymakers to figure out how the level of how we can level the plain field for freelancers in aspects such as access to affordable medical insurance. But that's it, as I said, if you want to lead the lifestyle that allows you total freedom, you can't also expect to be considered as a full-time employee when you're not. Michael, just while we have you, over the past recessions where the gig economy roles have been available, we've seen this flow into some of the roles for freelancers or even just workers who are looking to kind of take their own employment under their own control. For your business at Fiverr, given some of the investments that you've made into the business to try and unlock these larger projects, more engagement, what from the Fiverr perspective would you be kind of looking towards to really navigate a recession as well yourself as a business? Yeah, so I think that a lot of businesses we've talked about fixed versus variable expenses, I think that a lot of businesses are actually focusing on identifying their core competencies and hiring full-time around those core competencies and looking for the more peripheral areas of expertise and turning into freelancers around those those types of expertise, not could be if your core is technology, maybe something that is nothing your core is going to be marketing or design in which cases that they start to think about how to integrate freelancers into their workflows. And this is why we've seen the appearance of the Chief Freelancer Officer, which is a new role within companies within HR that thinks about how to",https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2iE41vefT4k,58,2022-10-12 18:00:23
3149," We've seen the appearance of the Chief Freelancer Officer, which is a new role within companies, within HR, that thinks about how to integrate that level of talent into organizations. We're seeing that rising throughout the past few years, and this is accelerating right now. Micah, good to see you. Thanks for being here. Micah Kaufman, who is five or CEO, appreciate it. Thank you. Now, let's get your quick trending ticker. We're sharing some Moderna. Merc shares are watching him. That's after Moderna announced that Merc has exercised an option to jointly develop and potentially sell an mRNA-based cancer vaccine. Merc is going to pay $250 million to exercise the option. That vaccine is being tested. Data on it expected in the fourth quarter of this year. But during a share, surging 10% on that news. A new burn lift shares got hammered yesterday on a potential change to how give workers a classified. We just mentioned it. Stocks are coming back today. Should they be? We'll discuss that next. Next, I will start. The sheriff's Ouberan lift and door dash are back on the rise today after getting slammed on Tuesday. After the Biden administration proposed to change the classification of gig workers that could revise them from independent contractors to employees. Fox Advisors founder and CEO Stephen Fox joins us now for some analysis on this. Stephen, has this now been priced in any potential change that may come in the first half of next year? Is it now fully priced into these stocks? You know, actually I think it's more than priced into this stock. I think regulatory concerns have been sort of the hand-ranging events since these companies went public. And what we've seen is that the companies have been able to manage through these events and actually continue to improve their business model. So I think it's being overdone at this point. Liftus said nothing is immediately going to change about its business model. Just yeah, of course that's what the company would say. Given the fact that yeah, there's still a lot of discussion that has to take place in the near term in order to see any type of reclassification go forward. But what extent should customers at the end of the day, if this does move forward, expect their prices, their fares to also have to be adjusted? Yeah, that's a great point because all the companies obviously could still raise prices to offset any higher costs. I think it's also important to keep in mind that what happens at the federal level is independent of what.",https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2iE41vefT4k,59,2022-10-12 18:05:37
3150," All the companies obviously could still raise prices to offset any higher costs. I think it's also important to keep in mind that what happens at the federal level is independent of what happens at the state level. So companies have been in discussions with various states. I think the most encouraging thing you saw without out of the state of Washington this year, which signed into law and independent contractor plus agreement, which basically allows for some benefits. This IC plus gives the driver's flexibility plus benefits. The companies are working to pass those costs through the customers and also reducing other costs tied to other pieces of the business to offset some higher costs as well. Stephen, as we potentially go into a recession, what effect will that have on the sort of driver service dynamic? In other words, could there potentially be more people who are available to be drivers? Unfortunately, if they're a layoffs or, you know, just do a burn lift get away with paying them less? Like, how is what are going to be all those knock on effects? Yeah, I don't think Uber and Lyft get away with paying them less, especially in this political environment. And I don't think they're looking to pay them less. I think if you go back and look what the companies have done. Forget about what they've said, but what they've done for their drivers, specifically over the last couple years, they've worked to make their expenses come down through various methods. And they've also worked to make their time on the network much more efficient. Obviously, if they're sitting around waiting for a ride, it's not as efficient. So it's really important to step back and say, OK, in a, in a weaker economy, how dependent has the consumer become on these rides share opportunities, whether to drive or also to ride. And so, you know, the real market is still the enterprise. So large companies with multiple pockets of spending on transportation and food delivery as a consolidate those things. Those are real profitable opportunities for lift and Uber that they can also translate into their drivers to make money. And so, you know, a lot of focus on driver utilization to make it more incentivized in order for drivers to actually want to be on the platform and be able to take advantage of more rides. But then there's also the thought of if this goes through and that changes the classification, does that actually make it more intriguing for new drivers to sign up and increase the supply side of this broader kind of supply demand equation that ultimately has a major kind of a major delta on prices here for consumers. Yeah, so one of the interesting things that I think Wall Street doesn't appreciate enough is that when you talk about these networks, the companies aren't playing checkers. It's more like three dimensional chess. So when you look at supply versus demand, like take the UK, for instance, where Uber is now providing benefits to the drivers while giving them flexibility. They're cost of going up, but then other costs have gone down in terms of actual providing, you know, looking at driver incentives, for example, they don't have to provide as many. And so they're attracting probably more drivers now passing on some of the cost of the customers, but competition has followed. So you're getting a little bit of that network benefit, I think. How it plays out in the US is going to be on a region by region basis, but generally speaking, I think the companies have a way to manage through this and continue to march towards evict goggles where they've been set, I get lift a new bird. Fox advisors founder and CEO Stephen Fox. Thanks so much for the time today, Steve. Thank you. A major headcount reduction is reportedly on the horizon for Intel. Thousands of employees are expected to be laid off, according to Bloomberg as the chipmaker looks to take cost cutting measures.

3151," to things like servers just as we started to see interest rates rise. And that's impacting its bottom line. And so there could be as many as thousands of these kinds of layoffs. The company also is dealing with those kinds of repeated slowdown that we've seen in the PC market. Gartner had said that the market actually collapsed 19.5% in Q3 2022. So it really doesn't look great for Intel at this point. Other chip companies are dealing with the same issues. But Intel is at this point kind of trying to turn itself around. They said that they're going to build that huge mega complex in Ohio. It's not going to look good for employees if they're getting laid off. It does look like the departments are going to be something along lines of marketing and sales. And the company does have more than 100,000 employees. So it's not as though it's clearing house by any stretch of the imagination, but it could be as many as 10% 20% of employees. Yeah, and obviously this is part of the moves that we've been seeing by many of the chip makers. Thanks, Dan. Appreciate it. Earlier this week, the Board of Directors officially approved XPO logistics plan separation of its freight brokerage business. The company also named a new CFO. I had the chance to speak to the company's current CEO and founder, Brad Jacobs, about the restructuring at the company. I'm here at the Greenwich Economic Forum with Brad Jacobs, the founder and CEO of XPO logistics, although not for much longer. Brad is great to see you in person. And I said not for much longer, of course, because the company is spinning off RXO, which is logistics business. You just announced what that's effective on November 1st, I believe. So talk to me about what's happening now, what the process feels like, and what investors can expect from the two companies. It's very exciting. After 10 months of working really hard with large number of people working long hours, we're this close to the spin. And we'll create two separate companies that will be an inch wide and a mile deep in what they do. And therefore, they'll likely do it much better. So we'll have a pure play less than truck load business. That'll be XPO. And we'll have a pure play non-asset truck brokerage business called RXO, which is best in class truck broker. It's very exciting. And you're not going to be running the day-to-day business any longer. That's correct. Do you have some plans yet for what the next thing, the next Brad Jacobs chapter is going to be yet? Well, I want to try to repeat what I've done before, which is to have companies that over a 10-year period or so create at least 10 times return on the initial capital. And so I'm not a private equity firm in trying to make two or three X, and let's not make any. I go for things that are 20X, 30X, you know, the big ones. So I'm looking for that. I'm looking for the next big thing. And where any hints of what in what industry or where you think the opportunities are, because especially right now, it's tricky time, right? It's the best time just start a business when valuations are low and there's fear out there and there's not a lot of competition because a lot of people are nervous about not being courageous because they're nervous about where the economy is going and so forth. That's when you want to get it. That's when you want to buy. When valuations are reasonable and there's not a lot of competition. But I don't know. I'm going to gainfully employed at CEO for a few more weeks. Sorry to get you to, don't mean to get you to jump ahead too soon. But let's talk a little bit more about the environment. You and I were just talking before now about all of the negativity that we're hearing, right? From Ray Dalio to Jamie Dimon, the IMF cutting, it's GDP forecast. All to the Jones and all of it. Yeah, all of it. I mean, you have a really good figure on the pulse of what's going on in the economy because of moving things around. So what are you seeing? I don't always get it right. I often get it right, but not a hundred percent of the time. My take is we're probably, so when you see all these really great minds, I'll come out and universally say, oh, it's really bad coming up. That's usually historically been the final pre-capitulation phase. So everyone agrees that, oh, it's really bad. And then you have the final plunge. That's the time to buy when everybody says, oh, it's down this. It's going to keep going down more. That's the time to do it. So I'm really having my antennas up for it because I don't think this downturn, which is likely to happen, is going to last for a long time. And there's definitely other two things. There's the economy and there's the market. And the market is usually a couple quarters ahead of the economy. Right. So we could see.",https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2iE41vefT4k,61,2022-10-12 18:17:58
3152," There's two things. There's the economy and there's the market. Yes. And the market is usually a couple quarters ahead of the economy. Right. So we could see. So the capitulation you're talking about is the market in the market. Yes, the economy might lag that. The economy could lag as the straights go up as quantitative tightening gets tighter. You could see a significant slowing in the economy. But the world has become such a small world and so well informed and so many people understand economics now. It didn't during the great financial crisis. I don't think it'll last long. I think there'll be such pressure to, okay, now we reduced inflation. Okay, now let's get some growth going again. I don't expect a long, long downturn. I expect a short, maybe significant downturn. Now, one of the things that was a detail in the latest jobs report made me think of you. And that had to do with trucker jobs, which fell by 11,000 in the month of September. And I'm just curious what that tells us. The number of truckers hired, I should say, fell by 11,000. A metric that we watch very closely, Julie, is for every truck job, truck driver posting that we post, how many people apply for it? That's about 45% just in the last several months. So there's a lot more people coming back into the job market as the economy gets a little tougher. So there's the pendulum is swinging on that. Don't get me wrong. It's still very tough to hire truck drivers. It's a lot less tough than it was even a few months ago. The inventory climbs that we are seeing, by a lot of, not just the retailers, but in other industries as well. How is that affecting your business and the loads of things that you guys are trucking around? Well, the transportation business does better. The industry is a whole, when inventory is a low, not high. There's more restocking and there's more goods being moved. But what you see right now is really interesting. As a result of all the craziness of the pandemic, people got the wrong, they have a lot of inventory, but it's often the wrong inventory. They have too much of this and too little of that. So there's still a lot of activity. So goods are still flowing. Goods are still flowing, but not as much as more. Not as much. But it's an interesting dichotomy. You observe the same thing. I observed today at the Greenwich Economic Forum. It's pretty downbeat. I'm sure you'd die here. People have their warrior face design. When you talk to my echo chamber is a little bit different. My echo chamber is CEOs of large companies, chief supply chain offices, large companies, entrepreneurs of small businesses who need their goods move. And they're not as negative. They're not as positive as they were say a year ago. They're less positive. But they're generally growing. They're not contracting. They're just growing less. All right, I have one final fun question for you. The Tesla semi. How much is that going to change the trucking industry? It depends on the price point. So we're a partner to one of the big OEMs for their electric vehicle semis. And actually, we call them semis. The semi-conductor semis. The semi-conductor semis. And we call them semis. Sorry. No, I'm being the other way around. But the semis are, they're beautiful. And the truck drivers love them. And they're slick and they're well designed. And they accelerate fast and they're safe. And they've all kinds of gizziness in them. But they're really expensive. And so the economics aren't there yet. Now, if the technology advances in the manufacturing process advances such that they become cost-effective, yeah, it can be very transformative. Makes sense. All right, Brad Jacobs of XPO, thank you so much. It was great to see you in person. Really appreciate it. Pleasure to meet you. Thanks. So it was fun there because Brad was sort of an antidote to a lot of the darkness. I mean, he's not saying everything is wonky-dory and fantastic. But part of it is the force of his personality. Part of it is what he's seeing on the ground. He was a little bit of a counterbalance to some of the worst case scenarios that we're hearing out there. You say tomato. I say tomato. Yeah, exactly. That makes sense. It was interesting to what he said, though, about the Tesla semi-truck. It's going to be fascinating when those trucks eventually hit the road because at some point, it sets the stage for driverless semi-trucks in this country. Yes. But as he said, the price has to come down. Absolutely. For it to make sense, which makes sense. Right. Also, a critical time for the business.

I think we can use these rewards to get that eggo eggnog. So I'm excited about it. No, it doesn't go that way. It goes the other way. So I can't use eggnog. OK. Am I misunderstanding? I understand. Yes. Starbucks points you towards Delta. OK, here's the details. 150 stars, 500 miles when you link those accounts. OK, so you get the double stars on Delta travel days. All right. So if you buy a Starbucks when you're flying on Delta at the airport, you get more stars. And you get one mile per one dollar spent at Starbucks. I have to add a special code and concur. Like, can I use this and concur? I feel like what I need right now is that gift with the guy with the calculations on the board behind him to figure out exactly how this works. It's still better than Duncan. It's still better than what Duncan did this week. I'm still waiting to get my free coffee. I think I have 600 more points to go. It's terrible. OK. I mean, but Starbucks has had one of the better rewards that are out there. And for the companies that have done more digital disruption for that customer touchpoint, I mean, Starbucks. All these companies should just copy Starbucks. Why try to reinvent any of the Starbucks? People love their rewards program. It's a huge driver of their business. Let's take a look at markets. Shall we? We have a mixed picture right now for the major averages, not much movement. It feels like this is a waiting game, both perhaps for FOMC minutes this afternoon at 2 p.m. And also, probably more importantly, for the CPI report that's coming out tomorrow morning. So perhaps a bit of a waiting game and that the market is playing ahead of that. Coming up, the cake of a G.D. is going to speak to the CEO of SunPower on the company's latest partnership with GM also be interested to hear what the inflation reduction act would that company. Don't want to miss that. We'll be back tomorrow. Welcome to Democracy, The Starry campaign.",https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2iE41vefT4k,64,2022-10-12 18:31:56
3155," Gamers Welcome to Yahoo Finance Live. It is 11 a.m. here in New York City. I'm Akiko Fujita. Here's what I'm watching at this hour. Sticky inflation, producer prices come in stronger than expected, but stocks in a bit of a holding pattern. I had a tomorrow's key consumer reading. Another hurdle for Amazon workers at a Southern California warehouse file a petition to form a union of vote alone would be a landmark move in the country's largest state. And charging your home with your EV, some power announces a big partnership with general motors on a new home energy system CEO Peter Ferrisy is going to be joining us later this hour. First though, 90 minutes into the trading day, we are checking in on the market action right now. As you see, things trading pretty flat right now, but the NASDAQ down about just slightly there, one tenth of a percent. A number of things that we've been watching this morning, we pointed to PPI coming out, jumping a little stronger than expected, up 0.4% month on month. We're also looking ahead to those FOMC minutes coming out later this afternoon, but of course, all eyes will be on that CPI print coming down tomorrow. Ahead of that, let's do a quick check of where bond yields are right now. We are seeing the 10 year yield still below that 4% level, but we are seeing it inching ever closer at 395 the five year well above that 4% level and the 30 year yield at 3.9%. Now all of this comes as we kick off earnings season, we're starting to get some of those results in with the Big Bang Flitter to report this Friday from",https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2iE41vefT4k,65,2022-10-12 18:35:37
3156," Well, at 3.9%. Now, all of this comes as we kick off earning season. We're starting to get some of those results in with the Big Bang Slated to report this Friday. For more on what to expect, we have here with us in studio, Victoria Green, G-Squirt, Private, Wealth, CIO. It's good to have you in person. Absolutely. I know. I feel like we know each other. Yeah. One way, Matt. Yeah, your first time we met, pretty fitting, right? We're talking about earning season. The bar is pretty low going into this. But you say set yourself up for even more disappointment. I do. I really see the market is hitting about 34.32. I mean, Pepsi did surprise on the upside. So maybe that's a little bit of an indicator that expectations have come low enough. But we have the dollar. I mean, the dollar was such a headwind in Q3. And I think you've got a lot of tech companies that are going to struggle. So who's going to do well? Probably the energy companies. We will probably see industrials do OK. We've seen some energy companies are going to continue to print money here at $80 or $90 barrel oil. So I think the sectors are going to matter. Individual company performance is going to matter. And what their CEOs did. But I think it's like you've got to check a box on what EPS is. But I think more so everybody wants to know guidance. What does this look like going forward? How much pressure is it going to happen with the dollar? Who's doing job cuts? I mean, it's expected Intel is going to announce job cuts to follow Microsoft, follow Snap. So we're seeing a lot of job cuts coming in the technology sector. Definitely no risk going to full earning season. Financials really kick it off. And we'll see. Did they pick up net interest income? Or are they having to put too many reserves, not seeing any mortgages? You know, we've definitely seen the mortgages almost grind to a halt. And then investment banking has been just difficult this year. So banks make trouble. So the four looking statements are what we're looking for going into these results. But also, you know, it seems to be still a bit of a debate if you could argue that, that, you know, where exactly we are in terms of the macro picture. You have those comments coming in from President Biden saying that he doesn't expect a recession. Obviously, he's the president. He's not going to say things are going to get worse. But we also got those comments from Jamie Dimon, which seems to suggest there are more rough patches ahead. How do you view that? So I think the fact the president said the R word, you know, if you're a fan of the show West Wing with a bagel word, you know, that nobody wants to say the R word is bagel time. But the fact the president is acknowledging it might be a slight recession. And that has to mean they're even acknowledging the slowdown is coming, the Fed's acknowledged the slowdown is coming. They're trying to slow it down, the slowdown inflation. I'm with Jamie Dimon. I actually think we're in a recession. I know we can argue the definition of recession. And that's technically Nebers job. But if you look at the slowdown, where we're going with growth, what's happening with inflation? What's happening with the hawkers fed? Definitely on Jamie Dimon's that there's a little more pain coming. Not sure I'm full IMF, right? They came out with like, hey, expect another 20% down like there's more pain coming. Everybody's going to feel recession in 23. Feel like that might be a tad draconian at this point. But I do think we're still going to see the effects. Remember the lag between rate hikes. And when we feel in the labor market, it's about 12 months. So the question is, where do you position yourself if that slowdown is already underway? You've been bullish on energy for quite some time. And there's questions right now, especially with the moves that we saw from OPEC last week about whether things are really going to start to take up. And when we have seen them tick up a little, where are you positioned in some of those big names? Sure. We did actually pull a little bit back to energy, but we're still overweight. We were very, very overweight. We pulled that back a little bit in June. But we still like a lot of it. So we like the USEMPs, right? The to get it out of the ground in the Permian area is about $30, $40 a barrel. And you haven't seen the rig count really jump up. We're at 765 total rigs. We're still below pre-piontubic levels. And the US has now become a net exporter of petroleum products because we are picking up market share from what Russia is stepping back in. And there are some big sanctions coming in December from the EU. And it's going to hit the shipping and the tankers, because they're not going to insure them. And if nobody's insuring an oil cargo, which I believe something like 95% of insurance is issued by the UK in the euro area. So I see opportunity in US energy producers. We liked our Devon, Devon, Diamondback announced the acquisition today. We really like the Shaneer. It's a natural gas exporter. We think the gas story. Because we feel like the story of energy security for the next decade. Yes, EVs are coming. Yes, solar is coming. Have we hit peak oil demand? We'll see. But we also see also the slit that we need people buying energy from all of us.",https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2iE41vefT4k,66,2022-10-12 18:40:00
3157," Yes, EVs are coming, yes, solar's coming. Have we hit peak oil demand? No, we'll see. But we also see also the slit that we need people buying energy from allies. You know, when we're dealing with that with Saudi Arabia right now, that is Saudi Arabia really an ally, or to sound like millennial self. Are they a friend of me? Like we're friends with them a little bit, but in reality we're not really. And if you look at the geopolitical macro view, you have maimed your players that we may have massive political shifts in. We have Saudi Arabia. We have Iran and we have Venezuela. And we're slightly not saying this is a grand decision and picking sides here, but we're slightly warming up to Venezuela because we realize how to Arabia really is not working in our best interests right now. Yeah, I mean, we did hear the President comment on the yesterday suggesting that there could be more moves coming against Saudi Arabia on the back of that decision. So energy, it sounds like you're still, you pulled back a bit, but you're still positive on it in this environment. What are some other names that you think are getting overlooked right now that offer real value? So, and I love my Costco. I'll talk about Costco anytime I can get it. I love my Costco. Not a stock itself. I'm talking about the company. And not even the $1.50 hotdog, but they are also picking up inventory. So this second Amazon Prime Day that we've gotten is not just because Amazon is trying to be nice to us. They're trying to dump inventory. Everybody's got inventory. Nike's got inventory. So the Costco's and the TJ Maxx of the world that are kind of the off brand, they're not beholden to any brand names. So they're picking up cheap inventory and they're moving it. They're a discount store. They're 75% in the US. The bulk of their international exposures, Canada, which has held up better. So I think they're going to have a little bit less currency effects. I like them. I like a really boring name IBM. I think they're a great place to hide. They've got a strong dividend yield. I think as a service, then a tech company goes, tech spending, it's going to continue. And because of the way they're positioned, I think they're going to see a little bit more sustainability in revenues. Because that's what we're looking at right now. As we move forward and things get pressured, who's going to still make money? And who's at risk of being cut? And so I think they're very well positioned. They're reasonably valued. But I think they still have a lot of growth. They changed who they were. And people realize IBM is a very old company. But they redeveloped themselves multiple, multiple times. They sold off Lenovo, got out of the PC business, and now they're in the hybrid cloud and AI and data consulting. And I see data and data and health care as a great place to be. And the last place playing defense is health care. Like a United Health. Great name to be in right now. And again, a little bit less effect with the dollar. So some of these names that have more revenues coming from the US, I think also will hold up a little bit better. Yeah, names from three very different sectors. But diversification is what we keep hearing. Victoria Green, good to have you in studio today. Yeah, thank you so much for having me. Joining us from G-Spray Private Wealth. Well, let's take a look at oil now. As OPEX last year's its forecast for global crude demand. Yahoo, finances, Jared Blickery here. With more on the price action, Jared, I guess, in some ways. This is OPEX Wave justifying that cut that we got last week. I think so. That took the administration also, the Democrats by surprise. In fact, a lot of people surprised by that because a slash of 2.1 million barrels per day is a lot. Now, OPEX Plus has been operating under capacity. So it's really only an effective cut of about 1 million barrels per day. That is still a lot. And it has house Democrats up in arms. And some of the Senator, Senate leaders as well, Dick Durbin, offering up some bills that have been offered previously in the year, and these have to do with the potential altering the relationship that the U.S. has with Saudi Arabia. We know the U.S. just visited. President Biden just visited Saudi Arabia. But all of this is one month ahead of the midterm. So we know how that, we know how gas prices and energy prices factor into politics. So not surprising to see this. But I believe there is a resolution introduced by 3 Democrats that would suspend military operations and protections in Saudi Arabia and also some sales of arms. And that's a huge deal. There's $100 billion in active tickets with respect to the U.S. and defense systems out there with respect to Saudi Arabia. Now here are crude oil futures. In today, you can see just kind of sinking here after the 8 AM hour. But here's a year to date. We just climbed above 91 dollars per barrel, but still well in the lower end of this range. We just broke out. And so with energy as the leading sector here, you got to ask yourself, and I'm going to go to our sector action and put a year to date on it. With energy, the leading sector, what are the options here? Victoria Green, our previous guest, mentioning that a lot of these companies, these energy.",https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2iE41vefT4k,67,2022-10-12 18:44:14
3158," go to our sector action and put a year to date on it. With energy-leading sector, what are the options here? Victoria Green, our previous guest, mentioning that a lot of these companies, these energy companies, are minting money. And with respect to the supply situation of Saudi Arabia isn't playing ball. Guess what? Venice will. She mentioned them too. They have some of the largest holdings of oil reserves in the entire world. And they are on this side of the world in the West. So maybe we're going to see some increase in terms of interest with respect to repairing those foreign relations. And maybe easing some of those sanctions, I believe Chevron still has a presence there. So we'll have to see what comes of this. XLE, by the way, is still up 43% for the year. OK, Jared Blickrey, thanks so much for that. Well, Pepsi, PepsiCo seeing a big boost after the food giant blew away profit estimates with free-to-lay North America powering PepsiCo's net revenue. Take a look at the stock there, up nearly 5%. The company also raising its forecast, now expecting its full-year organic revenue to increase 12%. We've got our very own Brian Sasi here with outfit change from the last hour. I just put out a place. This is my outfit I watch on Sunday football. You know, I feel a little peppy Max, bubbles and black and ice, and you're good to go. Which is fitting because we're talking about snacks. Turns out snacks are pretty resilient even in the face of cost rises. Yeah, you know, I don't want to bury the lead here. Bottom line is we talked to PepsiCo, CFO Hugh Johnson. He said, hey, y'all, finance team, we're pushing through price increases because we're still dealing with high levels of inflation. And despite those price increases, people are still out there buying lots of chips and lots of soda. Take a listen. Okay, I guess we don't have that. We don't have that, but still, Johnson came out. Really, I think struck a bullish tone. So in addition to that, really saying how he, he just implemented more price increases in the fourth quarter. What he did not want to do is really provide any 2023 guidance. That is typically what PepsiCo does. He did not provide that on the conference call, but ultimately said that's not where they're going to go yet too. We were just also showing pictures of Gatorade. I would expect a big push by Gatorade more into the energy drink category next year. They will launch that what they're calling their new fast-twitch product, 200 milligrams of caffeine in the early part of next year in partnership with the NFL. That's basically- 200 milligrams of that. Oh, right on my alley. Oh, I'm so psyched to keep going. I can't wait. You're gonna have more than one of those, right? Oh, you better go. I mean, you know, when you talk about those cost increases, and how much of it is it to offset? I mean, it's clearly there to offset the price increases they're seeing internally from the materials, everything that goes into making all these stacks, but at the same time, is it enough to offset what they're seeing internally? Yeah, they have, I would say they have. Pepsi was out here this morning with, I think, an earnings beat. Nobody on the street expected. That's why the stock is ripping higher here for Pepsi on an earnings day. That's a pretty big move. That's why it's the hottest ticker on the Yow Finance platform. This quarter's positively surprised a lot of folks on the street over the next coming days. I would not be surprised to see upgrades on Pepsi co-stock upgrades and price targets, upgrades and earnings estimates because it's clear that they have pricing power. And I think the focus now turns onto Coca-Cola to see if they report more of the same. First instinct is yes, you will probably see a very strong quarter from Coca-Cola. The only red flag I would call out is maybe more currency exposure for Coca-Cola than Pepsi-Cola, but still Coca-Cola is teed up for a very strong quarter. Now, yeah, currency exposure one. We're going to continue to hear throughout the earnings season. Brian Sasi, thanks so much. Thanks. Well, shares of Intel aren't focused today as the company reportedly considers major job cuts. That stock is up right now, but it did hit a new 52 week low today. Bloomberg reporting the chipmaker plans to announce the reductions around its quarterly results on October 27. News of the cuts come as the company sees declining demand for its products, especially its PC processors. It's a key revenue driver for the company. Bloomberg reports the revetions could be as high as 20% of staff in some divisions. Well, coming up from changing our office to watching the office meta labels the Quest Pro, a powerful device for productivity and announces tie-ups with Microsoft and NBC Universal. Dan Halley is going to break down the announcement for us on the other side. MUSIC",https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2iE41vefT4k,68,2022-10-12 18:49:17
3159," Whats going on? Swim. Eat. Well, meta has unveiled its new virtual reality headset with a price tag and an eye-watering $1,500. The device isn't aimed at gamers, it's being more positioned as a work-use tool. Those credentials bolster by an appearance from Microsoft's very own CEO Satya Nadella at the big event. Yaku Finance's Dan Halley has all of the details. I guess you could argue the device is a little less clunky, but let's talk about the technology and how this helps meta accelerate their vision of the metaverse. Does it, though, I don't know if it does. This is a $1,500 headset. It's really geared towards professionals. As you said, it's not really geared towards gamers. Part of the developers' conference that they were running had a huge focus on gamers and how they want to bring more game developers in and talk about how they're offering more and that game developers are making billions or rather millions through the platform. They really did put that heavy emphasis on gaming. The headset, though, as you said, seemed to be focused more on the idea of work and being able to have these kind of meetings in the metaverse where you can sit down with people from around the world and easily chat without having to do it via video conference, which I'm not sure that too many people will find that super appealing when they have to strap a headset on that is heavier than the current quest, albeit according to people who have used it, a little bit better weighted and less hot. It really was kind of a mixed bag. The technology is supposed to be better with better visuals, better graphics, improved lenses, there's the ability to see the outside world in color. You could do that sort of with the quest, too, but not really with full color at all. It really does ring to be seen if this is actually going to start pushing the metaverse idea forward still seems like...",https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2iE41vefT4k,69,2022-10-12 18:52:29
3160," You could do that sort of with the quest too, but not really with full color at all. So yeah, it really does ring to be seen if this is actually going to start pushing the metaverse idea forward. It still seems like it's quite a ways off before it becomes something that, you know, the average consumer says, you know, I gotta go out and get this headset and then use it all the time because, you know, they've sold something like 10 million headsets or more, but how often are they being used as I think the real question? And how often are people picking them up, going back daily and jumping in to do things like, you know, check email, talk to people, access kind of, you know, the big displays that you might get in the metaverse when, you know, instead you could just fire it for computer and do that quicker. Yeah, I mean, it is about that transition we talked about so much. It's not so seamless going from the real world to the virtual world, although I have to say, Dan, I'm just really excited that Avatar's getting lights. You can talk about that. I mean, that's a good sign, right? Technology's advancing. We talked about Satya Nadella making a surprise appearance. There, what's this partnership about between meta and Microsoft? Yeah, so this is about their team's mesh software and it's really, you know, they're both going hard as far as the ability to get this kind of work into the metaverse where you can sit down and have meetings with people, chat with them around a virtual conference table. You know, Microsoft already offers a team's chat where you can do video chatting with your colleagues through your laptop or your smart phone. So, you know, it just kind of feels odd that you can fire up something so easily that you can carry with you and have conversations with people. Sure, you're not around a virtual conference table. You're not able to virtually whiteboard the way you might want to although there is a whiteboard feature for video chatting with Microsoft teams when you do use the laptop. But, you know, it does kind of point to how both companies don't want to miss the boat on what could potentially be a big piece of hardware and software down line just like they did with the smartphone. You remember Facebook tried to launch a phone. Microsoft had their phone line, Windows OS, mobile OS, wasn't as bad as people thought. But they also did lean into gaming. So part of Microsoft's X Cloud, their Cloud Gaming platform will be available on the quest. And so you see this kind of, you know, balance between, or attempt to balance between gamers and people who are working. It feels as though they're trying to make a PC when the PC already exists. This one you just have to put on your head. All this of course coming as a medic kind of keeps the close watch in their rear view mirror, right? With Apple, expect us to come out with our headset soon. Dan Halley is always thanks so much for that. We are continuing to monitor some of those layoffs coming out of Warner Brothers Discovery. This is all part of the company's drive to cut costs. It's now affecting the Warner Brothers TV studio. Yahoo! Finance is Ali Canal following that story for us and Ali, do we have a sense of just how many job cuts are coming? Yeah, we do. Yesterday we got the announcement that the TV studio has been affected. That segment cut 26% of its head count, AKA 125 positions across scripted, unscripted, and animation. And that translated to 82 staffers being laid off. And then the company opted not to fill an additional 43 vacant positions. But there's another big cut that the company made. They are shuttering their digital production arms, stage 13. And the 40 year Warner Brothers Television workshop. And this is a big one because this fostered new, diverse talent. There was a lot of talk on Twitter. Why are they deciding to cut this when there was so much diversity? That was coming out of that program. So that is now done. And obviously this comes at a pretty crucial time for the company. They are trying to cut $3 billion worth of costs over the next two years. We saw back in August that they cut 14% of their HBO Max work for. So this is just a continuation of those expected layoffs. I think we will see more throughout the fall. But if you take a look at the stock, it's trading near 52 week lows. Down more than 50% year to date. David Zazov has been very aggressive. But I think investors are still in a bind to his vision. So I think once all this consolidation happens, once we get that newly combined HBO Max discovery plus streaming program next summer, the next step is going to be, OK, David Zazov, where are you going to take this company and will investors ultimately buy into it? Yeah, maybe investors are waiting for this shake down to all play out. The other company, of course, in this streaming space, Netflix, the big giant here reporting next week. What are we expecting there? What's interesting?",https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2iE41vefT4k,70,2022-10-12 18:56:52
3161," This is just waiting for this shakedown to all play out. The other company, of course, in this streaming space, Netflix, the big giant here reporting next week. What are we expecting there? What's interesting about this earnings report is for the first time in a long time, I don't think subscriber numbers are going to be the B all end all. If we take a look at the numbers here, Netflix says it expects revenue at $7.85 billion adjusted EPS at $2.22 a share. They expect that subscriber number to come in at $1 million. I actually think they might even be on that subscriber number due to the success of Dahmer. That series has just been crushing it week after week on the Netflix top 10 list. But going back to what's happening at the company right now, ad supported, that is going to be a big driver. There's been a lot of optimism on Wall Street. We've seen a lot of upgrades. The stock is up 18% over the past three months, widely outpacing the broader market. We still have a couple bears in there that say there's a lot of volatility. There's a lot of competition. We have Disney's out supported coming out in December. People are saying that Netflix could come out with theirs November 1st to beat Disney to the punch. But right now, I think ultimately analysts are really hoping for some more clarity on the ad supported and they're really banking on that to help Netflix improve their free cash flow and profitability. So that's going to be probably the biggest question that investors want answered during the earnings call in the report. You think that people will be a little more cautious in this environment in terms of which advertisers would be willing to pay up, but I guess that points to the attractiveness of the platform that at least, you know, the analysts see if they're upgrading it because the additional revenue source they expect to come in. And that's been some of the bear sentiment too because Netflix is charging a really high premium to a lot of these advertisers. So if they even want to be on the platform, they're paying above industry standard and that could be a risk. Yeah, an important point to point out there. Ali Canal, thanks so much for that. Well, coming up, the sustainability conundrum. We're from major governments, Trillian's worth of assets, and now a new report saying supply cannot keep up with demand. But isn't there backlash against ESG? We'll discuss next. Thank you. Great. Thank you. You",https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2iE41vefT4k,71,2022-10-12 19:01:12
3162," you you you you Welcome to Yahoo Finance on this one day afternoon. I'm Sean Smith along with Dave Briggs and Richella Kufo. Let's get you up to speed on the market action. We are looking at gains at least when you take a look at the Dow and the S&P or a Dow and the Nasdaq excuse me the Dow up about 60 points. S&P now back in negative territory. The Nasdaq though holding onto gains barely of just five points taking a look at this intraday chart. You did see this spike shortly after 2 PM after we got the Fed minute release. So it looks like the Fed minutes weren't as hawkish as what the street had maybe been bracing themselves force. That's why we're still in the green today, although well off the highs of the day, Russell 2000 moving to the upside up just about nearly two tens of a percent taking a look at the bond yields yield pulling back a bit as investors seem to get a little bit more hawkish if we could say that the 10 year yield now at 390 the 30 year yield at 389. Take a look at the sector action today and this really gets into what exactly is going on in the markets energy. The leader here up just around 1% but consumer staples also among the outperformers here up just around 8 tens of a percent. The reason why was earnings that we got out from Pepsi earlier today and take a look at some of those beverage names. You can see Pepsi leading the way with just around a 4% jump here to the upside better than expected earnings on the top and bottom lines. They also raised their guidance competitor Coca-Cola moving to the upside today as well as some of some the bigger beer names here. Budweiser you can see up just around 2% and Moulsen Quars also moving to the upside up nearly 3%. I mentioned the minutes from the Fed meeting. That's a big driver here in this afternoon's trading. Yahoo! Finance is Jen Schomburger has the latest on that. Hey Jen. Good afternoon, Shana. Many Fed officials felt that the cost of doing too little to cool inflation versus the cost of doing to outweigh the cost of doing too much according to internal policy deliberations amongst Fed officials at their meeting 3 weeks ago. Now several participants felt the need to maintain a restrictive stance for as long as necessary with a couple stressing that historical experience showed the danger of prematurely ending periods of tight monetary policy. Now at the time, Fed officials remained thought that inflation remained unacceptably high, noting that inflation data had come in above expectations and was declining more slowly than anticipated. Several participants pointed to continued elevated rate of the increase in�",https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2iE41vefT4k,72,2022-10-12 19:04:52
3163," on above expectations and was declining more slowly than anticipated. Several participants pointed to continued elevated rates of the increase in core goods prices. That is prices excluding those volatile food and energy prices. Now, most fed officials feel that some interest rate sensitive sectors like housing and business fixed investment have started to respond to rate hikes, but that a large portion of sectors in the economy have yet to. Now, as monetary policy titans further, officials think that they can slow the pace of rate hikes at some point and assess the impact of those rate hikes that have already been implemented on inflation. Many officials felt that once the policy rate had reached as efficiently restrictive level, they would maintain that level for, quote, some time until there was, quote, compelling evidence that inflation was on force to return to that 2% objective. Now, many officials expect the economy to grow at a pace below trend this year and for the next couple of years as they expect these interest rate hikes to filter through the economy. Guys. All right, thanks for that update, Gen Sean Berger reporting there. Well, let's bring in now Amy Kong, Barrett asset management chief investment officer, and Wells Fargo economist Mike Puglesi to break some of this down. So, Amy, as you sort of pass through the comments that we heard from the third and obviously, we saw that this hawkish toe and they are waiting for this consistent sign that inflation is going down. What does this mean for markets right now? Yeah, I think the trappiness continues until the third really gives us a little bit more insight into their end goal. I don't think they know what the end goal is because they are very data dependent. So, really going into the rest of this year and into 2023, what we're really watching for is inflation trends to moderate and to some earlier comments sustained at a much lower level until we get to that point. I would definitely expect elevated market volatility. Mike, these words, the aim of mitigating the risk of significant adverse effects on the economic outlook seem to sound a bit dovish to some. It seems to me that the Fed has been remarkably consistent. What did you hear today? Yeah, I think that's right. I mean, the message I heard is the Fed knows there's still a lot of work left to be done. Inflation remains well above their target and as so long as that's the case, they're going to continue to tighten monetary policy or at least leave it in very restrictive levels. But what I think you're starting to hear is a Fed that recognizes it may not need to be as aggressive with the pace as it was when rates were back at zero, right? Back in March or May when rates were very, very low still in terms of the federal funds rate, there was a lot of ground between where they were and where they needed to go to get policy restrictive. With short-term interest rates now above 3%, and potentially headed above 4% in the very near future, I think you're starting to hear a Fed that slowly but surely is calibrating to both ends of the risk spectrum, obviously not doing enough, but also potentially with rates getting to 4 or even 5% over the next few meetings, you know, worrying about doing too much. Well, Mike, and on that note, worry about doing too much. That certainly is the sentiment of some investors out there saying that the Fed is simply going to overshoot. Is there any risk of that? And I guess to what degree is that risk? Yeah, I do. And in fact, we put a recession in our base case forecast back in June based off that exact thinking with the idea being if the Fed wants to see not just lower inflation from month or two months, but on a sustained basis. And given the extent to which inflation is at best a concurrent indicator and, you know, at worst lagging, we're probably going to see a mild downturn in the economy. Now, it doesn't mean it has to happen that way if they can catch a few lucky breaks related to supply chains and COVID and the war in Ukraine and other factors that have been, you know, very unlucky breaks on the inflation fronts. You know, that could help them achieve the much desired soft landing, but, you know, I do think there is a very real possibility that what will happen in reality is a mild recession starting next spring or summer. And Amy, as we're looking at what's happening with the strength of the dollar, how do you see that playing into the Fed's thinking going forward? Sure. You know, the strength of the US dollar may, you know, certainly cause the Fed to think about the aggressiveness that they have been taking on the markets, but I don't necessarily think that they will pivot all too much from their aggressive stance. I do agree with Mike's comments, though, in the sense that, you know, we are.",https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2iE41vefT4k,73,2022-10-12 19:09:41
3164," that they have been taking on the markets. But I don't necessarily think that they will pivot all too much from their aggressive stance. I do agree with Mike's comments though, in the sense that we are at a point where we are now back at pre-COVID levels from the standpoint of where interest rates are. So really, I think the Fed needs to really understand how that cumulative impact is on the economy. They've now raised three times at 75 basis points. I'll likely do it again in November. So you're looking at four very aggressive rate heights. What's the tone they want to set for December and into 2023? I think they're going to weigh that a lot more carefully now that we are again back at pre-COVID levels from the interest rates standpoint. And Mike, you talk about catching a lucky break. Unfortunately, the war in Ukraine is ramping up. China continues to lock down and inflation is sticking around. That being said, what's your strategy to these conditions? Cash is king? Yeah, I think that's right. I mean, in these kinds of conditions, you've seen asset prices just across the board. Be it equities, be it obviously longer term bonds, even home prices have started to roll over recently. And so you start to think about where we're getting in short-term interest rates. The Fed does in fact go 75 basis points in November, which we also think is going to be the case. You're going to be talking about a 4% return on relatively safe assets like treasuries where you don't have all that much interest rate risk, you don't have the credit risk. And so I think until we get a lot more certainty on inflation finally rolling over and the Fed at least ramping down to 50 and 25 basis point of eight tax, let alone actually outright pausing, it's going to be very difficult. And I think in that kind of environment, you do want to play cautiously. Amy, what happens to earnings in all this? Because estimates have been lowered. Yet we got Pepsi out this morning beating on both the top and bottom line raising their guidance. Do you think this is a start of a trend or is Pepsi simply most likely an outlier? It's very soon to tell Pepsi is really one of the first major companies to report. We will see from some of the banks coming in the coming days, whether or not they start to build a reserve. We started to see that with Jake Morgan and maybe other banks will follow suit. I think it's again too soon to call a trend at this point. Pepsi's earnings were certainly very good, but one note to keep in mind is that they didn't guide into 2023. So while they do think the rest of the year will pan out nicely for them, I think the key is to listen for clues in terms of what 2023 earnings will look like. Our stance is that as we get into the Q3 earnings season and into January and February, we will start to hear those numbers come down. And we do expect that 240 in terms of what's the street now thinks as the peak in our next year is likely to come south to probably in the low 200s. All right. What do you see as some of the bell whether earnings reports that you're going to be keeping an eye on? Yeah, I think the financials are a great example as well, just given that one, they're so early. And two, it provides insight into the US economy as a whole, either from, you know, you can think about it just from loan growth and what's the demand for credit right now, particularly given the sharp rise and interest rates we've seen over the past few months, or just credit conditions more broadly. What are we seeing? You know, what are banks seeing on the consumer side? What are they seeing from a credit quality standpoint? So that's certainly what'll be front and center for me over the next couple of weeks, both in terms of the timing and the information provided. Okay, Mike Poblisi and Amy Kong. Thank you both. Appreciate all that. We're just getting started here on Yahoo Finance live. Coming up as mortgage rates hit their highest levels since 2006. To find out where housing prices are dropping the fastest.

3165," now Clearly, the Fed is not beating inflation yet, but they are winning the war against an overheated housing market today. Some new numbers showing mortgage demand slowing yet again. Mortgage applications decreased 2% from the prior week that's according to the Mortgage Bankers Association. These higher rates now at 6.81% on the 30 year highest since 2006 really took a hit on demand for refiase though down 86% from the same week last year. Question now is there any good news amidst all this housing carnage? It's a glimmer some deals can be had. Realtor.com out with the 10 cities where prices are falling the fastest and topping that list. In Texas where listen to this prices are down 10% plus since June. Phoenix, Arizona just behind them at 9.9%. Palm Bay, Florida Charleston, South Carolina, Ogden, Utah, they round down to top 5. Denver, Stockton, California, Durham, North Carolina, Spokane, Washington, also in the top 10. You might think those are the 10 cities where prices grew the fastest in the pandemic. That's not necessarily the case, Jonathan, there certainly is some overlap, notably Phoenix, Austin and Denver. But most of those cities were in Florida where prices are not falling that fast because we're still flocking to the tax rate. Look at Ken Griff and Citadel, they're calling it Wall Street, South Beach. A lot of people still keeping those prices high. Yeah, there certainly is a lot of demand in Florida. We talk about this cooling housing market and it's very important to pour out even though Wall Street has been lowering their expectations. For example, Morgan Stanley saying that home prices are going to drop between now and the end of 2023 by about 7%. That puts us right back to where we were at the beginning of this year, January 2022. When prices were still very elevated historically speaking. So we are starting to see a flow down, demand is starting to fall off a bit. A lot of that has to do with the higher mortgage rates that you were just referencing. But it's important to point out, Michelle, that on a pricing basis, we are still very elevated when you compare it to what we were seeing pre-pandemic. And as Dave was mentioning there, it is a regional issue. Obviously, a lot of the places that we saw that were really thriving during the pandemic as people wanted to be warm and we also had people working from home wanted some options. It's interesting though, because different parts of Florida sort of coming back at different places and then when you also look at some of these other bank predictions, you mentioned",https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2iE41vefT4k,75,2022-10-12 19:18:22
3166," people working from home wanted some options. It's interesting though because different parts of Florida sort of coming back at different paces. And then when you also look at some of these other bank predictions, you mentioned Morgan Stanley also Goldman Sachs saying that they expect home prices to fall between 5% and 10% next year. Wells Fargo putting it at about just over 5% as well. But then when you look at Zillow, they're actually expecting prices to go up. Now, I'm sure they're hoping that's the case, given that that's the business that they're in. But the big banks are expecting some cooling in the market. And so if you're a first time home viral and you got stuck in a very expensive rental, at least perhaps some good news, but you're going to have to wait about a year for it. Yeah, people think we've got a lot further to fall. Mortgage rates will climb above 7%. We could be looking at 2020, early 21 type of home prices. So you're going to take a further hit in what you have into your house right now. The interesting part about we talked about mortgage demand dropping off 2% from the week prior. It's picking up on adjustable rate mortgages. People taking a bit of a risk on those five year fixed. After that, your subject to market rates. And that we are seeing quite a big demand. People betting on rates down the road. I think in this environment, probably worth the chance for a lot of homeowners. Yeah, and we talked about the slowdown that we're seeing in the US. Obviously, this is also true on a global scale. It was interesting. UBS was also out with a recent report highlighting what they're what they're calling the riskiest cities for real estate. So Toronto actually top that list. Frank Firth, those were the top two. Miami was the only US city in that top 10 list at number 10, which I've had a little bit interesting, right? Risky. Risky. Not buying it. Miami will stay hot. They might lose a few percentage points, but we are flocking to the no state income tax. That would be fun. Certainly is a lot of demand, at least for right now. All right, well, coming up here, the self-described anti-woke YOLL ETF making its Wall Street debut yesterday. With the rise of politically driven funds, say about the broader market, we've got that",https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2iE41vefT4k,76,2022-10-12 19:22:34
3167," Pennsylvania Ken08 John Ken08 in the South New Israel The best for the future. Consumer Staples among the leaders here in today's gains after Pepsi posted a beat on both the top and bottom lines. They're full a year forecasting. Look at some of these numbers. Organic revenue up 16% growth there. The growth was also broad based North America and also global markets each delivering that 16% growth snacks were of 20% beverages were up 12% we had the CFO Hugh Johnston on Yahoo Finance earlier today and he was basically saying that Pepsi has historically done well even into a recession so Michelle maybe that explains the strong numbers here. I think the question though for Wall Street as we do see the strong report come out of Pepsi Pepsi leading the way for this current quarter whether or not this is going to be a trend maybe earnings aren't going to be as weak as we had initially expected or rather if Pepsi will simply be an outlier here. It's interesting obviously we're still very early in the earnings season but perhaps this speaks to the consumer that they're not pulling away from brand loyalty they are sticking with some of these brands. Obviously Pepsi also owns Doritos, Gatorade and a number of other brands as well and consumers clearly still sticking with that loyalty and still willing to spend a premium for some of these brand names versus say some of these store brands we know that during as recession as inflation has peaked people have turned to some of these grocery store brands but as we're seeing consumer staples still going strong at the moment as we're looking at some of the ones on the screen at Coca-Cola Pepsi, Tyson's Campbell and Kellogg enjoying some gains today showing that people aren't pulling back at least on some of these things despite high inflation day. Yeah and Sean asked which of those things will happen I'm just going to go with yes because overall I think Pepsi is going to continue to grow snacks and beverages we'll continue to be recession proof because they've talked about raising their prices has not impacted one bit the demand in fact their CEO says our category seems to be going faster than food food is going faster than non food I don't think that's going to change in spite of all the ups and downs potentially economically around the world I don't think overall they're going to be the rule of what we see in the quarter with the exception of booze my friends till array we we really focused on the earnings in terms of being a Canadian cannabis company they saw their cannabis revenue down 9% the quarter guess what booze was up 33% the quarter cannabis down nine booze up 33% we saw that with constellation brands as well it said their recession resistant and the demand has not dropped off so again yes I guess would be my oh yeah and I also think it's interesting just a commentary that we've gone out from Wall Street so far web bush was out saying that this is a positive re through on expectations for the broader sector for the broadage that broader beverage sectors that points to what you were saying just in terms of non alcoholic and alcoholic beverage companies here and also Pepsi was raised to a strong buy at CFRA at 12% upside there after the earnings be on both the top and bottom line so the streets encouraged I hope this is a trend but we'll see we love our snacks all right environment social and governance or ESG funds seeing considerable investment in the last several years and though interest has Wayne slightly this year to spurned a counter movement into a so-called anti woke funds with holdings in fossil fuels manufacturing and the like joining us now is vetifies financial futures Dave Nadeg for this ETF report sponsored by investment go QQQ so you can invest in the anti ESG movement now right yeah absolutely we've got a couple different versions of this from funds that are sort of mechanically looking at the individual stocks that are skipped by ESG to this new fund y'all which launched today which is an actively managed fund that isn't pretending that it's trying to go anti ESG as much as anti left so it's it's really positioning itself against companies who take any political so few right well that's my first guess well they don't actually say that what they say is mostly they're going to avoid companies that speak out on social issues that's the big one we do have another ETF drill from from a strive financial which is specifically going after those fossil fuel companies with the idea of voting for the ones that are and voting the shares of those individual stocks to promote more energy drilling so I think you've got a lot of different ways to skin that cap but the ESG side of the equation is",https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2iE41vefT4k,78,2022-10-12 19:28:57
3168," for the ones that are and voting the shares of those individual stocks to promote more energy drilling. So I think you've got a lot of different ways to skin that cap, but the ESG side of the equation isn't going anywhere. There's still an enormous amount of money chasing that as well. And Dave Rochelle here, I know you obviously people have invested in things that they believe in or that they support. So that aspect of it is something that's not necessarily new, but you say this actually might trivialize some of these issues. Why is that? Well, so when we look at the broad ESG universe, this is being driven by institutions and it's not a small amount of money. There's a PWC study just came out suggesting that we're going to grow from $15 to $30 trillion in the US focused on ESG investing. So the amounts of money we're talking about in some of the reactionary products here are pretty de minimis compared to the institutional money, which is going to continue to allocate based on ESG and which frankly is being rewarded for that. I mean, ESG is outperforming in most reasonable time frames, maybe not the last three months. But if you look over the, you course it this year or the last three years or the last five years, many of these ESG funds are actually beating their benchmarks. Interesting. So Dave, it sounds like you're expecting this, this pullback that we're seeing in ESG investing to at some point bounce back. What do you think that catalyst is going to be? Well, I think we're not really going to see much of a pullback in terms of that asset flow. In terms of the sort of the narrative around this, the political environment for it, I think that this will probably die down. I think I'm absolutely for people voting with their dollars if they don't want to be with an ESG asset manager. You shouldn't be with an ESG asset manager. That's a reasonable approach to take. But the big horse here is still that institutional market. A lot of it outside the US, that's going to be invested in US companies based on ESG principles, regardless of what the US retail investor might do with ETFs. This is a bit of a U-turn, but do you think the impact of these Republican attorneys' general will have an impact on the ESG investment space? They are taking this all the way. Yeah, I'm skeptical of that. If you look at, for instance, what they did in Texas, where they were trying to sort of black ball, black rock. It made for great headlines. When you went under the hood, it was a really diminimous amount of money that was going to be pulled from black rock. And in fact, if you got under the hood, they had to do a whole carve out because black rock was running their energy fund, their private equity energy fund. So this is a big, complicated industry. It makes for a great headline to say we're firing black rock, but it doesn't actually move the needle in terms of getting more drills in the ground or really even changing the cost of capital much. Well said. Dave, what about some of the returns that we're seeing on some of these anti-woke investments and ETFs? It doesn't end up being worth it, as you said. If you do have companies like Blackwink that are already doing business with some of these companies, perhaps, but making the headlines nonetheless. Yeah. Well, so one of the great things, also frustrating things about ESG, is it's very much in the eyes of the beholder. What I think of as ESG might not be with somebody else thinks. When we think about carbon, that's an easy one to understand. Investing or not investing or anti-investing in the net zero carbon transition, that's a pretty clean way of thinking about it. When you start layering on things like social issues, governance issues, honestly, I think the numbers get much harder to tease out. The carbon impact stuff, it's pretty unequivocal that the long-term returns have been positive there. 60% of institutions report that their ESG investments are outperforming consistently their non-ESG investments. Quickly, the currency hedging we can now invest in that space, what's the move? Well, people have been avoiding this and I don't really understand why. If you look at just domestic markets like EFA versus the HEFA, the hedged version, it's being a by 10% this year, just by being currency hedged. We saw this a decade ago with Japan, DXJ, a fund that really rallied way more than Japanese market because it hedged it out. We're in a similar market, but investors don't want to be international at all. That's the problem. We've seen net outflows from international investing in ETFs. So while a hedge diversion might be a better way, they're so little appetite for international diversification, it's not picking up a bid. Well, certainly an opportunity there. Big thank you to Dave Nadeg, Vetifies Financial Futures. Thank you for joining us this afternoon. Thanks for having me. You're so welcome.

3169," So welcome on, you can now get more than just caffeine when you get a red eye or your red eye. Delta and Starbucks are teaming up and their most loyal customers can benefit most. We'll have those details next. you it's time for triple play the three stocks that we're watching in the final 30 minutes of trading. We have Camico, Moderna and Starbucks and my pick is Uranium Minor Camico. Now the ticker is CCJ. The stock off about as you can see they're down about almost 14% there and that's after announcing a deal to buy Westinghouse Electric for $7.9 billion and that's via a partnership with Brookfield Renewable Partners. Now to fund the deal, Camico is selling $650 million worth of stock, priced at $21.95 a share and is also expected to close this deal in the second half of 2023. Now Brookfield Renewable and its institutional partners will own 51% of Westinghouse with the remainder going to Camico. Now a significant deal this is as Westinghouse services, services nearly half the nuclear power generation sector and of course the timing coincides with nuclear power really in focus at the moment due to the energy crisis in Europe, also high oil and gas prices and then of course you have some CEOs including Elon Musk who have been pushing for more nuclear energy use. You have Michelle the drop that we're seeing today the largest percentage decrease that we've seen in the stock sense January of 2017. So just putting today's decline into perspective you mentioned the focus here on nuclear energy. It's very similar to what we heard when we had the uranium energy CEO on the show not too long ago. He was talking about the importance of nuclear power here given the current energy climate right now saying that one in five US homes are powered by nuclear energy. He of course is making the case that more of that should be done in our own backyard that we should be investing more. So here in the US for up you can see the demand there for nuclear power and exactly what that looks like here.",https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2iE41vefT4k,79,2022-10-12 19:35:00
3170," of that should be done in our own backyard that we should be investing more. So here in the U.S. for up, you can see the demand there for nuclear power and exactly what that looks like here, given the current energy landscape. All right, my play today is Moderna. It's a top performer in the S&P after Merck extended its partnership with the company to jointly develop and also sell a cancer vaccine to treat patients with melanoma. Now Merck will pay Moderna $250 million for the collaboration, including joint development and future commercialization. Now Wall Street's viewing this as a big one ahead of the clinical trial results that we are expecting before the end of the year. You can see the pop in the stock today. This is not the only catalyst for Moderna. The FDA also granting emergency use authorization for its Omacron booster vaccine for children as young as six years old. So two stories here, very bullish for Moderna here and we're seeing the Pusok pop mostly on the cancer news, but still, big mostly. I was about to say, I think for the most part, the upside of the Omacron or any of the COVID vaccines, it's pretty much worn off. We are pretty much over it and flip the page, but it is that younger portion where there are some people that have not had their kids vaccinated. But this key truda is key because you've heard so many questions, Moderna. What now? What have you done for me lately? You've printed money for two years. What's the next plan? And this is finally a glimpse into that. Keytruda Merck's second biggest drug, 35% of their sales in the most recent quarter. My play is a two for its Delta Airlines and Starbucks. You gotta love coffee when you're flying. What's the comment thread here, though, beyond that? The two are linking their loyalty programs in order to boost sales. Starting today, once you connect the accounts, Delta Sky Miles members can earn one mile for each dollar spent at Starbucks. Members will also earn double stars on Starbucks rewards when making purchases at participating Starbucks on days when flying Delta. I know that sounds confusing. Check your email if you're a member of either. They've already emailed you. Through the end of the year, Sky Miles members can earn 500 miles if they link accounts, earn another 150 and stars once they make a qualifying purchase. This adds to existing Delta rewards relationships already with lift, Airbnb and Instacart. Delta Stock is up. Just over, let's see, it was just over 1%. Now 27% though, your today's Starbucks is up as well, 1% and down, 25% year to date. Interesting partnership, although speaking of coffee loyalty stories, the big story this week, Rochelle has been dunking members are furious at their changes, making it harder to get a freak up a coffee, and they say they're going to Starbucks. I don't believe it. I mean, there's a pretty significant price difference between what you pay at Dunkin' in Starbucks. I don't know how long it will last, but you start looking at your wallet. Exactly. As you were mentioning, these partnerships that Delta has, we saw from Prashant Sharma Vice President of Loyalty at Delta, they've really been trying to evolve the premium experience. They say they want to really capture that, whether you're flying with them or not. So, Sili, clearly having that overlap, that Delta customers get to enjoy that premium experience, so to Starbucks consumers, I like this fusion. I think this is good. What do you think, Sean? Yeah, I don't think there's anything not to like about. I'm a little confused just in terms of how you're going to prove that you're flying on Delta. How exactly this all works? So, I think we're all going to have to check the fine print of this, but this partnership of course makes a lot of sense. And this is coming in terms of, as we approach a potential worsening economic slowdown, consumer facing brands, facing a pretty rocky couple of months, that's what we expect at least. So, a partnership like this certainly does not help. Davey listed the partners that Delta has already had locked in here so far. It makes a lot of sense. I hope a similar partnership is coming to United. I don't fly Delta that often, but I think it makes a lot of sense. And I think flyers of Delta and Starbucks drinkers are going to be very excited about this one. I'm just wondering which of the airlines is going to partner up with the streamer. It's got to happen in the next couple of years. Just going to put that out there. Coming up, Fanatics is preparing to place a massive wager on sports betting in 2023.

3172," What do we know? So they had cut their production forecast twice this year from around $20,000 to $12,000, $14,000 to now at $6,000 to $7,000 a year. They're reaffirming that $6,000, $7,000 target. They actually made around 2,300 cards last quarter, which is triple the amount they made in Q2. But that's not that much. So a lot of heads are rolling actually in management there. CEO Peter also went to the factory with their everyday to sort of like, iron out those issues so that they're finally past that with the production kind of bottlenecks. But still a long way to go. We're talking about a car that costs around $150,000. So volume is low to begin with. But they have said they want to make an $80,000 base level to lose it air. So maybe that comes soon. Also the gravity SUVs also on the horizon. So that's another probably big deal for them. Hopefully next year we'll see that. It's a nice, very affordable $80,000 version.

It looks like demand is very strong amongst the airlines. What's your assessment? Yeah, thanks for having me. So a couple of things. Number one, yes, you're right, demand. Especially for international is very strong. We've seen a shift in mix in the last couple of months from domestic leisure to international and mostly international leisure. And I think that's somewhat behind the United Decision to add more leisure international destinations for next summer. We did a preview on Friday for the earnings season. And we said we thought American Delta United had the best opportunity for positive surprise because we've gone from the first, say, four months of the year when we saw international down something around 60%, 50% to 60% from 2019 levels. And now we're down closer to 15%, 1%, 5%. So you've seen that big increases as markets have opened up. People have shifted and started flying further, especially Transatlantic, not so much Trans-Pacific, but Transatlantic. And business we've gone from being down about 40% or 50% earlier in the year to being down 25% earlier in the year. So I think those two elements, and we've still seen strong domestic leisure, but instead of being up 35%, it's up closer to 10%, 15%. So you've seen that mix shift, which has huge positive implications for revenue. And I think the Delta reports tomorrow first, you just mentioned that. And I think you'll hear them talk about that for the rest of the quarter, or the rest of the current quarter. Yeah, fourth quarter. And I know, obviously, the industry is still dealing with some of these staffing shortages as well. How is this affecting some of the more profitable routes for these airlines? I'm sorry. I missed the first half. They're doing more of these what as well. As we're still seeing some issues when it comes to things like labor shortages, as we continue to see some of these kinks getting worked out, how is this affecting some of the most profitable routes? Yeah. So we're having these issues to your point, with respect to infrastructure. So it's not just labor. It's air traffic control. It's airport infrastructure. I don't know when you flew last, but I was at an airport. So it was two airports yesterday and the day before and stores are closed. They haven't reopened. They can't find people. And we're seeing a lot of that. And so that's going to inform growth for 2023 and probably 2024. And not only that, you didn't specifically ask about this, but the OEMs are behind on deliveries. So the airlines don't have the, and they don't know when they're getting the aircraft. So from an airline perspective,",https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2iE41vefT4k,82,2022-10-12 19:48:54
3173," The OEMs are behind on deliveries, so the airlines don't have the, and they don't know when they're getting the aircraft. So from an airline perspective, it's really hard for network planning to think about where they're going to grow and where these aircraft are going to go and not knowing whether you're even going to have the aircraft. United is in a really unique position because they didn't retire a lot. They don't retire any, as a matter of fact, of their wide-body aircraft during the pandemic. So they are in a really great position to be able to shift capacity around their network and grow into some of these domestic leisure markets. That's part of why we have United rated and outperform. And the others retire their aircraft and in part they were older, so it made sense to retire them, but they're having issues because the OEMs are behind on deliveries or having issues getting. They're having our aircraft to be able to grow, growing, going forward. So we think we'll probably talk a lot about that too. Yeah, Holly, you mentioned the supply chain issues, the volatile jet fuel prices, difficulty hiring and retaining employees. A lot of this focus is going to be on how exactly these airlines are going to reign in costs at this time. What do you want to hear? What do you expect to hear over the coming weeks? Yeah, so the first thing I'd love to hear from them is labor contracts. Every, the big four airlines have open pilot contracts. American has an open flight to tenant contract. I would love to hear them talk about there. They probably won't because they don't like to talk about open labor contracts on earnings calls, but I would love it if they could give us some confidence that maybe by next summer, a lot of these contracts would be negotiated and ratified. That would be great, both from an investor perspective and from an employee perspective. I think it would be nice. And if the pilots, the flight attendants knew what they were going to be earning, and I think that would be good to get that resolved. We also, as you mentioned earlier, we need to attract people to the profession. I mean, we can't just do it overnight. We need to start with young people, younger people. But yes, I'd love to hear that. I think we're going to hear a lot of discussion about their loyalty programs. The number one credit card that everybody has that Americans mostly have, anyway, is a cashback card. And then that's usually followed by a gas card. But if you live in a hub city, you probably have an airline card and your spend is probably high. And you, but it takes a while to earn, earn a free ticket or an upgrade. So the airline's like having that dollar today, because it's not going to be redeemed for months yet. And it definitely helps. But if there's the shift in mix to more leisure oriented travel from business and corporate travel, that's going to inform the way the airlines think about loyalty going forward. So I'd love to hear them talk a little bit about that. I'm demanding for the holiday season. I'm starting to hear from people that fairs are getting a little out of control. And so they're driving versus flying. I feel like everybody goes home for Christmas, but not everybody goes home for Thanksgiving. And in my investor calls lately, I've been hearing people echoing that and saying, we're driving this year for Thanksgiving or we're doing Thanksgiving at our house this year. We're not going. We have to buy four tickets, five tickets, whatever. It's just gone like really aggressive. Especially given how far fairs have come in the last say 18 months, because obviously in the worst part of the pandemic, the airlines were discounting. And in the last six or nine months, they've been raising fairs pretty aggressively in part to cover higher costs. But in part to discourage some demand. But yeah, flights are full. They're like 90 percent. Well, they're more there. They're almost always going out with very few free-seats available seats. Well, certainly airlines and flyers as well, having to be more strategic at the moment. A big thank you to Helene Becker for joining us this afternoon. Thank you. All right, well, fanatics is looking to disrupt the sports betting space and soon. These are all the company's plans.",https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2iE41vefT4k,83,2022-10-12 19:52:56
3174," Becca for joining us this afternoon. Thank you. All right, well, fanatics, there's looking to disrupt the sports betting space and soon. These are all on the company's plans next. Sports apparel retail giant fanatics is not satisfied with the $27 billion valuation. The company is betting big on the sports gambling space. They're CEO Michael Rubin saying that the sports business journal world congress of sports that fanatics will be in 15 to 20 states by the start of the 2023 NFL season. Listen. We want to have an integrated gambling experience where someone can have one, you know, kind of, you know, locked into our experience once. They have one loyalty program across all of our businesses. You buy merchandise, you're incentive to game. You gamble, you're incentive to get a collectible, you know, an integrated experience. So we will be, I'll tell you this right now, we will be in every major market other than New York by next football season, you know, 15 to 20 states. That's Rubin with executive editor of sports business journal A Madcore and look, they're not in New York for two reasons. One is they got denied the permit there, but also a 51% tax on sports gambling revenue. Can you make money in the state of New York? Not entirely clear. I can't tell if they can be successful in this field because Draft Kings and Fandool have just been dominant and they're not making money. So Michael says to anyone that says to him, Hey, it's too late to get in this game. He says, how are these companies doing from a year ago? Well, Draft Kings is down. Let's see, 72% in the last 12 months. Flutter, which owns Fandool down 30%. Pen gaming is down 60% in the last 12 months.",https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2iE41vefT4k,84,2022-10-12 19:56:59
3175," and let's see, 72% in the last 12 months. Flutter, which owns Fandall, down 30%, Penn Gaming is down 60% in the last 12 months. So yes, it is late, but in this game, it's still very early, second or third inning, and the bottom line is he's one of those leaders. Mike Rubin, it's just so damn smart, I can't bet against him. Yeah, exactly, you came bet against him. They do have an advantage when it comes to the data on their customers, that of course will give them maybe the leg up against some of those bigger competitors that you just mentioned. It's going to be very, very expensive. The customer acquisition costs a number of estimates out there, but what they're going to have to spend in order to build up this business, that is going to cost a lot. Interesting that they do want to venture into this side of the sports industry. And then of course, Rochelle, the impact that this could potentially have on some of those publicly traded companies. When we talk about draft kings performing so poorly over the past year, Fandall also having a rough time over the last 12 months, if in fact, Michael Rubin is successful with this, that will also push out some of those profitability targets that we've heard from some of these bigger companies. I mean, speaking of profitability, he also talked about licensing, because he was saying, you know, perhaps people think licensing is an issue when it comes to expanding, but he was saying that prices are actually 30% to 40% cheaper than a year ago. So he was saying that his patients actually paid off. A lot of people who didn't have, who had the money to spend overpaid, and now he's like, well, we're in a good position. So clearly being strategic about this. So perhaps that could be where the profits of Bentley's going to come from, perhaps the profit that will end up making from all the licensing. Goes back to what Dave said. It's questionable, I think, but you don't want to get bet against Rubin. Take Michael's name out of it, I'd say no chance. Yeah. But I'm saying there's a chance. All right, well, we've got to take a break here. Coming up on the other side, we're counting down to the closing bill on Wall Street. You're still looking at mixed picture, S&P in the red, off just about 2% to the percent. We'll be right back. All right. All right. Yeah. Just about 90 seconds here until the closing bell. Gender Blueprint joining us in studio with a closer look if some of these movers, hey, Jared? Hey there. So, not a lot of big movement in the major indices. We didn't get any fireworks from the Fed minutes, from the prior meeting, and then we're expected. However, we are looking toward tomorrow's CPI report. We are expecting a moderation in the headline number, but an increase in the core number. And I think that's why we're seeing some muted action here. Do you have a new trajectories?",https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2iE41vefT4k,85,2022-10-12 20:03:09
3176," We are looking toward tomorrow's CPI report. We are expecting a moderation in the headline number, but an increase in the core number. And I think that's why we're seeing some muted action here. There's not in utilities and the other interest rates sector of real estate. We're going to get to the bond market in a second, but just want to note, energy staples and discretionary, those are in the green. And let's take a look at some charts now with about a minute, less than a minute to go. This is a 13 week T bill yield. This is very short duration. This tracks what the Fed is thinking, or what is anticipated to be done. It is up 19 basis points. A huge move today. So a relentless increase in the expect exosfire works tomorrow morning. Before we go here, I think we have time for one more heat map. And we do have that in terms of the travel section. Check out this. Royal City enough 11% today. He's a closing bell on Balsby. There is your closing bell on this huff day stocks ending the day on a downward note. Not a whole lot of action as you can see. The doubt down to 28 points. The S&P doubt about 12 in the NASDAQ barely slipping to the downside. Nine points. Not a whole lot of reaction to the Fed minutes. We're close to looking for broader markets. Let's bring in Eric Friedman, U.S. Bank asset management CIO and Hugh Roberts, quant insight head of analytics. Good to see you both. Eric, let's start with you. Any takeaway from the Fed minutes? Are you expect tighter, longer? Nothing's really changed in the dynamics here. I think it's a story that we've heard from the Fed most specifically post Jackson Hall, which is rates higher and higher for longer. I think that was really the key message coming out of this set of minutes. I think the key thing for us as we think about the really the talent of this year is not so much what happens next meeting. But what does it look like for the Fed in the first quarter of next year? By that point, we expect to have a little bit of guidance from companies, which should be a little more sobered and perhaps a bit more tepid than what we may hear right now. So our viewpoint is the bar is pretty high for the Fed to come off. It's correct rate path for this year. But if we get into the first quarter of next year with some downbeat company guidance, the Fed may start to waver at least a little bit. And Hugh, as you look at the Fed minutes, and also some of these data points that you know that the Fed is watching and really looking for this sustained inflation to start going down. What is your outlook? Yeah, I would largely echo Eric's comment first up. I think this year and the immediate next couple of meetings are pretty much locked in really 2023 and the outlook there is more important. I guess if we're trying to look a wee bit further ahead, I think the comments from Deputy Chair Brainard have been probably the most interesting because the messaging has been consistent. It's been about taking financial conditions. That's been true all year and as Eric said, it went up a gear after Jackson Hole. Brainard appears to be the one who is just flagging the fact that overseas market is seeing stress. We've seen obviously intervention in Dolly-N. We're all aware that Shenanigans going on here in the UK after the many budget a few weeks back. I know the whole kind of move fast and break things. I think in the States you're used to looking at things like inverted yield curves or credit spreads or things that might domestically be the things that break. But actually it's looking like it's international stuff that's breaking first and Brainard seems to be flagging that up a little bit. So very early days yet, it's not obvious she's got a consensus at all but she's the one potential outlier as things currently stand. Eric, what do you think this measure is in terms of the pricing activity that we're going to see between now and year end? Are we going to remain volatile or is more of that risk to the downside do you think from these levels? We think probably a little more risk to the downside. I would just tip my cap to Q and they're firm. They do great work on this topic specifically but just in terms of our read on things. We say really a couple things at work. Number one is that we think we're largely in sync with the feds most recent thoughts regarding the forward state of the curve. In other words, the market is really in tune with what the fed is thinking with respect to interest rate hikes. That's really the first repricing that we've had. You cover this as a team very well in the last.",https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2iE41vefT4k,86,2022-10-12 20:06:23
3177," In other words, the market is really in tune with what the Fed is thinking with respect to interest rate hikes. That's really the first repricing that we've had. You cover this as a team very well in the last segment. And we think what's next is the slowdown, almost the lagged impact of higher rates still elevated fuel costs, still elevated shelter costs. We think that's going to start to really weigh in on margins. And so we do think there's probably a little more downside. We wouldn't be abandoning ships, if you will, right now. But we do think that in terms of risk to the equity market, we'd still be leading a bit more defensive. As you pointed out, utilities and infrastructure, those have been areas that we've actually been, been really constructive on. They've been, we think on, on duly hits in recent days, those are getting more attractive. We stick around in energy as well. Those would be our top ideas right now. Here, you say the latest down move has not been a function of macro fundamentals. What are you seeing? Well, it's more of the fact that we're being uber tactical here to be fair. So, you know, the primary trend throughout 2022 has been at macro conditions for us equity markets have got worse. And that's largely a function of what we talked about just now, i.e. tighter financial conditions. And in particular, they're moving real yields and the move and credit spreads. What's interesting from a very short term perspective is that this latest down trade, and I'm talking in the last week now, our model value was actually flatlined. So that this very latest down move has been less justified by macro fundamentals than from much of the bear market price action of the last nine, 10 months. So if you are in a kind of repeat of the summer potential for a bear market squeeze, looking at positioning, looking at beaten up sentiment, I saw an interesting tweet today about inside of buying picking up tends to get people interested when, you know, CEOs are buying their own stocks. If you're thinking there's scope for a bit of a tactical squeeze within the context of the primary bear market, then what we're seeing at the moment actually is that S&P is around 6% cheap to our model value because macro conditions have kind of stabilized up at the lows. And this latest selloff has gone a little bit further. So still agree with the primary bearish dynamic that there's been a spouse, but there may be some hope for a little bit of a bear market squeeze. And Eric, there's some of the clients that you speak to. What lens are you suggesting that they really view this period through? Yeah, it's a great question. I think that, you know, for those that have capital that they need in the what's called the next three to six months, we think that like a great place to be is in very short duration of income. Well, for a long time, we just haven't been paid or shell to be involved in whatsoever in that part of the curve. Not to say that there isn't some potential price risk, but just as you hit on the earlier segment, if you're looking at corporate bonds and are spitting out 5, 5, 5, 6% yields, not a bad spot to be in very, very short maturities. I do think that for those clients that have the ability to kind of piece into stuff, we would not be aggressively involved in technology, we're just going to scratch right now. We do think that the supply, demand and balance is still skewed the wrong way for technology in the media term. But again, we do think that there's likely to be some rationalization towards the middle to the second half of next year for again, for longer term investors. So our viewpoint has been, look, take what you're given and this market, don't trade the market that you want to trade the market that you have. And so grabbing some yield up front makes sense. We do think that there's a time to again reconcile the second half of next year. We're just not there quite yet. And you, one of the challenges in this market now is a strong dollar. That of course is being felt on a global scale. We did get the earnings out from Pepsi this morning that were actually better than expected. And so we're wondering whether or not I guess how big of a threat that strong dollar would be to a name like Pepsi. What do you think today's results really tell us just about what we couldn't expect this earnings season? Well, from a macro perspective, I think the Pepsi earnings were bad news from the Fed's policymaking perspective, because it basically showed that they have pricing power and they're going to increase margins. And that's not good for the Fed who want to see demand slow down, obviously. More broadly, I agree totally that the strength of the dollar is going to be a key key issue for this.",https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2iE41vefT4k,87,2022-10-12 20:10:40
3178," on a Z demand slowdown, obviously. More broadly, I agree totally that the strength of the dollar is going to be a key key issue for this particular earnings season. On our analysis, we have the ability to break down patterns between, say, sectors and the strength of the dollar. And it's the independent pattern where we can out but we're able to strip out the isolated impact of the dollar on different assets. And what stands out on our analysis at the moment is that if you look at the likes of energy by the XLE, OIH, XOP, they're all comparatively indifferent to the dollar. It's not really a big driver of price action in the energy ETS at the moment. But it's technology that is most vulnerable. And that's true for XLK. It is true for something like consumer discretionary, where, of course, Amazon and Tesla are, I think, nearly 50% of that sector. And it's especially true for something like Sox, the semi-conduct, that ETF. So I think that's probably where, on our analysis, that's where potentially the most pain is going to be felt. Lots of great insights. They would do appreciate you both joining us, Eric Friedman and Hugh Roberts with your market insights. While investors watching tomorrow's inflation data closely and the data will have a big impact on millions of social security recipients, inflation from the third quarter is used to determine the cost of living adjustment or cola. Now, the adjustment for 2023 is likely to be 8.7% according to estimates from the senior citizens league. Now, that means the average monthly social security check would rise by $145. And that is the biggest jump since 1981. All right, well, coming up, the Amazon Labor Union faces its next test in upstate New York. We'll give you the latest when we come back.

3179," Apple is reportedly withholding its latest employee perks from a unionized store in Maryland. Apple, according to Bloomberg, has told retail and corporate employees that going to increase education and in some states' health benefits. However, employees at the one unionized Apple store in a Baltimore suburb will have to negotiate for those benefits via their collective bargaining arrangement. Now the news comes as employees at an Oklahoma City store are said to vote this week on joining a union. Apple shares closing down about half a percent in today's trade. Sure, no? Well, Apple rival Amazon, also dealing with unionization efforts starting today, workers at a warehouse near Albany, New York can vote in a pivotal union election. Yahoo, finance, senior tech reporter, Ali Garfinkle, joins us now with more. Hey, Ali. Hi, Shana, great to be here. So it's important to remember here this vote is pivotal. A victory for the Amazon labor union could be watershed. It could prove that they can really generate some momentum in more than one warehouse. And nurses are telling me that the ALU actually thinks they have a pretty decent shot here. The organizing has been organic and it's actually a relatively small number for the ALU. About 400 workers they're trying to organize, which is to be fair still a lot by NLRB standards. I'm looking for the Albany vote count to start on October 18th. Ali, big picture here. We hear a lot about the unionization effort across the country, but where are we overall? Overall Dave, I was talking to San Francisco State professor John Logan about this recently. And what he said is that in part this is actually a byproduct of the pandemic. You include down to the fact a lot of these unions were seeing, including the Amazon labor union, Trader Joe's union, that they're unconventional unions. The discontent that was kind of fermented by the pandemic has really facilitated and really helped unions gain momentum that they haven't necessarily had in decades. In the case of Amazon, we did see a petition for a vote in the inland empire near Los Angeles recently. And it's important to say though, nothing is all said and done. The odds are usually still in the employer's favor. And in the case of this vote that's coming in California potentially, the NLRB has not yet authorized that election. However, it's important to state that location here is important, particularly in the inland empire. I've talked to experts who've called it logistics central. So a vote there would really matter not only for warehouses, but for Amazon in particular. The company has actually invested more than 19 billion in the inland empire since about 2010. So, the messaging I'm getting out of Amazon as of today so far is that they are skeptical that that vote will come to fruition, but the either way, I'm looking for them to continue to fight. And overall, yeah, they have a lot of momentum, but would it be stopped cold in its tracks if we enter a recessionary environment? That. We shall wait and see. Ali Garfinkle, thanks so much. Appreciate that. Coming up, a Bank of America survey reveals significant differences between how millennials and older generations are investing. We'll break it down next. All right.",https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2iE41vefT4k,89,2022-10-12 20:19:15
3180," son The Well-being millennials are losing faith in the stock market as a way to build wealth. A recent Bank of America survey found that many are turning to alternative investments to find those returns. Here with more on that is Jeff Busconi, Bank of America Head of Private Bank Services. Jeff, welcome back to the show. So talk about the divergence in what we're seeing between some younger investors and older millennials. Sure, and thank you thanks for having me. It's great to be here with you again. Yes, so we did find in our survey some generational differences emerging. And in particular 75% of younger investors who were part of our survey indicated that they don't believe a traditional portfolio of stocks and bonds will generate above average returns over time and into the future. So that was really one of the major findings. We also found that younger investors were more inclined to have sustainable investment products in their portfolios and also wanting to have an impact through philanthropy with their wealth. Jeff, you mentioned the fact that this group of individuals is favoring alternative investment or really finding a reason to invest there. I guess what do you think is driving that lack of confidence when it comes to stocks and bonds? I think I would point to a couple of factors. First, you have to remember where we're coming from from a market standpoint. We've come through a fairly prolonged period of strong performance at the equity and bond markets. And of course, this year we've had considerably more volatility. So that may be causing some investors to think about investments outside of traditional investments. I also think the alternative investment universe continues to evolve. There's more and more access to alternative investments through platforms like ours here at Bank of America. And as access grows, interest may also be increasing. Remember this was historically the domain of institutions and endowments. The last thing I would point to is remember that this generation has really come of age during a period of extreme innovation. And so there may be a greater willingness here in this generation to embrace newer asset classes and different products. They're also coming of age at a time where crypto and NFTs have absolutely crashed in particular NFTs. Has that shied them forced in the shy away from some of those digital assets? You know, what we see around digital and this was picked up in the survey as well, there's a lot of innovation and development happening in that space. One will tell how it all plays out. If in our client base, our conversations are focused mostly on education.",https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2iE41vefT4k,90,2022-10-12 20:23:50
3181," in that space. Time will tell how it all plays out. Within our client base, our conversations are focused mostly on education. People want to learn more about the ecosystem. They want to understand what it is, how it works. And Jeff, I thought it was interesting as we had that crypto question in this study, looking at the discrepancy between those who thought they understood crypto well and whether they thought it would actually pay off as a longer term investment, break down some of that for us. Sure, again, I think what you're starting to see in the survey again is generational differences among investors. And as I just said, you know, the younger investors, college, 20 to 40, they've come of age in a period of just extreme innovation. So they may be willing to embrace newer asset classes, non-conventional forms of investment to a degree that maybe we haven't seen in prior generations. Again, I think time will tell when it comes to crypto. And certainly the current market environment is playing into the mindset here around crypto. Jeff, one thing that did stick out to me in this survey was that only half of wealthy parents considered their children well prepared to inherit their fortunes. The conversations that you've had with clients just the feeling out there, why do you think that is? Look, so I think you put your finger on one of the critical insights from the survey. We're all aware of the 84 trillion in wealth that's set to transfer here over the next two decades. And yet half just half of parents feel that their children are well prepared to inherit that wealth. For us, I think that speaks to a need, a continued need around a state planning, wealth in a state planning. Our advisors, our client teams need to really be having comprehensive holistic dialogues with families around a state planning. And it's not just the documents, the legal documents, its conversations around family dynamics, purpose, impact, all of the factors that go into having a really well thought out a state plan. And finally, we talk a lot about ESG investing in this space and it's been a hot topic across the country politically as well. Statistically, what is the survey showing about the drop-off between younger people and those over 43? So what the survey showed is about a quarter of all respondents have ESG and their portfolios. That 25% or so is driven heavily by this younger cohort of investors. Upwards of 70% of the younger investors have ESG and their portfolios. So there again, you see a divergence between the older generation of investors and the younger generation of investors. I think it's important to point out that there was a quarter of respondents had exposure and that's double the level that it was just four years ago in 2018. So this is an area that's growing rapidly and that's an area of focus particularly for younger investors who feel that this is just a smart way to invest. It's not a specific initiative or something separate. It's yet another way to have a positive impact on the world around them. It's growing rapidly as is the pushback to ESG investing as well, right? Thank you. Jeff was going to do good stuff. Appreciate that. Continuing the conversation about young investors now, Goldman Sachs taking a survey of its 2400 interns to get their perspective on the world today and some fascinating takeaways including how they invest, which unsurprisingly lines up with the wealthy Millennial survey, 28% invest in stocks, 15% of ETFs and 12% in cryptos. You might ask, why do we care what Goldman Sachs interns think? This is an extraordinary cross section of young America, Taipei, highly successful young people, 68 languages spoken among these 2400 interns. They're not your average run of the Mill interns as all I'm trying to point out here, but some interesting takeaways. What struck you? You know, what struck me was some of their priorities when looking for a job. You mentioned the fact that a lot of them are Taipei. Obviously, very, very driven group of individuals, 34% saying that they're putting a huge emphasis on what they do day to day, 21% say who their colleagues will be only 20%.",https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2iE41vefT4k,91,2022-10-12 20:27:38
3182," A very, very, very driven group of individuals, 34% saying that they're putting a huge emphasis on what they do day to day, 21% say who their colleagues will be. Only 12% though putting companies' purpose. And the reason I bring this up is because when we talk about Gen Z, when we talk about this generation, other results have shown this real focus on a company's purpose, how that is among the top priorities here for somebody who is seeking a job. So that not necessarily reflected in this survey, at least when you take a look at majority, also only 8% focusing on advancement. I thought that that would have been a little bit higher as well. And then also just plans to retire. And I like this because they're very optimistic, 35%, saying that they want to retire between the ages of 55 and 65. On the other hand, 29% nearly a third want to work as long as possible. I also want to redo this survey in 10 years. And on the find out, those 29% of people would still say that they want to work as long as possible. I think they will. Yeah, I don't know. Check in on that every decade. I think for every decade you work, that enthusiasm is probably going to tap for doubt. I thought it was interesting. Obviously, it's a very day to driven business that they're in. When it came to where they turned to find their truth when they came to getting information, 40% turned to friends and family, 35% turned to digital news outlets. So really this shift is where people are getting their information from. They consider clearly friends and family the more trusted source that they tend to go to. And then social media came in at about 14%. So I know, obviously, Twitter has this, it seems like this has this massive outreach but in terms of where people sort of get their final information from and the sources that they trust, I thought that was interesting. And I know we talk a lot about the return to work. And 99% of them said that they believe that relationships are best formed in person. Because there is something that gets lost if you don't get to have that. At least at least some sort of face-to-face interaction. So you really get a sense of people. A lot can get lost in translation over text or video chat. I was happy to hear that. You mentioned Twitter. TikTok was a surprise. Only 1% of these interns post on that. They all said really overwhelmingly Instagram is their platform, both posting and following. How do they pay for stuff? 47% use an app. Only 2% cash. A lot of fascinating takeaways. They prefer shopping in person over all of the time. I was surprising to me. I would have thought the online app would have been much much. Yeah, 2% cash is not king for the kids. Maybe in the markets right now. Not for the young people. App on their phone. You know, I'm slowly using Apple Pay more and more. When she start, it is life changing. I'll say that. All right, well, come here. Next, Microsoft revealing a slew of new products today. We'll tell you all about them next.",https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2iE41vefT4k,92,2022-10-12 20:32:30
3183,"e Apple and Google are among the major names in tech unveiling their newest products in recent weeks, and now it's Microsoft's turn. The company unveiled a slew of new Surface products earlier today. You said, Medi, Microsoft corporate vice president joins us, along with Yahoo Finance tech editor Dan Howley to break it all down. So thank you for joining us. I want to first get your instincts here. We have a very crowded market. What were the standout products for Microsoft so far? Today there's really a couple of big things. One is the next major update to Windows 11, which really makes a lot of improvements in accessibility, insecurity, and productivity for people as well as better gaming. And then a number of updates with our new devices on our Surface line. So we have a new Surface laptop 5 and a Surface Pro 9, both of which are 50% faster than the predecessors. They're amazing for hybrid work and learning. And the Pro 9 has new capabilities that let you take advantage of the cloud and AI to do some incredible creativity that you haven't been able to do before. You said this is Dan. I just want to get a sense of who you think the customers are for these types of devices, really. You have the hybrid Pro 9, you have the laptop, you have the studio, and you have some adaptive technology there. Who's really the audience here? Yeah, good question, Dan. It's a pretty broad audience. So if we start with the two most mainstream products we have. We have the Surface Pro 9, which is our 2-in-1. It's our tablet that can replace a laptop. It's designed for the mobile professional that likes to move around or the person who's running from the house, running the home and moving around. It's a laptop and a keyboard. It's a great device. We also have then the laptop 5, which is essentially similar class, but more of a laptop form factor. Again, great for businesses, business professionals, but also great for students and great for people in the home. Those are our mainstream devices. They start at $9.99 and they go up from there. Then we have a very high end, probably our best creativity device. It's the Surface Studio 2 Plus. It's designed for creators, professionals, programmers, designers, graphic designers in enterprise. That's a more expensive device, obviously, but it is the absolute best creation device. Finally, as you mentioned, we do some number of great accessories for people with disabilities. One in five people in the US deal with some form of disability and these devices let you use your Surface devices in a much easier form. I guess where are you seeing most people use their computers now? We're in the hybrid work world at this point. It seems like it's staying that way. Where are they really sticking to? That games chat, what is it? Sorry, what was the last part you said, Dan? It games chat or work. How are they using this? They're using it for quite a variety of things. For people at work, they're using their laptops for obviously remote work. They're doing video conference calling. We've seen 300 million more apps use like Discord, Slack, Teams, ReChadternet is now used in a very less way from home. Also, of course, for a creation with Microsoft 365 and productivity devices. Then a lot of gaming. A lot of gaming gets done on it. Gaming's still at an all time high.",https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2iE41vefT4k,93,2022-10-12 20:36:35
3184," Also, of course, for a creation with Microsoft 365 and productivity devices. And then a lot of gaming, a lot of gaming gets done on it. Gaming's still at an all time high. So we see a lot of that in home use. We see people doing things like telehealth. They're doing online shopping from home. They're doing communications and connecting with family and friends. So they're doing a variety of tasks. As a whole, what we've seen over the last two years, use of Windows PCs and Windows 11 is up significantly. It's up 10% total minutes per device. We see 20% more people using Windows PCs in the past. And that's because the relevancy of the PC in our lives has probably never been greater. And use of the, we are seeing a slow down overall than what we're seeing with PC demand. How is Microsoft navigating this space? And what does the next generation of the PC look like? Yeah, it's a great question. You're right. We're in a tough macro environment. So it's very hard these days, whether it's interest rates up or the war in Europe and the like, a big part of what's good about the PC is it is really the best value for your money if you're buying an electronics device. And a big part of that is, as I was just talking about, usage is up, that's the proof in there. Where we see things going is we see continued new use cases opening up on the PC. Like I mentioned, they're being used now in a way that they weren't before for video conferencing because of the remote work. We're seeing, like I said, online shopping quite a bit. I saw recently that you were just talking a little bit about how new generation likes to shop in person, but broadly people want to shop at home. And we've seen a huge amount of that. We offer a coupon feature in Edge now. We've saved over $1.4 billion for people with coupons. The average person can save $100 when shopping online using Microsoft Edge browser. So I think we're going to see some of these new use cases open up for shopping, for health, for gaming, for creation. And I think that will continue. All right, well, a big thank you for joining us this afternoon, you, Seth Medi, and our very own Dan Howley. Thank you both. All right, coming up, Major League Baseball hopes it's deal with CBD maker Charlotte's Web becomes a home run. Charlotte's Web CEO tells us how the deal came together next. I'll speak about unlocked events this evening at the UK experience it's all set, one of the biggest benefits is the low common chain data. We ended two game games with Zная.",https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2iE41vefT4k,95,2022-10-12 20:44:15
3185," To do this, can we grind the butter and sugar into egg whites? Let's slow heat it up. Then webpage Take me out to the cannabis game Major League Baseball, the first of the four major US sports leagues to sign a sponsorship deal with the CBD company. Technically a cannabis compound, Charlottes Web today becomes MLB's official CBD company. Jack Torturellis is the CEO of Charlottes Web and joins us now good to see you. Want to talk about how this deal came together and what it means for the industry. If you could just dispel a little bit of the misconception out there about what exactly is CBD and what's its application for athletes? Yeah, so sure great thanks for having me on you know simply put MLB and CW Charlottes Web are changing the future of wellness for athletes and fans together. You know MLB's decision reflects what players and fans really want today by bringing botanical wellness options to support the everyday lives of athletes and fans particularly around mental wellness. You know things in each states like staying calm under pressure recovery after exercise, maintaining the focus when it counts and sleeping like a champ. You know these are players that are on the road 162 games in a season seven months a year and we really believe that they have, they believe quite strongly that having the mental balance, the balance between the mental health and the physical health is super important and that's why they chose to open up the category and do it with Charlottes Web which is you know the industry founder of CBD and the leading company in CBD and purely because we have and we're uniquely qualified to be able to do this with the science and the credibility we have including the NSF certification that we got for our sports line and NSF as you know is the goal standard for sort of quality in CBD and botanicals. The sponsorship deal it's clearly huge for your company it's huge for your industry what do you think this does just in terms of the conversation that will likely have around CBD and the adoption that we could see as a result of it? Yeah I think it's a game changer for us and particularly given you know 180 million fans all of their social platforms that we now have access to is a microphone and the microphone is going to be really used for education telling telling consumers telling athletes telling trainers you know what CBD is and what it isn't it's not marijuana it's hemp and I think that's an important part of what they want to get across and we want to get across and we think it's huge for the industry and most importantly huge for Charlottes Web which again you know is uniquely qualified from the science and credentials point of view to be able to have this partnership come to life and I also want to point out that Charlottes Web has five of seven hemp patents and again the credentials are unquestionable which is why NSF certified our products to support. Doc mentioned it's the first of the four major US sports to have a CBD deal. How much resistance was there to a sponsorship deal like this and do you think the other leagues will follow? I don't think there was a resistance at all I think and the MLB was really a first mover a thought leader in this space very aligned in terms of wellness for players botanical wellness and again helping the mind not just the body and so you know the deal came together with two like-minded organizations wanting to do you know wellness solution for their players and it was just a great process and a real partnership it's not what I would call a traditional you know sort of sponsorship deal but it truly is a partner a partnership and as you may know that there are MLB is now a shareholder in Charlottes Web as a result of this this strategic partnership. You know that's interesting there why would you say it's not typically why you wouldn't describe it as a traditional sponsorship type deal. Yeah because it's not a it's not a pay to play right I mean the two parties now with MLB",https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2iE41vefT4k,96,2022-10-12 20:47:15
3186," Typically, why you wouldn't describe it as a traditional sponsorship type deal? Yeah, because it's not a it's not a pay to play, right? I mean, the two parties now with MLB being a shareholder in Charlotte's web, our interests are aligned to grow value through wellness and through our products that offer those solutions for need states, the consumers and players and their fans, ultimately have. So both parties are aligned in a mission of wellness. Both parties are aligned in terms of quality and safety for athletes, first and foremost. And it was really coming together with two like-minded organizations. I wanted to see this coming live. So what's the plan, Jacques, to pursue teams, specific players? And beyond that, the other leagues, the NBA, the NHL and the NFL? Yeah, look, I think all the leagues will ultimately get there. And again, congratulations to Major League Baseball for being at the forefront and being the first mover. I think right now, look, it's day one of our partnership and what we're really focused on is amazingly sort of execution excellence to show the value that our products bring to fans and consumers, to show we can do for players. And ultimately, that's what we're focused on right now. In terms of influences and teams, I strongly believe that influences use of products and are real advocates that they're authentic and not just paid spokesperson. And so if we do anything like that, it'll be with someone who's credible, authentic, and uses of products. Do you know specific players that use the products? I really don't want to talk about that, but I do know, you know, I do know players that have, yeah, and that have been public about it. I wanted to give you a minute to just tell people that don't know the story of Charlotte's Web. It's not about the nursery rhyme. This is Charlotte as one of the more influential people in this industry in terms of how changed medical marijuana laws some feel across the country if you could give us a bit of that backstory. Yeah, no, it's great. You know, Charlotte Figgie was, you know, the first sort of person that came into contact with the brands and the brothers. The company was founded by the seven Stanley brothers. All still shareholders, all still engaged in the company when direction or another. And it was about having a little girl who had 300 seizures, you know, a week and finding a hemp based solution for her. Our original formula, which is still the same formula we have today, you know, some 10 years later, really gave her her life back and her family's life back. And so, you know, at one point, there was a 15,000 patient waiting list for our products and the brothers gave product away because they believe so strongly in helping, you know, from a wellness point of view and providing quality of life for people with our products. And on the back of that story, we created an industry. You know, this is, this was the first company in CBD. It's the market leader in CBD. It's the only company that has seed to shelf sort of quality standards and vertical integration. And so we're very proud of the origins. We're very proud of the family and we're delighted to be able to bring this moment to them and our shareholder is more, more, more generally. Congrats, Nadeel. Interesting to see where it heads from here. CEO of Charlotte's Web, Jacques Tortoroli. Thanks so much. Appreciate that. All right, over to Sean. And now we look at what's moving after hours. All right, Dave, let's take a look at some of these trending ticketers. We have applied materials, a duck creek, a victorious secret. We also have digital world acquisition core of news breaking here just a second. And go, let's kick it off with applied materials. The stock moving to the downside here off just about 1.5% news from the company saying that they are cutting their fourth quarter adjusted EPS forecast, missing the streets estimate. A lot of this has to do with the new export regulations that we got from the Abbot in administration last week. Take a look at that five day chart. You can see the drop shortly after those regulations were announced the stock off nearly 15% in the past five days. It's been a tough go at it for the stock since the start of the year, year to date, off just about 51%. Let's take a look at duck creek here, the soft wear play moving to the upside up just around 6.5% here. The company raising its 2023 revenue guidance that beat the streets estimates now expecting 320 million to 336 million. The estimate out there was for 325 million for the fourth quarter results beating on both the top and bottom lines here, the fourth quarter adjusted EPS.",https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2iE41vefT4k,96,2022-10-12 20:49:57
3187," $336 million. The estimate out there was for $325 million for the fourth quarter results, beating on both the top and bottom lines here. A fourth quarter adjusted EPS coming in at $3 cents. Revenue at $80.7 million. The estimate out there was for $73.2 million. Let's take a look at Victoria Seeger. Remember this company is starting to trade as a standalone company just over a year ago. You can see the stock moving to the upside here. Up just around 4% the move higher coming ahead of its investor day tomorrow. Now the company releasing its strategic growth plan ahead of that investor day. They will focus on three areas. Strength in core, ignite growth, transform the foundation. A lot of it has to do with growth adding brands, especially what they're seeing on an international level. They also updated their guidance here. They see third quarter operating income to come in at the top end of the range here today. Though you can see it's been a rough go for Victoria Seeger. It's been around 41%. I also want to take a look at digital world acquisition here, especially in after hours and move to the upside. You can see it up just around 8.7% news here that Google is adding true social to its play store. Now the news here coming to Google saying that it is approved a true social for distribution on its play store. The Google spokesperson telling Bloomberg that true social can distribute the app on Google Play as long as it complies with its developer guidelines. So again, the stock moving to the upside here after hours up nearly 8% of course, so you're to date still well in the red off just around 68%. Michelle. All right, thanks, Sean. Well, my stock to watch for tomorrow is Delta. We've been talking about airlines today. The airline reporting earnings ahead of the open and results are expected to show profits and revenue rising from a year ago. The estimates earning for share of $1.55 on revenue of $12.89 billion. Now the stock has had a rough year so far underperforming the SFP 500 the last three months you saw they down to 6%. But there is some optimism on the sector as people return to traveling post pandemic, especially with the strong dollar. So certainly one to watch for tomorrow morning. All right, coming up Netflix has its site set on the Jersey Shore. We'll tell you why and what the streaming diet hopes to accomplish after the break. Thanks.",https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2iE41vefT4k,97,2022-10-12 20:54:30
3188," 2 exhale You know, I'm gonna get a little bit of a little bit of the same thing. Just my back last year from victims families, Dahmer, monster is Netflix's second most watch series. Yahoo, finances, Alexandra cannell is here with the details. All we talked about the fact that it was a hit right off the bat. I haven't watched it yet, but people love it. People love it. I haven't watched it yet either. I am. I'm happy to watch it. I've heard it's an emotional roller coaster, but America has a massive amount of money. I've seen it in a mass more than 701 million hours viewed, making it the second biggest series to date for Netflix behind stranger things. So it actually de-throwned Bridgerton. And you know when you're dethroning Bridgerton that you have a massive, massive hit on your hands. For a little context behind that number, stranger things season four racked up 1.35 billion hours viewed in the first month. So the fact that Dahmer even came close is a big deal. So I think it's really a big deal. So I think we're doing really well. Great thing for Netflix, but also a great thing for Ryan Murphy. This is his third year into his five year contract with Netflix. He signed a $300 million deal back in 2018. And this is really the first series from him to really drum up that big response that Netflix wanted. So people have been a little critical saying whether or not Dahmer is really worth that $300 million price tag. And it's not going to be giving out $300 million contract. And Shonda got one too. She got one too. And that was huge to follow up. That was the heyday of Netflix when they didn't care. They were just giving out money left and right. That's not going to happen in car. But true crime. Obviously it's a win every time. And obviously a lot's changed since those 300 million dollar deals, including a considerable subscriber fall off this year for Netflix. But the streaming giant has ended running to build a massive production company. And I think it's going to be a little bit more about that. Yes, you said it 300 acres Jersey Shore about 50 miles from New York City, New Jersey governor. Phil Murphy is all about this. He's been dying to bring some more Hollywood productions. Two New Jersey. There's a lot of artists. There's a lot of creatives there, especially with the close proximity to New York. And if this deal does go through, it'll be the second largest studio for the company after New Mexico. So we could be able to do that. So I'm really happy to be able to do that. So I fully approve this move by Netflix. But we'll see what happens once this deal officially goes through. They were in talks last year. So despite the profitability struggles, despite the fact that they've been losing subscribers, they still seem to be full steam ahead on this. So that just indicates to me that they want to produce more content and better content. And all they can do out trying to track those new subscribers. All right, it's been a scary year for snap. Shots shares down more than 75% this year. But snap rolling out a new activation during this spooky season. You can now virtually try on and buy Halloween costumes directly on the Appia partnership with costume design and manufacturing company disguise. We decided to give it a try and sticking with the streaming theme there from Ali Netflix and Disney and Disney. I thought I'd go with the cobra Kai since that season five debut has been so successful. And Shana, Shana, what'd you go with? I did. Hocus Pocus. Sticking with the streaming theme here Disney plus. What is it's posture? Is your thing? No. Swap game. You guys can tell how much I've watched either of those and there's there's Jared Blyckery in the Ghost Busters. Unfortunately, who's at female Ghost Busters? I'll be right back. I think this is a really cool tool, especially being able to buy them right there on the app. I mean, I love it. I love how easy they're",https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2iE41vefT4k,98,2022-10-12 20:59:30
3189," I think this is a really cool tool, especially being able to buy them right there on the app. I mean, I love it. I love how easy they're making it for people because you know, there's always that rush. The closer you get to Halloween and it was like fighting for this and that. If you could just sit down and do it. Now the fit though might be an issue. I don't know because I feel like some of these Halloween costumes are quite small. So if you can look as good as you do with the pictures, I'm more for it. But I think I want to try it on in person. Just in case, although Jared is really selling me on this on this Ghostbusters outfit. I think you look very so serious. I think that's all done by me. I think it's interesting. Look, Snap has had a rough go obviously. It's the ad market and social has been difficult. But activations like this are smart. They have a really interesting activation with SoFi, Stadium where the Rams play football, the NFL's Rams where they use a filter, a snap filter on the jumbo charts, although show a fan and make them look all silly and crazy. I don't know what the investor story is per say. But it's nice to see some new activations. Well, and they're also not the only ones who are doing this too, right? We talked about Amazon. You're able to virtually try on shoes. They launched that earlier this summer. Pinterest and Google has also been starting to leverage AR to try and really separate themselves from some of the competition out there. And Lauren, some of those more customers. So I think it's a smart move from Snapchat. They need though. My one criticism, they need some more costumes though in terms of options. So we're going to have a lot of options at least just yet. But I might be co-brokai, Rachelle. I might be going there. Yeah, you're right. Trigney. It suits you. It suits you. I'm not going to lie. It did seem like your thing. And you had the serious face and the growth of the sleeves and everything. John's show, baby. I couldn't show. And you look lovely. And you look lovely, sort of. Well, that'll do. We'll have to leave it there. We'll have to see what we'll wear on Halloween. But that'll do it for today's edition of Yaya's Fine Arts Life. To the store at 3PM Eastern, we'll see you then. Bye.

Earlier in the case, Jones had been found liable for defamation. He is infamous, of course, for touting conspiracy theories and with sued by the families and that agent after repeatedly and falsely claiming the school showed shooting was a hoax with plaintiffs saying they were harassed by Jones' followers.

The Sequoans the Wall Street Journal, that service would reportedly be integrated inside of Tiktok. Bitesense actually already has a music streaming service called Rezzo, but it's limited to countries like India and Indonesia. Rezzo's poor revenue streams are reportedly a sticking point with record labels, right? All right, everyone. Well, let's keep tracking the markets here this morning, the Dow Jones Industrial Average, the S&P 500 and the NASDAQ composite, all deeply in the red here, this after a hotter than expected is just seeing CPI print. And we've seen this decline initiated exactly in time with when that CPI report dropped from more on today's activity. Let's get on over to Jared Blyckery at the Wi-Fi Interactive. Jared, what are you seeing in the tape this far? Ouch. That's what I'm saying today. Let's take a look at the NASDAQ. That's down the most here, over 2 and a quarter percent. Over the last four days, so this week it's down another 4%. Let's check out the last seven days because we had some down drafts last week down another 9%. When we look inside the market, only energy has been in the green crude oil, actually under a little bit of water here. And we'll talk about that in a second, but consumer discretionary, just taking it on the chin and down another 2.75% followed by tech and then real estate. Let's take a look inside the NASDAQ here. We got Amazon down 4.5%. I believe it's just about to test its lows of the years. Here's the year-to-date chart. You can see, indeed, here we go trying to see if we can bounce from there, but too early to see if that's going to happen just yet. Tesla hitting another one year low. It has now taken out these May, June, July, rounded bottom lows here, so that is down 40% this week. And if you want to know the culprit, you got to take a look at the US dollar. I'm going to show you one of our screens here. This is our heat map of the US dollar versus everything else. The pound, a very interesting scene that's going on there, also the Japanese yen. By the way, the pound, the Bank of England, maybe scrapping those tax cuts in favor of, guess what, tax heights in a month, but that US dollar very much weighing on equity markets here also want to get a quick check of crude oil as a lot of criticism heaped on OPEC plus, including the international energy agency itself, haven't seen that in a while. So what's going on here? Crude oil down 4.10% of a percent, guys. Jarra Blickery, thanks so much.

The longtime activist semester is now urging the company to make changes to its board, including replacing the chairman or face another proxy fight. Coles shares are down by nearly 50% so far this year. This is where we find Sazie's. I got to say I thought the activists had already done this. Like they've leveled so much at the company I just figured that this was already part of it. This is, right. This is McHellam and Jonathan Duskett and he's been on many times with us talking about his views on Coles. Well, guess what? He's still over 5% holder in Coles and he's tired of this crap.

He's been on this board for 14 years and I think Jonathan really put a lot of cut up him briefly this morning. He put a lot of thought, I think, to crafting this letter. He wants to work with Coles, except that Coles is bored. Notably, Bonepartth has not want to work with him and really drive any change. This has been an absolute disastrous year for this company. I would argue disastrous three years under CEO, Michelle Gast, terrible job. This year, you came out of the second quarter with a major inventory bulge. Oh, guess what? Keep in mind a couple of months ago, they had a really what appeared to be a solid offer to take Coles' private at $53 a share. Look where this stock is trading out right now. It's $26. That is massive value destruction. What Duskett is calling here, he's tired of Peter Bonepartth. He's tired of some other board members that what he calls a shadow board that is preventing the company from making any operational changes. He wants some of these long-tangled Coles people off this board so some positive fundamental changes can happen. He's not calling for the company to be sole per say. He just wants to see it better run so the stock price could go up because the results improve. It really is that simple and worth noting too. It is interesting. I remember very briefly covering Jones' a power group when Bonepartth was CEO many years ago. He didn't want to sell the company back then and that's why in many respects he was ousted and it looks like he's running the same plane book at Coles. But again, this is situation not going anywhere and frankly guys it's one that continues to baffle me. How this board can continue to be overbordered with cushy paychecks at the same time they're not delivering. Same goes for the management team. It's really, really strange. Coles shares down 47% a year to date. We're continue to track those shares of Kate, S.S. We're coming up on the other side of this short break. Our founder and CEO Kathy Wood. And if you're on this for an exclusive interview you do not want to miss this.",https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6_2e_wGpQzc,2,2022-10-13 14:01:21
3194," An exclusive interview you do not want to miss this. It is Thursday, October 13th here in New York City on Brad Smith with Julie Hyman and Brian Stasi and Ugly Day on Wall Street after another red hot inflation report. CPI month over month coming in at 4 tens of a percent in a move higher. The economic data keeps on coming. Jewels over to you for some housing news as well right now. 6.92 percent Brad that is now the average 30 year fixed rate mortgage. That data just coming out to us from Freddie Mac. 6.92 percent by the way is the highest going back to April of 2002. All of this of course goes back to the Fed raising interest rates and also has already had ripple effects throughout the housing market putting pressure on pricing, putting pressure on demand and affordability. We've been watching these mortgage numbers very, very closely because obviously they have really ratcheted up the monthly cost for people who are taking out a 30 year mortgage in order to buy a house. So we've got that number, we've got that CPI number all of it pointing to continued inflation at least for now. But now we're joined by someone who has her eyes on potential deflation. That of course is Kathy Wood, our Founder and CEO and you recently wrote an open letter to the Fed where you warned about deflation. We talked to Michael Darda of MKM at the top of the show where he said the Fed is making the mistake of looking at backward looking indicators. What should the Fed be looking at Kathy when it's trying to really assess what is happening with inflation? Sure. Hi Julie. Hi.",https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6_2e_wGpQzc,3,2022-10-13 14:05:29
3195," What should the Fed be looking at, Kathy, when it's trying to really assess what is happening with inflation? Sure, hi, Julie, and Brian. Well, if you look at what's happening in the pipeline, what you're seeing in terms of commodity prices are some very serious declines both from their peaks and year over year now. So that is sort of, we would say that's upstream inflation that is heading towards the PPI and then ultimately the CPI. So we've got gold prices, and in fact, I looked at them yesterday. I had thought that the last two years gold had been trading within a 1700 to nearly $2,100 range, and that's true it has, and it has broken down. This is a really good leading indicator of inflation. What caught my surprise yesterday was looking at where gold was in 2011, it was roughly this level. So you can say since 2011, more than 10 years, we haven't had a big burst in a big breakout in the gold price. And that is informing our decision here. Gold is a leading indicator of inflation, and it has not broken out, it is breaking down. And then the second thing that we're looking at is the inventory glutt around the world, and especially in the United States, it looks like some of the best supply chain managed companies in the world have overordered, they ignored their automated enterprise resource planning system so ERP systems and double ordered triple ordered so that Nike, for example, its sales were up only three and a half percent globally last quarter, and yet its inventory was up 44%, and in the United States, they were up 68%, and if you look at it in transit, they're up 85%. So that's just one indication we're seeing lots of inventory overhangs, and even online sales are suffering. Amazon just had its second prime day, and it showed no increase, which is really from a year over year, which is telling us that either units are down or prices are down. So I think the CPI that we got today is a lagging indicator. It always is a lagging indicator, and we're seeing a lot of prices in the pipeline that are falling. So, Kathy, let's talk about what this means for the Fed, and your open letter to the Fed, where you urge them to consider some of what you're talking about right now. The market after today's data is now more fully pricing, and not just a 75 basis point increase at this upcoming meeting, but at the one after that as well. Do you think the Fed should be done? Do you think they should even raise 75 basis points at this upcoming meeting, or do you think they should stop here and give some time for their increases to make their way through the economy? Yes, as we're thinking about this question, we compare what Chairman Powell is doing to what Chairman Volker did in the late 70s, early 80s, when he was fighting an inflation problem that had been building for 15 years, Vietnam War, great society closing the gold window. That was a real inflation problem that built up over 15 years. This inflation problem has been 12 to 15 months by the time the Fed started addressing it, and we think it's much more a function of supply chain imbalances caused by COVID, and then again, by Russia's invasion of Ukraine. These are very, very different circumstances. So what the Fed has done this time around is it has increased interest rates. If they go another 75 basis points, which is very likely on November 2nd, they will have increased interest rates from 0.25 to 4%. And that's a 16 fold increase. What did Volker, in the early 80s, he took interest rates from 10 to 20%. That's a two fold increase after consumers and businesses had gotten used to...",https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6_2e_wGpQzc,4,2022-10-13 14:09:33
3196," interest rates from 10 to 20%. That's a twofold increase after consumers and businesses had gotten used to dealing with inflation and working around it over 15 years. This is a real shock to the system. And I do believe we will see the ramifications. In many ways, we're seeing housing shutting down. And I think we're gonna see a lot of other activities shutting down as well. We believe we're in a recession and we believe this recession now will be sustained. And if we see an increase in GDP, it's probably because either inventories are continuing to increase or imports are coming down as companies try to unwind their inventories. Kathy, so do you see a severe recession? And then how long do you think this bear market will continue? Well, what's interesting, I think many people are coming around to the idea that we're in a recession or we're going into a recession. The first two quarters with real GDP growth negative to us means we're in a recession. And now that many people are worried and are beginning to see recession for us far as the eye can see, we are looking at this recession a little bit differently. We think it's going to be a function of this massive inventory overhang and that it's going to be a serious inventory correction, but it's not going to be anything like we saw in 0809. That was a systemic financial problem caused by the mortgage and financial meltdown. We don't think this is the same thing. So now that many economists are starting to agree with us that we're in a recession or going into a recession, we feel that they might become a little bit too alarmist. If this is just an inventory recession and I think the Fed will have a lot to do with whether or not it is. This is a shock though to the system and this idea that we have an inventory overhang, we think it's going to get bigger as consumers pull back low saving rates, 3.5% versus 8% where it was before COVID. And so we'll see. We think this holiday season is going to be pretty tough. And so as you kind of read it, you're shopping list for that holiday season, Kathy, and you think about some of the ways that equity valuations are starting to price in that recession to the best of their ability. Is there a big buy that you now kind of think through or evaluate going into the end of the year here? Well, you have to consider the source here and our focus, our sole focus, is on disruptive innovation. And we also believe that innovation solves problems. We had a tough time going into COVID with our kind of strategy and then we had a boom in our strategy during COVID because guess what? We needed the genomic revolution to help sequence the coronavirus and figure out tests and vaccines and our kinds of companies helped with that. We think with supply chain issues and with the food and energy prices caused by this shock, this rushes invasion of Ukraine, that once again, innovation is going to help solve these problems. Electric vehicles, there's an accelerated consumer preference shift towards electric vehicles like Tesla because of oil prices. And we think there's no stopping that trend now. And in terms of food prices, we do believe that gene editing is going to help us figure out how to produce crops in areas that are less fertile than the Ukraine, the bread basket of Europe, with less water, less fertilizer, less pesticide. So we're going to continue to see the miracles associated with the genomic revolution. But our other strategies as well, whether we're talking about robotics, solving the labor shortage, energy storage, I mentioned electric vehicles pulling us away from oil consumption, artificial intelligence, which is going to help every company become...",https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6_2e_wGpQzc,5,2022-10-13 14:13:56
3197," energy storage, I mentioned electric vehicles pulling us away from oil consumption, artificial intelligence, which is going to help every company become more competitive if they use their data and combine it with other data in effective ways. And then blockchain technologies, which is going to take the middle men out of a lot of businesses and take the cost out of a lot of businesses, helping us to solve this inflation problem. So again, consider the source. We think innovation solves problems. It certainly gave us an appreciation of that during COVID. Our strategy was high flying. And we think we have even more problems right now. So stay tuned. Kathy, this economic shock that you talk about in large part at the hands of the Fed, does that cause a shock to one of your long term holdings in Tesla in terms of the stock price and also the company's financials? Well, certainly all stocks are experiencing difficulty in this environment as the market tries to understand how far the Fed is going to go and how deep this recession is going to be. So Tesla, as I mentioned, is a solution to the problem. It's very interesting. If you look at gasoline demand this summer in the United States, it dropped below COVID levels, the worst of COVID, and it dropped to levels that we have not seen since 1997. That's real demand destruction. And it couldn't have happened. We do not believe without electric vehicles at the margin, taking huge share from traditional automobiles. So if we had to be concerned about an industry, it would be the traditional auto industry. We think that gas powered vehicles are going to be obsolete within the next five to ten years. And the traditional auto industry has to figure out a way to migrate into electric vehicles and into the next big phase, which we think Tesla is leading, the autonomous taxi platform phase. So lots of changes here. Traditional industries are in harm's way as innovation pushes through accelerated by some of the turmoil out there. Kathy, when we last talked back in the spring, I believe it was just at the beginning of the Elon Musk Twitter saga. Now we are maybe, maybe getting to a little bit of closure in that case. But I would post you the same question that I asked you then, because a lot of time is elapsed in different events have happened. Are you at all concerned about Musk's attention wavering now that it looks like he is in fact going to be taking over and likely at least having a pretty heavy hand in running Twitter? Well, we are prolific users of Twitter. Our gives away its research. We give away our research not when it's finished, but as it's evolving. And our most prolific platform, social platform out there is Twitter. I'm kind of excited to see what Elon will do. I actually think he'll work closely with Jack Dorsey and maybe open up the ecosystem, take away the censorship, make it much more transparent. And I think add more value to that ecosystem. You don't think that it'll be a mess if that happens. It'll just be sort of a free for all where it's tougher to find commentary of value. You know what's interesting about Twitter and we found this. We have a lot of debate around our own strategies. We can filter that debate ourselves. So we can unfollow people if we think there's bad behavior, but that's our choice. And we can follow those people who we think are moving discussions, whether it's about innovation or the economy, moving discussions along. So I think there's a lot of wisdom out there. And we're kind of sick of the nonsense that we see on some of these social platforms. And Twitter, I think, is going to give us more tools.",https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6_2e_wGpQzc,6,2022-10-13 14:18:09
3198," And we're kind of sick of the nonsense that we see on some of these social platforms. And Twitter, I think, is going to give us more tools to filter out the nonsense and get right down to business. I certainly would like to filter out a lot of the nonsense sometimes on their caddy. I want to ask you more broadly about our guests and your funds. I was looking at art K in particular and the fun flows that we have seen, which were seeing sort of bigger swings to the up end of the downside earlier in the year. They've gotten a little more muted as of late. You talk a lot about your three to five year time horizon, which I think makes sense, but I wonder how long how patient investors are going to be particularly in an environment where they are seeing losses, not just in our K, but in lots of other areas as well. Yes. And I think one thing that helps our clients is our research. And they see that it's first principles research. We have the long term time horizon. And we're seeing spectacular exponential growth opportunities. And not only one by one, the various platforms I just described, but the convergence of those platforms. So one ask her of feeding another. And I think many of our clients understand that they're short innovation, truly disruptive innovation. If you own the NASDAQ or the NASDAQ 100 right now, and you look through that index, this is not the index that I grew up with in the 80s and 90s when we were looking for innovation. We'd go to the NASDAQ. But if you look through the NASDAQ now, and especially the NASDAQ 100, what you see are 25% of the names touching disruptive innovation. The rest of them are kind of me too. They look like other indexes, the fangs, Microsoft, Nvidia, Tesla would be our only overlap. And then you look further and more deeply into these indices. And you see names that you'd never expect to be there. Food and beverage, utilities, rails, brick and mortar retail. These are not innovation companies. So what we've done at ARC is we are pure play innovation. And we'd like to think we are what the NASDAQ used to be in the 80s and 90s. And it used to be a very productive place to invest with a long-term investment time rise. And so I think our sharing our research and our pointing out to investors, look, what you think you own in innovation is not what it used to be. And what ARC is doing is really back to the future. We're all about investing in the future as opposed to indexes, which are more about past success. Those companies that have been extremely successful have risen to the top of these indexes. But if we're right, in these five platforms that involve 14 different technologies are going to disrupt the traditional world order, then investors need to get to the right side of change. And one of the other things that we do, that's one of our missions and values, is to educate. That's why we give our research away. And we want to educate not only investors, but parents and grandparents about how the world is changing, how radically it's changing, and how it's ever more important to get, especially students on the right side of change, so that they can enjoy these incredible growth opportunities and not be disrupted by industries that will be sunsetting, shall I say? Kathy, a three to five year time horizon means not only kind of midterm or recession proofing your companies, you're not just recession proofing your portfolio, you're also kind of midterm proofing your portfolio, you're a general election proofing your portfolio. And so, you know, Eric, how do you go about identifying disruptive innovation that then doesn't get disrupted by public policy or political agenda? Well, one, we have a six metric scoring system, very much focused on innovation. One of the scores is thesis risk. thesis risk has a lot to do with government policy.",https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6_2e_wGpQzc,7,2022-10-13 14:22:30
3199," very much focused on innovation. One of the scores is thesis risk. Thesis risk has a lot to do with government policy. And so in the early days of ARC in 2014-15, we were thinking, okay, government may be very concerned about the safety of autonomous vehicles. But as we've moved through these last eight years, what we've seen, thankfully, is the government and regulators in particular, very focused on data. And what does the data say? The data says that most fatalities and accidents, 85, almost 90% of them are caused by a human error. If we take the human being out of the equation, then we're going to save up to 35, 40,000 lives in the United States, the fatalities per year, and up to 1.25 million around the world. So that is a noble goal. And we've been very gratified to see the regulators looking at the fatalities in Tesla's vehicles and informing us that for the most part, most of those fatalities were caused by human error. And for the second, that people who are driving Tesla vehicles are much safer thanks to the various automated driving capabilities now. Up to 40% safer than in most other cars. So we're very focused on what governments are studying in terms of the data. And if they stick to the data innovation typically, it solves problems and makes the world a better place. Really, always a treat to get some time with you. Kathy Wood, ARC, Invest Founder and CEO, always nice to see you. We'll talk to you soon. Appreciate the time. Brian, Julie as well. Thank you. Thank you. All right, let's stand in the economy here. Inflation is still running hot as we saw in today's consumer price index. That comes as economic growth continues to be sluggish and recession calls pick up on Wall Street. Let's dive into the economic outlook with Jar Bernstein, who is a member of the White House Council of Economic Advisors. Jarred, always great to talk with you. I don't know if you heard, but we just had a noted investor, Kathy Wood, on calling for a potential economic shock because what we're seeing with inflation and the Fed will have to get your take on it. Well, I think the underlying fundamentals when it comes to particularly the labor market remain very strong in this economy. And that's a really important tail when family budgets are challenged by these high price levels. So when you have an unemployment rate of 3.5%, you're adding hundreds of thousands of jobs for a month, 10 million jobs since this President got here. That's going to help working families offset some of the pressures they're facing on the price side. But it certainly doesn't get the job done. We've got a lot more to do in that space. And that's why, at the direction of the President, we have focused, like a laser, on doing all we can to ease price pressures on the supply side of the economy when it comes to the ports, when it comes to shipping costs, air freight costs, energy costs. And of course, the Inflation Reduction Act with its reduction in costs for medical care, for premiums, for prescription drugs, and also for clean energy. So I think the question is, A, is there a strong labor market at your back, the answer is yes, B, is this administration doing everything we can to help ease those pressures, also a firm yes on that one? Jared, I want to pick up on the energy part of all of that. In particular, listen, I know you're not a foreign policy guy, but obviously what's been going on between the US and Saudi Arabia has been getting a lot of attention. And the Saudi support of the OPEC production cut, which has been problematic for the global energy market. If we were looking for prices to continue their downward trajectory, what can the White House do and what is it doing domestically in terms of continuing to push for more production domestically? Well, let's set the level here with just a little bit of...",https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6_2e_wGpQzc,8,2022-10-13 14:26:59
3200," domestically in terms of continuing to push for more production domestically. Well, let's set the level here with just a little bit of a background on what's been going on in energy markets because I certainly agree with a lot of your characterization, but we got that in the CPI report this morning, which is a motivation for our discussion, a gas prices are actually down about 5 percent in September and at an annualized rate of almost a third, about 30 percent in the third quarter. And of course, that reflects almost 100 days of declining gas prices. Now to get to your question, and also to reference back what I was talking about in terms of what this White House can do to help, that reflects the very large distribution of 180 million barrels of oil from the strategic reserves. That's ongoing to be clear. It's another 10 million barrels coming October, November. So that's an ongoing addition to global supply. But we have to do more, especially in the light of this misguided, and I think a very wrong headed decision by OPEC Plus. I'm not going to talk about the geopolitics that's not my lane. I will say the president has consistently since then gone out and talked about the importance of sharing some of those wide profit margins with consumers to give them a bit more breathing room at the pump. If you look at the spread between the wholesale and the retail price, it's still quite elevated. But let's not forget that at the pump, the national price, about $3.90 gallon, is down over a dollar from its peak in June. We need to see more of that kind of breathing room for consumers, and that's one of the things we're going to keep pressing on. The reality is that individuals households, they can't afford to stop spending on some of the necessities, whether that's food, whether that's energy prices, whether that's some of the rent prices even that we've been tracking. And so even with a longer, more protracted, kind of an era of higher inflation, higher prices that people are paying, what do you believe from the White House side are some of the longer term implications of that that may also begin to show up on the back end? So here's my answer to that. I think when you're thinking about that question, which looks around a corner, corners are very hard to look around right now. As you know, everybody's crystal ball is kind of cracked. Inflation is a global phenomenon. It's higher in many other countries than it is here. But I think the right thing to do is ask yourself, are the institutions most directly responsible for this challenge doing what they need to do? The Federal Reserve absolutely yes, okay? They're their pivot, they're tightening campaign. I'm not going to get into the details because we stay out of their knitting, but they're very much engaged as they should be the president has endorsed that pivot. Are we doing everything we can as I've tried to explain yes in the energy space and the supply chain space helping to unsknarl supply chains, inflation reduction act, ship sack, infrastructure act helping to boost the economy supply site. Our policies, makers doing what they need to do. Is it taking effect? Well, if we dig into the inflation report today, we see goods inflation was actually flat in September. That's useful, but of course, housing inflation, shelter inflation created more pressures. Well, is the feds action cooling the housing market unequivocal? Yes, it takes time for that lag to work its way into the CPI, but we're already seeing some cooling in the housing market actually non-trivial, both on the rental side and the ownership side. I'm chair, just very quickly. We've been starting to hear not just from Kathy Wood, but other economists that inflation forward looking inflation indicators are already starting to come down. So just to put your pure economist hat on for a moment, is inflation going to take care of itself? Should the fed and the White House actually maybe take a step back here and say inflation will come down without us having to push things into a recession? Well, I think that's a complicated question that gets into a lot of debates, some of which would have me a lot more into the feds knitting than I'm willing to go in this position. You're right when I was a pundit chin-flapping plane. I get into this all day. It's a good question, but from our perspective, we want to respect the feds independence. I think the question again redounds quite simply to the following. The fed is the first and foremost inflation.",https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6_2e_wGpQzc,9,2022-10-13 14:31:20
3201," But from our perspective, we want to respect the Fed's independence. I think the question again redounds quite simply to the following. The Fed is the first and foremost inflation fighter. This President has said we deeply respect their independence. So we're not going to comment on their granular policy, but he has said that this pivot that they've made is a very appropriate pivot given the challenge of price pressures. On our side, you've seen, well, let me put it this way. I have never been part of a White House or any other job in my long political economy career, where we've done more to try to help on the economy supply side. I never talked about dwell time in my long career. That's the amount of time that containers spend in ports. Now I wake up every morning and check dwell times, and they are significantly down through put through the ports is at historical levels, shipping costs, air freight costs, down significantly. Those actions have our fingerprints on it. We worked closely with the private sector, so there's a real partnership there. But again, the question to get away from the granular who's doing the right thing and the timing of all that, very complicated, quite. Nobody has the right answer to that. What you really need to ask is are there relevant institutions that fight inflation doing what they need to do? And the answer for this White House and for this Federal Reserve is an unequivocal yes. Jared, all of us have gotten to get a big education about supply chain terminology to be sure. Jared Bernstein, member of the White House Council of Economic Advisors, thank you so much for your time this morning. Appreciate it. Thank you. Coming up, we'll get another check on markets and dig into some of the moogers here as we see. A market's still sharply in the red, but well off the lows here. This is Yahoo Finance Live. We are seeing stocks still lower the Dow right now off of 186 points, about 1%, but as you can see, we are well up off the lows of the session here, even though we are still sharply lower. So that initial alarm over CPI, fading a little bit as people try and game out what the Fed is going to do. Next, we are seeing a similar phenomenon with the S&P, although it's still down 1.2% or so, and the NASDAQ down about 1.9%. So likewise, we continue to watch what's going on with yields here, the 30-year-yield 3.9.",https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6_2e_wGpQzc,10,2022-10-13 14:35:51
3202," down 1.2% or so and the NASDAQ down about 1.9% or so. Likewise, we continue to watch what's going on with yields here. The 30 or yield 3.92% and the 10-year yield coming just a hair back below 4%. Also in terms of movers, we're watching shares of Kroger and Albertsons. Bloomberg is reporting that the two grocers are in talks potentially to combine that an announcement could come as soon as sometimes this week or the next week. The Albertsons shares, sharply higher Kroger shares, a little bit lower. Coming up, we're going to battle it out in our bull versus bear segment this week. So the focus will be on meta, put on your VR goggles, we'll be right back. Welcome back. It is time to battle it out in our bull versus bear segment for the week. This week we put the spotlight on meta. Need him, senior analyst, Laura Martin has an under-perform rating on the stock saying costs will exceed revenue growth over the next two years. Welcome Laura. We've also got Aby Bernstein, senior analyst, Mark Schmohlich, reiterating his outperform rating saying he sees light beyond the dark. Welcome Mark as well. Okay, so let's get into this. First and foremost, we've got to talk about the advertising revenue right now for meta platforms, especially as so many companies are pulling back on some of their ad spend really looking at some of their cost restructuring as well. And so Laura, I want to go to you first on this as we see even more of that demand for digital advertising continuing to unfortunately see this vacuum given the restructuring that many companies are doing. What does that mean and net out for what should we should expect going forward for meta platforms and the underlying subsidiaries and Facebook Instagram? You're right. The macro environment continues to deteriorate. We think many ad driven companies will miss their fourth quarter earnings. In meta's case, not only is just the macro environment deteriorating, but they're losing a lot of user time to tick talk. And that continues to happen. Tick-tock now is up to 75% share of adults under 25 here in America, which is the highest ARC per region for meta. So we're worried about both ad unit availability as people move time into tick-tock and we're worried about demand softness at the advertising level and 100% of meta's revenue comes from auction. So if you have...",https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6_2e_wGpQzc,11,2022-10-13 14:39:58
3203," people move time into TikTok and we're worried about demand softness at the advertising level and 100% of Meta's revenue comes from auction. So if you have a falling demand for units, you get light pricing for the units that you do have to sell. Mark, when I get your reaction to that, I mean, you're calling this a make or break quarter for Meta. Absolutely, you know, and I think Laura's right that there's certainly all these, you know, the very loud bear case right now where, you know, it is time to prove it even in this tough macro environment and, you know, there's really kind of three legs of things that they that they need to go off and, you know, effectively dispel one is on the engagement side. And, you know, since they had that for one quarter where they lost a million users, they've gained about 40 million Facebook glue users. Now granted much of that's international, but domestic sell fine. On the revenue front, it is a tough macro, but, you know, we're seeing them actually set up a little bit better actually starting to gain back some share while it from advertisers. Primarily as, you know, they've made some improvements on advantage, sorry on, you know, the idea of a front, they've launched advantage plus, which certainly helps a lot of advertisers, you know, make decisions around kind of automating the, the ad delivery process. And they've launched a lot more ad inventory ramping up advertising load on reels, launching new ad inventory elsewhere. And so, you know, we're starting to see them make progress against much that's been weighing down the stocks since the end of last year. Mark, wanna stay with you for a hot second? The reality of the revenue construct for, for meta, especially as they make a big push into the metaverse, I mean, my goodness. Are we gonna be buying $1,400 glasses to wear augmented reality glasses to wear within our households or even at work? Who knows? I bought one, not saying everybody else, well, so let's write it out. But, you know, I think where we are right now, that certainly captures the headlines and certainly the number that they've been spending, you know, to kind of build out that meta, their metaverse ambitions is, you know, certainly kind of stickers. Not to change the whole name. Exactly right. You know, but I don't think that matters right now for the stock to work, right? Because I think the stock is back to questions around really core fundamentals, folks can understand, you know, that that's like a more long-term initiative. I imagine investors will love it if they were spending a lot less on it. I think we're gonna see some of that discipline. They're not gonna ban anything at all. You know, but you certainly see discipline that, you know, investment in growth areas is gonna be tied to core performance. You know, and so I think investors do need to see that discipline. And so long as engagement is holding and revenues are turning the corner off the bottom, you know, I think they kind of will allow them to continue to kind of build up, even if it's not necessarily desired, but you know, it's certainly a long-term view for sure. Laura, you've called Metacio America's CTO. So what do they need to get right with the metaverse for that to actually hold true? And that figure is Mark Zuckerberg. Yep, so we need to make a distinction between the stock call, which my attitude is, why would you ever get an invest in a stock where you're spending $10 billion a year, but the payoff is in 2030. You should go sit somewhere else. Energy is fine with me or banks, don't care. Those are all fine, but do not sit in a stock that pays off in 2030, which is the stock call. I think what he's talking about in terms of changing the world of computing for consumers is really innovative and interesting and risky. But bringing on the CEO yesterday of both Microsoft and Accenture, great. Says he's got some great enterprise partners and I don't think consumers want to pay $1,500. I think that's the exception. But I think Accenture could pay by thousands of $1,500 goggles. So I think it's interesting what he could do for America and for the consumer over a 10-year frame. Having said that, you know, I would say that, you know, we would move to the sidelines and use meta as a source of funds because that's no place to be as the return on capital deteriorates. Just as we wrap up this conversation, wanna get both of your kind of biggest risks for meta. And I mean, if I'm gonna bring myself into this conversation, it really is who that consumer is because it's about the time spent on these platforms and engaging even with the hardware that they decide to move forward with in order to make either the metaverse real or to just drive up engagement in the screen wars, if you will. Laura, I'll start with you. I think Mark Zuckerberg is telling us he doesn't think he has a core business. He is moving to Reels because it competes with TikTok.",https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6_2e_wGpQzc,12,2022-10-13 14:44:39
3204," I think Mark Zuckerberg is telling us he doesn't think he has a core business. He is moving to Reels because it competes with TikTok. He is moving to the metaverse and he's changed the name of this company, which tells me he doesn't think his core business that he built 15 years ago is actually a business anymore. Otherwise, why would you do these two things at once? Take on an extra $10 billion a year in metaverse spending in a midst of a recession in the ad market on the revenue line? So I think the big question here is, is there a core business that meta that can persist and has an exit multiple? Mark, what about you? Yeah, look, if you take a look at the motivations behind it, we've gone through these changes in the past from desktop to mobile. Mark and the team over there at Meta certainly remembers that well with the existential questions of should they build an app and participate in that ecosystem. And then in the meantime, they've been hit by changes that Apple makes, the gatekeepers in this current environment make. And so they understand that at some point there's going to be another computing platform change. They don't want to be stuck in the application layer. Now, I don't think that is a signal that the core business is certainly kind of, you know, expiring or anything like that. Now, there is certainly this barricade that at some point, you know, social media does go the way of my space or, you know, or Yahoo, but the data is not as important. What is it all social media that goes the way of my space? No, it isn't. And I think, you know, we miss, you know, kind of sitting here in the West that, you know, abroad, Facebook is internet. That's how people access it. And if you kind of take a look at the global charts of who's downloading new apps for the first time, Facebook and Instagram are right at the top. Now, a great, a lot of that's international, but it's still massively growing. We're still growing global internet penetration. And Facebook remains important for how you access it. But, you know, I don't want to fault the company for figuring out that if you're Apple sitting here, yeah, we should try to build an iPhone to kind of, you know, participate and own the next new thing. You know, I understand the motivations behind it. It's a long-term view. Doesn't mean that there's any issue. We still use desktops. So I don't think there's anything to kind of suggest from that investment aside from perhaps the magnitude, you know, that there's any issues with the health of core. All right, we got to give you the gong for the Yahoo ding there. All right, Laura wins by two points. Need him, senior analyst, Laura Martin and A.B. Bernstein, senior analyst, Marc Schmiller, great to have you both here with us today. And everyone's coming up. We'll do a quick check of the markets.

3205," America has long run on Duncan, but a change in the company's rewards program. It has some loyalists rethinking where they go for their a Java run. Let's talk more about all things Duncan and what's on the menu here with Duncan, President Scott Murphy. Scott, great to get some time with you coming to us from inside a Duncan location. Curious on what you're seeing in traffic? There's so much economic cross-currents coming at consumers right now. What does that breakfast day part look like? Yeah, and first of all, thanks for having me. I really appreciate it and I can't wait to talk about our new loyalty program, Duncan Rewards. In terms of traffic, you know, I've been listening to your segment all morning on inflation and everything that's going on with the consumer. We feel really good about the breakfast segment. We feel really good about our brand and how we stand tall. People need their coffee and their breakfast sandwich to start their morning, so we've seen really strong results for our brand in the last couple of months. Scott, full stop. I was critical to changes in the rewards program, but it's coming from a place of love. I have to dunk an app. I go to dunk it all the time, and a lot of other people seemed to have caught my vibe. Have you looked at what you made here and are making any changes now to respond to consumers? Yeah, so, and I know it comes from a place of love from you, Brian. Absolutely. Here's what I would say. We rolled out our Dunkin Perks program in 2014, and we haven't made any changes in the last eight years. And we went out and we talked to our core users and we said, what do you want from a program? And they said they wanted three things. They wanted more variety, because in the old program, you could just get a beverage. They wanted more flexibility, and we've now given them a chance to stack points so they can buy a drink for themselves. They can buy a sandwich for their family, or a whole meal for the soccer team. And they said they wanted recognition. So big users like you want to be recognized. And we now have a boosted status. And so we've put those three things in place. We're really excited about this new program. We gave out four billion free points in the last three days, and the response has been overwhelming with positive. Okay, fair enough. That's good to hear, but the birthday drink is the, it's the industry standard. Like I know, I would like to get a free birthday coffee until I ultimately dropped dead and six feet under. I mean, do you think you'll bring that back? So we're talking about that for sure, Brian. But one thing we did do is, well, we did take that piece away. What we added is come in either the day before your birthday, the day of your birthday or the day after, get three times points, points that won't expire as long as you come a couple times a year. And you can actually get something besides just a beverage. You could get a donut, you could get a sandwich, you can get avocado toast, a lot more flexibility, which is what our guests wanted. So you're really monitoring some of the taste profiles, the trends on what consumers are moving towards in their purchases for anything from lunchtime to, you know, starting off the day. So where are you still seeing the most traffic at what point in the day to really make some of the menu decisions and changeovers there? Yeah, we're certainly a morning day part business. So 70% of our business happens before 11 AM. And honestly, when COVID happened and we had that shutdown, we were all very nervous when the commute was not happening. But people shifted their behaviors a little bit and they came to us a little later in the morning and they came for a couple beverages, maybe to share with their spouses while they're working at home. But really, the trend that's happening is all around ice beverages. And we invented ice coffee. We're a leader, whether it's ice coffee, whether it's cold brew, our new refresher line. It's all about ice beverages and great attachment with snacking items to that. Hey, Scott, it's Julie here. I mean, I gotta say it's like, I guess I want to know a little bit more about the whole recession, spending patterns, et cetera, because you sound super positive. And I'm just wondering what signs, if any, you see a trade down, for example, of a drop in traffic, of any kind of sign that, you know, the anecdotal and data pain that we are talking about every day, if you guys are seeing any evidence of that. Yeah, we do see some of it. And here's what I'd say anecdotally. What happens in our business is, when things happen like fuel prices or you see other spikes in inflationary environments, people pull back a little bit and maybe they stop coming quite as frequently to a dunking or some of",https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6_2e_wGpQzc,14,2022-10-13 14:53:07
3206," is when things happen like fuel prices or you see other spikes in inflationary environments, people pull back a little bit and maybe they stop coming quite as frequently to a Duncan or some other restaurant, but especially with Duncan. I think after a couple days or a week, people realize they need their morning Joe to get started, right? They need their coffee to fuel their day and we've seen it come right back up. And I think uniquely positioned for us, Duncan, it is a value offering, right? So we've got great products, both beverage and food at a great price point at the speed of Duncan. I think that's an unmatched combination out there. Uh, Scott, I go to my local Duncan every Saturday, and it's just a ritual I have. And every time I'm in line, launch a huge in the morning, which is a good thing I'm sure, but everybody's buying coffee, notably iced coffee. How big a percentage is donuts now on your business and what does that menu look like? Yeah, donuts are about 20% of our product mix right now. You're right. Ice coffee is the future that last year was the first year we sold more ice beverages than hot beverages. That's what the next generation of consumer wants. They want these iced cold beverages. They want highly colorful products that they can share on Instagram. But I will say our donuts, no one does donuts like we are. We are obviously a national and a global leader on donuts. You got to come try our spider donut, which we just rolled out for Halloween. We've got a jack-a-lantern donut. There's nothing more shareable and more fun and a nice treat to yourself than a donut. As you've got more people returning either to office or to schools that breakfast wars, that's continuing to brew and heat up, what's Duncan's positioning in that breakfast war? And what are going to be the keys to essentially helping it retain that consumer mind share and that dollar at the beginning of the day? Yeah, a couple things. First of all, we have an incredible brand with a lot of brand love. So we tap into that loyalty like that new program. The second is some degree of everyday value or targeted digital value. So through our app, we are going to have the ability to have laser-focused offers that go right to you and what you want and give you incredible value in our program. And then the last thing I'd say is we've got, it's through our app, our ability to order ahead. So Brian, when you see those long lines, you download the app, order ahead. It'll be ready when you get there and the crew will hand it to you and you'll be off and running for your busy day. Scott, I just, I need the birthday drink back. I'm going to Duncan anyway, lad. I'm going to get off of here. I'm going to Duncan. I just need the birthday drink back. Please, please. Brian, I'm going to come deliver coffee to you personally on your birthday. I'll take that. April 4th. There we go. Yeah, done. Deal. Duncan, President Scott Murphy. Thanks so much for joining us this morning. Appreciate it. Thank you guys. Coming up, everyone, we're going to do a final check of the markets on the other side of this short break.",https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6_2e_wGpQzc,15,2022-10-13 14:57:44
3207," Remember to subscribe and set the notifications on! Well, that was quite a two hours. Hope you enjoyed the ride. We certainly did, even as we see markets continue to sell off. The sell off is definitely not as acute as it was right after we got that CPI data. Right now you've got the NASDAQ still leading losses down 1.3%. But it was down double that earlier. SME 500 the same and has paired its losses to the lower end of the market. Well, that was quite a two hours. Hope you enjoyed the ride. We certainly did, even as we see markets continue to sell off. The sell off is only now down around 30 points. So could we actually end the day higher that would be quite something even with these ratcheted up interest rate expectations?

3208," The blickery in for a Keiko Fujita. And here's what I'm watching today coming in hot. Lower gas prices aren't low enough or high enough to keep a little inflation. It surprises to the upside-sending stocks lower. 100 bips on the Fed. For November, is that on their radar? We're going to chask ICG's Nick Brooks to break it all down next. Crude oil among the risk assets sliding after the numbers hit. This as the IEA says OPEC plus cost could tip the global economy into recession. We're going to speak with Saxo banks ahead of commodities on exactly that. And Ark Innovation Founder CEO Kathy Wood spoke with our morning team about its holdings. And that open letter to the Fed. We're going to bring you more from the conversation. First, let's get a check of the market action. It is a down day here. We can see the Dow off almost 100 points. Parents, some of those losses, S&P 500 and Nasdaq under water as well. And taking a look at the bond market. Wow, we saw the 13-week Keiko not shown right there scream higher, but also the 10-year. That is up about seven basis points in the five year, the lower part of the curve. That is up 12 basis points. And I want to check the Wi-Fi interactive now. I'm going to show you the S&P 500 futures. And this is going to show you what happened at 8.30 AM when we got the lowest or excuse me, the highest core CPI print this cycle. And that was a big down move in the futures. You can also see here 10-year treasury note futures, big down move there. That means the yields shot up. And I'll show you what happened to gold. Gold taking a leg lower even WTI crude oil. It did take that initial downside action, but that has been subsequently reversed. And we got to take a check on the world's, I think most proxied risk asset, I don't know the call it, that Bitcoin. That is also taking two legs lower. So no recovery insight for Bitcoin as it heads to 18,000. That is basically the low of the year. So pretty critical to watch this going forward. And Americans still feeling the pinch when it comes to the price of groceries in September, the price of food increased by 0.8% compared to August. Brooked to Paulmas here with the details. And where did we see some of these biggest jumps broke? That's right, one of the biggest categories. We saw the jumps in cereal and bakery products. Now this is considered the highest. Since the late 70s and early 80s, I was confirmed by Steve Reed and economists at the Bureau of Labor Statistics. Of course, those higher pricing being driven by higher gasoline oils, transportation, weighing on the cost of both groceries and farmers alike. Of course, energy costs here decreased by 2.6% gas laying down 5.6%. Making it cheaper to transport goods, but still higher. Of course, also Dickens is going to say consideration, rising worker wages and prices for impact costs like packaging, fertilizer there. And now here, if you take a look, cereal and bakery products being driven higher by, of course, that rushes Ukraine invasion that happened earlier this year. Also, fruit and vegetables being impacted here, up 10.4% due to a historic drought facing the western half of the country impacting crop yields there. We got to talk about egg inflation here. It looks like some items, including eggs are seeing a bit of a price decline. Others not so much. I just wondering what items are sticking out to you. That's right. Well, to make it clear, Americans can still inspect sticker shock here when they go to the grocery store. I did it. Yeah, exactly. There's really no relief just yet. Of course, we see right here that eggs, month of a month, down 3.5% milk, down 1.3%. But this is doable to some of the impact, some of the climate events that happened over the summer. Of course, egg expires were covering from the spring's avian influenza outbreak. That's what Dr. Michael Spenson of Wells Fargo telling me. But dairy dealing with a hot summer, they are in key markets. Also, vegetables dealing with that record, transportation costs, shipping costs, expected to decline here, but still taking a toll on prices here. And now if we take a look year over year, of course, higher prices across the board. Some of the highest increase here. Flower, lettuce, potatoes, margarine, milk, and eggs. Eggs, once again, seeing a bit of relief, but still up 30%. Now, Jared, as you know, this is a volatile index. They are hard to judge whether or not next month. We might see a tick up, a tick down there. But I also want to note that citrus, somebody to keep a look out here on Wednesday, the US Department of Agriculture, said that Florida's orange crop this year will be the smallest in 1943. Now, that's not even taking into account the effects of hurricane Irene. So lots of fold out here, but Americans still expecting higher prices across the board. Silver lining for you and I.",https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6_2e_wGpQzc,17,2022-10-13 15:06:18
3209," not even taking into account the effects of hurricane Irene. So lots of fold out here, but Americans still expecting higher prices across the board. Silver lining for you and I, Broca, I hear that our lunch time is getting picked up today by corporate, but today only really appreciate that report in all seriousness. Lots of higher prices to digest. Young finances broke to Paul. Thank you. Sticking with this morning's CPI report, let's welcome in and Nick Brookes, ICG head of economics and investment research for his reaction to the numbers and Nick. Let me just get your thoughts, your frontline thoughts on those headline numbers here, especially that core reading, which just shot up excluding food at energy. Yeah, I think that's the key problem. I mean, the headline number has been sort of gradually coming down since June, but the real focus is on the core inflation, which of course is what the Fed really cares about. And that just keeps going up. And as you were highlighting, food inflation is very high. Shelter inflation has also been a key driver of the rate, healthcare costs, and pretty much across the board and services. So the problem with this type of number is, I don't think the Fed wants to continue raising rates. I think the Fed recognizes quite clearly that the economy is probably going into a slowdown over the next couple of quarters. But as long as those core inflation rates remain so high, they need to keep raising rates to keep it under control. So I think bottom line is, and the market seems to think we're going to get 75 basis points from the Fed in November. And now markets are starting to price potentially another 75 in December. So not a good place to be. Yes, I even saw 100 basis point raise in November being price as I think the probability was 2% max. But just goes to show you the extent to which the Fed, which has really been consistent on its messaging. I was going through the FOMC minutes that were released yesterday. No big surprises at CPI, of course, being the bigger report here. But we've seen central bank action out of the bank of England, the bank of Japan just get completely reversed. I mean, you look at the debt of the UK or the currency of Japan trading like emerging markets here. What do you make of the central bank or reaction? How painted into a corner are they? I think they're all painted into quite a severe corner. And I'm based here in the UK, and I won't start talking too much about the UK. But they're in a very, very tight spot. And I think the problem is central banks haven't faced anything like this since the late 70s, early 80s, where you've got extreme inflation. And it's broad-based. And the central bank recognized that growth is coming down. And if it wasn't for these inflation rates, they'd probably be cutting rates. But bottom line is they're worried that inflationary expectations could get out of control. And we'll get the feared wage price spiral that becomes self-fulfilling. So they have to talk tough. They have to act tough. Until inflation rates start coming down, even if it means recession. Well, and we've gotten comments from CEOs who may or may not be talking their books. But Jamie Dimon sticks out in particular, especially ahead of earnings, which we expect imminently this week. Tomorrow morning, and he's talking about another 20% decline in the S&P 500 already on its way there over the last couple days. Just wondering what you see in terms of the markets set up, any levels you're looking at. What are you looking for in the eventual rebound when we find a bottom finally? Yeah. I think there are a couple of things. My own view would be that a lot of the rate increases are in the market. So if you look at swap rates, if you look at forward rates, I think a lot of the central bank hikes that are coming are actually in the market. I think where perhaps the market has not yet priced appropriately is the risk of quite a severe earnings decline as we move into potential recession. So I think the PEs need to come down further and the earnings are also likely to come down further. So I think there is certainly likely to be more downside on equity markets. The other point though I'd make is I think very similar to what we saw during the COVID, the worst of the COVID pandemic. I think it will be very sector focused. I think there are going to be some sectors that are clearly going to be hit much harder than others in this type of environment. But there also be.",https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6_2e_wGpQzc,18,2022-10-13 15:10:30
3210," I think it will be very sector focused. I think there are going to be some sectors that are clearly going to be hit much harder than others in this type of environment. But there also be some sectors that will perhaps be less affected. So I think one does have to take a more nuanced approach if one has a medium term view on an medium term investment horizon. Investors need the nuanced view because the Fed is not playing the nuanced scheme. Well said here Nick Brooks, ICG, head of economic and investment research. Thank you for your time today. Thank you. Before we go to break, check in on shares of Delta. You can see that company if we can get it on the screen there in a second. The company beat on revenue in the third quarter and we spoke with CEO Ed Bastion who had this to say about airfare cost cuts that will benefit customers like you and me. We thought what happened earlier this spring when we pushed ourselves a little faster than we thought we could and the reliability suffered. So I'm confident we can get there by next summer. And as we bring that additional capacity back, that's going to help probably take a little bit of the pressure off of pricing for consumers. But more importantly for Delta, it's going to enable us to get much better cost productivity and we'll be able to pass along some of that cost savings onto our customers.

So moving into the fourth quarter TSMC warning that it's seeing demand bladdish right now. It's rebounding the stock It's up 7% but I also just want to mention that look the chip sector has been dealing with the fallout of the new government Regulations the Biden administration's export control. So you've got applied materials lamb research applied material saying that their fourth quarter is going to be Impacting impacted by this new regulation. So you've got this regulation on the one hand And then you got some of these chip makers that are talking about slowing consumer demand on the other hand impacting and keep in mind that the chip sector also is going through periodic cycles, so it was expected that in the second half of the year that we would see Demand slowed down slower and it's it's these stocks are such that the kind of they've kind of been the way the pandemic style stocks have been Really high during the pandemic and then losing steam this year Hey, we don't need any nuance on that we know the hit that they've been taking and a lot of green on that board It was read quite a bit earlier.

We have a mere Paul Schneider electric president North America And thank you for coming here today This is all part of your presentation at the innovation summit Las Vegas Just tell us a little bit about the event and what we can expect from that Well, first of all, thank you for having me and yes We're here with 1500 customers about 20% of the Fortune 500 is here and the conversation we're having is how do we move from an intent to action There's been a lot of commitments made about getting to net zero and that's great More of those commitments are getting certified with science-based targets, which is an important next step But really deploying the technologies and learning by doing is how we're going to create innovation that we desperately need and That's really what we're talking to our partners customers and broader strategic alliances about here The thing that's most important right now is that we remember that sustainability is also an efficiency driver So it's got a bottom line positive impact and I think that is going to be an acceleration point for all of the sectors And a lot of the impetus behind the eat well behind the clean air Movement and clean energy movement has to do with government subsidies just wondering what the status of that is We hear a lot about that with respect to Tesla and some of the other big makers, but there's a lot going on behind the scenes as well as we beef up our infrastructure It's government subsidies for sure especially for consumers and it'll act as a catalyst for consumers to make the right choices People want to do the right thing and if it can be also Providing a better experience then these incentives are just going to make that transition happen faster Think about people buying an EV once they buy an EV they have an opportunity to put solar in their home when they do that They can add a battery and then with technologies that we can work with the utilities to also make them Producers of energy and maybe even sell some of that back in the right environments to the broader grid So there's a real evolution where consumers are going to become prosumers And we think this evolution is going to be catalyzed by things like the inflation reduction act But I want to go back to my earlier point sure investment and clean tech is about also making environments more efficient Not just in terms of being more green but operation",https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6_2e_wGpQzc,20,2022-10-13 15:19:02
3212," reduction act. But I want to go back to my earlier point. Sure. Investment and clean tech is about also making environments more efficient, not just in terms of being more green, but operationally more efficient. So it actually saves money in the long term. And we've published research with the Schneider Sustainably Institute that in existing buildings, we can build payback periods under eight years, not only making the buildings more efficient and in places like Las Vegas at the largest Hilton property in the world, we're demonstrating that as an act of solution. What is what's some of the tech behind this, what you call next generation industrial technology that's being used to empower workers, specifically, how does this all fit together? So look, one key element is to bring digital into the space. As consumers, we've been living in the digital and internet era for about 20 years. But in the industrial space, data and digital assets are just being deployed at scale. And what digital does is it makes the invisible visible and brings all of that opportunities for optimization. What it also helps us do is take our scarceest resource, which is people, and help them focus on the most important places where they can innovate and be creative. That is also going to create a lot of new jobs. We think there's an incredible opportunity in the clean tech space and solar, the number of electricians we're going to need, and we're investing. In addition to working with people like Nika, the National Association of Electrical Contractors, we're investing with community colleges to make sure the next generation is ready to work in this IoT environment. Finally, we're also investing in manufacturing. We announced an additional $46 million invested in the United States to prepare for this wave of electrification. And that's on top of 100 million we invested in our factories last year. Well, appreciate your time here. I've got to leave it there. I'm here, Paul Schneider, Electric President in North America. Thank you. Coming up, if you think the S&P's 2022, excuse me, 2022 punch has been steep, spare a thought for Kathy Wood's flagship fund. It has plummeted at more than twice the pace. So how is she feeling? My name's like Tessla and Roku now. You're going to hear from her up next.",https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6_2e_wGpQzc,21,2022-10-13 15:23:24
3213," Built-Th глаза Cream cheeseーブリケк Welcome back. We saw a red inflation print this morning with CPI coming in at 0.4% for the month and Kathy Wood weighed on one of the prints and more with our morning show today with us now is Julie Hyman and Julie. Lots going on in that interview. She talked about golden deflation, but also the dreaded R word recession. Yes, and it was sort of linked in with what she's talking about with deflation as well. The chief see some deflationary impulses out there going on under the service, particularly in commanding. She did talk about gold. And so she talked about if indeed we are seeing deflation come down the pike, then the risk with the fed raising rates is that yes, we will see recession. This is a real shock to the system. And I do believe we will see the ramifications in many ways. We're seeing housing shutting down. And I think we're going to see a lot of other activities shutting down as well. We believe we're in a recession and we believe this recession now will be sustained. And if we see an increase in GDP is probably because either inventories are continuing to increase or imports are coming down as companies try to unwind their inventories. It's pretty interesting, Julie. Everybody talking about what the Fed is going to do in November and December, but a lot of traders already pricing in rate cuts for the end of 2023. I have to see how that pans out. But you also asked her about Elon Musk and the purchase Twitter, of course, Elon and Tesla being one of the great disruption plays that she has. But what are her thoughts on Elon taking over Tesla? Well, she doesn't have Twitter in the portfolio anymore. We should mention that, but she does have Tesla. And Tesla is one of the things that's done better in that portfolio amidst what has not done well overall. Right. The arc, arc, arc, that benchmark ETF is down more than 60% for the year thus far. It's down in today's session even as other things are turning higher. So I asked her, what's the risk that Elon gets distracted and are you worried about what he's going to do for Twitter? She said she's excited about what Elon Musk could bring to Twitter. Listen, we are prolific users of Twitter. Our gives away its research. We give away our research not when it's finished, but as it's evolving. And our most prolific platform, social platform out there is Twitter. I'm kind of excited to see what Elon will do. I actually think he'll work closely with Jack Dorsey and maybe open up the ecosystem, take away the censorship, make it much more transparent. And I think add more value to that ecosystem. You know, it was interesting. I asked her, like, isn't it going to be a mess though? And there's all this stuff. And she said, no, she said two things. I thought we're as interesting. And one, she said she herself will be able to filter out. And she thought that a Twitter under Elon Musk could offer users maybe more filtering options. And so that it wouldn't necessarily be a noisy, harassing, ugly place under an Elon Musk scenario. We'll see. When it comes to Twitter innovation under the old regime, we just got that edit button after what, 10 years. So yeah, I think it could be a little bit chaotic. I'm interested to see all the changes. I hope it doesn't break. I don't think it will because as news people were, were prolific users of, we are. It's actually like Cathy Wood. Yes. Very prolific here. Thank you for that. And great interview, by the way. Thank you. And finances Julie Hyman. All right.

The idea is that users can use and manage the account directly from their existing wallet. Apple Pay was launched in 2014 and the joint credit card, Apple card was established by both groups in 2019.

Car coming up chorus of Doom sayers there was Jamie Diamond's recession called then the IMF saying the worst is to come now in a rare warning the IEA that is the international energy agency joins the negative sentiment brigade saying op-ed plus cuts could tip this world the entire world into a downturn that's up next welcome back let's take a look at the markets where we see a sudden reversal to the upside you can see the dial there up over 1% on the Wi-Fi interactive that's good for 362 points and change looking over the past four days looking at gains of just short of 1% there want to take a let take a look at the Nasdaq as well up about two thirds of a percent but you can see for the four days in this week it is down about one and a half percent also want to get a check on the bond market where we saw a yield screaming higher after that surprisingly high CPI point a print five year Tino yield is up 12 basis points as you can see right here 10 year also up but not as quite as much that's up about eight basis points 30 year that is at the highest level since 2007 that's up six and the 13 week which tracks what the Fed is doing with its benchmark interest rate that is up five basis points finally want to get a quick look at the sector action today everything except energy was in the red earlier now energy up 3% followed by materials that is a play on a weaker dollar perhaps maybe reversal going underway there financials up ahead of a lot of bank earnings that we're getting tomorrow as well as tech to the downside consumer discretionary taking a small hit now as well as real estate now on to oil OPEC plus slash shits production targeted by 2.1 million barrels per day last week the move threatened to raise gas prices in the U.S. and we're seeing as a,https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6_2e_wGpQzc,23,2022-10-13 15:31:51
3215," Now on to oil, OPEC plus slash shits production targeted by 2.1 million barrels per day. Last week the move threatened to raise gas prices in the U.S. and was seen as a critical blow to the President Biden ahead of the midterm elections. Now today something of a rare warning. The International Energy Agency says higher prices could be a tipping point for the global economy as it sits on the brink of a recession. Now let's move to oil market fundamentals. Now joining us from Copenhagen is Oli Hansen, Saxo banks, head of commodities strategy, Oli, great to have you here today, a rare rebuke for the Paris-based agency, the IEA. What's going on behind this? Maybe some politics? Well it just clearly highlights Jared that we are seeing a politics playing an in greater part in this oil market. We're obviously still trying to work out what really happened last week in that meeting in the OPEC plus meeting. The initial response, I initially thought that this was a good for Russia and bad for the global consumer and it seems like that's the tone that's been adapted. It's really a dangerous game right now, cutting production at a time where we're seeing an economic slowdown because it does several things. First of all, as the IEA says, it carries the risk of hurting demand even more, but also carries the risk of central banks being more aggressively on the hiking foot for longer. That's clearly not what the market needs right now. We need to start to look for peak in these yields and peak in the dollar and so on. That potentially could prolong that period. Well let's talk about the dollar here. We've seen the dollar screaming higher versus all kinds of currencies including, I think the top three in the basket that I'm looking at are the Argentine peso, the Turkish lira and surprise surprise surprise surprise, the Japanese yen, which is a third largest currency traded in the entire world. That's quite a trio to have at the top, but I'm wondering with all these central bank actions with the Bank of England and also the Bank of Japan, seemingly running out of bullets here, all that action resulting in opposite movements in their prices that they wanted in the first place, what do you think the outcome is for global currencies led by the US dollar here? Well the response that we've seen so far today after that, higher than expected inflation print, could indicate that the market is starting to get into a bit of a selling fatigue in the stocks, buying fatigue in yields and the dollar. We've seen quite a sharp turnaround as you mentioned there. It could also just be the fact that the market say, well we are clearly going to see a turnaround in inflation sooner or later and we are getting closer and we can also see the sub components of the increase today that we are seeing some sub-components down to ease down a bit. So there is expectation that inflation will peak, but at the same time also that will bring us to the point where we potentially could start to talk about peak hawkishness and that really could be a turning point when the Fed, when we get the idea that the confirmation that the Fed is starting to look in the other direction because that could be the beginning of some dollar weakness which the global economy is sorely neat right now and also lower yields which we also add some most ability to the market. Well Lisa, a little tamping down of the volatility that we've seen there in the yields market, but I want to take it back to commodities looking at the Wi-Fi interactive here. This is commodity prices over the last month and up in the upper left is heating oil. That's up 14 percent followed by orange juice. That's up 11 percent maybe something to do with hurricanes there, but then our Bob Gasoline wheat aluminum. The list goes on here. Are we in fact seeing maybe another upturn in the commodity cycle here after a bit of a respite where we saw a lot of these prices just club down to very low levels this year? Well that is our general outlook that we are in a situation where we see tight supply across several markets basically supporting prices enough to put prices even on a further upward trajectory. Even though we have this worries about economic slowdown, but if we look at the the the the market you just mentioned there apart from the hurricane which is impact the orange juice it is really it's got Russia written all over it. It's sanctions potentially on on aluminum. It's Ukraine wheat supplies and it's a diesel demand because we are we are here in Europe getting close to the embargo which means we have to find out these levels.",https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6_2e_wGpQzc,24,2022-10-13 15:36:23
3216," on aluminium, it's Ukraine, wheat supplies, and it's a diesel demand because we are here in Europe getting close to the embargo, which means we have to find out these levels where we are already now having a multi, well at least a decade low diesel stock in the US. We did have the report coming out earlier today and it just shows that diesel stocks continue to drop. So that's really a substitution for gas right now and that's right, these price size elevated as they are. We have to leave it there but really appreciate your insights here, Saxo banks, head of commodity strategy, Oli Hansen, thanks for joining us from Copenhagen, enjoy your evening. All right, let's get to our chart of the day and this has to do with a part into demand, which is starting to ease according to real estate data provider, real page, it's all rental demand, turn negative in the third quarter for the first time in 30 years. Negative demand means more people are moving out than in suggesting that higher rent prices are taking a toll on would be renters after last years, resurgent and rental demand, having moved recently myself, experiencing 37% price increases, I can testify to this rental inflation and sticking with real estate mortgage rates have jumped to their highest level in more than two decades. The average rate on a 30 year fixed loan increased to 6.92% as of today, Thursday, according to Freddie Mac's weekly survey, last time we saw that was April 2002. Coming up, crypto check a big down day for Bitcoin and friends as investors await the next meaningful jolt higher but does a drop in volatility being a break away from stocks. We'll take a closer look next. Markets now green after this morning's CPI report, you got to take a look at this on the Wi-Fi interactive. These are the futures, S&P 500 futures.

3217," After this morning's CPI report, you've got to take a look at this on the Wi-Fi Interactive. These are the futures, S&P 500 futures. Now up over one in three quarters of a percent, I want to show you what happened at 8.30 AM. Got this huge drop here, but now we are higher than we were just before the report. And if we take a look at the year-to-date action on the S&P 500, this is pretty significant here when you're going up on a bad news day. That is potentially bullish. We got a firm rejection of these lows here around what is at 3,600 or 3,500. And so we're going to have to see if this continues. But I want to show you a very similar market. It just in terms of price reaction. Here we have Bitcoin. Now we did get this big down draft at 8.30 AM, followed by another one a bit later. And now we are heading higher. But you can see Bitcoin not reclaiming all of those losses. But we want to stick with this. The crypto market and joining us now to discuss how it's huge. Roberts quant insight head of analytics. And we want to get your take on what's going on with Bitcoin this morning. And because it's had an incredible correlation with stocks, particularly the tech sector. Absolutely. Actually, you've just taken my punchline now away from me. So what quant insight does just to back up a second and to give some context is we look at macro factors. So growth and inflation measures of financial conditions like real yield, sleep of the yield curve, what feds up to and measures of risk appetite. And then we look at all different assets across equity markets, bond markets, commodities, FX. And more recently in the last few years crypto as well. And give a sense of the macro characteristics of that asset. And whether that asset is rich or cheap to prevailing macro conditions. For a long time, for a first couple of months of this year, crypto was not trading as a macro plate. It was trading off crypto technicals. But in April, it came into a new macro regime. And to your line, it is trading very much to characteristics of it are exactly the same. As a US tech stock. The difference being whereas S&P NASDAQ have all been cheap on our models beaten up in the last couple of weeks. Crypto looked expensive. So in a way, we've been waiting for this price action. The valuation gap is not extreme, but both Bitcoin and Ethereum, they both look modestly richer on our models and macro fair values world over while the swap price has been holding in there. So we've been waiting for price action like this. Let me ask you something because Bitcoin is knocking to the downside on the lows of the year, which also coincidentally happened to be the highs roughly speaking of that huge bull market in 2017. Many years ago, just wondering what you think in the price action happens, should that floor, temporary floor maybe be breached here? 18,000, what's the next level? Yeah, absolutely. Well, I would defer to Chartis and Tech Lannaries who know that better than I would. But yeah, Charting 101 tells you that if we take out those levels, then clearly it doesn't look good. And the crypto winter, which I think people hoped was beginning to go to maybe form a base. And could potentially be looking to reverse higher. This would suggest that actually the bear market was just pausing for breath and the charts would point to significant downside. But that's very much a technical analyst perspective. As I say, we come exclusively from a quantitative macro perspective. Well, let me extend that then to the general currency markets, where we've been describing. I've been talking about this almost the whole show the incredible strength of the US dollar that we've seen here. What are your, what is your quantum analysis at the macro level? Levels show you in terms of the pain that the US dollar rise this year is having on other currencies, especially big ones like the yen and also the pound at a record low versus a dollar. Yeah, absolutely. That's a very fair comment. And I think you are seeing that the stress and strains of the current global monetary policy tightening cycle is actually manifesting itself first and foremost in overseas markets, the strength of the dollar. It calls that 20 billion unilateral intervention from the Japanese and dollar yen a few weeks back. We've all seen the russians in sterling and guilt markets. Some of those have their own idiosyncratic flavours and they're in the case of the UK and the mini budget. But you can say that the reason we got here in the first place is being the strength of the dollar for the first nine months plus of 2022.",https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6_2e_wGpQzc,26,2022-10-13 15:45:02
3218," in the case of the UK and the mini budget, but you can say that the reason we got here in the first place is being the strength of the dollar for the first nine months plus of 2022. The interesting thing from our modeling perspective to go back to your question is that for the first five, six months of the year, all the major FX crosses were very much macro plays. It was interest rate differentials. Sometimes it was nominal rate differential, sometimes a different cross mic feed more of real yield differentials, but it was very much about a hawkish fed and kind of outstripping its central bank peers. But a few months back, our model confidence was just captures how good a job macro is doing and was explaining price action in FX some to fall and fall aggressively. So the interpretation from our side has actually the last couple of months in the dollar rally has been less to do with fundamentals and actually more to do with non macro factors. And I suspect key amongst those is probably actually being trended momentum and its CTA flow just fought in the one way trend and pushing things higher more than it's been about macro. No, if that's a case and it's all about momentum, I'd say we're in for a ride because these things tend to go parabolic before they reverse. Hugh Roberts, quant insight head of analytics, really appreciate your insights here. Coming up, social insecurity benefits would jump at the start of the next year as a cost of living adjustment battles inflation. But are we getting the most out of the system? Our next guest has a few thoughts for you. Don't miss it. nasze ses Welcome back, Social Security Beneficiaries are looking at receiving higher payments as the Social Security Administration announces an 8.7% benefit increase for 2023. What does it all mean for your retirement? Joining us now is Jimmy Hopkins, Carson",https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6_2e_wGpQzc,27,2022-10-13 15:49:36
3219," Curity Administration announces an 8.7% benefit increase for 2023. 2023, what does it all mean for your retirement? Joining us now is Jimmy Hopkins, Carson Group Managing Partner of Wealth Solutions. So really big jump here. I'm guessing probably the biggest jump in a lot of our lifetimes, right? Yeah, it's the largest jump since 1981. So you might be able to tell if you can see me, but I actually was born right after that. So yeah, I have not seen one of these in my life and to put in perspective right 2020, we had about like a 1.3% increase. We had a couple years of zeros before. And I think everybody knows inflation's been high this last year and that's where the cola's coming from. Well, let me ask you because we've seen a lot of prices in the sub indices jump by a lot more than 8.5% we're talking about here, especially when it comes to rent and food at times. Is this enough? And how are people, how are retirees who are living off of their benefits, adjusting to this high inflation era? Yeah, and that's a great question. Now give a little bit of a positive spin on this. So we saw that number right and you see the CPI that most people see was about 8.2% here. And that's we track off of something called the CPI U for that main number of most people looking at. This actually comes from something called the CPI W. And that's actually up here at this 8.7%. So we actually saw a higher increase in the cost of living adjustments than the one on the chart right now that 8.2. And actually if you go look at there's another number called the CPI E, which actually tracks the spending of seniors. Now I have not seen the September data yet. I pulled it up this morning. They still only have August in there. But if you run that back August to August 21 to 22, that actually was about 7.7%. And so that's actually tracking what our seniors are spending. So the good news there is right now it looks like seniors are actually spending on items that are not seeing as high of inflation as a general population. So I'd say that's a good thing. Now the hard part is seniors live on more of a fixed income stream and those adjustments don't occur till next year. So they are trailing right now, right? The adjustment. And that's how Social Security always works. We adjust for the next year. So they're feeling it in their pockets today. And I have to imagine there might be some pent up purchases here for somebody living on a fixed income. Maybe they're staple items. Maybe they're things that they need. But also there could be some discretionary purchases. Given the length of time since we've seen anything happen like this before you were born looking good, by the way, I would ask do we have any idea where we could see some of this money end up in our current ecosystem, in terms of our current economy? Yeah, I think one of the things to think about right now is our people are going to start pushing off some spending. I was in an interview earlier today talking about holiday spending. And I think I saw about 14% of Americans that they already started back in August. They're trying to spend those expenditures out. I think that's something to pay attention to as we head into this holiday spending, we want to see this money being spent. We've got millions and millions of Americans that are impacted by Social Security. And it tends to provide people look at this as their income replacement, right? Their paycheck replacement. So a lot of people are using Social Security for those basic expenditures. And they're pulling from other things more as they're discretionary. So I don't know if this is going to have a direct impact right now. I think most people are still probably moving along, not adjusting their spending this year due to this COLA increase next year. But this is a serious thing. I mean, it is a good amount of money increase. If you think about it, I think it's 130 something dollars increase on average over the previous year. So more than a thousand dollars total next year that will be going out into our seniors pockets. But so flip side of that, this number also increases something called the taxable wage base. And so that went from I got 147, 147,000 to about 160,000. So that went up 13,000 dollars, which if you apply the 12.4% Social Security taxes to it for workers, that's about $1200 more in taxes that will pay next year for going into Social Security too. So we see an increase in benefits. We also see an increase on the flip side. And the taxes we will pay if you're earning that much money back into Social Security. But we appreciate your insights into this issue. Very near and dear to hearts of many in our audience, Jamie Hopkins, Carson Group Managing Partner of Wealth Solutions. Now for a random story of the day. And this one is a, it's a bit mind blowing.",https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6_2e_wGpQzc,28,2022-10-13 15:53:57
3220," Our audience, Jamie Hopkins, Carson Group Managing Partner of Well Solutions. Now for a random story of the day. And this one is a bit mind blowing here. Researchers at cortical labs have grown brain cells that have learned to play the video game PONG. The research team grew many human brain cells grown from stem cells and some from mouse embryos and connected it to the video game, the electrodes. Dr. Brett Kagan, who led the study says there are so many more research areas that can be explored in a comprehensive way and even plans to test the impact alcohol has on the many brains ability to play PONG. I'm calling this Pete, the Petri-Desh Pong player and I hope that we're going to have more of this. Now driving the development with the dream team, Japanese giants Honda and Sony. Now they are teaming up with something completely different here and Yahoo Finance is probably supermanian. I know you have the details of this for our audience. Now I might have got a bit distracted here with Pete talking about our Petri-Desh Pong player but this is an important development for the EV space. What are the details? Yeah you know Jared, it's Honda and Sony teaming up here. Maybe Sony is providing the brain cells if you will for this car. So essentially this is the IRA at work. They're going to actually make this Honda Sony car in Ohio, most likely in Ohio, Honda's plant there, taking advantage of the tax incentives and things like that to build this car. So we're going to see probably the full production model or a full mock up at CES this year. But big picture here is this is a car that's going to be powered by Sony's software entertainment services, even level for the autonomy and A-DAS type systems going to be powered by Sony and Honda will make the actual physical car itself for the batteries and the motor and the actual shell. And this thing with one of the big key features of this car is that it's going to be a premium sort of low volume car and Sony and Honda want to use subscription services software services to kind of make this recurring revenue streams that posted this one time, here's your money, give me the car. So they want to really focus on that subscription stuff offering as well. Another big part of it is that the industry wants to make fewer like new cars, right? They want to make fewer design, fewer shells and cars. They want to actually update the software, update componentry inside and that's the way they'll actually kind of make money. That's what Tesla does. I mean the model that's been offered over 10 years, that car's not going anyway. Anyway, going away anytime soon. It's more about the software and also upgrading the internal componentry and that's what Sony and Honda want to do here with this car. Hopefully we'll see you in January. And let me ask you along that vein. We saw a BMW roll out heated seats as a subscription service. That was not necessarily well received by the market. Lots of haters there that I saw on my Twitter feed. So there are some pitfalls to trying to get that recurring revenue. Are people becoming more acclimated to this? Where do you see this going? I think it's more along the lines of how we pay for apps on our phone. I think there's Sony seeing this car as almost like a big smartphone. It's a way for you to actually kind of add services like that and you might be willing to pay for a Spotify app or something like that monthly or one time basically. As opposed to like the physical features like heated seats that got a lot of blowback, BMW actually kind of backtracked that because it saw it as such. You're telling me you're building this actual feature in the car than not letting me have it. So you might have see stuff like autonomous features, things like that that you can actually add on a software and people might be okay with that as a subscription add on. Yeah, I can't wait until we get those subscription service where you don't have to keep the car itself. I think that's around the corner as well. Yeah, who finances, products who are median always appreciate you stopping by here. And let us call it turn around Thursday, stocks plunging 300 points and then reversing to the upside. Let's take a look on the Wi-Fi interactive before we go here and we are seeing green across the board, Russell 2000 and the Nasdaq, those are each up 1.51 percent, S&P 500, 100, up a little bit more and the Dow is leading the way. You can see it's up 1.86 percent for the four days in this week. Actually, we got to do three days. Forgot Monday was a holiday. We are seeing the Dow up 1.88 percent. Also taking a look at the bond market. See what's happening here. The 10 year yield, whoa, you know what? I got a surprise. I forgot. This popped up on my radar a little bit ago. It's just brands, the maker of Twinkie, ticker TWNK. That is at a record high. And I got to say, it has been making record highs many times this year as a lot of stocks have been faltering. So, hats off to the good folks at Twinkie. But I do want to get to some other sector action for today. Here's the Nasdaq 100. We can see Microsoft down 3 percent. In video, also down 3 percent. And then we can see the Nasdaq 100. And then we can see the Nasdaq 100. And then we can see the Nasdaq 100.",https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6_2e_wGpQzc,29,2022-10-13 15:58:17
3221," But I do want to get to some other sector action for today. Here's a NASDAQ 100. We can see Microsoft down 3%, Nvidia also down 3%, Tesla up about 6%, 10% and I'm going to put a 1-year chart on. You can see we took out these lows here from May, June, July. It looks like we have risen back above and this isn't too dissimilar from some of the averages and the price action that we've been seeing in there. So is this a turnaround Thursday? I'll tell you what, when stocks go up on really bad news, could be the case. All right, we got one more thing to check here. I do want to check in on our leaderboard. Excuse me, I'm going to go back to the Wi-Fi Interactive. Regional banks taking the lead there up to 1.5% followed by stocks. That is a semiconductor insects and then that followed by gambling, value stocks, momentum. Momentum on a tarot here. I'm not going to delve into the irony there, but that is up about 1.5%. We're going to have to go, but we're going to be back in a little bit and I will be back Monday morning. You can catch me back. Goodbye. Multinational earnings could very well be.",https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6_2e_wGpQzc,30,2022-10-13 16:02:46
3222," our country revenues are generated overseas. So as we sort of think about the strength of the dollar overseas as well as the weakening economic backdrop, particularly in places like China and Europe, a lot of these multinational earnings could very well be coming under pressure through the third quarter. But currency markers, I think, are very much sniffing out this weak sort of global backdrop in this challenging environment that global central banks find themselves in, particularly with the Bank of England and the Bank of Japan, on one end, particularly in the Bank of England, they're hiking interest rates to try to assert that stabilize their currency. While they're also, they're just finishing out buying bonds by the end of this week to try to stabilize the bond market, very, very difficult environment for global central banks to try and navigate. And so, certainly another layer of uncertainty and complication in the markets. And I do think this means that the dollar is probably going to remain pretty strong through the end of the year and into next year. As Julie mentioned at the top, we're going to be kicking off this earnings season, some of the banks were set to hear from them. And with that in mind, a lot of chatter around how strong the household balance sheet is. From your perspective and what you've been reading through, where are household balance sheets and especially going into next year, what is that kind of tenor of the consumer likely to be? I still think household balance sheets are in decent shape. I will acknowledge that we do anticipate another quarter of a build up in loan loss provisions across banks. This would be the sixth consecutive quarter that banks have decided to build up those loan loss reserves. And that is certainly going to act as a drag on overall bank earnings. And I think it's very much them being taking a slightly more conservative approach, just recognizing that, just about every analyst and market participant is calling for a recession sometime in 2023. And so I think banks really just want to fortify their balance sheets ahead of that. But when we look at the data today, we certainly acknowledge that consumers have been dipping into those pandemic-related savings. They've also been running up some of their credit card balances. But I would argue this is more of a normalization in credit card spending and usage, not necessarily a consumer that's becoming overextended. If you actually look at revolving credit as a percentage of disposable income, leading up into the pandemic, that number was sitting at around 6.5%. And now, after consumers decided to pay down some of those credit card balances over the course of the pandemic, that number has picked back up to around a 6% level. So we, and to add to that, we haven't necessarily seen consumer delinquency rates pick back up meaningfully. So I think today, consumers are still in a decent shape. Labor markets are still tight. Nominal wages are still strong. And that could certainly provide some support for consumers over the short term. But again, as businesses become a little bit more sour about the economic outlook, you'll start to see those hiring freezes, start to lead into job cuts and in layoffs. And then that's when the consumers really are going to start to come under pressure. Jordan, is the reality that the bear market is just not going to end until there is any whiff of a Fed pivot? To a certain extent, I think that's fair. And the reason why the pivot is so important is because there's still room for the Fed to actually be more hawkish. I know you've got the Fed that's settling a roughly 4.6% term right next year. But I think the real question is, when is the federal funds rate going across CPI? And I think it's going to cross sometime at the middle of next year. The challenge is I think it crosses out a higher Fed funds rate, not a lower inflation rate. And so I think the Fed and we'll get to submit sometime this afternoon, I think it's certainly going to continue to show that while some committee members are concerned about a slowdown in the economy, there's still laser focused on trying to bring that inflation and more importantly, maintaining that in their credibility as an inflation fighting entity. And so I think you do kind of have to see that Fed pivot because markets don't like higher rates. And the Fed may actually be in a position to do a little bit more over the course of the first half of next year.",https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6_2e_wGpQzc,31,2022-10-13 16:06:51
3223," you you mm ro you Pepsi co is the hottest ticker page on Yahoo Finance right now as the food giant way profit estimates and raised its full year forecast for sales and earnings. Joining us now is not other than PepsiCo Vice Chairman and CFO Hugh Johnson. Who? Great to see you as always. You just got off the earnings call. I was on the earnings call as well. I think the street was very surprised by how strong your sales came in. Is this the reality that your business is still going to do pretty darn well even in a mild recession? Yeah, good morning. Nice to be with you guys. You know, I think it will historically we have done well as we've moved into recessions. Obviously, a 16% growth rate for PepsiCo is an extraordinary number. But that said, we do think that we'll continue to perform pretty well. Regardless of the economic environment, one of the beauties of consumer staples is, while people may trim their purchases in durables and more higher end goods. In a difficult environment, people want a bit of an affordable luxury and a bag of chips or a beverage is something that they can treat themselves well and give themselves a smile. So we should perform well through good and bad economy. I'm all for smiles, Hugh. Absolutely. Are you still pushing through price increases though in the fourth quarter? We did. Beginning in the fourth quarter, we took some more pricing. Again, all of that is based on commodity input costs, which continue to be higher. For the year, we'll be in the high teens in terms of our commodity input costs. So our pricing has been a little bit less than what we've experienced in inflation. But frankly, we focused on all the other aspects of our cost structure as well. So while gross margins were down a bit, operating margins were up as we've managed the balance of the cost structure very tightly. Hey, Hugh, it's Julie here. I just want to dig into pricing a little bit more. So average price is up 17% year over year. Average sales volume or overall sales volume, I should say, went down a little bit. How much are you going to be able to continue to raise prices? And do you expect volumes to continue to trend lower? It's a great question. We started the year with relatively high pricing, and we assumed that, in fact, volumes would do worse than what they have. Whole variety of reasons as to why that's the case, I think, for number one, prices are increasing everywhere, not just in our categories and in our company. Number two, household balance sheets for at least the upper eight deciles are still remarkably strong here in the United States. So as a result of that, we think we can continue to take whatever pricing we need to address the commodity inflation that has actually impacted us. In terms of that inflation, you guys know, and we've talked about in the past, we tend to forward buy on commodities about six to nine months. So as we see some moderation in commodities, we'll be able to manage our pricing going forward, but that's going to be a delayed effect because of our forward buying. What type of replenishment have you seen among your partners, your channel partners who are selling through so much of the inventory that you do produce, especially...",https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6_2e_wGpQzc,32,2022-10-13 16:11:00
3224," because of our forward buying. What type of replenishment have you seen among your partners, your channel partners who are selling through so much of the inventory that you do produce, especially knowing that consumers who are looking for deals, they might be buying in bulk for some of the products that you offer that you bring to the market in order for themselves to be able to see some type of deal on their side. Yeah, it's less an issue for us than I think is elsewhere. Because our number one, our Southeast snack products have a limited shelf life. So you really can't buy too much in bulk on those products. And then on beverages as well, because our pricing tends to be relatively even. We used to do much more high low in terms of pricing. It's now a little bit more level. So the desire to sort of load in on those products when the prices are low, that opportunity doesn't exist anywhere. Candidately, we think that's better for the consumer. And what we've seen is consumers look at the category more favorably when the pricing is more consistent. So given that we control distribution all the way to the shelf for the majority of our products in a number of markets, that load in fact is really not an issue for us the way it might be for some other companies. Hugh, let's talk currencies for a moment. You guys say now the currency transition is going to cause about a two and a half percentage point hit to the top and bottom line for the full year. That's up a half a percentage point from previously. We've been watching all kinds of wacky currency moves, particularly when we talk about the British pound and the actions that the Bank of England are taking. I think you guys get about 2.5% of your sales from the UK if I'm not mistaken. How much of a problem are central banks? How much of a challenge I guess I'll ask that more diplomatically, is that posing for you in your business? I mean, currency whenever the dollar strong obviously impacts our international profits when we dollarized them. That said, at a two or two and a half percent level, we view it as relatively manageable. We don't hedge on translation of earnings. We only hedge transactions, frankly, because hedging translation doesn't create any real economic value. In fact, it has a cost to it, so it destroys economic value for shareholders. But at the level we're at right now, we view it as a manageable issue, not something that it's going to be disruptive. Hugh, you got some questions on the call about Gatorade. Early next year, I would say you're making a big push into caffeinated Gatorade via a product called Fast Twitch, I mean, 200 milligrams of caffeine. That's a lot of caffeine. How big a role do you think Gatorade will play in the entry drink market starting next year? Well, Gatorade broadly is doing really, really well right now. The base Gatorade, Gatorade zero is probably going to be a billion dollar business pretty soon. GFIT, the product that we introduced earlier this year is capturing occasions outside of the core sweat occasion for Gatorade. So we think that franchise is very extendable. One of the places we've seen athletes, and Brian, I suspect you probably use a product like this as well as athletes will use caffeine as a mechanism for driving performance. We viewed it as an opportunity. We certainly got requests for it from some of the professional teams that frankly use it as a performance assist as well. So we decided to launch the product and we think it's going to be a terrific product. How big it'll be? Hard to say at this point, but we do know there's a market out there. We're excited to participate in it. Well, we have you in the market that we see right now where evaluations have significantly lowered. Do you see more of an accelerated opportunity for deal making for looking at some of the brands that have looked kind of inquisitive or tasty, if you will, for a company in Pepsi and bringing them on board? Well, we've done a few deals over the past couple of years and obviously we like to spend the time to make sure that we integrate those deals properly in order to ensure we get the success we anticipated out of them. Look, the reality of it is we look at everything. Anything that's close to our space will always take a look at. At the same time, we're very, very disciplined in terms of the way that we approach actually executing a transaction. So I agree with the evaluations are down, but just sometimes something isn't inexpensive. It just costs less than it used to. All right. Wise words there. PepsiCo Vice Chairman and CFO Hugh Johnson. Hugh, thanks as always for taking the time with us.",https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6_2e_wGpQzc,33,2022-10-13 16:15:33
3225," Something isn't inexpensive. It just costs less than it used to. All right. Wise words there. PepsiCo Vice Chairman and CFO Hugh Johnson. Hugh, thanks as always for taking the time with us. Thank you. Good to be with you guys. The majority of bosses won employees back in the office full time. The new survey from five are found that 52% of employers want their workers back in person five days a week. But 42% of workers say they would consider quitting if that were the case. Five or CEO Micah Kaufman joined us now. Five or by the way, a platform for freelance workers. Micah, it's good to see you. So there's obviously tension here, right? There is this ongoing tension in the market. How do you think it ends up resolving itself? Thanks for having me on the show again. We're definitely seeing a very polarized view between managers and employees. And I think that if there's something very clear is that managers want this to be 2019 again. And employees cannot move back from having the experience of the past two or three years. And wanting to have more flexibility into the work, I think that some of that is going to be resolved. But the fact that those employees are actually going to leave. And I think in order to receive that level of flexibility, a lot of them are actually going to turn into freelancing, which allows them to define the level of flexibility that they're looking for. Okay, so that kind of answers or begins to answer my next question at least. Which is where would they go if they if they did leave? There are still for a lot of the companies that are either in a hybrid or purely virtual reality for their workplace and collaboration. There's still some of the hiring freezes that are in place. Some places looking at cutting and trimming their staff. So where would the opportunities be to still retain that virtual lifestyle, even if going to or looking for other employment opportunities? That's correct. I think that a lot of companies, those who are freezing or rethinking the way they want to employ talent are really making a shift between fixed expenses and variable expenses. And when you think about variable expenses, a lot of it is being answered by free answers. So a lot of the talent that are going to continue looking for that level of flexibility are going to turn into freelancing. And we're seeing very high levels of talent coming to us to five or in similar platforms to look for that level of flexibility. So, Michael, does that mean a recession would mean just a hiring boom for freelancers? I think that at some point, yes. Because again, I think that more and more companies are thinking about the shift between fixed and variable expenses. So obviously that is going to fuel. If you go back to the wake of the previous recession right around 2009, we've saw a boom in freelancing. We saw a boom in new business formation. And a lot of these businesses cannot actually afford full-time employees. So they turn into platforms such as Fiverr to find the stun.",https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6_2e_wGpQzc,34,2022-10-13 16:19:34
3226," I'm saying we saw a boom in new business formation. And a lot of these businesses cannot actually afford full-time employees. So they turn into platforms such as Fiverr to find this talent. Mike, at this end, we've got now this proposal, although it's sort of vague on the part of the Biden administration to reclassify workers, which there's some thinking that it might eventually make some workers who are classified as freelance before us to come on the book's full-time. Any thoughts on that or the likelihood of that happening and the effect that that could have on your business? Yeah, I think that with the fact that freelancing is becoming a huge force in the workplace, statistics show that by the end of this decade, by 2030, 50% of talent is going to be engaging in freelancing in some form or the other. Policy makers are trying to figure out what to do with this huge cohort. And I think that in this space, we need to make a distinction between skilled and unskilled labor. So if you look at Fiverr as an example, on Fiverr, freelancers have total freedom regarding their work, what they offer when they offer it from where. So that level of freedom is something that is highly sought for, but it also comes with the price. I mean, you can't lead a totally free lifestyle and then expect to be considered to be a full-time employee. In other aspects of gig economy, maybe the situation is slightly different because they have less freedom on what they offer and how much they charge for it. This has been in the making for quite a long time and we're actually working close with policymakers to figure out how we can level the plain field for freelancers in aspects such as access to affordable medical insurance. But that's it, as I said, if you want to lead the lifestyle that allows you total freedom, you can't also expect to be considered as a full-time employee when you're not. Michael, just while we have you, over the past recessions where the gig economy roles have been available, we've seen this flow into some of the roles for freelancers or even just workers who are looking to take their own employment under their own control. For your business at Fiverr, given some of the investments that you've made into the business to try and unlock these larger projects, more engagement, what from the Fiverr perspective would you be looking towards to really navigate a recession as well yourself as a business? Yeah, so I think that a lot of businesses we've talked about fixed versus variable expenses, I think that a lot of businesses are actually focusing on identifying their core competencies and hiring full-time around those core competencies and looking for the more peripheral areas of expertise and turning into freelancers around those types of expertise. That could be if your core is technology, maybe something that is not in your core is going to be marketing or design in which cases they start to think about how to integrate freelancers into their workflows. This is why we've seen the appearance of the chief freelancer officer, which is a new role within companies, within HR, that thinks about how to integrate that level of talent into organizations. We're seeing that rising throughout the past few years and this is accelerating right now. Micah, good to see you. Thanks for being here. Micah Kaufman, who is Fiverr CEO. Appreciate it. Thank you.",https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6_2e_wGpQzc,35,2022-10-13 16:23:58
3227," you Chicago.ared ash. independent contractors to employees. Fox Advisors founder and CEO Steven Fox joins us now for some analysis on this. Steven, has this now been priced in any potential change that may come in the first half of next year? It isn't now fully priced into these stocks. You know, actually I think it's more than priced into this stock. I think regulatory concerns have been sort of the hand-ranging events since these companies were public. And what we've seen is that the companies have been able to manage through these events and actually continue to improve their business model. So I think it's being overdone at this point. Lift has said nothing is immediately going to change about its business model just yet. Of course, that's what the company would say. Given the fact that, yeah, there's still a lot of discussion that has to take place in the near term in order to see any type of reclassification go forward. But what extent should customers at the end of the day, if this does move forward, expect their prices, their fares to also have to be adjusted? Yeah, that's a great point because all the companies obviously could still raise prices to offset any higher costs. I think it's also important to keep in mind that what happens at the federal level is independent of what happens at the state level. So companies have been in discussions with various states. I think the most encouraging thing you saw without out of the state of Washington this year, which signed into law in an independent contractor plus agreement, which basically allows for some benefits, sort of this IC plus gives the driver's flexibility plus benefits and the companies are working to pass those costs through to customers and also reducing other costs tied to other pieces of the business to offset some higher costs as well. Steven, as we potentially go into a recession, what effect will that have on the sort of driver service dynamic? In other words, could there potentially be more people who are available to be drivers? Unfortunately, if they're a layoffs or, you know, does Dubra lift get away with paying them less? Like, how is, what are gonna be all those knock on effects? Yeah, I don't think Uber and lift get away with paying them less, especially in this political environment. And I don't think they're looking to pay them less. I think if you go back and look at what the companies have had done, forget about what they've said, but what they've done for their drivers specifically over the last couple of years, they've worked to make their expenses come down through various methods. They've also worked to make their time on the network much more efficient. Obviously, if they're sitting around waiting for a ride, it's not as efficient. So it's really important to step back and say, okay, in a weaker economy, how dependent it has, the consumer become on these rideshare opportunities, whether to drive or also to ride, and how do the network utilization rates look? On top of that, you know, the real on-tap market is still the enterprise. So large companies with multiple pockets of spending on transportation and food delivery, as they consolidate those things, those are real profitable opportunities for lift and uber that they can also translate into their drivers to make money. Right, a lot of focus on driver utilization to make it more incentivized in order for drivers to actually want to be on the platform and be able to take advantage of more rides. But then there's also the thought of if this goes through and that changes the classification, does that actually make it more intriguing for new drivers to sign up and increase the supply side of this broader kind of supply demand equation that ultimately has a major kind of, a major delta on prices here for consumers. Yeah, so one time has that much energy and substance.",https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6_2e_wGpQzc,36,2022-10-13 16:28:31
3228," broader kind of supply demand equation that ultimately has a major kind of a major delta on prices here for consumers. Yeah, so one of the interesting things that I think Wall Street doesn't appreciate enough is that when you talk about these networks, the companies aren't playing checkers, it's more like three-dimensional chess. So when you look at supply versus demand, like take the UK for instance where Uber is now providing benefits to the drivers while giving them flexibility, they're cost of going up, but then other costs have gone down in terms of actually providing, you know, looking at driver incentives for example, they don't have to provide as many. And so they're attracting probably more drivers now passing on some of the cost of the customers, but competition has followed. So you're getting a little bit of that network benefit I think. How it plays out in the US is going to be on a region by a region basis. But generally speaking, I think the companies have the way to manage through this and continue to march towards evict doggles where they've been set, like at Lyft and Uber. Thanks, advisors founder and CEO Stephen Fox. Early this week the Board of Directors officially approved XPO logistics plan separation of its freight brokerage business. The company also named a new CFO. I had the chance to speak to the company's current CEO and founder Brad Jacobs about the restructuring at the company. I'm here at the Greenwich Economic Forum with Brad Jacobs, the founder and CEO of XPO logistics, although not much longer. Brad is great to see you in person. And I say not much longer of course because the company is spinning off RxO which is logistics business, you just announced what that's effective on November 1st I believe. So talk to me about what's happening now, what the process feels like and what investors can expect from the two companies. It's very exciting. After 10 months of working really hard with large number of people working long hours, we're this close to the spin and we'll create two separate companies that will be an inch wide and a mile deep in what they do. And therefore they're likely to do it much better. So we'll have a pure play less than truck load business. That'll be XPO and we'll have a pure play non-asset truck brokerage business called RxO which is best in class truck broker. So it's very exciting. And you're not going to be running the day-to-day business any longer. That's correct. Do you have some plans yet for what the next thing, the next Brad Jacobs chapter is going to be yet? Well, I want to try to repeat what I've done before which is to have companies that over a 10-year period or so create at least 10 times return on the initial capital. And so I'm not a private equity firm in trying to make two or three X and let's not make any. I go for things that are 20X, 30X, the big ones. So I'm looking for that. I'm looking for the next big thing. And where any hints of what in what industry or where you think the opportunities are, because especially right now, it's tricky time, right? It's the best time to start a business when valuations are low and it's fear out there and there's not a lot of competition because a lot of people are nervous about not being courageous because they're nervous about what they're doing.",https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6_2e_wGpQzc,37,2022-10-13 16:32:39
3229," time, just start a business when valuations are low and it's fear out there and there's not a lot of competition because a lot of people are nervous about not being courageous because they're nervous about where the economy is going and so forth. That's when you want to get it. That's when you want to buy. When valuations are reasonable and there's not a lot of competition, but I don't know. I'm still gainfully employed at CEO for a few more weeks. Sorry to get you to, don't mean to get you to jump ahead too soon. But let's talk a little bit more about the environment. You and I were just talking before now about all of the negativity that we're hearing, right? From Redalio to Jamie Dimon, the IMF cutting, it's GDP forecast. Well, to the Jones and Holy. Yeah, all of it. I mean, you have a really good figure on the pulse of what's going on in the economy because of moving things around. So what do you see? So I don't always get it right. I often get it right, but not half a hundred percent of the time. My take is we're probably, so when you see all these really great minds, they'll come out and universally say, oh, it's really bad coming up. That's usually historically been the final pre-capitulation phase. So everyone agrees that, oh, it's really bad. And then you have the final plunge. That's the time to buy. When everybody says, oh, it's down this, it's going to keep going down more. That's the time to do it. So I'm really having my antennas up for it because I don't think, I don't think this downturn, which is likely to happen, is going to last for a long time. And there's, don't forget, there's two things. The economy and there's the market. Yes. And the market is usually a couple quarters ahead of the economy. Right. So we could see, so the capitulation you're talking about is the market. In the market. Yes. The economy might lag that. Yeah, economy could lag. Could as the straights go up as quantitative tightening gets tighter, you could see as a significant slowing in the economy. But the world has become such a small world and so well informed. And so many people understand economics now. It didn't turn the great financial crisis. I don't think it'll last long. I think there'll be such pressure to, okay, now we reduced inflation. Okay, now let's get some growth going again. I don't expect a long, long downturn. I expect a short, maybe significant downturn. Now, one of the things that was a detail in the latest jobs report made me think of you. And that had to do with trucker jobs, which fell by 11,000 in the month of September. And I'm just curious what that tells us. The number of truckers hired, I should say, fell by 11,000. Well, a metric that we watch very closely, Julie, is for every truck job, truck driver posting that we post, how many people apply for it? That's about 45% just in the last several months. So there's a lot more people coming back into the job market as the economy gets a little tougher. So there's the pendulum is swinging on that. Don't get me wrong. It's still very tough to hire truck drivers. It's a lot less tough than it was even a few months ago. The inventory climbs that we are seeing, by a lot of not just the retailers, but in other industries as well. How is that affecting your business and the loads of things that you guys are trucking around? Well, the transportation business does better. The industry is a whole when inventory is a low, not high. There's more restocking and there's more goods being moved. But what you see right now is really interesting. As a result of all the craziness of the pandemic, people got the wrong, they have a lot of inventory, but it's often the wrong inventory. They have too much of this and too little of that. So there's still a lot of activity. So goods are still flowing. Goods are still flowing, but not as much as more. Not as much. Yeah. But it's an interesting dichotomy. You observe the same thing I observed today at the Greenwich Economic Forum. It's pretty downbeat. It's pretty dire. People have their their warrior face design. When you talk to my echo chambers a little bit different, my echo chamber is CEOs of large companies, chief supply chain offices, large companies, entrepreneurs of small businesses who need their goods move. And they're not as negative. They're not as positive as they were say a year ago. They're less positive, but they're generally growing. They're not contracting. They're just growing less. All right, I have one final fun question for you. The Tesla semi. How much is that going to change the trucking industry? It depends on the price point. So we're a partner to one of the big OEMs for their electric vehicle, uh, semis. And actually we call them semi. The semi. The semi conductor. The semi conductor. And we call them semi. Sorry. No ring. Sorry. But the. The.",https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6_2e_wGpQzc,38,2022-10-13 16:37:14
3230," uh... semis and actually we call them semi-semis semi-semis semis and semis and semis and semis are no we don't but the the semis are they're beautiful and the truckers love them and they're slick and they're well-designed they accelerate fast and are safe and they've all kinds of gizmos in them but they're really expensive and so that the economics aren't there yet now if the economic if the technology advances in the manufacturing process advances such that they become cost effective yet very transformative make sense alright bad jake up so vexfield thank you so much it was great to see you in person really appreciate it thanks so it was fun there because brad was sort of an antidote to a lot of the darkness i mean he you know he's not saying everything is wonkydorian fantastic but part of it is the force of his personality part of it is what he's seen on the ground he he was a little bit of a counterbalance to some of the worst case scenarios that we're hearing out there you say tomato i say tomato yeah i think that's it's interesting to what he said though about the uh... the tesla uh... semi truck it's going to be fascinating when those trucks eventually hit the road because at some point it sets a stage for driverless semi trucks in this country yes but as he said the price has to come down to make sense which makes sense right also critical time for the business given the spin-off that's moving forward and drew wilkerson is going to be the new CEO of that spin-off and he had even in this most recent earnings period talked about how the company has a long track record of growing gross profit even through economic cycles and they're confident right now they're going to continue to do that i for one can't wait to see what brad is going to next the next thing he's going to tackle it's tough to see him leave this industry he is this industry that you podcast. We'll quick check on the commodity space right now and looking specifically at oil. We are seeing both WTI crude and Brent crude to the downside. WTI down about more than 2% Brent crude down about 1.9 there. For more on the commodity space, let's bring in Suki Cooper, a stand chart executive director and precious metals analyst. Suki, good to talk to you. You've specifically been looking at gold right now. Sort of what has traditionally been more of a safe haven play, but it sounds like you think there's more downside to comp. Gold has really been caught in the headwinds of the strength of the dollar and the scope for further rate hikes. And while we think that the Fed is not done with its rate hikes, I think there's another 75 basis points that's likely to come in an November meeting and another further 50 basis points in December, we think these are going to present strong headwinds for the gold market. But we do think that the downside is quite well supported. We're seeing quite a good price elastic response in terms of demand from India and China. And there's still that concern around the session risk and perhaps the need for flight to safety that is buffering some of the downside for gold. But we do think that there's more downside risk to come as the year comes to an end and into 2023. We see gold prices heading further towards 1600 towards the end of next year. So 1600, we're at 1675 right now. Is 1600 the support level you're talking about? The case pool.",https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6_2e_wGpQzc,39,2022-10-13 16:41:24
3231," the toward 1600 towards the end of next year. So 1600 we're at 1675 right now, a 1600 the support level you're talking about? The key support that's coming up next is around 1650. So this is a level that we've seen physical demand materialising and now we're entering a period where we tend to see seasonal demand from India, Diwali falls in the 24th this month, we have the wedding season as well. And we've seen in markets like China, the physical premium earlier last month's long to levels that we last saw in 2015. So that price drop that we initially saw below 1700 was greeted by quite strong physical interest in the gold market. So the next level to look at from here will be 1650 and then beyond that is 1600. If we breach those two levels, then we're really looking to the cost of production on where that provides a guideline and for the gold market. And we tend to see in a longer and basis and here I'm looking at around about 40 years that gold prices tend to trade a third above the average cost of production. And that guideline suggests to us around 1550 to 1600 is where that floor from the production side should materialise. So much of the price moves as you point out really driven by the stronger dollar and we have seen it climb up again today looking at something like the Japanese yen well above or below depending on how you look at it, those intervention levels. I mean how much higher do you think the green bag goes as you track those metals and moving in tandem? It's really pivotal for the communist complex as a whole. The dollar strength has been a headwind for not just gold but for silver, platinum and playdium. It's really damp and that upside risk. We think that there's likely that we may see further dollar strength and perhaps we'll see something of a stabilization coming in the first part of next year and that's really when we might see some of that pressure on gold prices starting to ease. But if we look at the correlations for the gold markets, its strongest consistent relationships since the start of this year has been with the US dollar. That correlations jump in above 60% at the moment but last year that relationship had started to pivot towards real yields and nominal yields. That relationship still matters for gold. It's in close second but at the moment it's the strength of the dollar that's proven to be a key headwind. Now it's not to say that gold can't rise if we see dollar strength. If both dollar and gold are benefiting from safe haven demand, we can see them both rally. But in the current environment, it's the concerns around slowing demand over the longer term but there's also concerns around higher rates that's really weighing on gold and it's not benefiting from safe haven demand at the moment. So bottom line Tsukiya, you should investors be putting their money here or is there a better value in the precious metals space? If we look at the entire complex on a longer term basis, the industry bias precious metals fundamentals are set to tighten. If we look at markets like Plastinum and Pladium, we think that towards the end of this year we're going to see much tighter markets. As the auto markets start to recover, we were anticipating at the start of this year a rebound around about 11% in global auto production but we've scaled back our expectations closer to 7%. But into 2023 we're still expecting the double-digit rebounds in terms of global auto production and PGMs are critical in terms of growth that we see in the auto industry. So those are two markets where we expect in more off-sider risk towards the end of this year but on a longer term horizon, perhaps silver is the metal where we might see more off-sider risk and given the demand from the solar energy given the electrification of vehicles, this is strong growth that we're likely to see but that demand is like to take two to three years to materialize. So over the longer-run silver has positive prospects but in over the next few months we think there's more upside risk for Plastinum and Pladium at least in the short term. Sookie Cooper, Stan Chard, Executive Director and Precious Metals, analysts, good to have you on today. Thank you.",https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6_2e_wGpQzc,40,2022-10-13 16:45:49
3232," you We're taking with the ESG investing theme here a new study by PwC found that nearly nine and ten institutional investors believe that asset managers should be more proactive in developing new ESG products but fewer than half of asset managers were planning to launch new ESG funds. So what's an investor to do? Joining us now is Bruce Usher a Columbia Business School professor an author of the new book investing in the era of climate change and Bruce you've been arguing that despite the economic backdrop this is kind of the time to be investing in some of these green names. Walk me through that thesis. It's really about the macro trends climate change. We know climate signs. We know that after 300 years of building a global economy that's putting emissions into the atmosphere. We've got 30 years to decarbonize to avoid catastrophic climate change. So you've got consumers pushing to buy more sustainable goods. You've got employees saying they want to work for sustainable companies. You now have investors looking at those trends. Company leaders saying we need to meet those trends. You have government action like the global risks of climate change manifesting themselves. More violent storms, heat waves. So all these macro trends are all pushing the same direction. They're going to be with us for decades to come. How do you break that down though for investors who are looking at this and saying well okay there's questions about yes she funds and we'll get into that in just a bit. But in terms of the names there's you know EVs which some would argue that that's actually not a long term play in terms of impact on climate change. So when I looked at this sector 20 years ago, how long I've been in it. The big challenge then was there was nothing to invest in. If you look at the whole solar power market everything globally does less solar than one coal plant. Last year the investment solar more than 100 coal plants worth and gaining. So the big picture here is that the opportunity to invest is now trillion dollar sectors. We've got the EV sector. All the automakers are going EVs. The key question is why? The reason is that those products are better than the incumbent product there's other before. So you look at EVs specifically suggest that why the EV sales so good because consumers love them. Consumers prefer EV products that flying out the showrooms in fact the car makers can't keep up with them. They prefer the products but it's still a very small portion right we're talking roughly what 5%? What 5%? But now analysis has shown that around 5% you get a tipping point in these markets. And that's what the automakers are seeing. You have to ask why they all rush into this market. What they see is 5 years ahead. When they're planning new cars they're looking 5 years in the future that's how long it takes to roll it in a model. And what they see is an all-the-evee future because it's a better product, consumers like it and then we have these trends around climate change. So that's what's really pushing that and that's what's creating the investment opportunities. When consumers and businesses go in this direction the market opens up to investors. We have seen incredible amount of inflows into ESG funds over the last few years. A bit of a reckoning so we'll argue that's happening right now not just this being politicized but you've also got those like Deutsche Bank some other names who are now being called out for greenwashing the funds that the names that were included in these funds were not necessarily sort of green so to speak. What do you think? I mean what do you think is happening here? How does this manifest itself from an investor perspective? Those who've been putting money behind these saying they were anticipating some impact coming from these funds well turns out that's not actually what ESG investing is. That's correct, exactly. And there's a real misunderstanding around ESG. ESG investing is really very simple. It's saying look when I look at potentially investing in assets I look at financial numbers, I look at management, I look at all these things and then also to be a smarter investor what else could this investment at risk?",https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6_2e_wGpQzc,41,2022-10-13 16:50:06
3233," It's saying, look, when I look at potentially investing in assets, I look at financial numbers, I look at management, I look at all these things. And then also, to be a smarter investor, what else could put this investment at risk? What else could change the outcomes? Look at risks like flooding or hurricanes or wildfires. How could that affect my investment? If you wouldn't go out by a house, a second home on the coast, would you want to know if it's going to flood? Would you want to know that? That'd be a smart thing to know. That's what ESG investing is. It can make you a better business manager. It can make you a better investor. The challenge, though, is it doesn't really address climate change. Just because you're deciding on a walk away from that house, I'm going to pay less for it because it's at flood risk, that doesn't reduce the risk of flooding. That's the challenge. So how do you invest from an impact standpoint? So from impact standpoint, it's much more important that you go beyond ESG investing. And there's really two strategies that I write about my book. One is what we call thematic. So pick a theme that you're excited about your comfort with. If you're really interested in renewable energy, invest in the solar or wind fund. There's plenty of those out there. That's a way to really channel money into a solution. Or if you're interested in EVs, into IBV company stocks, or funds, those are thematic funds. There's also now new funds coming out in green hydrogen, other leading technologies. So you can have a thematic focus, equity, debt, venture capital, as you wish. Or you can have what we call impact first focus. So this is very special in the sense that it's really only for high net worth investors. Impact first is not falling if I do share responsibility. It's saying, I really want to dress climate change. I'm going to put my capital into that. I might get a return. The return might be decades from now. But it's going to have great impact. And that's where you're really investing in technologies. Aren't you commercial? This goes well beyond say solar and EVs. This is some new technologies like direct air capture, for example. And really quickly, what about green bonds? So green bonds are issued by companies because they see these trends coming. They see these sustainability trends, consumers want it, investors want it. It's again thinking about how is how is they will be carbonizing and what does that mean for my business. The green bond makes perfect sense. But again, a green bond is not going to have tremendous impact on the environment. It's just a very sensible investment. Okay. Good to differentiate those two. Bruce Astro, Columbia Business School professor and author of the book, Investing in the era of climate change. Thanks for joining us today. Thank you. All right. Let's take a look at United shares up just around one and a half percent. Who does this work? Hong Kong waxes. Good afternoon. That was my welcome. I look forward to it But I'm still have other about30 to 30. New velocity. lifting its third quarter guidance. It looks like demand is very strong amongst the airlines. What's your assessment? Yeah, thanks for having me. So a couple of things. Number one, yes, you're right, demand, especially for international is very strong. We've seen a shift in mix in the last couple of months from domestic leisure to international and mostly international leisure.",https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6_2e_wGpQzc,42,2022-10-13 16:54:42
3234," National is very strong. We've seen a shift in mix in the last couple of months from domestic leisure to international and mostly international leisure. And I think that's somewhat behind the United decision to add more leisure international destinations for next summer. We did a preview on Friday for the earnings season and we said we thought American Delta United had the best opportunity for positive surprise because we've gone from the first say four months of the year when we saw international down something around 60 percent, 50 to 60 percent from 2019 levels and now we're down closer to 15, 155 percent. So you've seen that big increase as markets have opened up. People have shifted and started flying further, especially Transatlantic, not so much Trans-Pacific but Transatlantic. And business we've gone from being down about 40 or 50 percent earlier in the year to being down 25 percent earlier in the year. So I think those two elements and we've still seen strong domestic leisure but instead of being up 30, 35 percent, it's up closer to 10 percent, 15 percent. So you've seen that mix shift which has huge positive implications for revenue and I think the Delta reports tomorrow first, you just mentioned that and I think you'll you'll hear them talk about that for the rest of the quarter and or the rest of the current quarter, yeah, fourth quarter. And I know obviously the industry still dealing with some of these staffing shortages as well. How is this affecting some of the more profitable routes for these airlines? I'm sorry, I missed the first half. They're doing more of these what as well. As we're still seeing some issues when it comes to things like labor shortages and we continue to see some of these kinks getting worked out. How is this affecting some of the most profitable routes? Yeah, so we're having these issues with to your point with respect to infrastructure. So it's not just labor, it's air traffic control, it's airport infrastructure. I don't know when you flew last but I was at airport, so it was to airport yesterday and the day before and stores are closed, they haven't reopened, they can't find people. And we're seeing a lot of that and and so that's going to inform growth for for 2023 and probably 2024. And not only that, you didn't specifically ask about this but the OEMs are behind on deliveries so their airlines don't have the and they don't know when they're getting the aircraft. So from an airline perspective, it's really hard for network planning to think about where they're going to grow and where these aircraft are going to go and not knowing whether you're even going to have the aircraft. United is in a really unique position because they didn't retire a lot, they didn't retire any as a matter of fact of their wide body aircraft during the pandemic. So they are in a really great position to be able to shift capacity around their network and grow into some of these domestic leisure markets. That's part of why we have United rated and outperform and the others retire their aircraft and in part they were older so it made sense to retire them but they're having issues because the OEMs are behind on deliveries or having issues getting our aircraft to be able to grow, grow going going forward. So we think we'll probably talk a lot about that too. Yeah, Holly, you mentioned the supply chain issues, the volatile jet fuel prices, difficulty hiring and retaining employees. A lot of this focus is going to be on how exactly these airlines are going to rain in costs at this time. What do you want to hear? What do you expect to hear over the coming weeks? Yeah, so the first thing I'd love to hear from them is labor contracts. Every, the big four airlines have open pilot contracts. American has an open flight to tenant contract. I would love to hear them talk about there. They probably won't because they don't like to talk about open labor contracts on earnings calls, but I would love it if they could give us some confidence that maybe by next summer a lot of these contracts would be negotiated and ratified. That would be great both from an investor perspective.",https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6_2e_wGpQzc,43,2022-10-13 16:58:39
3235," give us some confidence that maybe by next summer a lot of these contracts would be negotiated and ratified. That would be great both from an investor perspective and from an employee perspective. I think it would be nice. If the pilots, the flight attendants knew what they were going to be earning and I think that would be good to get that resolved. We also, as you mentioned earlier, we need to attract people to the profession. I mean, we can't just do it overnight. We need to start with young people, younger people. But yes, I'd love to hear that. I think we're going to hear a lot of discussion about their loyalty programs. The number one credit card that everybody has that Americans mostly have, anyway, is a cashback card and then that's usually followed by a gas card. But if you live in a hub city, you probably have an airline card and your spend is probably high and you, but it takes a while to earn a free ticket or an upgrade. So the airlines like having that dollar today because it's not going to be redeemed for months yet and it definitely helps. But if there's the shift in mix to more leisure-oriented travel from business and corporate travel, that's going to inform the way the airlines think about loyalty going forward. So I'd love to hear them talk a little bit about that. Demand for the holiday season. I'm starting to hear from people that fairs are getting a little out of control and so they're driving versus flying. I feel like everybody goes home for Christmas, but not everybody goes home for Thanksgiving. And in my investor calls lately, I've been hearing people echoing that and saying, we're driving this year for Thanksgiving or we're doing Thanksgiving at our house this year. We're not going. We have to buy four tickets, five tickets, whatever. It's just gone really aggressive. Especially given how far fairs have come in the last, say, 18 months because obviously in the worst part of the pandemic, the airlines were discounting and in the last six or nine months, they've been raising fairs pretty aggressively in part to cover higher costs. But in part to discourage some demand. But yeah, flights are full. They're like 90 percent. Well, they're more there. They're almost always going out with very few free available seats. Certainly airlines and flyers as well, having to be more strategic at the moment. A big thank you to Helena and Becca for joining us this afternoon. Thank you. In this episode of Influencers, Marty Walsh, US Secretary of Labor. The biggest question we have is getting people back to work in the labor market. I mean, lots of jobs still open in the country. So we have some work to do here at the Department of Labor. It's no secret. I'm a union guy. I have a union book in my pocket, but I represent all workers in America. What's happening is we're still living in COVID. We're still living in the pandemic and the pandemic's not gone. So they're still fear out. Hello, everyone. Welcome to Influencers. I'm Andy Sirware and welcome to our guest, US Labor Secretary Martin Walsh. We're here in front of the Labor Department in Washington, DC. Thank you very much for having us, Secretary Walsh. Thanks for having me today on this nice cool day in Washington. It is a bit brisk, but you're used to that being from Boston, right? Yeah, not too bad. Yeah, it's a lot colder in Boston today. That's right. So I want to jump right in and ask you about the labor market. Jobs report the other day a little bit weaker than expected in terms of creation, but the unemployment rate below 4%. That's good news. But I want to ask you what you're most concerned about when it comes to the labor market in the United States right now? Well, I think obviously the biggest question we have is getting people back to work in the labor market. I mean, lots of jobs still open in the country. So we have some work to do here at the Department of Labor and in working about retraining workers in new skills, for new opportunities that they left their previous job for. They haven't gone back to a job. I think that that's one thing that we have to do a better job of. And that meaning by that when I say better jobs, such as the federal government's working with states.",https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6_2e_wGpQzc,44,2022-10-13 17:03:05
3236," They left their previous job for they haven't gone back to a job. I think that that's one thing that we have to do a better job of. And that meaning by that when I say a better job, it's not just the federal government's working with states and cities to create opportunities. You know, I'm a former mayor so we did a lot of job training in the city of Boston. And I did a lot of work of attracting new companies to Boston because we had workforce there that could do the job. So I think we're in a very different situation right now. This isn't about attracting new companies and filling those jobs. This is about filling jobs that remain open. So 2022, that's going to be, we've done in 2021, 2022, the present has tasked us with that priority of making sure that we get as much job training out there that's going to get real impact and get people back to work. What about black Americans, though, Secretary Walsh? The numbers were a little bit weaker there for that particular group. Is that a concern for you? Yeah, we have to be a lot more intentional when it comes to black Americans. Historically, the unemployment rate for black Americans is often double out of white Americans. But if you dive, you have in deeper and some of the jobs that black Americans have, you know, high paying jobs. So we have to create better pathways. And I think that we have to do, you know, myself and I've been partnering with Secretary Gidona from Education and Secretary Mondo from Commerce and working to how do we create better pathways, whether it's out of high school, into community college, college, working with businesses, working with labor, moving forward. So we have to do, we have to be more intentional about our work there. Some places have done a really good job of it down in Atlanta. I've done some good work on it. But there's not enough of those stories around America yet. Another area just to dive in a little bit into the market is restaurants leisure and that sector of the economy, which has just been whipsawed, obviously, by COVID, are the steps you can take there? Well, it's a little different. I mean, we did see some of the largest gains in employment in those areas, but there's still a lot of openings in those areas. And I think that the issue of restwares restaurants have, it goes a lot deeper than just hiring. It goes with the COVID implications with shutting down, having to go to take out, having a remote, having to build barriers in their restaurants. So, you know, again, a lot of restaurants have done, people have said to me in the beginning of the pandemic when I started this job here at Secretary Labour, that the unemployment benefit was keeping people from going to work. And quite honestly, when the unemployment benefit expired, people still didn't go back in some of those industries. So again, I think those industries are reimagining how do they hire people, how do they get more people engaged in coming into work in those places. And I do feel that they will come back. The pandemic, you know, we have these conversations all day long about, what do you think is going on in the economy? What's happening? What's happening is we're still living in COVID. We're still living in the pandemic. And the pandemic's not gone. So, there's still fear out there. There's still lack of child care out there. There's still concern about people going working with the public. So, all those challenges we move forward here, as we get more people vaccinated, and we do a better job of testing, I think more people feel comfortable going back to work. Another faster the economy that has caught a lot of people's attention lately is inflation. And we just saw that record number come out, or 40 year high, I should say, 7% the other day. And I'm wondering how that's impacting the labor market. Well, certainly when you think about that number that came out the other day, it's not something that I want to talk about. We want to see it go the other way and see more people going to work. But I think we have to look at it through the lens of the whole picture. And we look at what's happened in 2021 with President Biden after he took over, putting out the vaccines getting Americans vaccinated. 81% of the think of all adults are vaccinated out in our country. 6.2 million new jobs, 3.9% unemployment number, 84% of the industries that were affected by the pandemic, people gone back to work, we're seeing lows in highs in job creation and lows in unemployment benefit, so the other biggest decreases. So those are all positive signs. And then we also have to do some more work. We have to make sure we continue through President Biden's economic plan to work on the issues of lowering inflation, bringing forward the experts and the economists saying by the end of the year, we'll see that number tactical the other way, which is a good sign, but that doesn't help anyone today. So President is making sure that the impact he has is going to have a big impact at the kitchen table. And you mentioned the vaccines and I want to talk about vaccine mandate of course and ask you about enforcement, obviously still in front of the Supreme Court. But where do things stand in terms of administration forcing that with the companies right now? Well, I don't think you have to force a company. I think most companies have stepped up, but it is, ultimately it's going to be the responsibility of employers making sure their employees are safe, making sure that the workplace is safe.",https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6_2e_wGpQzc,45,2022-10-13 17:07:45
3237," I don't think you have the force of companies. I think most companies have stepped up, but it is, ultimately, it's going to be the responsibility of employers making sure their employees are safe, making sure that the workplace is safe, making sure they have the proper PPE and social distancing, if you will, inside their establishments, a little trickier when it comes to production lines and things like that where people are working close, tight quarters. But I think at the end of the day, regardless, in favor of the Department of Labor, medical experts have said that this is the right thing to do. People have said this is the right way to go. We should be doing this. Many companies support us, but even with or without what the ETS says, it's still the responsibility to work with employers to make sure that workplace are safe for their workers. Do you have a plan if the Supreme Court strikes it down? The plan is that we're going to be asking employers to continue to make sure that workplace are safe. We're doing that before. I think that I've spent the last couple of weeks here talking to some of the largest employers in the country. We talked about vaccine programs they have. All of these companies have programs set up in them already. They've already thought about this. They've thought about this from probably mid-2020 to today to make sure they create a safe space for their employees. Number one, to keep them safe. But also number two, to create an environment that people want to come back to work. Secretary Walsh, aren't there problems with enforcement given the shortages of test kits? And what is the administration doing there to make that happen? Well, obviously there's issues around right now and supply getting more test kits made. And the ETS, if it's passed or within the effect now, but if the Supreme Court rules in favor of the Department of Labor, the testing is going to be for those that are unvaccinated. So that's a lot smaller number than people that are vaccinated. I want to shift gears and ask about some labor and negotiations and strikes around the country. In March, there was a union drive at an Amazon warehouse in Alabama and President Biden called for no intimidation. The federal agency has found that Amazon did legally intimidate workers during the union driver. You disappointed that Amazon defied the president's words? Well, there's going to be another vote there. I don't know if the data's set yet, but I saw that the other day. There's going to be another vote there in that. So there'll be an opportunity for the employees to see if they want to unionize there. Certainly the president's feeling, my feeling is everyone has the right to organize. And they should be able to organize without any interference. And I think that that's for any company in America. Same with Starbucks. There's a lot more unionization going on with those stores. Is that surprised you? Not really. You know, when you look at the numbers, what's surprising is the polling number is 70% of millennials feel they look very favorably upon unions. And when I say surprise, I'm happy to see that. I grew up in a labor family and as a kid, you know, not everyone had the same feeling. And my family, my father and myself, my uncle, and my brother and cousins who felt that way. So it's good to see that there is definitely an interest in unionization again. Union's bring opportunities for people in this country that otherwise wouldn't have the power of cut to bargaining, the power of fighting for raising their wages, the power of pensions, the power of other people. And the power of other kind of pension plans for one case. So I think that there's opportunities here for us to rebuild the middle class by that. And certainly I support collective bargaining and I support unionization. But I also support it being done the right way. So if people want to organize, they should be able to organize. And if people choose not to organize, they should have that right as well. Thank you. Thank you.",https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6_2e_wGpQzc,46,2022-10-13 17:11:46

3239," a post office. You used to be a well sought after job. I think it still is. I mean good benefits and things like that. But again, I think that this pandemic, you know, I think we all, I don't know if happened to you, happened to me. We had an opportunity to have a lot of downtime thinking about, you know, I was the mayor of Boston when it began. And you know, I went to work every day, but I'd be home at five o'clock that never happens as mayor. And you'd have a lot of time to think about where you are in society, where you are in your job. And people took that time and had a lot of good quality, family time, saying wait a second, I want something different. Let me ask you about Proposition 22 in California, which is a really interesting and critical issue about gig workers and whether or not their employees. Where do things stand with that? You know, what we're focused on here is on misclassification of employees right now, looking at who's being misclassified and the severity of misclassification. When people are misclassified, they lose out on wages, they lose on the benefits, they lose on the protections, they lose out on a whole bunch of different things. And, you know, some of those misclassification that we look at, people like dishwashers, everyone thinks of Uber and Lyft as gig working, but some of it's also misclassification of dishwashers in restaurants. So, you know, we're working through a process here and we're looking at making sure that workers have their rights, that the rights that are owed to them. In October, you visited Striking Kellogg's workers. And I'm wondering, how do you make the decision when to visit Striking Workers or not? Well, I can't visit every strike in place in the country, but generally when I go there, if I go to a strike, it's to support workers, but it's also to create and open to a pathway. I'm willing to step into any negotiation, leaving negotiation that's needed in this country to solve it. If workers are on the street striking, that means that the problem, that's a problem for the company, it's a problem for the workers. The workers make any money and the company is not producing whatever they produce. So I think that when you get to a strike, it's too late. So I think it's important for us to continue the dialogue, stay at the table, even if it's hard feelings, employers and employees should stay at the table and get those negotiations done. My time as Mayor Boston, I intervened on several strikes that were successful. My time as Secretary of Labor, I've intervened on several strikes that have been ended in a good way. So I do feel that we need to keep those conversations dialogues going. The build back, better build appears to be dead at this point and Senator Manchin has effectively blocked it. I think it's fair to say there are some labor provisions in that bill. Does that strike you that Senator Manchin is anti-labor, therefore? I wouldn't say it's dead. I would say that it might be on pause a bit, I hope. No, I would not say Senator Manchin's anti-labor. I've had many conversations with the Senator. Certainly he represents the people in the state in West Virginia, the miners in particular, their union eyes that he represents them very tough, very strongly. But I think that there is hopefully dialogue will continue as we get into the new year, a little further into the new year. And there are some great provisions in the build back, better build that I'd love to see come into existence. Pre-Candygaden, childcare, adult care, job training money, all of those are important for our economy moving forward. It also looks difficult to get that $15 minimum wage law passed. I saw that Kroger was paying $25 an hour up in the Midwest, had a job opening there. What are the chances that I'd ever had? I can't understand why somebody is against a $15 minimum wage, a baseline minimum wage for families. It just doesn't make any sense to me. People use the excuse, well it's going to hurt business. It doesn't hurt business. Look at the states where the minimum wage is $15 an hour or look at the companies that have raised their minimum wage to $15 sometimes $25, $18. Those companies are raising their wages because they're doing great. They're not raising their wages because they're going out of business. So in states aren't going out of business and losing business because of that. So I don't quite understand why we don't have a $15 now, a federal minimum wage right now in our country. The Department of Labor did raise the minimum wage for federal employees this year, going into effect January 1st and I think we'll see some benefits of that, at least for families. You talked earlier, I think to us as a matter of fact, about modernizing unemployment insurance in this country. And I'm wondering where things stand with that effort. Is that something you'd still like to pursue? Oh, we're doing it right now. We have the Mornization Office here at the Department of Labor.",https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6_2e_wGpQzc,48,2022-10-13 17:20:42
3240," in this country. And I'm wondering where things stand with that effort. Is that something you'd still like to pursue? Oh, we're doing it right now. We have the modernization office here at the Department of Labor in the UI system. We got a $2 billion investment from the American Rescue Plan. We're working on getting grants out to cities and towns, not cities, out to towns, states across the country, very encouraged by both Democratic and Republican-led states, are very engaged with the Department of Labor in modernizing their system. Speaking of states around the country, I think you visited 30 last year. 60 cities, 30 states. What did you learn? Why do you want to do this and what did you learn? Well, I learned that the challenges that American workers have are in every state in this country. I found that it's been great going around to the states because I come from Massachusetts, I come from the Northeast, and anyone that knows us, we pretty much stay where we are. But I've had a chance to go all over the country down to Memphis, and out to California, and to Alabama, in different places. And it's great to talk to people. What I do know, the biggest thing I've seen, and I wouldn't say this is great, but the challenge and struggles people have in America, whether it's around child care or any good wages, that's a big problem in our country. One thing people have criticized workers for, if you will, is that they are not moving as much as Americans used to. I don't know whether that's the case or not, but I've heard it anecdotally. In other words, people are sort of stuck in towns that may be depressed, and they should move to places where there's more job creation. Do you think that's true or...? That's the first I've heard of it, but I definitely think that we should be making investments in those towns that are depressed and bring more jobs to those areas. And I think that's the responsibility of government to do that, to create more opportunities for people in the cities and towns so they can build their towns up. Rather than people exit cities and towns, try and create opportunities in the cities and towns. Secretary, I want to ask some questions about you personally, and growing up, and back in Boston, which you talked about. When you were a young child, you had a battle with cancer, and I'm wondering how that informed you in your life, and you're thinking about things. Yeah, when I was seven, I was diagnosed with Burkutslum Pharma, which is a form of childhood cancer. I dealt with it. I got it in 1974, so the prognosis back then was not as good as it is today, thank God, with medicine. But as a child, it didn't inform you, but as I got older, I realized that what my family went through, and what I went through, made me think a little differently about how I govern, how I lead, and really thinking about making sure opportunities. So, for example, in Massachusetts, I was proud to vote for universal health insurance in Massachusetts. We did it before Obamacare, and it was a good vote because I knew that there were thousands of families in Massachusetts, like the same place my family was in 1974, that didn't have a lot of money and resources, but create an opportunity for families today to have health care. You followed your father into the union, and I'm wondering what you talked about, but I'm wondering, what did you take away from that? What did you get out of that? And what drew you to that, actually, besides just your dad? Well, first and foremost, I shouldn't have dropped out of college to go on the, and my father was dead against it, but I did drop out. And what I learned was the ability for hard work and what it means, and understanding that, you know, I'm fortunate in my life, the opportunities I've had in my life, and my father went to work every day, and millions of people at my father went to work every day, and got dirty and came home. It was able to support a family, raise a family, put food on the table. My father was able to live with dignity when he retired because he had a pension. My father was able to die with dignity because he knew that his pension would be able to go to my mother when he died. So that union gave my family the opportunity from the time he came off the plane in Ireland when he joined the union to the day that he passed away, and my mother still has that same pension my father had. What's the biggest difference between being the mayor of Boston and the U.S. Labor Secretary? Oh, when you're the mayor of the boss, you know, President Biden is my boss, and I'm going to President Biden is my boss. I work with the guys over there, and ladies over there should say, no, it's a little different. It's an executive role being mayor, and it's executive slash policy role being Secretary of Labor. And obviously the geographic reach of the Secretary of Labor's job is 50 states and also territories in our country. And also we also have international labor.",https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6_2e_wGpQzc,49,2022-10-13 17:24:57

3242," you What about partisan politics here in Washington Secretary Walsh? Is it different than from Boston and how have you been able to deal with that? Completely different than when I was in the Massachusetts House Represents. You know, many of the Republicans in the House were friends of mine. And you know, you might have an argument debate on the floor, but when you walked out the door, it wasn't personal. And I think the partisan stuff here in Washington is a little too much. And I think the American people are being turned off by it. I think that we have to realize that whether you're a Democrat or a Republican or an Independent, you represent people. And you represent all the people in the district, they're not just the... I'm a Democrat. That doesn't mean that Secretary Labor, I represent just Democrats. I represent everyone in America who is looking for anything from the Department of Labor. That's what I do. And I think we have to think about that more in the country. All right. Speaking of Massachusetts, I have to ask you, it's been reported you've considered running for governor of Massachusetts. Anything to that? Yeah, I haven't considered anything. You know, I am the Secretary of Labor. You know, I got a call from my governor, Chai Baker, who I had a very good relationship when I was the mayor of Boston. He's retiring. I congratulate him on his retirement. And I'm focused on my job as Secretary of Labor. Final question, Secretary. What do you consider what would you like to have as your legacy? Oh, God. Honestly, I'm not a big legacy guy. I want to make sure that people I work with every day that their legacy is strong, honestly. And I'd like to see the Patriots win about six more Super Bowls. That actually is probably going to be very difficult right now. They're not looking that bad. We'll see. We'll see. They're not bad right now. Mac Jones is okay. He's looking quite of back. He's only a rookie. More in the playoffs. That's all that matters. Right. All right. U.S. Labor Secretary Martin Walsh. Thank you so much for your time. Thanks for having me today.

3243," It is Thursday, October 13th here in New York City on Brad Smith. Jes goes out there with made v winter, sl Weftkami,ris District everyone sunk into тол November灶 A measbolts of 2002. All of this, of course, goes back to the Fed raising interest rates and also has already had ripple effects throughout the housing market, putting pressure on pricing, putting pressure on demand and affordability. We've been watching these mortgage numbers very, very closely because obviously they have really ratcheted up the monthly cost for people who are taking out a 30-year mortgage in order to buy a house. So we've got that number, we've got that CPI number. All of it pointing to continued inflation at least for now. But now we're joined by someone who has has her eyes on potential deflation. That, of course, is Kathy Wood, our our our confessed founder and CEO and you recently wrote an open letter to the Fed where you warned about deflation. We talked to Michael Darda of MKM at the top of the show where he said the Fed is making the mistake of looking at backward looking indicators. What should the Fed be looking at Kathy when it's trying to really assess what is happening with inflation? Sure, hi Julie, and Brian. Well, if you look at what's happening in the pipeline, what you're seeing in terms of commodity prices are some very serious declines both from their peaks and year over year now. So that is sort of we would say that's upstream inflation that is heading towards the PPI and then ultimately the CPI. So we've got gold prices and in fact, I looked at them yesterday. I had thought that the last two years gold had been trading within the a 1700 to nearly $2,100 range and that's true it has and it has broken down. This is a really good leading indicator of inflation. What caught my surprise yesterday was looking at where gold was in 2011. It was roughly this level. So you can say since 2011 more than 10 years, we haven't had a big burst in a big breakout in the gold price and that is informing our decision here. Gold is a leading indicator of inflation and it has not broken out. It is breaking down. And then the second thing that we're looking at is the inventory glucked around the world and especially in the United States. It looks like some of the best supply chain managed companies in the world have overordered. They ignored their automated enterprise resource planning system so ERP systems and double ordered, triple ordered so that Nike for example, its sales were up only 3.5 percent globally last quarter and yet its inventory was up 44 percent and in the United States there were up 68 percent and if you look at it in transit, there are up 85 percent. So that's just one indication. We're seeing lots of inventory overhangs and even online sales are suffering. Amazon just had its second prime day and it showed no increase which is really from a year over year which is telling us that either units are down or prices are down. So I think the CPI that we got today is",https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6_2e_wGpQzc,52,2022-10-13 17:37:41
3244," over year, which is telling us that either units are down or prices are down. So I think the CEPI that we got today is a lagging indicator. It always is a lagging indicator. And we're seeing a lot of prices in the pipeline that are falling. So Kathy, let's talk about what this means for the Fed and your open letter to the Fed, where you urge them to consider some of what you're talking about right now. The market after today's data is now more fully pricing and not just a 75 basis point increase at this upcoming meeting, but at the one after that as well. Do you think the Fed should be done? Do you think they should even raise 75 basis points at this upcoming meeting? Or do you think they should stop here and give some time for their increases to make their way through the economy? Yes, as we're thinking about this question, we compare what Chairman Powell is doing to what Chairman Volker did in the late 70s, early 80s, when he was fighting an inflation problem that had been building for 15 years, Vietnam War, great society closing the gold window. That was a real inflation problem that built up over 15 years. This inflation problem has been 12 to 15 months by the time the Fed started addressing it, and we think it's much more a function of supply chain imbalances caused by COVID, and then again by Russia's invasion of Ukraine. These are very, very different circumstances. So what the Fed has done this time around is it has increased interest rates. If they go another 75 basis points, which is very likely on November 2nd, they will have increased interest rates from 0.25 to 4%, and that's a 16 fold increase. What did Volker do in the early 80s? He took interest rates from 10 to 20%. That's a two fold increase after consumers and businesses had gotten used to dealing with inflation and working around it over 15 years. This is a real shock to the system, and I do believe we will see the ramifications, in many ways we're seeing housing shutting down, and I think we're going to see a lot of other activities shutting down as well. We believe we're in a recession, and we believe this recession now will be sustained. If we see an increase in GDP, it's probably because either inventories are continuing to increase or imports are coming down as companies try to unwind their inventories. Kathy, so do you see a severe recession, and then how long do you think this bear market will continue? Well, what's interesting, I think many people are coming around to the idea that we're in a recession or we're going into a recession. The first two quarters with real GDP growth negative to us means we're in a recession. Now that many people are worried and are beginning to see recession for as far as the eye can see, we are looking at this recession a little bit differently. We think it's going to be a function of this massive inventory overhang, and that it's going to be a serious inventory correction, but it's not going to be anything like we saw in 0809. That was a systemic financial problem caused by the mortgage and financial meltdown. We don't think this is the same thing. Now that many economists are starting to agree with us that we're in a recession or going into a recession, we feel that they might become a little bit too alarmist if this is just an inventory recession. But I think the Fed will have a lot to do with whether or not it is. This is a shock, though, to the system and this idea that we have an inventory overhang, we think it's going to get bigger as consumers pull back low saving rates, 3.5% versus 8% where it was before COVID. And so we'll see. We think this holiday season is going to be pretty tough. And so as you kind of read your shopping list for that holiday season, Kathy, when you think about some of the kind of ways that equity valuations are starting to price in",https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6_2e_wGpQzc,53,2022-10-13 17:41:58
3245," And so as you kind of ready your shopping list for that holiday season, Kathy, and you think about some of the kind of ways that equity valuations are starting to price in that recession to the best of their ability, is there a big buy that you now kind of think through or evaluate going into the end of the year here? Well, you have to consider the source here and our focus, our sole focus, is on disruptive innovation. And we also believe that innovation solves problems. We had a tough time going into COVID with our kind of strategy. And then we had a boom in our strategy during COVID because guess what? We needed the genomic revolution to help sequence the coronavirus and figure out tests and vaccines and our kinds of companies helped with that. We think with supply chain issues and with the food and energy prices caused by this shock, this Russia's invasion of Ukraine, that once again innovation is going to help solve these problems. Electric vehicles, there's an accelerated consumer preffership towards electric vehicles like Tesla because of oil prices. And we think there's no stopping that trend now. And in terms of food prices, we do believe that gene editing is going to help us figure out how to produce crops in areas that are less fertile than the Ukraine, the bread basket of Europe, with less water, less fertilizer, less pesticide. So we're going to continue to see the miracles associated with the genomic revolution. But our other strategies as well, whether we're talking about robotics, solving the labor shortage, energy storage, I mentioned electric vehicles, pulling us away from oil consumption, artificial intelligence, which is going to help every company become more competitive if they use their data and combine it with other data in effective ways. And then blockchain technologies, which is going to take the middle men out of a lot of businesses and take the cost out of a lot of businesses, helping us to solve this inflation problem. So again, consider the source. We think innovation solves problems. It certainly gave us an appreciation of that during COVID. Our strategy was high flying. And we think we have the more problems right now. So stay tuned. Kathy, this economic shock that you talk about in large part at the hands of the Fed, does that cause a shock to one of your long term holdings in Tesla, in terms of the stock price and also the company's financials? Well, certainly all stocks are experiencing difficulty in this environment as the market tries to understand how far the Fed is going to go and how deep this recession is going to be. So Tesla, as I mentioned, is a solution to the problem. It's very interesting. If you look at gasoline demand this summer in the United States, it dropped below COVID levels, the worst of COVID, and it dropped to levels that we have not seen since 1997. That's real demand destruction. And it couldn't have happened. We do not believe without electric vehicles at the margin, taking huge share from traditional automobiles. So if we had to be concerned about an industry, it would be the traditional auto industry. We think that gas powered vehicles are going to be obsolete within the next five to 10 years. And the traditional auto industry has to figure out a way to migrate into electric vehicles and into the next big phase, which we think Tesla is leading, the autonomous taxi platform phase. So lots of changes here. Traditional industries are in harm's way as innovation pushes through accelerated by some of the turmoil out there. Cathy, when we last talk.",https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6_2e_wGpQzc,54,2022-10-13 17:46:15
3246," These are in harm's way as innovation pushes through accelerated by some of the turmoil out there. Kathy, when we last talked back in the spring, I believe it was just at the beginning of the Elon Musk Twitter saga. Now we are maybe, maybe getting to a little bit of closure in that case. But I would post you the same question that I asked you then because a lot of time is elapsed in different events have happened. Are you at all concerned about Musk's attention wavering now that it looks like he is in fact going to be taking over and likely at least having a pretty heavy hand in running Twitter? Well, we are prolific users of Twitter. Our gives away its research. We give away our research not when it's finished, but as it's evolving. And our most prolific platform, social platform out there is Twitter. I'm kind of excited to see what Elon will do. I actually think he'll work closely with Jack Dorsey and maybe open up the ecosystem, take away the censorship, make it much more transparent. And I think add more value to that ecosystem. You don't think it'll be a mess if that happens. It'll just be sort of a free for all where it's tougher to find commentary of value. It's interesting about Twitter and what we found this we have a lot of debate around arcs own strategies. We can filter that debate ourselves so we can unfollow people if we think there's bad behavior, but that's our choice. And we can follow those people who we think are moving discussions, whether it's about innovation or the economy moving, moving discussions along. So I think there's a lot of wisdom out there. And we're kind of sick of the nonsense that we see on some of these social platforms. And Twitter, I think, is going to give us more tools to filter out the nonsense and get right down to business. I certainly would like to filter out a lot of the nonsense sometimes on Nerkati. I want to ask you more broadly about arc invests and your funds. And the funds that we have seen, which we're seeing sort of bigger swings to the up end of the downside earlier in the year. They've gotten a little more muted as of late. You talk a lot about your three to five year time horizon, which I think makes sense. But I wonder how long how patient investors are going to be particularly in an environment where they are seeing losses, not just in our K. But in lots of other areas as well. Yes, and I think one thing that helps our clients is our research. And they see that it's first principles research. We have the long term time horizon. And we're seeing spectacular exponential growth opportunities. And not only one by one, the various platforms I just described, but the convergence of those platforms. So one ask her feeding another. And I think many of our clients understand that they're short innovation. Truly disruptive innovation. If you own the NASDAQ or the NASDAQ 100 right now and you look through that index. This is not the index that I grew up with in the 80s and 90s when we were looking for innovation. We'd go to the NASDAQ. But if you look through the NASDAQ now and especially the NASDAQ 100, what you see are 25% of the names touching disruptive innovation. The rest of them are kind of me too. They look like other indexes, the fangs, Microsoft, Nvidia, Tesla would be our only overlap. And then you look further and more deeply into these indices. And you see names that you'd never expect to be there food and beverage utilities, rails, brick and mortar retail. These are not innovation companies. And so what we've done at ARC is we are pure play innovation. And we'd like to think we are what the NASDAQ used to be in the 80s and 90s. And it used to be a very productive place to invest with a long-term investment time horizon. So I think our sharing our research.",https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6_2e_wGpQzc,55,2022-10-13 17:50:53
3247," and 90s and it used to be a very productive place to invest with a long-term investment time horizon. So I think our sharing our research and our pointing out to investors look what you think you own in innovation is not what it used to be and what ARC is doing is really back to the future. We're all about investing in the future as opposed to indexes which are more about past success. Those companies that have been extremely successful have risen to the top of these indexes. But if we're right in these five platforms that involve 14 different technologies are going to disrupt the traditional world order, then investors need to get to the right side of change. And one of the other things that we do is one of our missions and values is to educate. That's why we give our research away and we want to educate not only investors but parents and grandparents about how the world is changing, how radically it's changing and how it's ever more important to get especially students on the right side of change so that they can enjoy these incredible growth opportunities and not be disrupted by industries that will be sunsading shall I say. Kathy, a three to five year time horizon means not only kind of mid-term or recession-proofing your companies, you're not just recession-proofing your portfolio, you're also kind of midterm-proofing your portfolio, you're a general election-proofing your portfolio. And so, you know, ARC, how do you go about identifying disruptive innovation that then doesn't get disrupted by public policy or political agenda? Well, we have a six metric scoring system, very much focused on innovation. One of the scores is thesis risk. Thesis risk has a lot to do with government policy. And so, in the in the early days of ARC in 2014-15, we were thinking, okay, government may be very concerned about the safety of autonomous vehicles. But as we've moved through these last eight years, what we've seen, thankfully, is the government and regulators in particular very focused on data. And what does the data say? The data says that most fatalities and accidents, 85, almost 90% of them, are caused by a human error. If we take the human being out of the equation, then we're going to save up to 35, 40,000 lives in the United States, the fatalities per year, and up to 1.25 million around the world. So, that is a noble goal. And we've been very gratified to see the regulators looking at the fatalities in Tesla's vehicles and informing us that for the most part, most of those fatalities were caused by human error. And for the second, that people who are driving Tesla vehicles are much safer thanks to the various automated driving capabilities now. Up to 40% safer than in most other cars. So, we're very focused on what governments are studying in terms of the data. And if they stick to the data, innovation typically solves problems and makes the world a better place. Really, always a treat to get some time with you. Cathy Wood, Ark, Invest Founder, and see you. Always nice to see you. We'll talk to you soon. Appreciate the time. Thank you, Brian. Julie as well. Thank you. Thank you. All right. Let's stay on the economy here. Inflation is still running hot. As we saw in today's consumer price index, that comes as economic growth continues to be sluggish and recession calls pick up on Wall Street. Let's dive into the economic outlook with Jair Bernstein, who is a member of the White House Council of Economic Advisors. Jair, always great to talk with you. I don't know if you heard, but we just had noted investor Cathy Wood on call.",https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6_2e_wGpQzc,56,2022-10-13 17:54:57
3248," Jar Bernstein, who is a member of the White House Council of Economic Advisors. Jar, always great to talk with you. I don't know if you heard, but we just had noted investor Kathy Wood on calling for a potential economic shock because what we're seeing with inflation and the Fed, we'll have to get your take on it. Well, I think the underlying fundamentals when it comes to particularly the labor market remain very strong in this economy. And that's a really important tail when family budgets are challenged by these high price levels. So, when you have an unemployment rate of 3.5%, you're adding hundreds of thousands of jobs per month, 10 million jobs since this President got here. That's going to help working families offset some of the pressures they're facing on the price side. But it certainly doesn't get the job done and we've got a lot more to do in that space. And that's why at the direction of the President, we have focused like a laser on doing all we can to ease price pressures on the supply side of the economy when it comes to the ports, when it comes to shipping costs, air freight costs, energy costs. And of course, the inflation reduction act with its reduction in costs for medical care, for premiums, for prescription drugs, and also for clean energy. So, I think the question is, A, is there a strong labor market at your back, the answer is yes, B, is this administration doing everything we can to help ease those pressures? Also a firm yes on that one. Jared, I want to pick up on the energy part of all of that in particular. And listen, I know you're not a foreign policy guy, but obviously what's been going on between the U.S. and Saudi Arabia has been getting a lot of attention and the Saudi support of the OPEC production cut, which has been problematic for the global energy market. We were looking for prices to continue their downward trajectory. What can the White House do and what is it doing domestically in terms of continuing to push for more production domestically? Well, let's set the level here with just a little bit of a background on what's been going on in energy markets because I certainly agree with a lot of your characterization, but we got that in the CPI report this morning, which is a motivation for our discussion. A gas price is actually down about 5 percent in September and at an annualized rate of almost a third, about 30 percent in the third quarter. And of course that reflects almost 100 days of declining gas prices. Now to get to your question, and also to reference back what I was talking about in terms of what this White House can do to help, that reflects the very large distribution of 180 million barrels of oil from the strategic reserves. That's ongoing to be clear. It's another 10 million barrels coming October, November. So that's an ongoing addition to global supply. But we have to do more, especially in the light of this misguided and I think a very wrong headed decision by OPEC+. I'm not going to talk about the geopolitics. That's not my lane. I will say the president has consistently since then gone out and talked about the importance of sharing some of those wide profit margins with consumers to give them a bit more breathing room with the pump. If you look at the spread between the wholesale and the retail price, it's still quite elevated. But let's not forget that at the pump, the national price, about $3.90 gallon is down over a dollar from its peak in June. We need to see more of that kind of breathing room for consumers and that's one of the things we're going to keep pressing on. The reality is that individuals households, they can't afford to stop spending on some of the necessities whether that's food, whether that's energy prices, whether that's some of the rent prices even that we've been tracking. And so even with a longer, more protracted kind of an era of higher inflation, higher prices that people are paying, what do you believe from the White House side are some of the longer term implications of that that may also begin to show up on the back end? So here's my answer to that. I think when you're thinking about that question, which looks around a corner, corners are very hard to look around right now. As you know, everybody's crystal ball is kind of cracked. Inflation is a global phenomenon. It's higher in many other countries than it is here. But I think the right thing to do is ask yourself, are the institutions most directly responsible for this challenge doing what they need to do? Because in other cases, modern scientists, technology族, their Sultanate, their perlu, industrial sucker, savez came along with an intellectual Haus and launched by Hertz,",https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6_2e_wGpQzc,57,2022-10-13 17:59:33
3249," But I think the right thing to do is ask yourself, are the institutions most directly responsible for this challenge doing what they need to do? The Federal Reserve absolutely yes, okay? They're their pivot, they're tightening campaign. I'm not going to get into the details because we stay out of their knitting. But they're very much engaged as they should be the president and has endorsed that pivot. Are we doing everything we can as I've tried to explain yes in the energy space and the supply chain space helping to unsknarl supply chains, inflation reduction act, chip sack, infrastructure act helping to boost the economy supply site. Are policies makers doing what they need to do? Is it taking effect? Well, if we dig into the inflation report today, we see goods inflation was actually flat in September. That's useful. But of course, housing inflation, shelter inflation created more pressures. Well, is the Fed's action cooling the housing market unequivocal? Yes, it takes time for that lag to work its way into the CPI. But we're already seeing some cooling in the housing market actually non-trivial both on the rental side and the ownership side. I'm chair, just very quickly. We've been starting to hear not just from Kathy Wood, but other economists that inflation, forward looking inflation indicators are already starting to come down. So just to put your pure economist hat on for a moment, is inflation going to take care of itself? Should the Fed and the White House actually maybe take a step back to here and say inflation will come down without us having to push things into a recession? Well, I think that's a complicated question that gets into a lot of debates, some of which would have me a lot more into the Fed's knitting than I'm willing to go in this position. You're right. When I was a punitive chin-flapping plane, you know, I get into this all day. It's a good question. But from our perspective, we want to respect the Fed's independence. I think the question again redounds quite simply to the following. The Fed is the first and foremost inflation fighter. This President has said we deeply respect their independence. So we're not going to comment on their granular policy, but he has said that this pivot that they've made is a very appropriate pivot given the challenge of price pressures. On our side, you've seen, you know, well more... Let me put it this way. I have never been part of a White House or any other job in my long political economy career where we've done more to try to help on the economy supply side. I never talked about dwell time in my long career. That's how that's the amount of time that containers spend in ports. Now I wake up every morning and check dwell times and they are significantly down through put through the ports is at historical levels, shipping costs, air freight costs, down significantly. Those actions have our fingerprints on it. We worked closely with the private sector, so there's a real partnership there. But again, the question to get away from the granular who's doing the right thing and the timing of all that, very complicated, quite... Nobody has the right answer to that. What you really need to ask is are there relevant institutions that fight inflation doing what they need to do and the answer for this White House and for this Federal Reserve is an unequivocal yes? Jared, all of us have gotten to get a big education about supply chain terminology to be sure. Jared Bernstein, member of the White House Council of Economic Advisors, thank you so much for your time this morning. Appreciate it. Thank you. Coming up, we'll get another check on markets and dig into some of the moogers here as we see.

3250," what This is Yahoo Finance Live. We are seeing stocks still lower the Dow right now off of 186 points about half 1% but as you can see, we are well up off the lows of the session here, even though we are still sharply lower. So that initial alarm over CPI fading a little bit as people try and game out what the Fed is going to do next. We are seeing a similar phenomenon with the S&P, although it's still down 1.2% or so and the NASDAQ down about 1.9%. Likewise, we continue to watch what's going on with yields here the 30 or yield 3.92% and the 10-year yield coming just a hair back below 4%. Also in terms of movers, we are watching shares of Kroger and Albertsons. Bloomberg is reporting that the two grocers are in talks potentially to combine that an announcement could come as soon as sometimes this week or the next week Albertsons shares sharply higher. Kroger shares a little bit lower. We're going to battle it out in our bull versus bear segment this week. The focus will be on meta.

3251," Welcome back. It is time to battle it out in our bowl versus bear segment for the week. This week we put the spotlight on meta. Needham, senior analyst Laura Martin has an underperform rating on the stock saying costs will exceed revenue growth over the next two years. Welcome Laura and we've also got a B. Bernstein senior analyst Mark Schmohlich reiterating his outperform rating saying he sees light beyond the dark welcome mark as well. Okay, so let's get into this. First and foremost, we've got to talk about the advertising revenue right now for meta platforms, especially as so many companies are pulling back on some of their ad spend really looking at some of their cost restructuring as well. And so Laura, I want to go to you first on this as we see even more of that demand for digital advertising continuing to unfortunately see this vacuum given the restructuring that many companies are doing. What does that mean and net out for what should we should expect going forward for meta platforms and the underlying subsidiaries and Facebook Instagram? You're right. The macro environment continues to deteriorate. We think many ad driven companies will miss their fourth quarter earnings. And in meta's case, not only is just the macro environment deteriorating, but they're losing a lot of user time to tick talk. And that continues to happen. Tick-Tock now is up to 75% share of adults under 25 here in America, which is the highest ARP who region for meta. So we're worried about both ad unit availabilities as people move time into tick talk. And we're worried about demand softness at the advertising level. And 100% of meta's revenue comes from auction. So if you have a falling demand for units, you get light pricing for the units that you do have to sell. Mark, want to get your reaction to that? I mean, you're calling this a make or break quarter for meta. Absolutely. And I think Laura's right that there's certainly all these, you know, the very loud bear case right now where it is time to prove it even in this tough macro environment. And you know, there's really kind of three legs of things that they need to go off and effectively dispel. One is on the engagement side. And you know, since they had that for one quarter where they lost a million users, they've gained about 40 million Facebook Blue users. Now granted much of that's international, but domestic's out fine. On the revenue front, it is a tough macro, but we're seeing them actually set up a little bit better. Actually, starting to gain back some share of wallet from advertisers. Primarily as, you know, they've made some improvements on advantage, sorry, on, you know, the idea for on they've launched advantage plus, which certainly helps a lot of advertisers, you know, make decisions around kind of automating the the ad delivery process. And they've launched a lot more ad inventory ramping up advertising load on reels, launching new ad inventory elsewhere. And so, you know, we're starting to see them make progress against much that's been weighing down the stocks and seeing the last year. Mark, what a stay with you for a hot second. The reality of the revenue construct for for meta, especially as they make a big push into the meta verse. I mean, my goodness. Are we going to be buying $1,400 glasses to wear augmented reality glasses to wear within our households or even at work? Who knows? I bought one, not saying everybody else will. So I'll try it out. But, you know, I think where we are right now, that's certainly captures the headlines and certainly the number that they've been spending, you know, to kind of build out that meta, their metaverse ambitions is, you know, certainly kind of sticker. Shot it changed the whole name. Exactly right. You know, but I don't think that matters right now for the stock to work, right? Because I think the stock is back to questions around really core fundamentals. Folks can understand, you know, that's like a more long term initiative. I'm imagine investors will love it if they were spending a lot less on it. I think we're going to see some of that discipline. They're not going to bend in anything at all. But you certainly see discipline that, you know, investment in growth areas is going to be tied to core performance. You know, and so I think investors do need to see that discipline. And so long as engagement is holding and revenues are turning the corner off the bottom, you know, I think they kind of will allow them to continue to kind of build up even if it's not necessarily desired. But, you know, it's certainly a long term view.",https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6_2e_wGpQzc,60,2022-10-13 18:12:22

3253," going on with the consumer. We feel really good about the breakfast segment. We feel really good about our brand and how we stand tall. People need their coffee and their breakfast sandwich to start their morning. So we've seen really strong results for our brand in the last couple of months. Scott, full stop. I was critical to changes in the Roarth program, but it's coming from a place of love. I have to dunk an app. I go to dunk it all the time. And a lot of other people seemed to have caught my vibe. Have you looked at what you made here and are making any changes now to respond to consumers? Yeah, so, and I know it comes from a place of love from you, Brian. Absolutely. Here's what I would say. We rolled out our Dunkin Perks program in 2014, and we haven't made any changes in the last eight years. And we went out and we talked to our core users, and we said, what do you want from a program? And they said they wanted three things. They wanted more variety. Because in the old program, you could just get a beverage. They wanted more flexibility. And we've now given them a chance to stack points so they can buy a drink for themselves. They can buy a sandwich for their family or a whole meal for the soccer team. And they said they wanted recognition. So big users like you want to be recognizing we now have a boosted status. And so we've put those three things in place. We're really excited about this new program. We gave out four billion free points in the last three days. And the response has been overwhelming with positive. OK, fair enough. That's good to hear. But the birthday drink is the industry standard. Like I know, I would like to get a free birthday coffee until I ultimately drop dead and six feet under. I mean, do you think you'll bring that back? So we're talking about that for sure, Brian. But one thing we did do is, well, we did take that piece away. What we added is come in either the day before your birthday, the day of your birthday or the day after, get three times points, points that won't expire as long as you come a couple times a year. And you can actually get something besides just a beverage. You could get a donut, you could get a sandwich, you can get avocado toast, a lot more flexibility, which is what our guests wanted. So you're really monitoring some of the taste profiles that the trends on what consumers are moving towards in their purchases for anything from lunchtime to starting off the day. So where are you still seeing the most traffic at what point in the day to really make some of the menu decisions and changeovers there? Yeah, we're certainly a morning day part business. So 70% of our business happens before 11 AM. And honestly, when COVID happened and we had that shutdown, we were all very nervous when the commute was not happening. But people shifted their behaviors a little bit. And they came to us a little later in the morning and they came for a couple beverages, maybe to share with their spouses while they're working at home. But really, the trend that's happening is all around ice beverages. And we invented ice coffee. We're a leader, whether it's ice coffee, whether it's cold brew, our new refresher line, it's all about ice beverages and great attachment with snacking items to that. Hey, Scott, it's Julie here. I mean, I gotta say it's like, I guess I wanna know a little bit more about the whole recession, spending patterns, et cetera, because you sound super positive. And I'm just wondering what signs if any you see of trade down, for example, of a drop in traffic of any kind of sign that, you know, the anecdotal and data pain that we are talking about every day if you guys are seeing any evidence of that. Yeah, we do see some of it. And here's what I'd say anecdotally. What happens in our business is, when things happen like fuel prices or you see other spikes in inflationary environments, people pull back a little bit and maybe they stop coming quite as frequently to a Duncan or some other restaurant. But especially with Duncan, I think after a couple days or a week, people realize they need their morning Joe to get started, right? They need their coffee to fuel their day and we've seen it come right back up. And I think uniquely positioned for us, Duncan, it is a value offering, right? So we've got great products, both beverage and food, at a great price point, at the speed of Duncan. I think that's an unmatched combination out there. Scott, I go to my local Duncan every Saturday. I mean, it's just a ritual I have. And every time I'm in line, I want your huge in the morning, which is a good thing I'm sure, but everybody's buying coffee, notably iced coffee. How big a percentage is donuts now on your business? And what does that menu look like? Yeah, donuts are about 20% of our product mix right now. You're right.",https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6_2e_wGpQzc,62,2022-10-13 18:24:26
3254," And is donuts now on your business? And what does that menu look like? Yeah, donuts are about 20% of our product mix right now. You're right. Ice coffee is the future. That last year was the first year we sold more ice beverages than hot beverages. That's what the next generation of consumer wants. They want these ice cold beverages. They want highly colorful products that they can share on Instagram. But I will say our donuts, no one does donuts like we are. We are obviously a national and a global leader on donuts. You got to come try our spider donut, which we just rolled out for Halloween. We've got a jack-a-lantern donut. There's nothing more shareable and more fun. And a nice treat to yourself than a donut. As you've got more people returning either to office or to schools that breakfast wars, that's continuing to brew and heat up. What's Duncan's positioning in that breakfast war and what are going to be the keys to essentially helping it retain that consumer mind share and that dollar at the beginning of the day? Yeah, a couple of things. First of all, we have an incredible brand with a lot of brand love. So we tap into that loyalty like that new program. The second is some degree of everyday value or targeted digital value. So through our app, we are going to have the ability to have laser-focused offers that go right to you and what you want and give you incredible value in our program. And then the last thing I'd say is we've got, it's through our app, our ability to order ahead. So Brian, when you see those long lines, you download the app, order ahead. It'll be ready when you get there and the crew will hand it to you and you'll be off and running for your busy day. Scott, I just, I need the birthday drink back. I'm going to Duncan anyway, lad. I'm going to get off of here. I'm going to Duncan. I just need the birthday drink back. Please, please. Brian, I'm going to come deliver coffee to you personally on your birthday. I'll take that. April 4th. There we go. Yeah, done. Deal. Duncan, President Scott Murphy. Thanks so much for joining us this morning. Appreciate it. Thank you guys. Coming up, everyone, we're going to do a final check. Of the markets on the other side of this short break. Well, that was quite a two hours. Hope you enjoyed the ride. We certainly did.

We saw the jumps is in cereal and bakery products now This is considered the highest since the 70 late 70s and early 80s. I was confirmed by Steve Reed and economists at the Bureau of Labor statistics Of course those higher pricings being driven by higher gasoline oils Transportation weighing on the cost for both groceries and farmers alike of course energy costs here Decreased by 2.6% gasoline down 5.6% making a cheaper to transport goods, but still higher Of course also to kids can say consideration rising worker wages and prices for impact costs like packaging Fertilizer there and now here if you take a look cereal and bakery products being driven higher by of course that rushes Ukraine Invasion that happened earlier this year also fruit and vegetables being impacted here of 10.4% Due to a historic drought facing the western half of the country impacting crop yields there We got to talk about egg inflation here. It looks like some items including eggs are seeing a bit of a price decline Other is not so much. I just wondering what items are sticking out to you. That's very well to make it clear Americans can still inspect sticker shock here when they go to the grocery store Yeah, exactly. There's really no relief just yet. Of course we see right here that eggs a month of a month down 3.5% milk Down 1.3% but this of this is doable to some of the impact some of the Climate events that happen over the summer of course eggs buyers recovering from the springs avian influenza outbreak That's what doctor Michael Spence in a Wells Fargo telling me but dairy dealing with a hot summer They are in key markets also vegetables dealing with that record transportation costs shipping costs Expensive to decline here, but still taking a toll on prices here And if we take a look year over year of course higher prices across the board some of the highest increase here Flower lettuce potatoes Margarine milk and eggs eggs once again seeing a bit of relief, but still up 30% now jarred as you know This is a volatile index there hard to judge whether or not next month We might see a tick up a tick down there, but I also want to note that citrus Somebody to keep a lookout here on Wednesday the US Department of Agriculture said that Florida's orange crop this year It'll be the smallest in 1943 now. That's not even taking into account the effects of hurricane Irene So lots of fold out here, but Americans still expecting higher prices across the board Silver lining for you and I broke I hear that our lunchtime is getting picked up today by corporate But today only really appreciate that report in all serious and it's lots of higher prices to digest Young finances broke to Paul. Thank you sticking with this morning CPI report Let's welcome in and Nick Brooks ICG head of economics and investment research for his reaction to the numbers and Nick Let me just get your your thoughts your front line thoughts on those headline numbers here Especially that core reading would just shut up excluding food at energy Yeah, I think that's the key problem. I mean the headline number has been sort of gradually coming down since June But the real focus is on the core inflation, which is of course is what the Fed really cares about And that just keeps going up and as you were highlighting food inflation is very high Shelter inflation has also been a key driver of the rate health care costs and pretty much",https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6_2e_wGpQzc,65,2022-10-13 18:37:07
3257," keeps going up. And as you were highlighting, food inflation is very high. Shelter inflation has also been a key driver of the rate, healthcare costs, and pretty much across the board and services. So the problem with this type of number is, I don't think the Fed wants to continue raising rates. I think the Fed recognizes quite clearly that the economy is probably going into a slowdown over the next couple of quarters. But as long as those core inflation rates remain so high, they need to keep raising rates to keep it under control. So I think bottom line is, and the market seems to think, we're going to get 75 basis points from the Fed in November. And now markets are starting to price potentially another 75 in December. Yes. So not a good place to be. Yes, I even saw 100 basis point raise in November being price as I think the probability was 2% max. But just goes to show you the extent to which the Fed, which has really been consistent on its messaging. I was going through the FOMC minutes that were released yesterday. No big surprises at CPI, of course, being the bigger report here. But we've seen central bank action out of the bank of England, the bank of Japan, just get completely reversed. I mean, you look at the debt of the UK or the currency of Japan trading like emerging markets here. What do you make of the central bank or reaction? How painted into a corner are they? I think they're all painted into quite a severe corner. Now, you know, I'm based here in the UK. And I won't start talking too much about the UK, but they're in a very, very tight spot. And I think the problem is, you know, central banks haven't faced anything like this since the late 70s, early 80s, where you've got extreme inflation. And it's broad-based. And you know, the central bank recognized that growth is coming down. And if it wasn't for these inflation rates, they probably be cutting rates. But bottom line is they're worried that inflationary expectations could get out of control and will get the, you know, the feared wage price spiral that, you know, become self-fulfilling. So they have to talk tough, they have to act tough until inflation rates start coming down, even if it means recession. Well, and we've gotten comments, commentary from CEOs who may or may not be talking their books. But Jamie Diamond sticks out in particular, especially ahead of earnings, which we expect imminently this week. Tomorrow morning, and he's talking about another 20% decline in the S&P 500 already on its way there over the last couple days. Just wondering what you see in terms of the markets set up on any levels you're looking at. What are you looking for in the eventual rebound when we find a bottom finally? Yeah. I think there are a couple of things. My own view would be that, you know, a lot of the rate increases are in the market. So if you look at swap rates, if you look at forward rates, you know, I think a lot of the central bank hikes that are coming are actually in the market. I think where perhaps the market has not yet priced appropriately is the risk of quite a severe earnings decline as we move into potential recession. So I think the, you know, PEs need to come down further and the earnings are also likely to come down further. So I think there is certainly likely to be more downside on equity markets. The other point though I'd make is I think very similar to what we saw during the COVID, the worst of the COVID pandemic. I think it will be very sector focused. I think there are going to be some sectors that are clearly going to be hit much harder than others in this type of environment. But there also be some sectors that will perhaps be less affected. So I think one does have to take more nuanced approach if one has a medium term view on an medium term investment horizon. Investors need the nuanced view because the Fed is not playing the nuance game. Well said here Nick Brooks, ICG head of economic investment research. Thank you for your time today. Thank you. Before we go to break, check in on shares of Delta. You can see that company if we can get it on the screen there in a second. The company beat on revenue in the third quarter. And we spoke with CEO Ed Bastion who had this to say about airfare cost cuts that will benefit customers like you and me. We thought what happened earlier this spring when we pushed ourselves a little faster than we thought we could and the reliability suffered. So I'm confident we can get there by next.",https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6_2e_wGpQzc,66,2022-10-13 18:41:37
3258," So what happened earlier this spring when we pushed ourselves a little faster than we thought we could and the reliability suffered. So I'm confident we can get there by next summer. And as we bring that additional capacity back, that's going to help probably take a little bit of the pressure off of pricing for consumers. But more importantly, for Delta, it's going to enable us to get much better cost productivity and will be able to pass along some of that cost savings onto our customers. Coming up, feeling the domino effect. The fly material says it'll take a big hit on export curves for China. And that's his founder, giant TSMC, that's Taiwan. Taiwan semi, well, they're slashing capital spending in another sign of trouble for this sector. We're going to take a look at the movers after this. Welcome back. Chipmakers still flashing warning signs with the latest headlines from Taiwan semi adding to the gloom. The Taiwanese group cutting its budget for 2022, but shares higher on better than expected results. And more we have, the finances in S4A and more gloom for the chip sector under a lot of pressure already. Yeah, that's right. And if we look at the Philadelphia semiconductor index, I mean right now it's rebounding, but it had opened lower, was down as much as 4% earlier today. And the four day chart will show you that it's down 5% and a year-to-date chart shows these down 43%. But let's get to that chip sector that you were just mentioning and TSMC that beat on the top in the bottom line, cutting capital spending and also warning about slowing consumer demand. So moving into the fourth quarter, TSMC warning that it's seeing demand bladdish. Right now it's rebounding the stock. It's up 7%. But I also just want to mention that look the chip.",https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6_2e_wGpQzc,67,2022-10-13 18:46:36
3259," TSMC warning that it's seeing demand bladdish. Right now it's rebounding the stock. It's up 7%. But I also just want to mention that look, the chip sector has been dealing with the fallout of the new government regulations to buy an administration's export control. So you've got applied materials, lamb research, applied materials saying that their fourth quarter is going to be impacting, impacted by this new regulation. So you've got this regulation on the one hand. And then you've got some of these chip makers that are talking about slowing consumer demand on the other hand, impacting. And keep in mind that the chip sector also is going through periodic cycles. So it was expected that in the second half of the year that we would see demand slow down, slower. And it's these stocks are such that kind of, they've kind of been the way the pandemic style stocks have been really high during the pandemic and then losing steam this year. Hey, we don't need any nuance on that. We know the hit that they've been taking and a lot of green on that board, it was read quite a bit earlier. All right, Yahoo, finances and S for it. Thank you for that report. Schneider Electric, one of the largest energy and power equipment providers in Europe and abroad unveiling new research and corporate ESG efforts at its presentation in Las Vegas. And finding, while there's little intention from companies to do green and be green, actually a lot of that intention, there's not enough follow-through. For more, we have Amir Paul Schneider, our electric president, North America. And thank you for coming here today. This is all part of your presentation at the Innovation Summit Las Vegas. Just tell us a little bit about the event and what we can expect from that. Well, first of all, thank you for having me. And yes, we're here with 1,500 customers, about 20% of the Fortune 500 is here. And the conversation that we're having is how do we move from an intent to action? There's been a lot of commitments made about getting to net zero, and that's great. More of those commitments are getting certified with science-based targets, which is an important next step. But really deploying the technologies and learning by doing is how we're going to create innovation that we desperately need. And that's really what we're talking to our partners, customers, and broader strategic alliances about here. The thing that's most important right now is that we remember that sustainability is also an efficiency driver. So it's got a bottom line positive impact. And I think that is going to be an acceleration point for all of the sectors. And a lot of the impetus behind the, well, behind the clean air movement and clean energy movement has to do with government subsidies, just wondering what the status of that is. We hear a lot about that with respect to Tesla and some of the other big makers, but there's a lot going on behind the scenes as well as we beef up our infrastructure. It's government subsidies for sure, especially for consumers, and it'll act as a catalyst for consumers to make the right choices. People want to do the right thing. And if it can be also providing a better experience, then these incentives are just going to make that transition happen faster. Think about people buying an EV. Once they buy an EV, they have an opportunity to put solar in their home. When they do that, they can add a battery. And then with technologies that we can work with the utilities to also make them producers of energy and maybe even sell some of that back in the right environments to the broader grid. So there's a real evolution where consumers are going to become prosumers. And we think this evolution is going to be catalyzed by things like the Inflation Reduction Act. But I want to go back to my earlier point. Investment and clean tech is about also making environments more efficient, not just in terms of being more green, but operationally more efficient. So it actually saves money in the long term. And we've published research with the Schneider Sustainable Institute that in existing buildings, we can build payback periods under eight years, not only making the buildings more efficient and in places like Las Vegas at the largest Hilton property in the world, we're demonstrating that as an active solution. What's some of the tech behind this, what you call next generation industrial technology that's being used to empower workers, specifically, how does this all fit together? So look, one key element is to bring digital into the space. As consumers, we've been living in the digital and internet era for about 20 years. But in the industrial space, data and digital assets are just being deployed at scale. And what digital does is it makes the invisible visible and brings all of the...",https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6_2e_wGpQzc,68,2022-10-13 18:50:20
3260," but in the industrial space, data and digital assets are just being deployed at scale. And what digital does is it makes the invisible visible and brings all of that opportunities for optimization. What it also helps us do is take our scarce resource which is people and help them focus on the most important places where they can innovate and be creative. That is also going to create a lot of new jobs. We think there's an incredible opportunity in the clean tech space and solar, the number of electricians we're going to need and we're investing. In addition to working with people like Nika, the National Association of Electrical Contractors, we're investing with community colleges to make sure the next generation is ready to work in this IoT environment. Finally, we're also investing in manufacturing. We announced an additional $46 million invested in the United States to prepare for this wave of electrification. And that's on top of 100 million we invested in our factories last year. We appreciate your time here. I got to leave it there, Amir Paul Schneider, Electric President North America. Thank you. Coming up, if you think the S&P's 2022, excuse me, 2022 flood has been steep. Spare a thought for Kathy Wood's flagship fund, it has plummeted as more than twice the pace. So how is she feeling? My name's like Tesla and Roku now. You're going to hear from her up next. we're going on найдulee. Welcome back. We saw a red inflation print this morning with CPI coming in at 0.4% for the month and Kathy Wood weighed on one of the prints and more with our morning show today with us now is Julie Hyman and Julie. Lots going on in that interview. She talked about golden deflation but also the dreaded R word recession. Yes, and it was sort of linked in with what she's talking about with deflation as well. The chief see some deflationary impulses out there going on under the service particularly in Camarro. We talk about gold.",https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6_2e_wGpQzc,69,2022-10-13 18:55:31
3261," And it was sort of linked in with what she's talking about with deflation as well. The chief see some deflationary impulses out there going on under the service, particularly in Camarro, and she did talk about gold. And so she talked about if indeed we are seeing deflation come down the pike, then the risk with the fed raising rates is that yes, we will see recession. This is a real shock to the system. And I do believe we will see the ramifications. In many ways we're seeing housing shutting down. And I think we're going to see a lot of other activities shutting down as well. We believe we're in a recession and we believe this recession now will be sustained. And if we see an increase in GDP, it's probably because either inventories are continuing to increase or imports are coming down as companies try to unwind their inventories. And it's pretty interesting, Julie, everybody talking about what the fed is going to do in November and December. But a lot of traders are already pricing in rate cuts for the end of 2023. We'll have to see how that pans out. But you also asked her about Elon Musk and the purchase of Twitter, of course, Elon and Tesla being one of the great disruption plays that she has. But what are thoughts on Elon taking over Tesla? Well, she doesn't have Twitter in the portfolio anymore. We should mention that. But she does have Tesla. And Tesla is one of the things that's done better in that portfolio amidst what has not done well overall, right? The arc, arc, arc, that benchmark ETF is down more than 60 percent for the year thus far. It's down in today's session even as other things are turning higher. So I asked her, what's the risk that Elon gets distracted and are you worried about what he's going to do for Twitter? She said she's excited about what Elon Musk could bring to Twitter. Listen. We are prolific users of Twitter. Our, uh, gives away its research. We give away our research, not when it's finished, but as it's evolving. And our most prolific platform, social platform out there is Twitter. Um, I'm kind of excited to see what Elon will do. I, I actually think he'll work closely with Jack Dorsey and maybe open up the ecosystem, take away the censorship, uh, make it much more transparent. And I think add more value to that ecosystem. You know, it was interesting. I asked her, like, isn't it going to be a mess though? And there's all this stuff. And she said, no, she said two things. I thought we're interested in one. She said she herself will be able to filter out. And she thought that, um, a Twitter under Elon Musk could offer users maybe more filtering options. And so that it wouldn't necessarily be a noisy, harassing, ugly place under an Elon Musk scenario. Let's see, when it comes to Twitter, innovation under the old regime, we just got that edit button after what, 10 years. So, uh, yeah, I think it could be a little bit chaotic. I'm interested to see all the changes. I hope it doesn't break. I don't think it will because, uh, as news people were, uh, were prolific users of, uh, it's great. We are. It's like Cathy Wood. Yes. Yes. Very prolific here. Thank you for that. And great interview, by the way. Thank you. I have a few finances at Julie Hyman. All right. Now, doubly doubling down on consumer finance, Apple and Goldman Sachs will offer a new, high yield savings account for the Apple card saying it'll come with no fees or minimum posits. The idea is that users can use and manage the account directly from their existing wallet. Apple pay was launched in 2014. And the joint credit card, Apple card was established by both groups in 2019. Cora coming up, chorus of Doom sayers. There was Damien Diamond's recession call.

3262," A you you you today, with coming after an initial drop of just over 500 points here. S&P now up nearly 3% trading in the widest trading range that we have seen for this index since March 2020. Take a look at the NASAT composite. That's moving to the upset up just over 2% Russell 2000. Also railing today up just around 2% as well. Taking a look at the sector action here. And clearly we are seeing some broad base buying across the board, energy, financial technology, among the leaders lagging as consumer discretionary. If you can call that still up over 1% today. Take a look at some of those individual names that is leading us to the upside here. I mentioned the rally that we're seeing in big tech. Take a look at Apple. Apple up just over 3% today. Microsoft up over 4% Google staying in the green here and video up just around a 4% taking a look at the semis. We're also seeing some buying there. Now this is a group that has really been beaten down over the last several months, but particularly over what we've seen in the last five trading days. And again, we are seeing gains across the board Qualcomm and Intel there among the biggest gainers in Backroof. And then also the buying that we're seeing in some of these bank stocks ahead of earnings tomorrow.",https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6_2e_wGpQzc,71,2022-10-13 19:02:55
3263," Qualcomm and Intel, they're among the biggest gainers in that group. And then also the buying that we're seeing in some of these banks, stocks ahead of earnings tomorrow, JP Morgan up nearly five and a half percent, Wells Fargo up just over four and a half percent, Goldman even up just over four percent years. So, Michelle Broadbeast buying across the spectrum, certainly a very different picture as we head into the final hour training that what we were looking at shortly after the opening bell. And that does certainly seem to be the case with crypto as well as we take a look on the interactive for the action there. We saw Bitcoin bouncing back there this afternoon, as long along with the broader markets. I mean, look at the dip that we saw and shooting off straight to the races there in the middle of the afternoon. It has been an interesting week for crypto again with the SEC dashing hopes for a bit coin spot ETF from wisdom tree marking more than a dozen rejections for such ETFs. We do see a mixed picture for cryptocurrencies overall, ether still down, obviously, because it has not been fairing while ever since the merger. But in terms of crypto, we also saw Morgan Stanley and Leschina Shah suggesting that the cryptocurrency ecosystem, but not blockchain itself is becoming more centralized, finding, quote, reliance on the running of a large portion of the blockchain on a single or small group of cloud service providers becomes a non negligible risk to consider. So a little bit less risk there, at least she sees in the short term, Dave. All right, sounds good. My friend. Let's get you up to speed now on the housing market inflation, not the only thing heating up today mortgage rates jumping to a 20 year high now averaging 6.92% on the 30 year fix that's up from 666 a week ago and well more than the double the 305 from one year ago. Now Lawrence Yoon, the chief economist at realtor.com saying quote, even with an anticipated fall in home prices in some markets, principally in California, homes will continue to be unaffordable while rents are squeezing non owners. Now there is a glimmer of hope here on that front in terms of the rents rents grew 9% last month. That's the first single digit increase in a year according to Redfit. Demand is cooling for rentals and a record amount of building will improve supply. We expect it more than 400,000 units will come on the market this year. Haven't seen that in back back years since the 70s, Shana. All right, well that CPI print is the big story of the day coming in much hotter than expected inflation rising 8.2% in September and a year or year basis. We want to bring in Vince Reinhardt, Drifus and Melon, a chief economist, Vince, it's great to see you. So certainly it's interesting when you take a look at the market's reaction, but from an economist perspective, I guess this change your outlook at all just where we are in the economy right now, and what we could expect in the coming months. No, it just seals the deal for what the Fed will be doing in the near term 75 basis points that it's upcoming meeting in November and other 50 in December. What it tells you is that inflation, once it gets high, gets entrenched. The worrisome thing about the consumer price index report this morning was core inflation, strip out food and energy. That's growing 6.6% that's a 40 year high. It's getting into the prices of goods and services that are sticky and sticky lives up to its name. Hard to bud, but once they start going, they have momentum. And that's the Fed's problem. Inflations brought her base now. And we know that the Fed is playing catch up. And at this point, they want to do too much, rather too little to really get inflation under control. When you pass through some of the minutes that we just recently gone, how does that factor into some of these data points that are going to continue to come out being that this is the last CPI print we're going to see before the midterms? You're exactly right. That was the headline they wanted out of the minutes that were published yesterday. FOMC participants basically said, you could do too much, you could do too little. There's more danger if you don't do enough. While they fred it a little bit about what it means economic activity, they were much more concerned about inflation getting embedded and inflation expectations rise up to the same. So right now, monetary policy choices pretty easy. It's unpleasant, but it's easy. Because when inflation is so far above your 2% goal, they all know what to do and what they need to do is raise.",https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6_2e_wGpQzc,72,2022-10-13 19:07:48
3264," pleasant, but it's easy because when inflation is so far above your 2% goal, they all know what to do. And what they need to do is raise rates, and that's what they'll be doing. And they'll be doing tighter longer, and just about every CEO in the conference boards suggest a mild recession. Next year, and just about every guest on this show says the same. But Vince, is that going to be enough to drive down inflation? We're seeing earnings at least early on that show people there's no demand destruction. Despite dramatically higher prices, what will bring down inflation to 2% of its just mild, we get anywhere near it. Ultimately, it would be the Federal Reserve that returns inflation to its goal by being willing to keep the policy rate high for a long time. I actually don't think they'll get there next year. And that is because inflation is stubborn. And as you say, the economy slips into a recession when the unemployment rate starts rising. As inflation gets nearer to their goal, not near enough to it, they're going to have much more difficult policy choices. And chances are they'll blink. I.e. they won't keep rates high enough to get inflation back to 2. They'll satisfy themselves that inflation in the neighborhood of 2, even if it starts with a 3, is sufficient progress to ultimately get to the vehicle. And then you've been in the room before you've been part of the very similar types of discussions. What can you tell us? What do you think the conversations are like now inside the Fed when we do get a print like today's? So I think it's a combination of what I alluded to earlier. A lot of unanimity when inflation is so high, the urge to tighten is across all FOMC participants. But you're beginning to see them put markers down about the next fight. And the next fight is next year when the unemployment rate is rising, when the economy is in recession, some of them are going to want to slow the process down. And so underneath all that good feeling, underneath them all saying the same thing about the need to raise rates a lot in front load policy to accommodation is a beginning of this showing of the seams. Where they're worried, where there'll be a difference of opinion, where it's set show up, concerns about rising unemployment rate or recession, and global economic recession. That's back on the board now, particularly this week when the IMF and the World Bank annual meetings are ongoing. They're all going to the same meetings. They're all here in the same thing. Yes, you need to tighten. You also need to be aware that everybody's tightening monetary policy and their significant risks of financial stability. And then obviously the IMF releasing their global outlook, seeing reduced growth also in some of the major economies expecting a slow down there. They looked, they talked about the EU, China, and the US. How do you see the fact that we're such an interconnected world now with our economies? How do you see that playing out in terms of the pressure it might put on the US economy? A lot. And it's not global monetary policy accommodate. A coordination is actually emulation. When the Fed raises interest rates, it puts upward pressure on the exchange value of the dollar. It puts downward pressure on everybody else's exchange rate, which is a force for inflation in Europe, in Japan, in emerging markets. Most central banks don't like it, and they're forced to follow the Fed up. So part of the message this week is recognize Fedors are we're all following you. That means your footprint is bigger on the global economy than you may appreciate. And that problems in the global economy will blow back to the US economy. That's the concern about next year. And as I want to close with the housing market, now mortgage rates certainly little rise and fall dramatically with rates, but more than 10 years, but needless to say another 75 point, it's probably going to take us above 7%. What do you see in the housing market? What do you think the Fed sees? It appears to be the first breaking point. So look, the Fed's got to work the tools it has in terms of the monetary",https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6_2e_wGpQzc,73,2022-10-13 19:11:55
3265," It appears to be the first breaking point. So look, the Fed's got to work the tools it has in terms of the monetary transmission mechanism. There's basically two reliable features. You raise rates, you choke off housing, you raise rates, you tend to put upward pressure on the exchange rate of the dollar. That's unpleasant for people looking for homes, and it's unpleasant for our trading partners facing downward pressure on their own exchange rates. I would think that housing is going to be troubled for a while. And the place to see that is actually abroad. In the UK, where more of mortgage activity is at variable rates, you see a much more sharper contraction and activity. Indeed, you see an inability to get mortgages at some point over the last couple of weeks. That's the future for the US. It just takes longer because we rely so much more on fixed rate mortgages. But as you said, fixed rate 30-year mortgages has been more than doubled in a year, and it's going up probably into the sevens next year. Indeed it appears, Sue.

3266," Markets in rally mode, despite a hotter than expected inflation print this morning, the Dow now trading above 30,000. Look at that 900 plus points up. What a rally Ryan Dietrich, Carson Group, chief market strategist is with us. Ryan, this is this is quite a day. This is quite a year. We're going to talk to Wall Street Plenty. Let's just speak to Main Street for a minute who's just confused because we get a bad inflation print, we get a good reaction from the market, we get a great job report and the market's do the opposite. Tell Main Street what to make of today. Yeah, well first off, thanks for having me on a day where things are green. Yeah. Which is something to talk about here. That's nice, nice change. But just today, we had the disappointing number, obviously markets were lower, but you look at what happened, we just corrected 50% of the overall bull market that we had off those 2020 lows, 3500. That's a normal type of retracement. We found some buyers there, wasn't shocking. The VIX, the fear gauge. It didn't surprisingly, didn't spike massively higher this morning. That would be a clue. The obvious market knew something and the rally came on. That's the biggest thing for Main Street, the people are really worried. Believe me, you're not the only ones confused. This year is very confusing for a lot of people, but think about this. In June 16th, we made those lows, 200 approximately, 200 stocks in the S&P made a new low. Just yesterday, we made new lows less than 80 stocks, made 52 week lows. What does that mean? Price is making new lows, but less stocks are. That Main Street, everyone listening, is an improvement. That's how major lows conform. There's less stocks going down, and that's a real positive sign. We're going to be speaking of that positive sign. The Dow up over 3% S&P not too far behind. Nasdaq up over 2.5%. Do you think today's gains does this rally that we're seeing have legs? Yeah, we think it does. I mean, there's lots of ways we can look at this. Right? I mean, I mentioned the VIX. You look at sentiment polls. We're near some of the most bearers we've seen, guys, since major lows, March 2009, March 2020. Expectations are so low. It's not like things are great. Believe me. We're going to see this earnings season, how corporate America is looking. Roptimistic earnings are still going to justify this economy growing. But expectations have just simply gotten so low. And let's not forget this. Believe the last 17 bear markets, six of them bottom in October. Believe me, it could be random. Maybe not. October is more of a bear market killer. The worst two starts year ever, other than this year, this is the third worst start, 74 in 2002. All right. Bottom in the first two weeks, two weeks of October. We just do it again. Believe me. Two in and watch later. We think we're optimistic that we can have another pretty good low in October. And then those regular fourth quarter strong seasonals that take place in a midterm year can take over. And we can have a pretty good size rally the rest of this year before the year is all said and done. And Ryan, how about the fact that it's a midterm election? Yeah, what are investors hoping for in this sort of environment? Yeah, great question. So let's put it this way. I think gridlock, right? You don't want too much power one way or the other. And you look at the way the election, how it might swing. You know the incumbent party that won the presidency, tends to lose some seats. But we don't think there's going to be too much power one way or the other. And that could be what matters. But for the average investor listening, just know this. We say do not invest in your politics, right? Just invest in the fundamentals. But think about this. If you looked at what the S&P did, the day of the midterm elections, go back to World War II. All right. One year later, the S&P was higher every single time, up 14.1%. So whatever happens, markets hate uncertainty. Get that election out of the way, the uncertainty out of the way. Then then markets tend to do pretty darn well. Last point on this, the second year of a new president. So this year, historically extremely weak. Believe me, this year is weaker than we expected. At the same time, this isn't abnormal to see weakness the second year of a new president. And things get a lot better that third year. And the economy can keep growing in our view. It should lead to pretty good sized gains into this year and into next year. Don't get me wrong, man. We love to see the rally. We love your positivity. You know that. But if I said dinner on the S&P being higher in one month than it is today, you'd say what? And that's an off. Where are we going for dinner is what I would say. I mean, okay. Some were expensive. Yeah, good steakhouse. No, higher.",https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6_2e_wGpQzc,75,2022-10-13 19:20:54
3267," today you'd say what and that's an off. Where are we going for dinner is what I would say. I mean, okay. Some were expensive. Yeah, good steakhouse. No, higher. I mean, believe me. So let's put it like this. October and November are the top two months in a midterm year. We talked about some of those things. I mean, I know we know inflation's high, but overall, this beach ball is really low, right? Really, really low. Once you let go and that momentum go up, we think, you know, this time next month, you can buy me a steak. I'll come to New York. Yeah, we think that S and P is going to be a decent deal higher. I'd be happy to buy you dinner, man. If I lose this bet and that is a bet, it's on tape. Is there anything that you see then that tells us inflation might be cooling? Yeah, I mean, believe me, this number is disappointing. Yesterday's number is disappointing. But yes, you know, you look at some of the individual surveys like Rents. Rents are actually down month over month last year. The government data doesn't show that because government data takes like nine months for it to get in there. Use cars and really started coming back down. The government data doesn't show that because again, they're not as real time when it comes to this. So those are some potential positive. Just look around, right? Commodity prices have come back significantly. Again, so those are some shining, I don't know, I'm worried. Some potential bright spots in a really dark sea when it comes to inflation. But at the same time, what's priced in and what's not? The market is pricing in massive inflation, massively higher rates. The Fed is not infallible. This time, 15 months ago, the Fed saw one rate hike this year. All right. I'm not calling them out. I'm just saying that's what it was. Six months from now, I doubt if the Fed's going to be nearly as hawkish as they are right now. Well, Brian, when you take a look, I guess what we're going to see play out in the markets over the next several weeks. A big, important factor here is going to be earnings. We're starting that tomorrow. We're starting a number of the bigger earnings with some of the bigger banks we heard from Pepsi earlier this week. They were actually able to weather this in certain environment, high inflation very well. What are some areas, or do you think do you spot any trends just in terms of companies that are best positioned to weather some of the downturn that we could see, even though you have a pretty optimistic outlook here. Yeah, that's a great point. So earnings coming up, right? Energy is supposed to have massive earnings growth. We know that. But the number two is industrials. Industrial is supposed to see over 20% year-over-year earnings growth. You don't usually have a recession when that happens. And you look under the service of industrials on a relative strength basis, versus yes and P500. Industrials are breaking out to like one and a half year highs on a relative strength. So to see industrials that strong under the service with small caps, with gin violated, the gin lows, with healthcare hanging in there, with regional banks actually making new highs and relative strength, things are perfect. We get it. But these are some shining lights and some positives that are under there. And industrials to me is a really good looking group that could be a big winner this earnings season. So Ryan, then, for investors watching this, wondering what to make of this period between now and November, how should they be viewing the market? Where are the opportunities? Yeah, kind of hinted at some of them. So we like value over growth still, your industrials, your energy, those materials. I mean, those are some groups that still look pretty good to us. We haven't liked big cap tech for a while, more neutral at best. I just look at this multi-year running growth, right? And technology, some of these names still look kind of top heavy, honestly. So we like kind of small caps look pretty good in value. Those are some areas we still like. We're just big picture, this big bear market that we've had. We think this time six to 12 months or now, I know it's cliche to say, but there are some really good opportunities. Absolutely. That's small caps. Small caps are historically cheap, relative to large caps. That's another positive we think there. All right. Lots of great stuff. A big thank you, Ryan Dietrich, for joining us this afternoon. Have a good one. All right. Coming up, Netflix reveals what's included in its new basic with ads plan. We'll tell you if it stacks up against its rivals. And also be sure to tune in to Yahoo Finance's All Market Summit Monday, starting at 9 a.m. Eastern time, GM CEO Mary Varra, Microsoft CTO, our CEO Satya Nadella are just two of the big industry leaders that will be joining the program.

3268," Picture Let's go. Netflix finally revealing the price of its ad supported tier Yahoo finances. Alexander Canal here with the details. Ali, what can you tell us a lot of the focus here on the price? A lot of focus on the pricing. Six dollars and 99 cents in the US. That's pricing is going to change depending on the country. Roll out in 12 different countries. The bulk of them will be rolling out on November 3rd except Canada, Mexico, November 1st. Users can sign up for this and in Spain, November 10th concludes that roll out. Now in terms of that $6.99 price tag in the US, Netflix told me on an earnings call, but a call prior to the announcement that they are not heavily anchoring the pricing based on competition, especially considering that Netflix Disney with ads cost $7.99. So perhaps a little bit more strategy there, but rather they said they want to provide that entertainment value. The company also shrugged off concerns when it comes to users. Potentially trading down to the ad supported tier, they estimated that total revenue will be neutral to positive with the comparable plan. And then in terms of these ads, how they're going to impact the user experience, four to five minutes of ads per hour with tight frequency caps. So basically they don't want users to see the same ads over and over again. Each ad will be 15 seconds or 30 seconds in length. It'll either be pre-roll or it will air in the middle of programming, which I probably am not going to be do keen about it by a user of this ad tier. But I did get a chance to preview some of these and it looks like the ones that are mid-roll are those on the shorter side about 15 seconds. Should be interesting to see the ad market when this rolls out. They also say Neil Sendata will be part of the next wave. Help or hurt the overall picture for Netflix. I think it definitely helps. Historically, Netflix has been a little bit coy when it comes to viewership that started to change once they began releasing their weekly top 10 list. So this is going to help advertisers really get a sense of the scale for some of these shows and how they can best program their ads within it. We saw Amazon recently partner when Neil Send for more clarity on Thursday night football. So this is something I think is going to be a net positive for Netflix. And I'm sure as soon as this rolls out investors, analysts alike, they're going to be closely watching this one, especially considering Neil Send is the main ratings tracker for a lot of those big cable.",https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6_2e_wGpQzc,77,2022-10-13 19:29:33
3269," Sure, as soon as this rolls out investors, analysts alike, they're going to be closely watching this one, especially considering Nielsen is the main ratings tracker for a lot of those big cable and broadcast television networks. So we're sort of entering this era where broadcasts and streaming are starting to converge. Yeah, and now, I mean, it's no surprise we know that Wall Street, I guess more broadly speaking, has been very bullish on the ad support to tear potentially what that could do in terms of subscriber growth going forward. But Rochelle was interesting that $6.99 price tag was a little surprising. I was expecting it to be a little bit cheaper given the fact that their base plan is at $9.99. I mean, I agree. I think they maybe didn't want to put people off too much. They didn't want there to be such such a big price difference. I actually thought it was a pretty good price myself. I'm still not willing to downgrade because I don't, I just don't like my things being interrupted. My time is precious. I think it was interesting that on the advertiser side though, they sold it on a fixed price basis first and they said that they nearly sold out all their inventory at launch. So at a time when we're seeing a lot of advertisers and marketers pulling back, this they seem to be all in on. Obviously you have a big target right there. I thought that was interesting. And Dave, what do you think? Are you willing to perhaps downgrade? Would you pay a little bit less to get the interruptions? Right, and that's really the big question. How does it change consumer behavior? And so we had a poll about what people would do with this $7 a month for the ad tier. How would it change your Netflix subscription? There's good news and there's bad news in here. The majority of you said you will not change. So that's the good news. I think the bad news is that only encourages 9% of you to join Netflix if you're not already. That is probably not the number that they are hoping for. Now this is a small sample size. For me, I'm in that majority. Yeah, I won't make any change based on a $7 per month price tag. My question is if this doesn't work, what's next? What's the okay then? Because they're not in sports. They're not in news. They said they're not going near it. They're not in merch. They don't have park. They don't have what Amazon or Disney or any of their competitors have. What next? Yeah, and I think that's a really big question that a lot of people are asking themselves. I think right now in terms of content, they should be focusing on buildable, franchise content. They spend a lot of money on these one-off movies that people could just watch and then give up. But what about the multi-series? What about, you know, if you look at something like a Game of Thrones and now they have the prequel House of the Dragon, they're starting to dabble in that a little bit, but I think they need more of that on the content side. And another thing I want to note just on the ad tier, another negative is that there's going to be a limited number of movies and TV shows that will not be available on the ad supported due to licensing agreements. They said it's a very small number. We don't know what. We don't know what. They said between 5 to 10% of overall programming, depending on the country, but that is a lot. And also, you can't download these shows on the ad tier because of technical complex. That is no small number. And if you want to play in, like, the amount of Netflix that I download. That may be the sole reason we have it. That is no small number. You know what? I was all in for downgrading for the ad supported tier. I know. I don't use it that often, but when you go to use it and not being able to have that, that is not a fine print. That is not fine print. That is not fine print. Yeah, that is not fine print. But it isn't going to be interesting to see, I guess, how many new subscribers they are able to get on board here. What you said just in terms of the amount of time for the ads, it was only a 30 second or 15 second mid-of-the-roll. Four to five minutes in an hour. I don't know. 15, 30 seconds. Yeah. It's not that bad, though. It's not terrible, but yeah, I am curious how many people will sign up. Well, we will see soon enough right, Alicanael. Thanks so much. Well, come here up next, Kroger, reportedly going shopping for a merger. We'll tell you who it might be. forbidden店.",https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6_2e_wGpQzc,78,2022-10-13 19:34:07
3270," good It's time for Triple Play, the three stocks that we're watching in the final 30 minutes of trading. We've got Proger, Delta Airlines and Digital World Acquisition Core. So my pick, a US grocery giant in the making with my pick, Proger, Ticket-KR, in talks to my rival Albertsons in an all cash deal according to Bloomberg. Proger shares, as you can see, that up about 1%, but look at Albertsons up more than 11%. Now that announcement is actually possible this week. Proger is the number two grocery seller with a 9.9 market share. You have Albertsons in fourth place with 5.7%, still a long way off to not warm up off the tops while they have more than 20% of market share, according to numerator. Now, if this deal goes through, it would be the largest US retail transaction in years, but it's a big if, though, as regulatory pushback is likely, according to Oppenheimer, due to some of these overlaps in West Coast states, including California and Washington, and also in big metro areas, including Vegas, Phoenix and Chicago, according to Churchill Capital and let's Nick Papas. He also has some rural areas where there aren't that many grocery stores, and they would be the dominant player there. Now, when you have high inflation, we were talking about food prices being up 11%, these sorts of merges have already drawn scrutiny from the Biden administration, so sure we'll have to be keeping a night on this one to see if it goes through. Yeah, I think the regulatory question is here, is really center here, whether or not is going to get approval. If, in fact, we do see this deal happen, it is expected to happen before the end of the week, just leaving tomorrow for it to be announced. I think operationally, the feedback, at least from the street, right away, has been that that would make sense, but of course, the approval process, that is really what is hanging in the balance right now. In terms of how big they are, Proger is already the largest supermarket operator ahead of this potential deal. It has a $32 billion market cap, Albert sends 15 billion, so we do see that combination certainly could potentially change the grocery landscape across the country. All right, my pick today is Delta, the stock jumping after reporting a profit, $695 million for the third quarter, higher fairs helping offset those rising jet fuel prices. Now the carrier also offered upbeat fourth quarter guidance, noting a resurgence in corporate travel and signs of a big holiday rush as two of those driving factors. Now CEO Ed Bashin telling Yahoo Finance earlier that he doesn't see consumers pulling back on spending.",https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6_2e_wGpQzc,79,2022-10-13 19:38:49
3271," in corporate travel and signs of a big holiday rush as two of those driving factors. Now CEO Ed Bashin telling Yahoo Finance earlier that he doesn't see consumers pulling back on spending in terms of travel because of inflation. Rather, he says that they are quote, prioritizing investing in themselves, experiences and services rather than buying things. Despite the near-term positive momentum, though, Raymond James did caution that the lack of detail 2023 guidance is quote, unlikely to switch any investor cost concerns amid labor, fuel and broader macro concerns. Dave, when you take a look at the numbers, initially looking very positive here for Delta, I thought that that point from Raymond James was pretty important here as we go into this uncertain time of potential pullback here in 2023, too much uncertainty to give that detailed guidance. It does make you. I guess wonder how bad. It's just no pullback insight. We also saw on the inflation print today up 8% airfare is month to month and up 43% year over year when you combine the inflation report with the Delta earnings and they're showing no demand destruction. I don't know, man, this is a lot like Pepsi. We just don't see people stopping, traveling, stopping buying some of these consumer staples. The airfare's united was up on this. JetBlue was up on this. American was up on this. All 3 plus percent on the day. So good news for the entire sector. My play is digital world acquisition. Corp shares of the blank check company jumping big time today on news. Former president Donald Trump's truth social media platform will be allowed on the Google Play Store. That covers 44% of all smartphone users who of course have Android devices. It had been banned prior. According to Google, though, truth social agreed to enforce content moderation and to remove and block users who publish posts that insight. Violence, DWAC is currently pushing to extend the deadline for the merger with Trump media currently set for December 8 without the extension or the completion of the merger. They will be forced to liquidate shares are down 94% in the last 12 months, but they are up today. We mentioned the balance 14 plus percent. This on the very day that the House had another public hearing on the January 6th insurrection. They're voting this afternoon to see if they'll deal subpoena Donald Trump. Of course, we'll never see him at these hearings. It'll kick way till after midterm until delay this forever. I'm stunned at this increase, though, Michelle. I give this deal a true social no chance. My perception is deals never changed. I just cannot see a path to success. Not sure about you. Now, I mean, and when they talk about the extensions, we heard from DWAC CEO Patrick Orlando. Basically, he's already said, if they don't get more of these extensions, the deal is going to fall apart. A lot of people were wondering now that this Twitter deal with musk is supposed to go through. Do you still need DWAC? Will you already have a platform? For some of these ones that perhaps sprung up because of the limitations of Twitter, even though there is some hope, obviously, with it being in the Google Play Store, if there's no deal, it doesn't really matter if the app makes it to the Play Store. I think the performance has just been so rough here going back year today with the stock off 64% of these investors are just looking for any sort of good news, which is why we're seeing the pop today. But I'm with you. I really don't think that this excitement in this is going to last. All right, coming up next, the price of grocery rising once again in September. We'll tell you just how much prices are jumping next.",https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6_2e_wGpQzc,80,2022-10-13 19:42:18
3272," Music We're keeping an eye on the oil and energy markets, especially after that hot CPI report showed that the energy prices were up nearly 20% in September compared to a year ago. A very own inesphere is hit with a closer look. And that's what are you seeing? Well we're starting watching oil prices today. We did see a bump in those. You're looking at WTI that's up more than 2% settling at $89.11 per barrel. Meanwhile, Brent Crude settled at $94.50 a per barrel up 2%. Earlier this week, oil prices had been lower over concerns of further rate hikes. So energy prices increased 19.8% in September of that CPI print that you just talked about. That's compared to a year ago, month over month, energy prices declined by 2.1%. And just looking at those components, you had the gasoline index which fell with the natural gas and electricity indices those rows. Shell. I'll find a says inesphere. Thank you for that update. Shona. Well speaking of higher prices, your grocery bill just keeps going up inflation data out today showing September at home food prices up another 7% of a percent on a monthly basis, bringing that year over year surge to just around 13%. And taking a look at some of these costs here, the price of bread jumping 14.7% from a year ago, eggs up more than 30% coffee up nearly 16%. Butter, a pastagorean 26%. Let's bring in Bill Baruch, Blue Line futures, President Bill, when you're looking at prices like that, you have to think it can't keep going up, but it seems to just continue to trend to the upside. Is it going to get even more expensive from here? Well, the sad news is, food prices in the grocery store tend to be some of the most sticky. And once they move those prices up, they may not come back down. But it's going to be a tough one here. And really, it's matters to what the crop looks like. And we're in harvest right now in the U.S., soybeans and corn. But we looked out the South America. They've had a tough planting season with very dry weather. And then, obviously, orange juice. Everybody loves their orange juice. And it could be the worst crop in 80 years. So there's a lot of questions behind that. And that's something that we have Blue Line. We put a lot of agriculture research out daily. And that's something we were poking to back when the Russian invasion of Ukraine started was that these prices had moved up. But once they came off, it was a matter of, you know, what is the U.S. crop look like? There are other factors in the world that are going to impact these prices rather than just the war in Ukraine, which is the bread basket of the global economy.",https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6_2e_wGpQzc,81,2022-10-13 19:47:07
3273," world that are going to impact these prices rather than just the the the war in Ukraine, which is the bread basket of the global economy. Yeah, you know, and we've seen some dent in demand with House and we've seen some dent in demand with used cars, but food is unlike all these things. Of course, fruits and vegetables surged 1.6% for the month. What will bring these prices down if you're the Fed? You know, I think if you're looking at it from the Fed's standpoint, I mean, they they are concerned with the food prices. They are concerned with this stickiness here, but the real question when we're looking at Fed policy and where it's going, the direction it's going, it's it's going to be really rely on OER. The owner's a little bit rent and that's the one third of CPI. It's been extremely sticky. Does it roll over at some point in quarter one? And that could really be the sign that inflation has top. That's that's going to be the question and that's going to allow the Fed to to live their foot off the gas. I mean, you could also you got an interesting move here in the market where where you have the equities and then really commodities have begun to follow and really all sets started with the US dollar. The US dollar spiked on on the hot CPI number, but once the US dollar came off, it's allowed for a relief of downward pressures and stocks in commodities. And so once you get this move back up, you're actually you're reflating these assets. Now, not at this level, but does the move continue and that's something we've been noting at the like futures too is the potential blowoff top in the US dollar really began about two weeks ago at the end of September with with the UK move and how the cable had fallen out of bad and you know the end of the euro were already pretty weak, but when you get sharp reversals like that in the US dollar that began in potentially a lower high right now, we could be at the start of a top in the dollar which will stoke prices and your grocery bill make it to be higher, just simply because of commodities being priced and dollars will rise. Bill, when we're trying to figure out I guess how much higher just in terms of percentage, are we talking a couple of percent? Are we talking a huge jump that we could potentially see? What do you think? Huge jump in the average food prices at the grocery bill. Well, you know, if you look at things, I saw an anecdote of a I saw on Twitter somewhere and I wish I could credit the person that tweeted it or retweeted it, but it was a picture of a bakery and a picture out of bakery and the baker had put a list of every ingredient and the cost. And everything across the board from granulated sugar to flour to powdered sugar to eggs, everything was doubled to maybe even almost triple the price. So you're seeing things, those prices that he's stating, I'm sure he's buying it as some sort of wholesale or, but you're looking at prices that have increased dramatically much more than what you may see in these CPI numbers. So the real hard cost that's hitting home is much more and that's the problem. And even different distortions that have taken place throughout the year, I mean, there's been different sort of different fires at different, different meat processing plants, outages at meat processing plants, chicken farms, things like that have also had an impact. And it's really odd to see that such a wide number of those taking place, but there's been, you know, these sorts of distortions that are taking place in this post-pandemic world that have also stoke prices higher. Want to quickly pivot to energy? We saw some relief there in the inflation print, but of course, that number's lagging and gas prices now up to 391 from 370 a month ago, where they headed. Well, you know, we've been extremely bullish energy for a, for really since June, June of 2020. And it's something that we put out research every single day at Blue Line Futures. And I personally write about the S&P, the NASDAQ, crude oil, and silver and gold. And specifically for crude oil, we've always had a bullish tone. We actually went neutral when crude oil did break below $93 back in August. I think it was August, you know, early September. And at that point, we said, you know, look for $75. $75 could be the floor. We traded down to 76 to crude. And we've responded off this massive level of support that really a cleansing, if you will, of prices. I mean, a lot of people from a trading perspective.",https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6_2e_wGpQzc,82,2022-10-13 19:51:03
3274," and we've responded off this massive level of support that really a cleansing, if you will, of prices. I mean, a lot of people from a trading perspective got, you know, sort of ingrained that crude oil by the dip, by the dip, and you're going to get paid, continue to buy the dip, and we needed a little bit of a cleansing. It really wasn't that much of a cleansing, but it allowed some relief and for the price of crude oil to go higher. Now we're back, you know, in roughly $90, let's call it, although we're a bit below here today. It really matters, you know, with OPEC taking production offline. I don't think that, you know, the headline drop of two million barrels per day in their production was, is the actual impact. It's more like 900,000 barrels per day, but it's definitely created some geopolitical tensions, which I think could stoke the price of oil higher. However, I'm not extremely bullish right now. And I've actually put a neutral tone in our research because they do think with the White House right now they're throwing the kitchen sink to try and keep prices suppressed. I don't think this is a good thing. And I think it's going to hurt in the end. But in the near term, over say the next month, you have this expiration of the November futures contract coming up next week, and then you get to the end of the month and then in midterm elections. I think that the White House will continue to release SPR and sort of go face to face here with Saudi Arabia. That could keep prices suppressed in the near term. And I think that would just be a tremendous buying opportunity back on your 80 bucks if we get it. Yeah, prices above four bucks by the midterms, bad news for the Biden administration. All right, Bill Baruch, Blue Line futures. Good to see you, Matt. Thank you. Coming up, Apple and Goldman Sachs are teaming up again. Stay tuned to hear what they're offering you. Next. Next. Next.

3275," We're seeing obviously Apple going even further with this ecosystem. We're really trying to make sure they're tapping to every part of your life. What do you think about this move? No, I love me some Apple pay. I do. I'm addicted. I use it every day for multiple times a day. I do think it is smart. We know that Apple has been focused on their services segment. This obviously would be a next. I guess pushed us into the whole payment space. There are rumors also that it's coming out with an affirm competitor in terms of buy now, pay later that they'll reportedly be pushed to next year. I think the interest though that's going to be offered is going to be key to this. Like Rochelle just said Dave, we don't have any details just in terms of what exactly that's going to be. Bangra did take a look at some of the competitor offerings out there saying that they're in the 2.2 percent to 3.05 percent range. It makes sense. I don't know how widely used it's going to be, but I think it's a natural step here for Apple. Initially, maybe not, but long term, I think this is huge upside for Apple and frankly, no downside for you, the consumer. I mean, there's no annual fee. There's no minimum deposit. There's no balance requirement. So what is the downside? You're going to have this dashboard on your phone that shows you the cash back. You're getting into your account. So it's kind of an immediate gratification thing. And to your point, services is where it's all about. We talk a lot about iPhone sales, but services, music, Apple TV, cloud, news plus. Fitness plus and now banking and the other side of this we haven't talked about is the Goldman Sach side of this, which is interesting. They become more like a conventional bank in this aspect and have access now to consumer deposits, which changes the whole picture for Goldman Sachs and all upside in that regard too. So hard to think of a downside other than more information that we're giving to Apple, but at this point, we're throwing in that. Yeah. And you're right to point out it is a huge win for Goldman too. They have clearly been working on growing their markets business. It hasn't grown on, I don't think as maybe as quickly as some had initially anticipated that it would be now that this gives them more exposure, exposure here to consumer deposits, which is a huge win for Goldman in that consumer push for show. I mean, as you bring up markets there, when you think of how many iPhones and people's pockets, the sort of collaboration here, I mean, this is a huge win, I think for both sides. So one will definitely be keeping an eye on. Alright, coming up, we're counting down to the closing bell on Wall Street.

Let's bring in Jared Blyckery to break down the glowing market action because of course we rally on bad inflation prints. That's what we do, man. That is correct. But I'll tell you what, this is actually good news. Actually bad news is good news. We're going to figure that out. All right, I want to show you the NASDAQ here. That is up over 2 and 1 third percent. But you really get a feel for what happened today if you look at the futures. This is the S&P 500. Just want to show you that. Was that dip on CPI? And this is what a recovering rally looks like. Now, if you take a year-to-date look on the candlesticks, I just want to show you this huge green candle down here. You can see it even better on this three-month chart. Wow, that is a reversal. I went back in history. The last time we got a new 52-week low and a big upside reversal closing up, 2 percent and more. Bunch of these caught the bottom in a bunch of bear market. So I'm going to be writing this up for tomorrow. You guys watch out for it. In the meantime, I want to leave you with a few heat maps here. Here's a sector action for today. Those value stacks up more than 4 percent energy and financials. Tech also up more than 3 percent and materials right there with them. Those are all the outperformers. I'm just going to show you what the NASDAQ 100 looks like on a good update. There you go. Apple up 3 percent. So is Microsoft Tesla up 2 percent, guys. And here's the closing bell on Wall Street on this Thursday. Right before my birthday. We hope Jared's birthday does help the good news here. Continue with the rally on Wall Street. Now of 825 points, this would be up 2.6 percent NASDAQ up just over 2 percent today, a huge reversal from what we saw shortly after the opening year. You look at some of the sector action that we're seeing today. All 11 of the S&P sectors moving to the upside, some of the largest gains coming from energy, financials and technology. So you're going to take a closer look at the action that we saw today. Let's bring in Ross Bayfield, Baird Investment Strategy, analyst. We also have Joanne Fini, advisors, capital management partner and portfolio manager. Great to see both of you. Ross, let me start with you just in terms of the reversal that we saw today. The bad news is good news here for the market. What do you make of it? Well, look, I'm a long-term bull. I'm an optimist, but reading that CPI report, I found it difficult to find any good news. Core CPI accelerating, broadening out. Presents a real problem for the Federal Reserve. So to me, maybe this was a sell the news type of event or just a sentiment positioning reversal, but it doesn't change the path of the Fed. It doesn't change what they have to do over the coming months. So maybe a lot of it was priced in getting near those 2022 lows. However, it's hard to find a lot of good news out of the CPI report this morning. I'll take the good day when we can get it, but maybe if there's good news, you can tell where it was. So, Joanna, hopefully you can help us figure this out, given how much stickiness we saw in this CPI report. Well, you know what? When I was a kid, he played Twister, and you have to be pretty skilled at Twister to figure this one out, I think. But bending over backwards a little bit, one can imagine that this print showing how resilient and broad inflation is and the challenges of the labor shortage and wage pressures does make it very clear that the Fed has to be adamant about solving this problem. It gives the Fed no wiggle room, which means that the Fed is going to raise rates and continue to raise rates until it solves the problem. Now, for the long term economic health of the United States, that's a good thing, because it really means that we're going to get this inflation problem under control. The Fed's not going to have an opportunity to pull.",https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6_2e_wGpQzc,85,2022-10-13 20:04:02
3277," long-term economic health of the United States, that's a good thing because it really means that we're going to get this inflation problem under control. The Fed's not going to have an opportunity to pause or to go light. So that might be something that's convincing investors that, okay, the Fed has no choice. They're going to have to solve this problem. Not going to be any wiggle room. There's no chance they're going to pause and make a mistake. You know, so a longer term, it could be that investors are saying, okay, the bad news is all in at this point. There's no room to maneuver around this. Fed's going to have to go raise rates. They're going to solve this problem. Longer term, we're going to have inflation come back towards that 2% target, and that's going to be good for the ultimate economic growth of the United States economy, which means maybe it's time to get into these companies that ultimately are going to do well in a healthy economy. We know there's a lot of cash sitting on the sidelines, and we've seen it before over the summer with these little tentative dips and rallies. It's a time to get back ending to own these stocks because a lot of them have gotten cheap. So I think it's partly all the cash that was sitting on the sidelines. And now I think it's conviction that the Fed will have no choice but to be adamant and determined about solving the inflation problem. And ultimately, that's good for the long run health of the U.S. economy. Dre, I'm outstanding at Twister. Far be it for me to solve this riddle, though. I can not even begin to explain that rally, but there is some optimism in your voice. Ross, do you see any opportunity? Yeah, absolutely. We'll look with sentiment as negative as it's gotten. Positioning as negative as it's gotten. Valuation, both in fixed income and in stocks, approaching something like we haven't seen in quite some time. I think there's some real opportunity if you're a long-term investor to start lagging in to, if you want to average in during this volatile time. So yeah, there are sectors we like, sectors that we think have tougher roads ahead, but overall, if you're a long-term investor, we haven't seen a starting point like this in quite some time. Now, it might be a rocky road in the near term, but we're long-term optimists. So if you want to look at sectors, energy leading to that, I think is a really good example of a sector that's been leadership that has a really good trend is going to have some really good earnings quarters over the next few quarters. On the flip side, the fact that the Nasdaq trail today, I think is emblematic that some of those big tech names are still a lot to work through before they become kind of the tech names that were used to over the last decade again. Joanne, you teased some of your picks too. Give us it inside scoop. What do you like in this market? Yeah, so when you're potentially heading into a recession, even if it's not so severe, something we've seen in the past, right? One way to help your portfolio during a time when some stocks are going to be weaker, they're going to be more aligned on consumer spending in the short term, is to move towards stocks that have the growth opportunity that's really structural. We still need more data centers. We still need more internet capacity. There's a lot more use of the internet from not just consumers, but firms, IOT devices, whether that's cars or factory equipment. So that's something that still needs lots of investment. And so the company's that enable that, whether it's parts or chips or software, cybersecurity is another area, which is going to be under continued pressure. Palo Alto is one of our favorites in that cloud data center space, whether it's a Broadcom or an Amazon. I know it wasn't one of the ones that rallied today, but they're a critical provider and it's mostly traded down on the retail side. And then you can go to a real contrary and play and look at home builders. Because the fact of the matter is with rental costs so high as we saw in the CPI print, people have to live somewhere and this millennial generation needs housing. And as rents get more expensive, that makes housing even with high mortgage rates, you know, something that becomes more palatable. What we're seeing is them trade down, getting rid of some of the extras on those new homes and buying something cheaper to help offset the high mortgage rates. So we really like Lunar. It's trading at 5.8 times. And we think that, you know, you'll be real happy with that kind of purchase over the next three, you know, three plus years and potentially even sooner. And Ross, I know you said you take the longer the, but for some people who perhaps have a short a time horizon, where do you see opportunities? I mean, near term, I think the volatility is likely to continue and we are headed towards some sort of economic slowdown. I mean, that is the intention of the Fed, whether it's a soft landing or a hard landing, you know, there is a slowdown coming.",https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6_2e_wGpQzc,86,2022-10-13 20:08:29
3278," are headed towards some sort of economic slowdown. I mean, that is the intention of the Fed, whether it's a soft landing or a hard landing, there is a slowdown coming. And so you want to position defensively and you want to position with leadership. Now, it's kind of a more near-term tactical view of it. Again, I actually think at these rates, at these yields, treasuries, some investment grade debt, starts to look really attractive. But on the equity side, like I said, I think energy is leadership. I think being a little bit more defensive in the near-term probably makes some sense because the Fed will continue to raise rates at least into the first quarter of next year. Inflation, as it proved today, is broad, is still a problem. And so we're headed towards a slowdown, even if milder by historical standards. And we think that's the case, given where the labor market is and given the consumer position. It's still a slowdown. There still will be some contraction of earnings. And so you want to position for that in those kinds of sectors. And certainly the Fed, not going off course, especially with this latest CPI data. A big thank you to our market panel, Ross Mayfield and Joe Anfini. Thank you so much. All right, well, the January 6th committee has voted to subpoena form of President Donald Trump for both testimony and documents. It's his, in his final hearing before the midterm elections, the committee played dramatic, never-before-seen video of what was happening as members of Congress sought safety. Take a listen. There has to be some way we can maintain the sense that people have that there's some security or some confidence that government can function and that we can elect the president of the United States. Do we go back into session? We think go back into session, but now apparently everybody on the floor is putting on a three-guest mask to prepare for a breach. We're trying to get more information, putting on their tear gas masks. We also learn this afternoon, the Supreme Court rejected Trump's request to intervene in the fight over the classified documents seized from his Mar-a-Lago property. Now, there were no dissents. All right, coming up, mortgage rates hit a 20-year high but didn't even more pressure on home buyers. That's it.",https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6_2e_wGpQzc,87,2022-10-13 20:12:37

3280," that the supply picture will improve with builders earlier this year in the first six months, really ramping up construction of single-family homes. But they have gotten obviously a naturally spooked by the developments in the market, the pullback on the buyer side. So they are cutting back on single-family. They are actually continuing with the multi-family side. But for home sellers, the interesting picture is after roughly two months May and June where we saw new listings on realtor.com pick up. We've actually seen them retreat. It seems that for a lot of homeowners, they are worried that they have missed the peak of the market and many of them are holding back. And I'll add there is a seasonality component, right? We are past the peak market activity. Summergenesis, most volume and naturally fall in winter. We see a slight fallback from that. But by and large, I think for a lot of sellers, the real concern right now is if they are looking for a trade-up home, they're paying higher price plus a lot higher mortgage rates. So that might end up locking in effectively a lot of potential sellers over the next few months. Is the Fed going to break something in the housing sector, George? Well, the Fed is already, and we heard Jerome Powell already say that its intent is to significantly cool housing, right? He used the words housing correction is needed because the over competitive pace we signed 2020-2021 have put a lot of people on the sidelines. So I think as far as the Fed is concerned, the correction we're seeing in housing in terms of demand pulling back, medium prices are already coming down from their summer peaks. These are in a sense, is the very prescription the Fed is trying to apply to housing and bike extrapolation, the economy. I think for a lot of market watchers, the question is, has the Fed done enough, at least based on CPI not yet? And so, you know, the Fed do too much, right? Can we have too much of an over correction? And I think the jury is still out on both accounts. So the Adelec had balanced the Fed trying to make their due a graduate from Realtor.com. Thank you so much for joining us this afternoon. All right, well, Social Security's cost of living adjustment for 2023 will increase 8.7 percent as the largest gains since 1981. Now, who finances Kerry Hanon joins us with the details, Kerry, what do we need to know? Well, I'm telling you, this is a big bump up. It's really going to allow Social Security recipients to tread water a bit better, right? I mean, we've seen this big bump up and inflation this year. This will make a big difference in their checks starting in January. Again, this will be, you know, for the average check, maybe $140 in each monthly check will be a bump up for an average one. And so it's really important to focus on this as something that a lot of people think of retirees living on a fixed income. Well, guess what? Social Security is not fixed. It is adjusted for inflation. So even though it's a little backwards looking, moving forward into 2023, we'll be seeing some breathing room. Let's say they're going to get some breathing room. And Michelle, you partner this with the Medicare, the dip in the premiums for the Plan B premiums coming up in 2023. And that's a nice little boost for retirees looking at what has been a tough year this year in pain for groceries and rent and gasoline and all those other things. So this is welcome news. And Carrie, speaking of high inflation, I bonds, I want to bring this up because of rates on I bonds, even though they have been very strong here, they're expected to drop. What can you tell us about that? Yeah, yeah, good one. Because they are tied to this whole issue that the equation gets out now. We're not going to know officially until November 1st, because they get adjusted twice a year, May 1st, November 1st. This what the analysts I talked to today said, now right now through the end of October, these I bonds are paying 9.62 percent. But what we're looking at moving forward for that November 1 number based on the CPI numbers, which goes into that equation, is around 6.4 percent. Could be 6.5. But what happens is, and the Treasury is suggesting, if you go to Treasury direct right now, they're saying try to get that, you know, lock in by the 28th of October so that you have your bond in hand by the 31st. But here's the good news. You'll get paid for the first",https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6_2e_wGpQzc,89,2022-10-13 20:21:27
3281," you know, lock in by the 28th of October so that you have your bond in hand by the 31st. But here's the good news. You'll get paid for the first six months that you hold that bond, that old rate, that 9.62 percent. And then after that, the next six months, say it is the 6.4 that we're looking at, you get the combination of the two, which I'm telling you, it's pretty attractive. It could be like, say, 8 percent for the year. So this is something, as I often say, this is a not a sexy investment, but it is a safe investment. Certainly an investment that has really gained popularity here over the last several months. I'm sure we will continue to talk about it. Carrie Henning, thanks so much for joining. Well, coming up, Amazon's slew of smart devices aim to make your home life easier, but they also collect a lot of your data. Stay tuned to hear just how much next. Amazon's second prime day event of the year or prime early access sale as retail giant is calling it has concluded and the numbers are in. Now, according to market research site numerator, the two day sales all nearly 45,000 prime orders from almost 19,000 households. Now, the average spend on those orders was around 100 bucks with most households placing just one order over those 48 hours. This site also broke down purchases by category with household essentials being the most popular, comprising 29 percent of purchases and health and beauty and apparel and shoes that coming in second and third respectively. About 29 percent of shoppers say that they use the sale to buy holiday gifts with Amazon gift cards being the most popular item.

3282," While you might soon be able to be unboxing some of these new shiny Amazon devices, the online retail giant slew of smart home devices are collecting a treasure trove of data from its millions of customers. So what does Amazon know about you and what's it doing with that information? What you're joining us now to discuss this is Washington Post Technology Colomest, Jeff Fowler. Go to have you on the show. Obviously, even when we were looking at the data, 12% of the purchases made there for Amazon Prime on these smart devices, I got a ring, I've got an echo. What does, what information did these devices collect for Amazon? Well, are you ready to get a little creeped out because I spent the last couple of weeks just trying to tally it all up. You know, I'm a tech columnist and I have many of these products in my own home where I've used them over the years. So I just tried to add it all up and I made a little list to share with you just to the top level here is Amazon. If you get their dream home, if you buy all their gadgets, they'll gather data about you when you're talking, when you're sleeping, when you walk by them, when you show your face, when you cough, when you snore, when you come home or leave home, when you turn on the lights, when you turn up the heat, when you play a music, when you watch TV, I mean, I could keep going and going and going with this list. The point is, you know, Amazon has pushed much further than any other big tech company, not only to make devices for this smart home, but also to make sure that they're collecting data out of them that they can use for their own purposes. I have to point out, Jeff Bezos happens to own the Washington Post. So it's listening to you right now, maybe the bosses. After knowing all this, do you still have an Amazon smart device plugged in in your home and what was the most concerning form of data that it is recording? Yeah. So I think the one that is the most popular in America is the Echo speaker. It's in fact one of the best selling speakers of all time. I do have something in my house. I'm a little bit unusual because I'm the tech guy for the Washington Post. So my job is to have all the things. So I also have the Apple one and I have the Google one. In terms of what is the most disturbing kind of information, for me, it's the stuff where Amazon just doesn't even give you a choice for them to collect all this data and to keep it, for example, their ring, doorbells and security cameras. They used to tell people that, oh, you're totally in control of what happens with that data. But we've now learned that there are about a dozen cases so far this year where Amazon has just handed over that footage to police without the permission of their owners. So I think stuff like that is really the areas where people Americans are going to get kind of upset here. So Jeff, two things, is there something that people can opt out of or if they're not comfortable with that? And also, from what I understand, Amazon doesn't sell the data. So then what are they actually doing with it? Yeah, so two really good points. This is sort of what Amazon always likes to say. It's actually lines that they borrowed from Facebook before, right? Facebook also doesn't sell our data. Yet they seem to have done plenty of use for it. And they, you know, Facebook also offers you lots of little opt out buttons. The truth is the default matter and the defaults for many of Amazon services just collect a lot more data. They just know that you're not going to bother to go in and change the setting that tells them not to keep recordings of stuff that goes on in your house, for example. So yes, you can do it. And in fact, we made a guide at the Washington Post as our privacy research guide, or we'll like walk you through a bunch of the settings you can adjust for Amazon to get them to collect less data. But you know, most people really just aren't going to take the time. And that's kind of the problem. And now they've got this $140 halo rise, which tracks your breathing during your sleep. God knows what else to what end? What do you think Amazon is trying to accomplish here? You know, Amazon is, it understands that data is power. You know, it's the oil of our economy. And with all of this data about our lives, they can do a lot of stuff. Many of their more recent acquisitions, in fact, have involved, and products have involved their bodies, right? They're trying to buy one medical, they bought a pill pack, the pharmacy company, products like the halo, and they also have the halo tracker or gather data about their body. One of their visions is to become kind of the AI doctor.",https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6_2e_wGpQzc,91,2022-10-13 20:30:07
3283," products like the Halo, I mean also the Halo tracker are gathered data about their body. One of their visions is to become kind of the AI doctor and to be able to do that, to be able to provide useful information to people, they just need to know a lot about our bodies. So we are giving it to them. In some cases, we're paying them to let them gather data about us, but they can then analyze and try to use and sell back to us later. It makes me feel even worse. We've talked about Echo and Ring, but even things like smart blinds. For people who are sort of ring comparisons with things like SkyNet and wondering where does this go from here? When it is, where does it is, in terms of AI and robotics, you've got your room being now nosy as it's vacuuming your house. How should consumers take this? What should they take away from this report? Yeah, I think a couple of things. First of all, everybody's going to have to make their own decisions about what they're comfortable with a company knowing about them, and also what they're comfortable with one of the largest corporations in human history knowing about them. Amazon should get some pressure back from us for those of us who think that it's collecting too much and storing too much, and they should be hearing this. So I hope they're listening to our conversation here today, because I think a lot of their customers feel this way. The other thing is, they don't have to design their products this way. We're often kind of given false choices as tech consumers that, you know, well, you know, either they're going to take all our data or we won't get to live in the future. And it's just not true. They don't have to design their products. And in fact, some of their competitors have not, if you look at the way that Apple, for example, handles a lot of smart-hung devices and data, they work very hard to make sure that they're not storing it, that they're not keeping it. So I think it's really just about us as consumers pushing back and saying, hey, we have some rights here to Amazon. Of course, everybody wants your data, including meta who roll down this new VR headset, $1500, you got to try this thing out. Your thoughts on it, and your thoughts on the metaverse, where we are right now. Yeah. Well, since we were just talking about privacy, I'll tell you the one eyebrow-raising thing about this new headset, is that it contains a whole bunch of cameras now on the inside that are looking at your eyes or eyebrows or cheeks, your mouth, you name it. And it's kind of a lot of information to know about our bodies. And I was really not satisfied with meta's answer about how they were going to keep that data private. So they say they're going to process it on the device, but they're still letting apps have access to it. So the question is, are we in a near future? Let's say you're watching Netflix, and Netflix could gather data about when you laugh at certain points in the show or when you're crying, because that's the kind of thing that this technology will enable. On the metaverse more broadly, it's been seven years since the first Facebook Oculus product came out of the Rift. I reviewed that at the time, and when I was sitting down looking through the six demos that meta gave me of the new Quest Pro, I was kind of struck by, we haven't really gotten very far. I think the term I used in my review for the post was, it's the Metaverse. It just doesn't really push the boundary that far. It's never felt further away the idea that the metaverse is a place where lots of us in our normal everyday lives, where jobs and being creative are going to use this thing. It feels like they've really got a long ways to go. A long, long way to go. Wash your post tech columnist, Jeff Fowler. Great to have you, man. Appreciate it. You bet.

3284,84 Today's CPI friend came in hotter than expected at 8.2% but our senior column this Rick Newman has found some bright spots in today's report. Rick we have been asking so many guests over the last two hours to give us some good news no one's been able to do it so tell us what you think is good in this report. Well you have to squint a little bit but I've been paying a lot of attention to what's happening in transportation and if you look at what has happened with the inflation rate for new cars and especially for used cars the inflation rate is actually coming down. Remember when the price of used cars at the beginning of the year the annual inflation rate was like 45% for used cars and we were all like how did that happen? Well we know now that the price of used cars was surging by so much because there weren't enough new cars. There has been a persistent shortage of new cars available and that has a lot to do with the semiconductor shortage. That shortage is still there but it's getting worked out and we have seen the inflation rate for used cars come down from around 45% of an annualized rate earlier this year. The annual rate now is around 7.5% I think that's still too high but at least that situation is getting better and of course gasoline inflation has been improving but it seems like we've seen the end of the gas price decline and it's probably going to stabilize around $3.90. The rest of the report there are a lot of things going wrong and we are not getting the break in inflation that a lot of people have been hoping for. Yeah how big a concern is this for President Biden said today the report shows some progress against his fight against tire prices. Perhaps you explain what that progress is but how big an issue is this for Democrats? Remember just a couple of months ago Democrats in Congress passed an energy bill that they named the Inflation Reduction Act. I think one of the reasons that they gave it that actually silly name is that when inflation does come down inevitably it will they'll be able to say see we did that because we passed this thing called the Inflation Reduction Act. It worked. It was like magic. Without a doubt they hoped they would be able to say that by the time of the mid-term uh,https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6_2e_wGpQzc,93,2022-10-13 20:38:56
3285," They'll be able to say, see, we did that because we passed this thing called the inflation reduction act. It worked. It was like magic. Without a doubt, they hoped they would be able to say that by the time of the midterm elections, which are now less than a month away in on November 8th. And they can't. They cannot say that we have meaningfully brought inflation down. I mean, it's down about a little more than a percentage point from the high point it was at over over the summer, but an inflation at 8.2%. Nobody is going to declare victory on that. I guess the one thing Democrats can hope for is that the big declining gas prices has made people feel a little bit better that has corresponded with a minor uptick in consumer confidence and a similar small uptick in President Biden's approval rating. But it hasn't gone high enough. Biden's approval is around 43 or 44%. I think for Democrats to have a good shot at holding on to both houses of Congress, Biden's approval would have to be around 50% even higher. And he just is not going to get their by November 8th. So this is last inflation report we're going to get before the midterm elections. We are going to have one more employment report and we're going to have one more federal reserve meeting. But everybody now seems to think the Fed is is certain to raise by another three quarters of a point and other big height coming. So if inflation comes down, it's going to have to come after the midterms. Yeah, it's going to need gas prices to stay with a three in front of it as well. Rick Newman, good to see us. Sir, thank you. Diet and exercise is so pre pandemic. The new way to lose weight is through diabetes drugs, even Elon Musk tweeting his endorsement of the drug wagovie. What's the investor story behind this and other diabetes drugs in demand now? Michael Nadalkvic is the vice president of equity research at Cohen, good to see us. Sir, so novosy only company with FDA approval to market wagovie. They also make ozempic in that category. You have 130 dollar price target on novo. How much does that factor in what could be a game changer in weight loss? Yeah, so you know, novo Nordisk is one of the leaders in diabetes and they're really an execution story. Yeah, they market one of the marquee drugs and what's called the GLP one class. That's the drug ozempic that you mentioned, which is indicated for diabetes treatment. And this class of drugs, where as I mentioned, novo is one of the leaders is growing at a double digit rate. And that seems to be something we can expect for the foreseeable future. So based almost entirely on their prospects and diabetes, we think novo Nordisk is a company that investors should take a look at. In the meantime, they have this outsized opportunity in obesity treatment. And obesity is a market that at least to date has not materialized in a real way for various reasons, but we think that that is always to change and novo Nordisk is really the tip of the sphere and is well positioned to take advantage of what could be a multi billion dollar opportunity over the next few years. Yeah, Michael. And the govie is the marquee drug there. Yeah, Michael, give us a better sense just on when you talk about the massive opportunity there. How big it could be in five years from now. What more specifically do you think that number could potentially look like? So I'll actually defer in part to novo Nordisk guidance. So their ambition is to sell 25 billion DKK in 2025 that that's roughly five billion or so a little bit less in US dollars and obesity drugs. So, you know, that kind of brings estimates down to earth a little bit. If you look at just the number of people in the US and globally that have obesity or overweight, it's hundreds of millions. And so you can get to some eye watering estimates pretty quickly if you if you dial up the penetration rate. Historically, hurdle to penetration of these drugs has been payers and market access. We think that's beginning to change, but that will probably be a headwind that that brings estimates closer to where novo Nordisk's mind is for 2025 and beyond. Stunning number on our screen nearly 42% of this country is obese. I know you do not cover Eli Lilly, but the FDA did agree to a quick review of their competitive drug, which is Moongaro. Are they similar in makeup and how they work? And how does this change the cap the ceiling for novo? So I'll quibble just a little bit with your question there. You know, the FDA's.",https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6_2e_wGpQzc,94,2022-10-13 20:43:00
3286," Does this change the cap the ceiling for Novo? Yeah, so I'll quibble just a little bit with your question there. You know, the FDA is requiring two of the four phase three trials for the drug is called Terzepity from Lily before they'll review it for obesity. And those are already due to read out in kind of Q2, Q3 of 2023. So the it might not be all that quick, although it is quicker than perhaps it could have been. But you know, in a market like obesity, which is really nascent. And as I said, we think is beginning to materialize in a real way. You know, the phrase arising tide lifts all boats probably has never applied more. So Lily entering the market with Terzepity, which is a highly effective weight loss drugs, it acts similarly to the way that Novo Nordic we go. He does. It is perhaps slightly more efficacious, perhaps slightly less tolerable, though that's to be determined in real world use. It's probably good for both companies and we think there are more than enough patients to address with both drugs. Michael, what can you tell us just about the cost of these drugs? Yeah, so you know, we actually know the list prices. So we go, if you just as an example, as a list price around $1,500 a month. But if it's covered by your insurance, you would pay something well below that. You know, so out of pocket, we don't anticipate in the US at least it'll be a major out of pocket market for these drugs. They're probably to expensive. Very interesting. How do both of these work or all of these drugs in this category essentially appetites a presence and therefore really band aids that you'd have to stay on potentially indefinitely? Yeah. So they do work primarily through appetite suppression, although there's some other mechanisms where they provide health benefits. You should, if you're on one of these drugs, physicians should keep a patient on them indefinitely. And there's solid data that demonstrates that if the patient goes off, then the weight comes back. So that's how they're labeled. That's how they're intended to be used. We'll see in the real world what treatment durations actually look like. But it's not really a band aid in that sense. You know, obesity is an illness and these are drugs that are meant to treat that illness in a way that's very similar to diabetes where it's a chronic disease and they need to be treated chronically. Michael Nadelka, Vitch of a cow and thanks so much for joining us. Really appreciate your insight. Yeah. Thank you.

Add the corn mustard Maggaret sophisticated Add the networking Amazon, Walmart and Target have already released their holiday hiring plans, but the news may point to signs of weakness in the labour market. Julia Pollack, Zyprakruti Chief Economist, joins me now as part of our career control series sponsored by Straight Talk Wireless. Julia, good to have you back on the show. So as we look at some of the trends that we've been seeing, so as we look at some of the trends that we've been seeing in hiring, leading up to the holidays, what does that tell us though? As we take a look back, as we take a step back and look at the overall market right now. Oh, I just... This is about the toughest environment that employers can be in for holiday hiring. So on the one hand, you have a situation where employers really don't want to be caught flat, but if they don't want to risk under hiring, when there's going to be a surge of demand, but they also are very concerned about the future outlook and the possibility of a downturn, and so they don't want to over hire. And so they're being a bit cautious and a little bit slow to kick off holiday hiring. And even as we look at the market, solid but supply constrained labour market, it's as it for crypto described, jobless claims are rising 9,000 to 228,000. What is your reaction to this job claims data and what this means for where we really are in the labour market? So layoffs and firings remain very, very low and that jobless claims number is incredibly low by historical standards. So there aren't yet too many layoffs taking place. In the most recent jobs report, we saw that job gains remain incredibly broad based over the past 12 months they've been broader than ever before. And yet there are some industries that are disproportionately affected by rising interest rates, by high inflation, by a strong dollar, and we are seeing some pain there. So for example, consumers are getting a little bit more wary about big ticket purchases. They can't dip into their house and use it as a piggy bank quite as easily anymore. And so car dealerships have shed jobs in the last month and so have building supply stores. So it's not easy to pay for your renovation by refinancing your house. And obviously as we talk a lot about things like hiring, freezes, job losses, we are seeing it in some sectors more than others as we talk about the tech sector often on here. But we're also seeing a lot more strategic hiring. So what are some of the more in demand positions and some of the really prime candidates that some of these companies are targeting right now? So this has been a very exciting time where because the labour market is so supply constrained, companies have had to streamline and centralise their hiring processes and revamp them quite dramatically. So companies are doing things like speeding up the time to hire. They're also increasingly posting jobs remotely and advertising them in multiple environments so that they can increase diversity and speed. Those are the two things that many companies are going for now. They're learning to hire for skills, not degrees and experience, and to sort of try to figure out who is going to be a good fit even if they don't fit the traditional mold. And they're having some success. These experiments are paying off and I think we're going to see innovations in hiring that improve the candidate experience and employee experience for generations to come. So talk about some of those innovations because on the one hand you have quiet quitting. You have a lot of people who could be lost in first up when they look at who perhaps could be most at risk. And you look at who's most at risk and where you see the future of work heading with innovation. What is that telling?",https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6_2e_wGpQzc,96,2022-10-13 20:52:04
3288," A lot of people who could be, you know, lost in first up when they look at who perhaps could be most at risk. When you look at who's most at risk and where you see the future of work heading with innovation, what is that telling you? So this is a labor market where there is still an increase in remote work in parts of the economy where there's tremendous potential. That increase has huge implications for the geography of work in America. We're seeing people increasingly open to moving in our monthly zippercruder job-seeker surveys. They are also being pushed by inflation in rent prices to consider opportunities more broadly across the country. Employers are also looking at candidates and increasingly hiring regardless of location. So that's one exciting move where people are sort of moving around for opportunity. And then we're also seeing an increase in the extent to which employers are having to behave in their HR departments like sales teams and like advertising and marketing teams. They are being more proactive. They are finding candidates passive talent often. People before they even apply and actively reaching out to them in our most recent survey, 37% of Americans hired in the last six months said that they had been reached out to. They had been recruited by someone at the company. So the job found them, they didn't have to find it. Now I also want to get your reaction. Obviously the Labour Department proposing this shift in gig workers being classified potentially as employees. You also have boomers being sort of left out of this, of this research and people coming back into the workforce and how that could impact the economy. How do you see some of these potential changes impacting what we see in the labour force say in the next year or so? So gig work, you know, we see in all the research that has been done is very valuable for workers because of its flexibility and converting those jobs into permanent payroll positions while it would improve benefits and have many benefits would also reduce that flexibility. And so there are trade-offs and I think those will become sort of abundantly clear as we go down that path. When it comes to labour force participation, you know, primate workers, even women, encouragingly have mostly recovered, almost fully recovered. We've seen younger workers actually see a boost in their employment opportunities and we've seen participation rise among teenagers and among workers with disabilities. So some people have been given better opportunities before because employers are expanding their recruiting efforts and because jobs have become more inclusive with the rise of remote work. That said, older workers have left this economy in much larger numbers than in any prior recession. They were displaced in enormous numbers. They faced the largest barriers to returning and it seems as though they are no longer coming back in large numbers. So they will leave a permanent gap and make this labour market as it permanently supply constrained unless we find other sources of labour perhaps by raising immigration caps or by improving our education and training programs. So a lot of demographic shifts to keep an eye on there. Thank you for breaking that down for a studio bullet. Have a good afternoon. Thank you very much. Thank you. All right, my stock to watch tomorrow, JPMorgan Chase, the bank marks the unofficial start, the third quarter earning season, analysts expect earnings to come in at $2.88 per share, which is down from a year ago.

One analyst also warning the guidance for $23 will come in week. And it's just one of the major banks to report ahead of the open tomorrow.

3289," Think about it A couple of collabs are all the rage these days, but sometimes they need your help. Craft launching a website and a call to action. Where is the Mac dot com encourages the public to push McDonald's to add craft mac and cheese to the Big Mac? The site has a direct link to tweet at McDonald's with the hashtag where is the Mac craft saying in a statement quote, we believe that the time for change is now. And we are hopeful that America's most iconic burger, the Big Mac, will start to add the most important Mac of all. Rochelle, are you in or are you out? I like Mac and cheese. I don't want it in my burger. You put making a side dish. Do something. That's way too much. The Big Mac is already a lot adding Mac and cheese that I can't. That's too much for me. What about you, Sean? Way too much for me. Although I didn't know this until reading this article, craft put out a statement saying that for years we've seen our fans add craft mac and cheese to their burgers from the comfort of their home. So even though Rochelle, you and I aren't necessarily on board with this, it does seem like there is a group out there, a market for this. Maybe this is why it's gaining some traction. You're a huge Mac and cheese fan. Oh my God. I'm right on board with this. There are a few things in the world I love more than Mac and cheese out of a box on a burger on all in, but hot take. I've never had a Big Mac. So maybe this is my opportunity. If they add it, I will have it here on this set. I will hope they're listening because they want you as a customer. All right.

3294," percent year date, you have layoff sweeping the industry met a snap, you name it. And Rita saying the tech industry has learned a lot most notably staying focused. Here's what he said. Well, I think one of the good lessons is to stay very focused. I think one of the things that the call it the 10 plus years of bull market is allowed. Kind of like let's experiment with X, let's experiment with Y, let's experiment with Z. Let's just try lots and lots of things. And I think one of the things to say it is good to innovate. It is good to do new things. But let's go like intensely. It's almost like some of what we learn from Steve Jobs at launching at Apple is like focus on a couple of things that you're launching really intensely and trying to make them as good as possible. And I think that's that's kind of one of the lessons for investors and executives and employees. And in terms of, you know, don't don't don't kind of like spread out like spaghetti all across the field. Read it. Read is right on. And basically that is my take for this one. This great reawakening inside of tech suite. See, sweets is in fact happening. Wow, it's some kind of graphic right there. He's like I said, he's very right on in my view. Evolution is happening across across the tech industry. And he is right. You know, we have seen the past five years amazing technology is created. Absolutely full stop. But there's been a lot of things that tech has worked on that are money losing outfits that really have no reason of being created inside of tech companies right now in this environment as a tech company or really any company. You have to be focused and rally around a series or one or two key strategies that you can do really well and that you're known for really well in a strong, really in the marketplace. And I think read is right on here. So I'm looking forward to hearing more from read on Monday for all market summit. I almost forgot what I talked about, but nonetheless, I look forward to seeing you. And how much is that tech actually improving society and improving business as well? That's going to be a major question mark going forward from here, whether it's social media companies or chip companies or some of the cloud companies. All of that has a larger question to answer moving forward if it wants to continue to benefit from some of the accelerated growth that it's seen in years past. And perhaps that all priced into their future as well. Once we finally do see them move forward with some of that vision and strategy, you are going to hear more from that conversation with Reid Hoffman and our on Brian Saasie as well during the all market summit next week Monday. And a lot of other conversations. I'm also a lot of other exciting. All right, guys. Coming up. We've got some breaking news on the state of the consumer. Stay tuned for this. It's nice. All right.

3295,"cussion Welcome back, you're watching Got Who Finance Live. We've struck this the top of the 10 a.m. hour here, Brad Smith here with Julie Heimann and you're seeing Brian Sazi on screen there as well with 30 minutes into trade. Let's take it swiftly on over to Julie Heimann who's got some fresh news, breaking news and consumer sentiment as well. Yeah, consumer sentiment coming out better than estimated from the University of Michigan's October preliminary reading 59.8 is that reading 58.8 is what analysts had been, economists had been estimating it's also an increase from the prior month. They've heard conditions whoo, up better than estimated 65.3, economists weren't even looking for a reading above 60, their expectations though are lower. So people that feel good now but they don't expect that they're going to continue to feel good. 56.2 is that expectations number. The one year inflation number expectations ticking up to 5.1% and the five to 10 year inflation expectations ticking up to 2.9% are pretty fascinating here and also kind of in line with what we have been hearing right from corporations as well. So kind of a confirmation that just as Jamie Dimon said today, consumers are in good shape right now right. They're feeling good right now. The consumer balance sheet is in decent shape. People are spending. It's what's happening next that people are worried about. Yeah, exactly. To continue to uncertainty over future trajectory of prices, economies, financial markets around the world indicating a bumpy road ahead for consumers that all kind of laid out within the commentary on this as well, sauce. Yeah, just an interesting report and I would say just strange, shortened to the point better than expected. Doesn't really, I would say, job with the retail sales report but nonetheless a good read on the consumer. Welcome, Reid, for the consumer ahead of the start to the holiday. Shopping season, but let's get back under earnings season, which is now officially in full swing results from the JP Morgan city, Morgan Stanley and of course Wells Fargo. David Allison runs point on the Hennessy large cap financial fund. David, market has seemed, at least initially seemed to like some of these big bank earnings. Do you think that enthusiasm is justified? Well, I think the stocks have been down a lot. So the fact that they're up a little bit tells me that the world didn't come to an end again. So I think the stocks have been really bad. And so the fact that they're rebounding is sort of a sigh of relief. I think generally the fundamentals are good. I mean, obviously the margin is expanded because rates are moving up and there are primary beneficiaries of that. But what you're not seeing is any real credit deterioration. So you've had a massive move in rates. You've had a massive move in the market that has gone down that's taken money away. Sentiment is not great on Wall Street. And yet you don't really see any movement in credit. So it's interesting to note how strong these banks are, even though we have this fear of recession and the...",https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GRIayi6dbGM,2,2022-10-14 14:04:37
3296," really see any movement in credit. So it's interesting to note how strong these banks are, even though we have this fear of recession in the end of the world that seems to be the talk every day. Yeah, I mean, the end of the world trade can at least from what I've been told. Only be right once, and you hope that we don't reach that point. But when you think about some of the activity, even that we're seeing here on the day as well, David, as the markets have slipped back into negative territory, there we had a moment ago, all three major averages in negative territory. After beginning the day, pretty strong, and what seemed like would be another add on to yesterday's momentum, even though it was a whipsaw day yesterday, as you kind of look into the rest of this quarter, what would you need to see in order to have some confidence that a bottom had been set in during this fourth quarter, going into what economists are expecting in a recession at the midpoint sometime, 2023? Well, my general broad thoughts are that we've had a pretty good move in rates. Two years ago, I think the two year was like 15 basis points, and now it's 4 plus percent. So I think we're through the bulk of the rating increases, meaning we're not going to go to 8 or 10% on the three-month T-build. That's my opinion. I think what we're heading into now is an earnings issue for all of the companies, not all of them, but enough of them. Obviously, the financials aren't seeing any earnings issues. There's concern that there will be that rates will go up, credit will kick in, loan demand will decline. And I think it would be interesting to see what happens the next couple of weeks as the non-financial start to report and tell you what's happening away from the financial economy. Again, the banks came into this downturn, very strong, very conservative. They haven't made, they don't want to make bad loans. They've got plenty of capital. They're benefiting from the rise in rates in the NIM. So this group is not really indicative of what's happening out there in the marketplace yet. Well, there are some hints of it, right? If you look at this, David, in JP Morgan, for example, yes, net interest income doing fantastically. But if you take out net interest income, revenue actually didn't do as well. They're raising their provisions for credit losses. They're seeing a decline in lending already. How much worse do you think some of those indicators, even if the banks are going to get worse? Well, I don't, you know, it's, I guess, is an investor in these stocks to be completely honest. I am looking forward to credit troubles. I am looking forward to higher rates. I am looking forward to the market getting very concerned about the health of the banking industry, because that's going to generate the opportunities for me to buy the better names and outperform on the way up. So, you know, that's the raw truth of what I do is, you know, I don't want what we have now to continue, because I can't really compete with the other companies in the marketplace that grow. They create new products. We need cycles for this industry to really make money for investors. And my hope, again, I've been doing this for 40 years. You know, I'm hoping we have a downturn. I'm hoping we have a recession. I hope we have higher non-performers that create lower stock prices that I can buy as the economy recovers, the Fed, if it's and all that stuff. Okay, so David, tell us. So what are the better names then? What are the ones that you're looking to get cheaper? What are the ones you're most excited about getting cheaper in this kind of tumultuous period? Well, the ones that are going to have credit problems, and I don't think the bigger companies are going to have that. They've just been too conservative, they're too liquid. So the smaller banks, the mid-tier banks, maybe not the real small ones, where they've made loans, the loans to deposits are higher, they don't have as much liquidity. If credit kicks in on a negative thing, then they'll hopefully go down a lot more and I'll be able to buy them. But right now, there's no problems in the industry. And this is the frustrating part for an asset manager. If there's no problems, there's nothing to get back.",https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GRIayi6dbGM,3,2022-10-14 14:09:12
3297," or now be able to buy them. But right now, there's no problems in the industry. And this is the frustrating part for an asset manager. If there's no problems, there's nothing to get better. There's no reason for the stocks to go up. So we need things to go wrong for this group to get really attractive. And right now, the first eight, four, five companies that have reported, everything's great. Non-performers are OK. Lone growth is OK. Yeah, they're preserving here and there. But they're just being super conservative. And I would do the same thing. So we'll see what happens. But I think you'll see more issues with the economy in the non-financials for the next couple of months. I think that the struggle, the real challenges in the world is not the financial system. It's away from the financial system. David Wells Fargo is a top 10 holding in the fund. Does that company frustrate you? They had a couple I would argue, two good come back quarters to kick off this year. They come out here this morning. I would argue, expense is still high. It announced a charge. The home business under pressure, auto is under pressure. What do you make of that name? Well, again, it's a large cap fund. So I'm not going to own a $2 billion bank. So you have to own something big. But the valuation is reasonable. They've got a great historical franchise. They've had some management issues for the last four or five years, which have been very frustrating, not quite as bad as CityCorp. But certainly, they've had some struggles. And the valuation is just too cheap to ignore. And the embedded franchise value of those deposits is just too large and too powerful. And you're seeing the benefit of those deposit franchises now in higher net interest income. Just while we have you here as well, David, there's an interesting tidbit within the consumer sentiment survey that had come out just a moment ago. And particularly as we think about the consumer and the higher net income consumer as well, if you see them start to be impacted to the same kind of detriment, maybe not the same detriment. But as they're citing here negative influence on their personal finances, the highest in five months, what does that start to spell out more broadly about where consumer mindset in the economy is trending towards? Well, presumably, the Fed is doing, or is making things happen the way it wants to have them happen, meaning they're slowing the economy down. And that's showing up in certain things. Obviously stock prices are down. Home prices have stopped going up 2% a day. So I think the issue here is who's going to really feel it more. And I just don't believe that the financial, the large financial companies, the banks, are going to feel the real bite of this recession, at least not yet. It's going to be the other companies. It's going to be the companies that have reported, even you look at Nike and you look at, those companies are going to hurt a lot more than the banks are. The banks since 2008 have been in a box, they've been regulated, they've been forced to be liquid, forced to be conservative, forced to have tons of capital. And now that's paying dividends for them, in a sense that they're not seeing the struggles. So you're not really seeing what's happening yet in the economy. And I think the financials are not a good example of that yet. And so I think the numbers you're seeing are going to impact the non-financial a lot more than the financial come. David Allison, who was point at the Hennessey large cap financial fund, good to see you. Have a good weekend. Thank you. You too. All right. Thanks. All right, before we head to break, we're keeping an eye on two stocks. First out, Morgan Stanley, the analyst Ben, Swinburn, defending Spotify with an overweight rating inter-earning.

3298," All right, coming up, Y'all, it's Jennifer, Sean Barter has an exclusive interview with San Francisco Fed President Mary Daley. You won't want to miss it. We'll be right back. Welcome back to Yahoo Finance. I'm Jennifer, Sean Barter. Well, on the back of that hot CPI report that showed a core reading, rising to the highest level in 40 years, investors are wondering what this means for the Fed. And if they'll get more aggressive here to weigh in is Mary Daley, president of the San Francisco Federal Reserve Bank. President Daley, welcome back to the program. So wonderful to have you. It's wonderful to be here. I look forward to it. So I want to kick off this conversation and get your reaction to that CPI report and whether it changes the course of policy for you. If we look at the reading on inflation, it appears to be actually moving in the wrong direction, right? We saw core inflation, which excludes those volatile energy and food prices rise 6.6% last month up from 6.3 in August in 5.9 in July. Do you still see the Fed funds rate rising somewhere on the order of 125 basis points this year, or does the Fed need to get more aggressive on the back of this report? Sure, and you know, the CPI is one part of the dashboard of indicators we look for. It's an important one and it does show the data not cooperating. It was a very disappointing report, but I would offer it wasn't that surprising, right? We would hope that inflation would start to come down faster, but I was prepared for it to just be sluggish in its response. It's a lagging indicator. So what I'm also looking at is what's going on in the inputs to inflation are demanded supply showing any signs of coming back in balance. And here I would offer two things that you see the labor.",https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GRIayi6dbGM,5,2022-10-14 14:17:56
3299," What's going on in the inputs to inflation are demand and supply showing any signs of coming back in balance. And here I would offer two things that you see the labor market cooling. It's still very strong, but it's cooling. You also see housing demand cooling. So the housing market is softening. And then today's retail sales report, which had showed flat spending is really another sign that we're getting some cooling. And that we will eventually feed through to inflation. And so my own sense is that we went in, I went into this, intermeeting period, if you will, thinking that we needed to continue to raise rates to further restrict the economy. And we'll have to be data dependent about what actual rate hikes we take, because we have domestic conditions, but we're also working in a global economy. And there's a lot of uncertainty and risks out there. And we have to think about those in the context of exactly what we do. But there's literally no doubt in my mind that we need to put more restrictive stance of policy in the economy to further get demand and supply and balance so that consumers don't have to worry about such high inflation month after month. So given that you think this is a bit of a lagging indicator and you do see some signs of cooling elsewhere in the economy, does this keep the Fed basically on course for what's been set out for the next couple of meetings or what's your sense there? Well, let's go back to the summary of economic projections, lovingly called the SEP. And that often isn't it is stale right after it's produced. But in this case, I think that's a really good guide post from our last meeting about what the path of policy is likely to look like. And then it's all about how do you get there? What's the path? And the SEP, if you remember it, it came out between four and a half and five percent rates as the best estimate of what rates would be at the end of next year. And it also said that we could get up into the fours into restrictive territory by the end of this year. And I still think that's a reasonable, really reasonable way to think about it. And I'm quite certain that some digital restriction is going to take place. And I do know that that's right for the economy. We are tightening into a strong economy. And so we need to bring it back down to something that looks a lot more sustainable in terms of the pace of growth. OK, so then to be clear, 125 basis points higher on that, but, but, but funds rate this year. And then looking at a peak of around four and a half to five percent next year still seems to be the run of play in your mind. Is that correct? Well, what I would say, Jennifer, and I just want to be crystal clear. I know people would like us to write down the exact numbers for the rest of the period. But there's too much uncertainty for that to be prudent for us. We need to be data dependent, extremely data dependent. So clearly the domestic data are pointing to further rate hikes. And I'm very supportive of continuing to put restrictions in place. I see the SEP is a good starting point and guide post for people to say that's generally where the Federal Reserve will be heading. That's consistent with my own views. But I also want everyone here listening to recognize that we're not on a preset course. We are a data dependent fed. And if more is necessary, we'll take it if less is necessary, we'll adjust. But we're not talking about at this point in my mind, you know, pausing or stopping. Nor are we talking about, you know, changing our overall strategy because the data are coming in about like we would expect. Monetary policy, actually the lag inflation is a lagging indicator. It is a hardship that continues to print so high. And I am very focused on that hardship. And I'm very mindful as my context tell me all the time that we want to make sure that price increases, that inflation doesn't become embedded in psychology. And that's why you'll hear me say again and again, we are resilient as an FOMC as a fed at restoring price stability. Even that you said monetary policy operates with a lag, you still think he would raise up to about four and a half, five percent and then, Oz at that point in 2023. Well, I think that's exactly the question we have in mind and why there's a big difference between what rate you get to and then holding it that you holding the economy in a restrictive stance of policy also continues to bridle it. So we'll end at a rate that we think is appropriate in in terms of where to stop and look around. But we still need to get the rates up in order before we ever do that and they'll go.",https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GRIayi6dbGM,6,2022-10-14 14:22:06
3300," ended a rate that we think is appropriate in terms of where to stop and look around, but we still need to get the rates up before we ever do that. And then we'll go to what I would think of as what I call oftentimes a raise and hold strategy where we raise it. And then we let that sit for a while. But we are always even in that reason hold piece adjusting to the economic conditions as they come in. We are not on some sort of course that can't correct if the economy needs more, bridal or needs less bridal, but really that's how I think about it. Get you between four and a half and five is the most likely outcome and then raise to those levels and then hold at that point for some period of time. You said there is a narrow path to engineer a soft landing for this economy. There is a window for that. You think it is possible. That said this week we heard that the IMF downgraded its global outlook. It says the worst is yet to come and it warned about over tightening from global central banks and the possibility of precipitating an unnecessarily harsh global recession. At the same time we also heard from JP Morgan CEO Jamie Diamond, who believes we could see a recession in the next nine months or sooner, given the impact of inflation on the consumer. They also said in their earnings report that they're setting aside 800 million for loan loss reserve. My question is where do you pin the odds of a recession in the next day six to 12 months. It's fascinating to me that we continue to be asked mostly by the media and others that about recession. But when I'm out in my context of nine western states that travel all over the United States, I'm not hearing signs of recession. I'm hearing signs that we'd like to grow more but we can't find workers or consumers saying when is inflation going to go away. My life would be great if we didn't have such high inflation. People have plenty of jobs opportunities. We still have a strong labor market. We have good consumer spending, even though it's flat. It's still people are spending. People are doing things that they want. I also point to one more data point that you didn't mention yesterday. I believe the conference board came out with their CEO survey and those CEOs 98% expected some sort of a slowdown. But they all, you know, what I remember from the report that was really meaningful and it's consistent with what I hear when I talk to business contacts workers, community groups is that people expect the slow down to be there, but they expected to be short lived and not very deep. That's a very different landing. That would I in my mind is the soft landing we're trying to achieve. We need to slow GDP growth substantially to get us back in demand supply balance. The labor market needs to cool further we're adding over 200,000 jobs per month in the last report. And that's another 100,000 over what it takes to just keep things study, you know, then just absorb the new entrance that come into the labor market. So clearly we're running fast demand and sluggish supply. Those things have to come back into balance. The feds tool, while it's blunt, it does directly affect the strength of demand and we're committed to bringing demand back in line with supply. You mentioned that business executives expected there is a recession. It would be a milder one. How deep of a recession is the fed willing to tolerate as you try to quell inflation and bring it down and frankly as a recession, what's needed to really get inflation under control? You know, that's not how I think about my work. Actually, we have a dual mandate full employment and price stability. My job as I see it is to treat those like they are for most people those things are related. They don't want only one or only the other. And so our job is to ensure that we can get a balance of both get jobs. Everyone who wants a job can find one, even if it takes a little bit longer as the unemployment rate moves up, they're still going to find a job and inflation comes back down to something closer to 2% in next year, you know, something closer and then gets to 2% in the course of the next two years. Those are critical things for us to achieve. And so I'm not thinking of it in terms of recession. I do think of it in terms of cooling the economy so the demand and supply come back into balance and Americans can go to bed at night and get up in the morning, not worried about whether the prices they paid a day.",https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GRIayi6dbGM,7,2022-10-14 14:26:18
3301," cooling the economy so the demand and supply come back into balance and Americans can go to bed at night and get up in the morning, not worried about whether the prices they pay today are no longer going to be there tomorrow and they're not going to be able to afford the basic things they need to have their lives and livelihoods. I do want to ask I do want to ask you about one other economic scenario since inflation has proven pretty sticky and if that does expect below trend growth this year for the next couple of years as your hiking rates to pull the demand side of the economy. What's the risk that a stack flationary environment could emerge and how would the committee approach that. Well, so again, I think of stack flation that's a it's frankly a big scary word but look at the consumer sentiment that came out today there it's it's rose and then the future expectations slow to course for for for growth but that's consistent with what the economy needs. I think of what we're doing now as bringing inflation down so that we can have a durable expansion and we know that durable expansions are the ones that are best for the labor market best for all the groups that we care a lot about and that high inflation is a tax a regressive tax that's literally eating away at the lives and livelihoods of Americans we're able to bear it so when I think of that I think of slower pace of growth delivers lower inflation puts us back in balance gets us in the best position to grow once again at trend and I don't have any data right now that suggests that that's not possible. President daily want to thank you so much for your insights so appreciate it and hope to talk with you again soon. I look forward to it. Thank you so much. Thanks so much that's Mary daily president of the San Francisco Federal Reserve bank will be right back. Thank you. Thank you. Thank you. Thank you. Thank you.",https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GRIayi6dbGM,8,2022-10-14 14:30:05
3302," Welcome back to Yahoo Finance, everyone. U.S. retail spending came in flat in September. However, consumer sentiment coming in above estimates, even as Americans' expectations for inflation, they worsened. For more, on the state of the economy, we have Stephen Rashido, who is the Mizzouho America's chief U.S. economist. Great to have you here with us this morning. First, just help us break down the market reaction that we've seen over these past two days to some of the economic data that really factors in everything from prices that consumers are paying to the sentiment from consumers right now. Well, I think when you're looking at the overall economy in this environment, you have to keep in mind, too, thanks. One thing is, if the economy is showing more resilience than people had expected, given the pace of Fed rate hikes, that's number one. But we often forget that they've only been tightening since March of this year. So it's what, seven months into the process and the shortest possible lag between monetary policy and economic impacts of six months. That's the shortest possible lag. It's a long and durable lag, and it tends to be sometimes to the much longer lag. So the fact that we're continuing to see inflation remaining stubborn on the upside and we're continuing to see a more resilient underlying economy, always back into the fact that the labor market has not had any major significant change. And this is the critical issue. The labor market continues to be a critical piece of the equation to get inflation down and to slow the pace of underlying economic activity. And in an environment in which we're dealing with a real labor market shortage, it's really hard to do this. And therefore, there's going to be much more additional rate hikes coming down the pipeline from the Federal Reserve. Steve, I don't know if you were able to catch it, but we just had San Francisco Fed President Mary Daley on and she gave a range of potential rates where they would like to go potentially 4.5% to 5%. If we reached that 5% level, is the US economy still growing and by how much? Well, again, I actually have a higher terminal rate at this particular juncture than President Daley has and that's not surprising. The SEP issue was quoting, did not take on board the latest inflation numbers or the latest retail sales numbers or for that matter, the latest we clean unemployment claims numbers. And the answer to your question is the economy could still be growing because we're going to be there by the end of this year and early next year. So it might not be into the real recessionary environment until we get into the second quarter of 2023, given the underlying resilience in the economy. So the answer is we're going to have to see higher rates than are currently discounted in the marketplace and higher rates than she's discussing in her commentary a few minutes ago. Steven, it's Julie here. We've had a lot of folks come on the show and say the Fed is not quite looking at the right indicators and that that means there is this big risk of overshooting, but it sounds like you think the Fed should be even more aggressive or will end up being more aggressive here. So what indicators are you watching right now is sort of giving us a good snapshot of what's going on? Look, and watch the weekly initial unemployment claims numbers. They are the best real-time measure that we're looking at in terms of labor market. And what we're seeing is, yes, people may be losing their jobs, but they're getting alternative jobs very quickly and not showing up either in the claims numbers or showing up in the continuing claims numbers. The labor market is the key here. And given the fact that we have a real labor shortage, this is the battle that the Federal Reserve is fighting against. And this is the battle that they have to win before they can get any declines of inflation that are going to be considered sustainable on an ongoing basis. And until we get there, we're not, one of those things we're going to know when we get there, we're not going to be able to forecast it ahead of time. So all this analysis that we're doing about what the terminal rate should be really has to be viewed against the live input of data coming in, which is why people at the Fed like price, you know, a unit of data that no one is going to see in favor of this from underground numbers has to say, unfortunately, it can't be moving down, there's none. And, those, the empieza notices, those are the summit numbers that we're going to get",https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GRIayi6dbGM,9,2022-10-14 14:35:40
3303," The rate should be really, you know, has to be, has to be viewed against the live input of data coming in, which is why people at the Fed, like President Daly, are telling you, we're data dependent. And what we see so far is nothing has really changed. That would change our view with regard to monetary policy. And I tend to agree with them as well. Steve, you said in your notes to us that the, by the dip strategy here is misguided. What is misguided about it? And is it still, for those who are asking themselves, should I be buying this dip? Is the answer from your perspective still no? And the answer is yes, it's still no. And the reason for this market's don't really yet discount what's going to come. There are going to be corporate failures. There are going to be banks that have significant problems. There is going to be economic pain that comes about as a result of what the Fed is doing. But the Fed really has no alternative, which is the other thing. So people seem to think the Fed has an alternative. There is no alternative to what they're doing. Allowing inflation to get embedded in the system is a long-term problem that is going to require even more pain down the road. So the Fed's prescription is take your medicine now, get it over with, and let's get it done with. And I think they're doing exactly what they're supposed to be doing. And I think people keep on wanting to look through to the other side of this story. The problem is this other side of this story could be further out in the calendar that investment horizons are set to. And that's the real reason why it's misguided. Stephen Reciutto, a Mizzouho America's chief US economist, always good to get some time with you. Have a good weekend. You too. Have a great weekend. Home Depot, co-founder Bernie Marcus slams the body of administration in a chat. I had with him about his new book. We'll have that interview next.好不好 mü'm gym Masters M M M M M M M M M M M M M M M",https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GRIayi6dbGM,10,2022-10-14 14:39:56
3304," I'm Deepo Coffounder, Bernie Marcus. Had some choice words for the Bonn administration in my exclusive chat with him on his new book called Kick Up Some Dust. He also reflected a bit on starting home depot during a period of high inflation. If you don't read history, you don't know history. We're right back where we started and we opened up during the Jimmy Carter days and in the flash, she was 20 percent, interest rates was 20 some odd percent and people were struggling. Manufacturers were struggling. We opened up in the middle of this and fortunately because of the capital market, we had cash. So we had to pay our vendors ahead of time. We paid vendors the day they delivered the product, which is uncalled for. I mean, it just doesn't happen. But we want to keep them in business. And I can tell you, there are hundreds of manufacturers who are major manufacturers today that we kept in business those days by paying our bills quickly so they can have the cash to buy product to keep the people working. And it was not an easy time. But here we are all over again. We don't learn less. Inflation is killing us. People are struggling. You know, a gallon of gas versus putting food on the table is not a place you want to be. But our customers now have that. It's unfortunate. We just still learn. Just to learn. Do you feel as though the economy doesn't feel like the same economy that it did back in 1979? Well, it's, it was easier. It was easier now to fix it than it was then. He caught or didn't have the tools. You know, he had all these people kept captive in Iran. He had, he opact really against him. And if you remember oil and gas rationing was pretty horrible. You had numbers and you couldn't get gas if you didn't have a certain number. Well, we have a president that just doesn't believe in that. We're sitting on tons of oil and gas and he doesn't allow us to drill. It's, it's, it's basically stupid. I can't come up with another word. It's stupid. And we will continue to suffer this. This inflation and our people will continue to struggle with high prices as long as he maintains this, this facade of climate control versus allowing us to do the things that we should be doing. I don't know. People live on a different planet. I think I, I feel one day I wake up in the morning and say, where the hell are they coming from? I don't understand it. What, why are they defending, not drilling when in fact climate change, you could put them off over a period of time and do it over the next 30 years, 40 years and do it intelligently, but not slam down on it and kill everybody today. So it's hurting everybody today, not good. I know you're a big free market guy, Bernie, I mean, that's how you created or helped create Home Depot. I do you mentioned, you mentioned capitalism a couple minutes ago. Do you think capitalism is under attack in this country? Oh, yes. It's under attack in universities. You have professors who are socialists, what teaching is to the young people. And we had a poll at one point that was very frightening because it showed that almost 50% of the young people would vote for socialism over capitalism. They just don't know. They get to their hearts. They don't get to their brains.",https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GRIayi6dbGM,11,2022-10-14 14:43:28
3305," people would vote for socialism over capitalism. They just don't know. They get to their hearts, they don't get to their brains. And unfortunately we have a whole group of people growing up today where they think in terms that socialism is good for America whereas in fact capitalism is what puts food on the table. It's allowed people to grow, allow people to develop economics and independence and they don't get it. When they get it it's like so many friends of mine say that their kids were socialists. I'll put till they got their first job and they took all money out of their paycheck to pay taxes and all of a sudden they became capitalist. So that may be the story. Always an entertaining, entertaining chat with Home Depot co-founder Bernie Marcus again, author of the new book Kick Up Some Dust. All right coming up going viral TikTok plans to build US fulfillment centers will break down what this means for the popular social media app next. Let's get down to business with a look at some other headlines we're watching now. SpaceX's Starlink satellites have been a vital source of communication for Ukraine's military since they arrived last spring. SpaceX CEO Elon Musk was said earlier this month that the operation has cost SpaceX $80 million and will exceed $100 million by the end of the year. But now he says this company cannot donate more Starlink Terminal to Ukraine's army or continue funding the ones it has already has. It's asking the Pentagon to pick up the bill which he says would cost more than $120 million for the rest of the year could cost close to $400 million for the next 12 months.",https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GRIayi6dbGM,12,2022-10-14 14:47:43
3306," Pentagon to pick up the bill, which he says would cost more than $120 million for the rest of the year, could cost close to $400 million for the next 12 months. The Russian-installed governor of Ukraine-Southern Kursan region Vladimir Saldoy told residents on Thursday to take their children and flee. Asin Moscow is losing its grip on the territory claims to have annexed following shelling from Ukraine. Saldoy was saying on telegram that the target that the missiles hit our hotels, residential houses, markets. There are lots of civilians. A departure of civilians would be a blow to Russia, especially due to the area's strategic importance. United Airlines looking to boost its fleet of wide-body jets, the airline operator studying offers for Boeing 787 Dreamliner and Airbus's A350. It's been in talks with the plane-makers for months, according to Bloomberg. CEO Scott Kirby told pilots at a Denver training session that the airline is planning a triple digit order with multiple wide-body models being considered. The shares of the cloud computing company Nutanix have been surging today, that's after reports the company could be seeing takeover interest from being capital. Right now, it's uncertain what prospects actually exist for a deal, but the acquiring company would likely have to pay a big premium to Nutanix's nearly $6 billion market value. The shares of 24% right now, Brad. All right, thanks so much, Julie. Well, TikTok is doubling down on e-commerce, the popular social media app looking to expand its footprints in this space by building fulfillment centers in the U.S. Yeah, we'll finance this. Kelsey Barbario joins us now with the details. All right, what do we need to know about this? It looks like, yeah, they're trying to compete with Amazon. What's going on? So, honestly, it looks like, according to reporting from Axios, we've got them filling out job list. They've got jobs listed. I'm so sorry. I am a little nervous to be here with you guys. Thank you. No, so Axios did some reporting that it looks like there are job listings up on LinkedIn for about a dozen different jobs for fulfillment centers that are going to be international. So, it looks like they're going to be getting into the e-commerce business a bit. And now, TikTok has a lot of people shopping on their platform as it is. They've got about 23.7 million people that are looking to make at least one purchase likely this year. That's according to insider, I believe. But no, so we've got, yeah, there's a ton of people. There's so much opportunity there, and they're really trying to get into that and take some of that market share from companies like Amazon, who have got Amazon Storefront, which is really popular on TikTok, and like to know it aboard style. Yeah, interesting here. And at the same time, there's all these things that TikTok is getting into that we know about, right, or that are reported upon. And one of them is that there would be some sort of QVC-like shopping feature. I mean, I know live shopping is kind of this big and growing thing, but it seems like it hasn't totally reached critical mass. Is there already a lot of live shopping on TikTok happening? I wouldn't say the QVC style that it sounds like they're trying to get into. I know that Facebook did something similar to this before. And now it looks like they're trying to make a partnership with TalkShop Live. There's nothing official there yet, but that could be something that's pretty big for them. I do know that they were testing this also in the UK and in Asia, and it wasn't very successful. I think that one of the big problems there is that a lot of people that are purchasing things from creators like the authenticity factor of it. They like feeling like it's just a creator going about their regular life, making videos about the things that they enjoy. And so I think if you kind of take away that natural element of it, there might be a problem. So I know they had issues getting creators on board in those other markets, so it would be curious to see how that happens here. I mean, I always set up a ring light in a camera when I'm doing my plant, dead duties, and now it's a... Of course. Of course it's authentic, right? I mean, but this is a big deal because TikTok reported they went through a round of layoffs in July. What does this new kind of e-commerce push really tell us about the future of the company here? Yeah, like you said, they started off with about 1,500 employees here in the US in 2020, which is pretty strong. They've been going at a pretty great clip ever since then, but then as of July, they did pull back and say that they were going to halt a little bit of their hiring. But I think that's just kind of following suit with what other tech companies are doing at this point. They're looking at the economy and they're not really sure what's going to happen. But I do think that a lot of their revenue right now is coming from add dollars. And so I think that they're trying to find a way to diversify the way that they're making their money and they see so many people, millions of dollars, if being spent through these affiliate networks, like StyleLink and RewardStyle, and they just... They want to get a little piece of that.",https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GRIayi6dbGM,13,2022-10-14 14:52:38
3307," By the way that they're making their money and they see so many people like millions of dollars of being spent through these affiliate networks like StyleLink and Reward Style and they just they want to get a little piece of that. Right. It's all about making this advertising kind of element really attractive for the marketers out there especially knowing that they're looking for conversions. That's why all these platforms are trying to make it more shoppable. We'll see what that looks like within Tiktok. Would you buy anything on Tiktok? Oh I buy things on Tiktok. I'd be buying anything off to you. Yeah, okay. Oh yeah. All right well, I'm behind the curve here. Thanks so much for joining us here in Studio. Yeah, we'll find in Sizzone, Kelsey Barberio. Coming up everyone, Julie's got this week's winners and alluzers on the other side of the bring. from red hot inflation data to volatile market swings. We've seen it all this week, and Julie's got some thoughts here. It's time for our winner and loser of the week. All right, so where should we begin, Julie? Let's start with the winner. Let's start with positive, right? Because maybe because I have a little more to say about the loser of the week. The winner of the week, actually, if you look in the S&P 500, the best performer on the week is Moderna. Hey. And Moderna is down again today, and it's been down quite a bit this year, something like 47% and 48%. But it did have a positive week, up about 12%. Because the big question surrounding Moderna has been what next? Now that it proved the viability of the mRNA platform, not just it, but of course the Pfizer-BiannTech vaccine for coronavirus as well, well, how then was that platform going to be used? And we got one sign of that this week, when Moderna signed on with Merck, that the two are going to try to make an mRNA-based cancer vaccine. Now it's early stages, but this is one of the early concrete signs of what we're going to then see from...",https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GRIayi6dbGM,14,2022-10-14 14:57:30
3308," RNA-based cancer vaccine. Now, it's early stages, but this is one of the early sort of concrete signs of what we're going to then see from it. So that was one of the winners. I saw it the week after the stock has been a loser this year. Soz. It is about some losers, Julie. What do you got? OK. I got one big loser for you. And that, unfortunately, for those in the UK is quasi-quarteng, who is the now resigned fire, depending on how you want to put it. Chancellor of the checker over there, who had been really closely allied with Liz Truss. And he came out with a letter today talking about his resignation. Of course, he was really the architect, along with Truss, of their big mini budget, which, among other things, was going to change the tax structure that came at a fire for proposing a tax structure on high earners, for example, a reduced tax structure. He sent his letter today. The economic environment has changed rapidly since we set out the growth plan on 23rd September in response together with the Bank of England. And excellent officials at the Treasury. We've responded to those events. And I commend my officials for their dedication. The economic environment changed because of this plan coming out. So it's just to come out with a statement like that. Yes, the conditions continue to deteriorate in the UK in terms of inflation going higher, just like it is here in the US. But it's a little disingenuous to say the economic environment has changed rapidly when you were one of the architects of that economic environment changing rapidly. In other words, seeing really a plunge in the British pound, for example, and a lot of pension funds in the UK becoming stressed. And then the Bank of England having to step in and help them with some easing to the system. So quasi-quartone, sorry for him, loser of the week. Yes, loser of the week there. You mentioned depending upon who you asked, whether it's fired or resigned. If it's the BBC, they say, well, the Bricks, they say SACT, according to the BBC. He was SACT, indeed he was. All right, everybody. Hope you have a great weekend. A kick off of Jeeta will continue our big bank discussion on the back of those earnings reports with speed capital management, bills meet. And don't forget on Monday are all markets summit happening. Monday the 17th, featuring interviews with CEOs from Target, General Motors, Microsoft. You don't want to miss that. It will be a full day of very big stuff. And have a great weekend in the meantime.",https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GRIayi6dbGM,15,2022-10-14 15:01:33
3309,". Welcome to Yahoo Finance Live. It is 11 a.m. here in New York City. I'm a Kiko Fujita. Here's what I'm watching at this hour. Big banks kicking off earnings season this morning with JP Morgan, Morgan Stanley Wells Fargo and city leading the way. We're going to break down the numbers with speed capital management, CIO, built need in just a few minutes. Oil prices down as global recession fears and waiting demand outweigh concerns over supply. The global head of energy at KPMG joined us this hour to discuss the repercussions of the recent OPEC plus decision. China braces for a historic party congress president Xi Jinping expected to secure an unprecedented third term but concerns about a slowing economy could rain on his parade. But first let's do a quick check of the market action on this Friday. Another choppy session on our hands here after the historic turnaround rally that we saw yesterday. You see all three majors right now in the red. The Dow down 42 points the S&P 500 down 29 and the Nasdaq down 129. Result season kicking off with some big banks announcing their Q3 numbers this morning and that is the focus of our show JP Morgan was the headliner topping estimates thanks to higher rates. Those CEO Jamie Diamond once again pointed to hurdles and headwinds on the horizon. Let's bring in Bill Smith, speed capital management, CIO, bill. This is kind of the super bowl for you, right? You've got all the big banks reporting today. It certainly feels like if you look at somebody like JP Morgan, we're kind of back to the discussion we had a few years ago. Last year we were talking about low loss reserves being pulled back. Now we're seeing an increase there because the concerns on the horizon around the economy. Yeah, it's so interesting that after all the work that's been done, these banks have been way more capital than they need even during a sharp recession. It's all set up that way. So you've taken the worst of the downside out of the risk associated with these companies because they have a wide mode that they have the deposits of the largest adult population group, the millennials because they have the best mobile banking apps. And now over the next 10 years, those millennials are going to be outstanding customers on the lending side, what they call the liability side in the business. And then the second picture you got from these reports is Wall Street is stinking and Main Street is doing well. Elaborate on that one for me. Well, trading and IPOs and all that kind of stuff is disappearing as a profit center. And at the same time, the average person in the United States is seeing their wages go up quite a bit. So it looks like the have-nots are going to win for a while. And that could be true of the next entire next decade, which is the way that the 1970s were where we had inflation that the have-nots were getting better bargaining position from a labor standpoint. And capital for the most part was treated very poorly unless it was invested in something that benefited from inflation. Yeah, I mean, let's talk about that bit more, Bill. I mean, JPM, one of those names that you do own. Obviously, we looked to these bank earnings for any kind of color on where the economy is headed. And yet, there still does seem to be a bit of a disconnect between where sentiment is and where actual spending is. And we kind of heard that from JP Morgan today when they said they haven't necessarily seen a significant pullback in consumer spending. Yeah.",https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GRIayi6dbGM,16,2022-10-14 15:05:19
3310," has certainly seen a significant pullback and consumer spending. Yeah, that's a great point, a great question. So about 80% of what goes on in the United States economy goes on regardless. Just go back and look at 07 to 09 and you'll realize that 80% of what goes on always goes on. It's that 20% of variable GDP that the recession hits, right? So if the economy contracts 4%, it means 20% of the 20% that's variable got hit. And so we feel the pain, right? Because people live a lot in that variable part of their life, not in the fixed part of their life. So that's where the concern is, but from an investor standpoint, a company is worth the net present value of the future income stream and the future cash flows. And 4% less for a year in a 20 year time continuum doesn't really change the net present value of a business very much. And that's where people make all their mistakes. They sell their stocks because of recession because they're going to get less 4% less affection from the economy. They don't do that with their spouse. They certainly don't do that with their spouse. Bill, another sector we've been watching really closely is housing and we got some color on that front from some of these bank earnings in terms of where mortgage rates are right now. Home lending originations, at least with Wells Fargo, down nearly 60% year over year at JPM, that was down 71%. How much worse do you think things are going to get on that front? Well, they've lost all the stupid stuff. You know, the people buying four houses and flipping. You know, all that stuff is going away, all the fluff. And I think Stuart Miller, the head of Lenard, said at best two weeks ago on his earnings call, he says, we're going to manage our way through this difficulty in the next 12 months so that we come out on the other side with dramatically larger market share. We own the largest home builders because over the next 10 years, there's 92 million millennials. They were seven years slower than other age groups getting started buying houses and they will buy houses the next 10 years. And that happened in the 70s with high inflation rates. We had the biggest home building boom of the last 60 years in the 1970s with sky high mortgage rates. So that sounds like you're not so cynical moving forward. I mean, you're not a cynical some others who've said that, you know, these higher rates are really going to accelerate some of the losses we've seen on that side. No, you're talking to a guy whose first mortgage was 13.5% in 1983 on a state buydown. We were anxious to get it because we had one child one on the way. That's why we like you, Bill. Some context there, right? Historical context, important. Let's talk a bit strategy right now. I'm you sort of alluded to some of these names that you think would be good buys right now. Obviously, you know, sort of the traditional thinking has been that with these big banks, especially, they could benefit on the back of higher rates. There's the macro story sort of weighing on that as well. Which one of these names you think is best positioned to write out some of the choppiness we're likely to see over the next several months? Well, we have owned Bank American JP Morgan since 2012. And if you think people are skeptical of them now, you should go back and relive 2012, right? I mean, people didn't know whether they were going to survive. Remember, we had the C-Car meetings and the Fed would give them a hard time and wouldn't let them buy back their stock when it was cheap and wouldn't let them pay dividends and so forth. So this tribulation compared to that tribulation is peanuts for these folks. They're way overcapitalized. They're super strong. So we like Bank American JP Morgan. They are the largest deposit banks to millennials because they have the best mobile banking. And now they're going to get to have them as people that borrow money for necessity purposes. And by the way, that's a powerfully positive influence in the economy. And then we love American Express because they're the favorite credit card of the millennials who, despite the fact they're getting married in record numbers this year and going to have kids in the next five years, we'll still drag those little kids all over the place on exotic travel with the travel points they get on our American Express card. And I hear you chuckling, you're probably a customer. Yeah. Just laughing at the context here. Well, we love to have you on the show.",https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GRIayi6dbGM,17,2022-10-14 15:09:54
3311," the travel points they get on our American Express Card. And I hear you chuckling, you're probably a customer. Yeah. Just laughing up the context here. Well, we love to have you on the show. Really appreciate your time today. Bill Smith, Speed Capital Management, CIO. Thank you. Well, retail sales remaining unchanged in September or missing, economists forecast of a 0.2% rise. To help break down the report, let's bring in Yahoo finances in as fray, a big data week for you this week. Retail sales, what do we see? Yeah, that's right. And so keep in mind that retail sales also, they are not adjusted for inflation. And remember that retail sales include many categories, like groceries, like vehicles, furniture, et cetera. But two interesting points from this report. First of all, excluding gasoline and auto, is retail sales grew by 0.3%. And also what's interesting is the weakness in some of these categories that we've seen. So electronics fell, furniture fell, also auto sales, those came in weak. So these are some big ticket items. And you could say that, for example, with electronics, well, a lot of people during the pandemic were buying electronics. And now they're using services more and going out more so they don't need more of that. Furniture, you know that the housing market is slowing down. So you would see a slow down in furniture sales as well. And auto sales, well, auto prices have gone up too much. And so perhaps this means the consumer is really pulling back. Another big story we're watching, and not in the US across the pond here, UK Chancellor, Acquasi Quarting, ousted by Prime Minister Liz Trot, just 38 days after taking that role. Obviously, this on the back of that initial proposal on the tax cuts, which I think by all accounts was quite disastrous in the rollout. But what can you more can you tell us about the market reaction that we've seen on the back of this? Yeah, so we did see the pound falling. We saw a bond yields being volatile. A 30-year yield of 11 basis points, the 10-year yield of six basis points, Prime Minister Trot saying that the U-turn for this corporate tax cut basically, that this is going to reassure the markets. Because we know what the markets did when these tax cuts were announced. And she said parts of the mini budget just went too far. This is to reassure those markets that were going well. I think it's also to save the bond market as well. Yeah, put one too far, kind of putting it mildly, when you look at the market reaction on the back of that. That's certainly a story we'll continue to watch. And that's thanks for that. Thank you. Well, deal making in the grocery space, leading to some big stock moves, shares of Kroger and Albertsons. Both moving to the downside here. After the second largest grocery agreed to buy Albertsons, the deal is valued at $24.6 billion with Kroger buying shares of Albertsons at a 16% premium to its closing price Thursday. The boards of both firms unanimously signed off on the deal. It still needs approval from regulators. And you see both of those stocks taking a hit today. Kroger down about 3.5% Albertsons down nearly 7%. Coming up, bearing the lead, oil supply concerns dominate after OPEC plus cuts. But isn't it demand we should be watching a signs point to recessionary cliff edge? We talk energy on the other side. Thanks for revisiting this. I'll see you later all the way. Dear fellows, Mr. Thompson and Len Luckler.",https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GRIayi6dbGM,18,2022-10-14 15:14:38
3312," way. Well, the follow-up from the OPEC Plus decision to slash supplies continues. President Biden has suggested a review of the relationship with Saudi Arabia, which is, of course, a long-time Washington ally. The move by the oil-producing group stands in direct conflict with Biden's goal of ensuring lower prices for U.S. consumers. And this coming just weeks before the all-important midterms here. The U.S. says the Saudis presented no market basis for the cuts. Let's get to Regina May, or KPMG's global head of clients and markets. Regina gets a talk to you today. Let's start on that comment that we got from President Biden saying there's no market basis. And yet, you look at where oil is trading right now. We're right back below the levels we were at when that OPEC Plus cuts decision was first made. So, I mean, what does that suggest in terms of, you know, where the real fears are at the end of the day? Is it about a potential global recession and is significant pull back in demand? Well, I think the market reacted to the headline of the secure of 2 million barrel per day cut. When the reality is that OPEC is producing 3.5 million barrels per day lower than their stated production photos. So, I saw it more as just a realization, an acknowledgement of what's actually happening on the ground. The one thing that was important was the Saudis are starting to signal that they don't have spare capacity. But I think we understand more of the supply side constraints because that's what we've been living with for the last few months and some of the peak pricing that we saw over the summer. Now the price is coming back down to earth because I think, as you mentioned before the break, the demand side pressures are where there's a lot of uncertainty. China still not come back fully online. There's lots of concerns now about what COVID could do over the winter. You know, we're worried about a recession. So, I think that's brought the price back down. But we saw a nearly 20% jump in WTI just in the last two weeks. And I think it's coming back down to a more realistic price projection. Specifically in the supply side, we had so many oil analysts come out on the back of that OPEC Plus decision saying essentially look despite this announcement of 2 million barrels caught a day. At the end of the day, most of these OPEC members do not meet their quotas. I mean, what's the realistic number we should be looking at in terms of how much comes offline as a result of this decision? Well, I think that the real number that I was looking at is about 800,000 barrels per day because I just looked at what the reductions were from Saudi, Kuwait and the UAE. So those are parts of the world that do have spare capacity. And when I visit the region, you know, you hear different things from the different executives. So that was what the real cut was. But the EIA is forecasting that the US is going to exceed 2019 production into 2023. So I think the world is starting to get a little more comfortable that we have been looking up at.",https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GRIayi6dbGM,19,2022-10-14 15:18:57
3313," US is going to exceed 2019 production into 2023. So I think the world is starting to get a little more comfortable that we have the supply that we need, especially if we face into a reduced demand environment. If we see a really severe winter, and we don't see the recession that folks are expecting, and we see demand continuous spike, then we're going to see a lot of upward pressure on price. Let's talk about where those prices could move. I mean, you pointed to some demand concerns there, especially coming out of China. We're all watching to see what kind of messaging comes from this party Congress over in China from President Xi specifically on the economy. But you said we're still talking about a tight supply here. So when you say upward pressure, how much more upside do you see going into the winter? I'm worried a lot about a potential big spike in the winter. If we have a really, really cold winter, that's where I think we could see prices back close to 100, maybe even in triple digits. But I'm hedging against that. I really think the prices are closer to where they should be. I've said WTI and Brent should be in the 80s. That was what OPEC plus was trying to do. It's sure the price back up because they saw the market potentially overreacting to some of the demand concerns and not paying enough attention to the supply. So I think that's in part what drove their 2 million barrel per day headline cut, which is just making transparent to the rest of the world what was actually going on. And Regina, I know you can't speak to specifically sort of the political environment and all of this, but it does feel like there are increasing lines being drawn geopolitically when you think about what happened between Saudi Arabia, Slash, Russia, OPEC and the U.S. You've got the Western European countries and pushing their sanctions as well against Russia. I mean, at the end of all of this, wherever that end may be, how's the oil market going to look? I mean, how fragmented do you think things could get? Well, I think, Eki, the same that has always surprised me is there's four fundamentals of how countries and markets need to manage energy. And that first and foremost is energy security. Second is affordability. Third is reliability. Fourth is sustainability. No doubt the climate agenda is huge and we are facing a climate crisis. But the world was focusing more on number four. There's almost like a maslow's hierarchy of needs. If you don't have the energy that you need and it's not affordable and it's not reliable, then governments and policymakers need to get very heavily involved. And so that's how I would characterize what we're seeing today is the realization your previous gifts talked about the 70s. I'm a child of the 70s. I remember long gas lines during oil embargoes. We're relearning the lessons from decades ago and hopefully we do a better time this time around. Yeah, a lot of people kind of drawing parallels looking back in time in history right now with so much going on. KPMG's global head of clients and markets, Regina Mayer, good to have you on today. Well, coming up, the final frontier, Elon Musk, Warren SpaceX can't help Ukraine indefinitely. So the question here, could the crucial Starling terminals be pulled? And if they stay, who pays? We'll get into that on the other side.",https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GRIayi6dbGM,20,2022-10-14 15:22:51
3314,"... We'll space access saying it can no longer pay for critical satellite services in Ukraine. And it's asking the Pentagon to pick up the tab. And according to reporting at a CNN, Musk appears to have confirmed the report in a tweet, writing in part, strange that nothing was leaked about our competitors and space launching communications, Lockheed and Boeing, who get over $60 billion. Now, the same CNN report, reference SpaceX figure shared with the Pentagon. Take a look at this. 85 percent of the 20,000 starlinked terminals in Ukraine were paid for or partially paid for by countries like the U.S. Poland or other entities. Who also paid for about 30 percent of the internet connectivity. Now, SpaceX says that costs about $4,500 each month per unit for the most advanced service. Musk has said there are around 25,000 terminals in Ukraine to break it all down. Let's bring in Praz, Supermanian, and Praz. The reason we're talking about this, some context here, is that earlier this year Elon West started seem to apply that we're doing this good thing where we're going to be donating starlink that this was all being paid for by SpaceX. That's not necessarily the case in this story out of CNN, really does point to the cost of operating it, who's footing the bill, and what this means ultimately for the future, because Ukraine has really come to rely on this for connectivity. From what I understand, it's a huge part of their operations against Russia. They need this connectivity. You know, when we first heard about Musk donating the starlink service, we thought this was free. They were actually out of their pocket, sending them the actual terminals and paying for the service, but it turns out, it looks at 85% is inputted by the U.S. and actually Poland paying a lot for this terminal. So a little surprise there. Also the odd timing, it's like Musk also kind of noting the fact that after he put out that supposed controversial peace plan, and then the Ukrainians were... Queen Russia and Ukraine, which seemed to suggest that he was more in line with the Russian thinking. Exactly, not so much the Ukrainian side, and then Ukrainians were upset about that, and then all of a sudden, oh, by the way, you get a pay for this, according to the CNN obtained report letter that they sent to the defense department. So like I said, odd timing here. It's sort of a strange sort of... I really don't understand why Musk would even put out this sort of image that he's actually donating this stuff in actual... Actually, actually he was not. It's not a cheap service. SpaceX is not a charitable organization. It is a company that's trying to be profitable, and it's cost a lot of money, so I understand that part. SpaceX worth 120 billion valuation. Musk worth 200 billion personally. So I think it's hard for people to sort of kind of round out the, hey, we're going to... You need to get paid for the service when the actually you guys are actually worth. I've got a lot of money. Musk obviously never wanted to stay silent, especially on...",https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GRIayi6dbGM,21,2022-10-14 15:27:35
3315," I think it's hard people to sort of kind of round out the hey we're going to you need to get pay for for the source when you actually you guys are actually worth a lot of money. And Elon Musk obviously never wanted to stay silent, especially on Twitter when he's been getting a lot of pushbacks since that report came out from CNN last night. What have we even hearing from him today? Well, we saw today, you know, I mentioned that from late last night about how, hey, the LEO connectivity is a very expensive business, it's not cheap, we are digging out of our own pockets to do this, so don't expect us to pay for this going forward. We're talking about 120 length of the entity of the year and then I think 300 to 400 million through next year. So it is not cheap, you know, SpaceX is trying to get their model off the ground, so I totally understand that. So that's what he's saying right now, but I think you sort of caught in the cross here, is it of do you support Russia or Ukraine and why are you actually kind of debating this right now? The grand scheme of things, now that we kind of know that the numbers in terms of, you know, what the connectivity, the service itself is going to cost, how significant is startling to the future of SpaceX? Because this is something that, you know, it's been getting a lot of attention because this is a real use case in Ukraine. They have to your point really come to rely on this service, but in the grand scheme of things for SpaceX, how big is startling? I believe it's, it was supposed to be a big component of their profitability, it's a service that they can offer, not only is it 4,500 for that high end terminal service, but also it's 50 bucks a month for families and other people to use that in places like India, for instance, like they want to deploy that there. It is a big part of their sort of mission to kind of not only just send elevators into space with rockets, but also to sort of connect everyone through the world through global satellite internet. So it is a big part of that story and a big part of that profitably component, but I guess right now it's still not fully profitable. Okay, something to watch there. According to Elon Musk. According to Elon Musk, always according to Elon Musk. Elon Musk, thanks so much for that. We're continuing the never ending saga between Elon Musk and Twitter. Court documents and SEAL Thursday revealed that Elon Musk is under federal investigation for actions connected with his $44 billion dollar Twitter acquisition. Let's bring in Yahoo Finance is Alexis Keenan Alexis. What how many days ago were we talking about how well the deal is probably going to get closed and here we are talking about another investigation. What is this specifically? Well, that's a big part of the story of all the around. Okay, so it could be investigations plural because of the way that this filing is phrase. Now why are we learning about this? It's because Twitter is asking for the judge in the Delaware case, the dispute over the acquisition that's currently stayed, the trial is stayed, not the case going forward. And asking for the judges help saying we want must to turn over the communications that his attorneys had with federal authorities. The way they specifically phrase it is they want those communications concerning Twitter and the Twitter transaction. Twitter wrote to the judge saying that Musk, the way they phrase it is presently under investigation by federal authorities for his conduct concerning the acquisition. They want to say that they want those documents specifically because they bear upon key issues in the litigation. Now there's no further details about what exactly that conduct is. Twitter says Musk's attorneys, Quinn Immanuel, had turned over about 1700 documents that they said were privileged and therefore could not be read by the other side. But Twitter is saying no among those documents are these draft communications from his lawyers with these authorities. One being a May 13th email sent to the SEC, a draft to the SEC rather, they actually dispute why there's not the final communications with pertaining to these documents. The second one is a slide presentation for the FTC. So they want those documents. They want to dig a little bit further into those investigations. Now we do know though that Musk was suspected to be under investigation because of the way he handled the acquisition altogether. We know that back when he was acquiring the Twitter stock and when he passed that 5% threshold going to 9% stake in Twitter, we know that he filed late with the SEC. And we also know that he filed the wrong document which was for passive investors instead of active investors. So at a minimum we should expect that the SEC would want to look into this. Really quickly, what does this mean in terms of the timeline for a potential acquisition? Getting completed? How is this going to complicate the process? Yeah, you know, I don't think necessarily that this particular issue will push out if there is going to be a trial and you further. The parties have had contentious issues every step.",https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GRIayi6dbGM,22,2022-10-14 15:32:00
3316," early that this particular issue will push out if there is going to be a trial at any further. The parties have had contentious issues every step along the way. And certainly these discovery fights are to be expected. Absolutely, each party is going to fight hard to make sure that they don't have to turn over to the other side something that they don't want to see. Yeah, good point. There are no real surprises at this point after all the back and floor. Thanks so much for that. Well, coming up, setting the tone, JP Morgan beats the street. It's the higher rates. But Jamie Diamond wants to get points to economic headwinds. Who's in the eye of the storm? I'm going to look to some big reports on deck next. Well. In a group of men who have never published yet, you can never really say the truth. Earlier on Yaku Finance, San Francisco Fed President Mary Daly joined our very own Jennifer Schomburger to talk about the latest CPI print and the Fed's policy. Take a listen to what you have to say. We will have to be data dependent about what actual rate hikes we take because we have domestic conditions, but we're also working in a global economy. And there's a lot of uncertainty and risks out there. We have to think about those in the context of exactly what we do. But there's literally no doubt in my mind that we need to put more restrictive stance of policy in the economy to further get demand and supply imbalance so that consumers don't have to worry about such high inflation month after month. We're joining us now to talk about the impact of the Fed's policy. We've got Tom Hanlon, senior investment strategist at US Bank, wealth management. Tom gets to talk to you today. Let's pick up on that point that Mary Daly just made. She insists the Fed is still data dependent. The data suggests in her words that restrictive policy needs to continue. Is that how you see it? Oh, sure. And thanks for having us on. Yeah, the CPI print yesterday. So core inflation, excluding volatile food and energy at a 40-year high. And then today you have the consumer sentiment indicator from University of Michigan.",https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GRIayi6dbGM,23,2022-10-14 15:36:09
3317," CPI print yesterday, so core inflation, excluding volatile food and energy at a 40-year high. And then today, you have the consumer sentiment indicator from University of Michigan, where consumers are asked where they see inflation, and that actually ticked higher, which is not the direction the Fed wants to see. So I think that the member, Daley, is representing that the data continues to suggest that the Fed needs to continue to tighten to bring inflation back under control. The data may suggest that the Fed needs to continue tightening control. But, Daley also in that interview said that this concern about that tightening, and how aggressively they're moving leading to a recession, a hard landing, so to speak, doesn't necessarily jive with what she has heard personally. So she talks about going out on the road, speaking to business owners who aren't necessarily asking about a recession, saying, yeah, they're concerned about higher prices, but we're worried about hiring. We're worried about other issues. I mean, what do you make of this disconnect that we continue to hear between this fear of, you know, those like Jamie Dimon saying there was a big recession on the horizon, and then others were saying, well, that's not really the prime concern, though. Yeah, I think it's just a difference in where we are today, to where we may be in 2023. So certainly, if you look at employment, that doesn't suggest that we're in a recession right now. There's still 10 million job openings and unemployment remains low. And the consumer remains in pretty healthy shape, and we still have a lot of savings that accrue during the pandemic that they're able to drop on as we get toward the holiday season. I think that the question is, at what point do federal reserve rate hikes start to eat into both consumer spending and business sentiment in the form of lowering investment in future gains? So, I think the question is, what does this look like not necessarily today, but in 2023? And there is the potential that the Fed continues to tighten into this slowing economy, and potentially do end up in that type of recession. It's not necessarily our base case today. I think that's what you're seeing in terms of capital market volatility, which is how far will the Fed have to tighten to get inflation under control? What rate will that do to consumer spending and business investment? Let's talk more about the volatility. I mean, yesterday we saw what was an incredible turnaround, rally, a huge swing, and today we saw, by the way, yesterday coming on the back of what was a stronger than expected CPI print. Here we are today talking about a dip in the other direction again. What do you think is behind this choppin-as? Yeah, so the initial market reaction on the CPI print yesterday was down, and you reach levels that technicians or other market observers suggest that maybe reached this oversold condition where program buying started to kick in, and then as the stocks market started to recover, perhaps you started to get more people participating at upside. It was a pretty high volume day yesterday, so that suggests that there was a lot of participation in it. But again, when you go back to the fundamentals, when you go back to what's going on in the economy, and you go back to the fears about inflation and what the Fed needs to do, today was just one more data point that let you know that inflation isn't yet anywhere near the Fed's target rate, and the Fed's going to have to continue to tighten policy. Is this kind of chopping-as continuing? You think moving forward here as we look ahead to the next FOMC meeting? Yeah, I mean, we think it sets up as a pretty news heavy year as we call it here in the fourth quarter, so you've got two Federal Reserve meetings, one in November, one in December. You've got the midterm elections and setting up in the first couple of weeks in November, and then you have, you know, still has more CPI prints and other economic releases, and we're just getting started on third quarter earnings and the corporations. This will be a key focal area as well, is what is corporate America seeing in terms of the outlook? Is it as visible as they thought it was in previous quarters, or things starting to get cloudy in terms of the four looking outlook? So these are the things that are going to play into now until the rest of the year. We think that sets up for a fairly choppy capital market and equity market going forward. Tom Hanlon, US Bank wealth management senior investment strategist, appreciate your time today. And shift your attention to the labor market and UF employers appear to be thinking twice before laying off workers. At least that's what our chart of the day suggests. This data coming from Axio Siding Fred shows a historically low level of layoffs and unemployment in the economy as things stand. All this has to be a persistent fear that we are inching toward a sharp slowdown. The spike you see is",https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GRIayi6dbGM,24,2022-10-14 15:40:10
3318," of layoffs and unemployment in the economy as things stand, all this amid persistent fears that we are inching toward a sharp slowdown. The spike you see is, of course, down to the mass layoffs during the peak of COVID in 2020, which may serve as a warning not to pull the trigger too soon this time around. We're not saying it's down to so-called labor hoarding, but it's certainly one of those theories that have been making the rounds for some time. Coming up, attention turns to Beijing. China's National Congress begins on Sunday, a mammoth gathering that will solidify the leadership of President Xi Jinping. But will it trouble the economy and zero COVID policy overshadow the event? That's our next. Let's meet soon! It is time now for this week's bi-denomics. The last CPI report before the midterms was grim reading for Americans and the administration after another stubbornly high number, President responded by saying inflation would be worse under Republicans. Morning consults, latest polling track or tell. The story illustrating the president's popularity or lack of it among voters in 45 out of 50 states. Let's bring in Yahoo Finance's Rick Newman. Rick we're so close to the midterms here. How much are we to make of another data set that points to inflation remaining high, the impact of that on the elections? Well, it's a big data set in a really important one. There was some hope among Democrats toward the end of the summer. Gas prices were coming down by a lot. President Biden's approval rating was ticking up. Some surveys showed that voters were feeling better about Democratic control of Congress. There was some hope that maybe Democrats actually would be able to buck the usual trend of the midterm elections and hold on to both countries.",https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GRIayi6dbGM,25,2022-10-14 15:44:24
3319," better about Democratic control of Congress. And so there was some hope that maybe Democrats actually would be able to buck the usual trend of the midterm elections and hold on to both houses of Congress. But for that to happen, they needed basically everything to go their way during the last few weeks leading up to the midterm elections on November 8th. And everything is not going their way. I mean, what Democrats really needed was gas prices to continue going down, but also consistent improvements in inflation. And we just haven't had that. So inflation peaked at 9% over the summer. And there was some hope that by now we would be below 8%, and maybe even below 7%, but we're not. We're down to just 8.2%. So inflation is very stubborn. And so far, all the federal reserve interest rates heights, interest rate heights that have been going on since March, have not had any notable impact on inflation. Now, they will have an impact on inflation, but there's a lag. And this timing is just not going to help Democrats. So I'm seeing a lot of political analysts who are saying this latest inflation number from September, basically, ISIS it for Republicans, they seem very likely to regain at least one house of Congress in the midterms. And that means they'll be able to block Biden's legislative agenda. We'll find out just a few weeks out from that all important midterm election. Rick Newman, thanks so much for that. GM. We'll say with big political events, China is set to kick off a historic National Party Congress this weekend. The country's struggling economy should have be a key focus in the face of President Xi Jinping's ongoing zero-COVID policy. Data today shows consumer prices in September rose. At the fastest pace, they've gone since April of 2020. It's certainly hard to overstate the importance of the event. The National Congress happens only once every five years. It outlines the broad priorities for the nation. More importantly, there are suggestions. The overall mission statement will pivot from a long-held focus on economic growth to security. The future structure of the Rolling Party will also be determined. China watchers eagerly awaiting details on the next premiere. He's traditionally part of the all-important standing committee or a Politburo and the nation's second most powerful man the big takeaway president Xi is poised to win a third term, making him the most powerful leader of China since Mao Zedong. Let's dive deeper into this big kickoff with Nargiza Saljanova, she's a Rodeum Group China Practice Director. Nargiza, you have put out this very interesting annual report the China Pathfinder that really takes a closer look at where China's economy is right now. All eyes are going to be on that third term or at least the president securing that third term. What is that likely to mean for in terms of how the economic policy shifts for China? That's right, as you said. The 20th party Congress means everyone is trying to really define what is the future of China's economic policy. And what the China Pathfinder project which we have worked on in partnership with the Atlantic Council shows us is that China's capture of one has really stagnated. Not enough to undo some good progress that they've done since their WTO accession, but in areas from open-est investment to market competitiveness, we see a pause or in some cases a rollback. And as we know, the role of the state has been surging in many regards in every part of the economy and society we have seen parties intrusion, increasing which really sends a warning and a caution to foreign investors, to domestic companies, what to expect coming out of the party's Congress is on everyone's mind. So it's where it's sort of looking back to where we were a year ago. China was growing at an annualized rate of 8%. Now you've got the World Bank forecasting 2.8% growth, many major banks have come out and set 3% in 2022. Well, what is the pivot that's likely to come out of this party Congress, or is there one given that number one, the president has doubled down on the zero-COVID policy? But number two, I mean, we have really started to see a reckoning in the real estate sector. And the real estate sector is, I think, the core issue for us to focus on, right? Delivering up to 25% of China's economic growth. And there's no...",https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GRIayi6dbGM,26,2022-10-14 15:48:50
3320," And the real estate sector is, I think the core issue for us to focus on, right? Delivering, you know, up to 25% of China's economic growth. And there's no substitution for that. The government has not been really able to set up new drivers of growth, which will take China forward and able to deliver the same kind of growth that China and observers have been able to enjoy. There has not been a proper resetting, even with all the downgrades, and we've seen them coming down and down and down through the entire year. A couple of important things to watch out for, right? And this is going to be true for both China's domestic audience and external audiences. What happens with zero COVID? Nothing has disrupted China's economy as much to going to the core of China's society as zero COVID policy. And it's really unlikely that there's going to be a real kind of aggressive shift unveiled at the party congress. That's really the time to use a reset and retrench, but looking forward, what happens? It's going to be a much better situation for China if there is a stronger signal that the policy is going to be stopped, rather than kind of a fudging and slurring its way through a kind of gradually declining to that. Another really important consideration to watch out for is the new crop of leaders being appointed into key positions. Every appointment is going to give you the reliance of whether it points to further consolidation of power by Xi Jinping and a further retrenchment, or will technocrats be at the reins once again and be allowed to put in place more policies which stabilize China's growth, which put it on a more sustainable path and push reform forward. Another really important thing to pay attention to is what happens with a greater unveiling or a greater emphasis on what common prosperity actually means. As we know, that's an important policy that Xi Jinping has put his personal and premature on. And Chinese officials have been at teens to say that there is not going to be a massive redistribution, but it isn't really clear how common prosperity is going to play out. Norgisa, I'm thinking back to just how much the message from the top down has shifted over the last five years since this last party Congress. We were talking about President Xi talking about quality growth, not growth at all costs, also talking about raining in debt. It feels like he sort of put that aside. He's certainly a bigger focus, at least that's the expectation moving into this. You think President Xi is willing to put security front and center at the expense of a slowdown in the economy because that has sort of moved hand in hand in terms of foreign direct, foreign investments coming in. Company saying, rethinking their presence in China. Where's the priority here, you think, for the next five years? So we have to be careful here, not to over general rise. Every all governments and all politicians, Chinese officials are able to have multiple levers that they pull depending on the need and depending on their core priorities. But it is certainly true that political considerations and in any case of security considerations have been overriding a lot of the economic priorities in recent years. We've seen this manifest that in China's relationship with some of its external partners, for example, the way that the comprehensive agreement on investment with the EU was really undermined by the decisions of Chinese policy makers and their emphasis on policies which the EU officials just found intolerable. What does this ultimately mean for companies that are still doing business in China? Investors, I mean, you point out in your report itself, there's increasing questions about whether China is investible. Right. I think, regardless of what happens at the 20th Party Congress, China faces a prolonged period of week or a growth. And this is because even if Chinese officials really decide to sort of go all in on a new aggressive reform package, tangible structural changes will take years to be realized.

3323," sites. I just want to get your reaction to the headline figure and the fact that we've seen still some of the persistence in inflation nudging higher and showing up in prices. No doubt about it. So I think what really scared the markets here was the strength in the core inflation readings in particular. You mentioned we have rents going up pretty rapidly. This was the largest month over month rise in rental inflation since June 1990. And we know that the Fed is very focused on the slow moving stickier parts of the inflation process. A lot of things tied to the service economy which has been rebounding. And we have to keep in mind that a lot of these numbers tend to follow the business cycle with long and varied lags. So in particular sticky core inflation measures like rents will tend to follow the economy by five quarters. That means the strength here could simply be a reflection of how the economy was doing 15 months ago. And that's really what has these market prices in a bit of a squeeze. And that's that the Fed is reacting very aggressively to backward looking information. A lot of the forward looking measures of inflation have really come down sharply. But the Fed is overlooking that and they are hitching their policy moves to deeply lagging indicators. And the economy is caught in the cross crosshairs of that. So Mike, what are those forward looking indicators that you are taking your cues from when you're saying maybe we're seeing a little bit of positivity coming on the inflation front. And then what you're saying implies that the Fed is indeed making a mistake here. Yeah, I think they are on the cusp of going too far and way too fast. I think there was some justification for them moving aggressively when the rate hikes started. But to persist now with these 75 base point rate increases with an inverted yield curve and with residential real estate hitting the skids, I think is a mistaken strategy. But in particular, the sensitive forward looking price level indicators that are moving lower in a dramatic fashion commodity prices in a big bear market, they ran up dramatically for two years on the front edge of the inflation process and the Fed ignored it. The dollar has soared in a historic fashion. Bond market inflation expectations where investors are putting their money on the line have come down dramatically. And let's not forget how this whole inflation process started with the huge explosion of the Fed's balance sheet of big rise and broad money. A lot of expansionary fiscal policy. All of that is going into reverse gear now. And I mentioned residential real estate a moment ago. That's where the the V shaped boom really started in terms of the whole recovery process. So everything that has been on the front edge of the boom in the inflation process has rolled over very sharply. And yet the Fed is acting in an aggressive manner looking in their rear view mirror. Well, then the Michael, how do we get inflation down? And this is the Fed's gig. Their sole purpose is there is to among many other things full employment and get inflation under control. If they're not out there being aggressive, who does that fall to? Do we have to look at the bottom administration to finally do something? Yeah, it's this is the Fed's responsibility in terms of inflation. At least the portion of inflation that's due to strong demand and by our calculations that's most of it. But the Fed also needs to be forward looking. If they were forward looking, they wouldn't have put the monetary stimulus on as long as they did. They would have been sooner to tighten policy. And there would be less of a risk of overshooting on the other side, which is exactly where we are now. So I would seem to me that they could improve policy by looking forward, by incorporating some of those forward looking indicators into their process. So they should really be slowing down the pace of hikes now, not reacting in a belated panicky fashion to deeply lagging indicators. That is a prescription for an accident. At the same time, you know, you.",https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GRIayi6dbGM,30,2022-10-14 16:06:00
3324," laid-it panicky fashion to deeply lagging indicators. That is a prescription for an accident. At the same time, Mike, you know, you, one has to sympathize sort of, right? Like, you see this alarming number, right? And there is the perception that the Fed has to act on this. Of course, you're not the only one with this message. We are seeing now and hearing from an increasing number of economists who are saying something similar to what you are saying. What we convinced the Fed to listen? In the past, we have sometimes seen dramatic things happen in the market that have then convinced the Fed to act, perhaps belatedly. How would that kind of a scenario play out? Well, I mean, I think the setup here is we're going to need to see some softness in these lagging indicators, or at least some of the coincident information. Pay rolls were very strong in September. So that didn't do the trick. This core inflation data has been strong. And so we're really going to need to see the momentum there break to the downside. I think that is coming. I'll give you another forward indicator that was peaking six months ago. The ISM prices paid index. Typically, there's about a six month lag in terms of when that's showing up in the inflation meetings. And so if you go back to six months ago, we are basically at the high for 2022 there. And now we're off very sharply. So over the next three to six months, I think we're going to get some better news on inflation that may not be soon enough to save the economy from a recession with the Fed likely to keep going pretty aggressively here. And then in the near term, and then the discussion right before I came on was about, you know, these peak policy rate expectations now are pushing towards 5%. That's well above the rates across the whole treasury yield curve, which, you know, to me means if that happens, we will be going into a recession. Inflation will fall very sharply in a recession. And then the Fed will be backtracking and cutting rates in an embarrassing fashion. Mike, for consumers who wake up this morning and see the headline number and then also see the market reaction, there's also the reality of how they think about their own spending. Does this change any household spending even knowing just how much we're paying for everything from groceries to some of the other necessities and even some of the discretionary items that we still continue to buy? No doubt about it. I mean, the labor market has been very strong in resilience. So that's sort of been the saving grace. But these, you know, this inflationary backdrop has certainly been an irritant to households. And we can see that in a lot of weak confidence data. So far, that hasn't been enough to stop the economy in its tracks, but we have the Fed tightening very aggressively. And that will hit the economy with a lag. Over the last seven months, policy rates have gone up 300 basis points. And in real terms, if we use inflation expectations, which have been falling since March, a 400 basis point rise, that is the most rapid rise in short-term interest rates that we've seen since the early 1980s going into a very deep and very long recession. So I think households, unfortunately, here are also caught in the Fed's crosshairs because the tightening is likely to keep going until it kills the labor market. Though kill inflation, but they're going to end up killing the labor market with it. Oh, all right. So brewing here, Mike, thank you so much for being here with your analysis.

3325, you you it is Thursday October 13th here in New York City on Brad Smith with Julie Hyman and Brian Saasie an ugly day on Wall Street after another red hot inflation report CPI month of a month coming in at four tens of a percent in a move higher the economic data keeps on coming jewels over to you for some housing news as well right now 6.92 percent Brad that is now the average 30 year fixed rate mortgage that data just coming out to us from Freddie Mac 6.92 percent by the way is the highest going back to April of 2002 all of this of course goes back to the Fed raising interest rates and also has already had ripple effects throughout the housing market putting pressure on pricing putting pressure on demand and affordability we've been watching these mortgage numbers very very closely because obviously they have really ratchet it up the monthly cost for people who are taking out a 30 year mortgage in order to buy a house so we've got that number we've got that CPI number all of it pointing to continued inflation at least for now but now are joined by someone who has has her eyes on potential deflation that of course is Kathy Wood our our Invest Founder and CEO and you recently wrote an open letter to the Fed where you warned about deflation we talked to Michael Darda of MKM at the top of the show where he said the Fed is making the mistake of looking at backward looking indicators what should the Fed be looking at Kathy when it's trying to really assess what is happening with inflation sure hi Julie and Brian well if you look at what's happening in the pipeline what you're seeing in terms of commodity prices are some very serious declines both from their peaks and year over year now so that is sort of we would say that's upstream inflation that is heading towards the PPI and then ultimately the CPI so we've got gold prices and in fact I looked at them yesterday I had thought that the last two years gold had been trading within the 1700 to nearly 21 hundred dollar range and that's true it has and it has broken down this is a really good leading indicator of inflation what caught my surprise yesterday was looking at where gold was in 2011 it was roughly this level so you can say from since 2011 more than 10 years we haven't had a big burst in a big breakout in the gold price and and that is informing our decision here gold is a leading indicator of inflation and it has not broken out it is breaking down and then the second thing that we're looking at is the inventory glut around the world and especially in the United States it looks like some of the best supply chain managed companies in the world have over over ordered they ignored their automated enterprise resource planning systems so ERP systems and double ordered triple ordered so that Nike for example its sales were up only three and a half percent globally last quarter and yet it's inventory is up 44,https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GRIayi6dbGM,32,2022-10-14 16:14:22
3326," Nike, for example, its sales were up only 3.5% globally last quarter. Yet its inventories were up 44%. In the United States, they were up 68%. If you look at it in transit, they're up 85%. That's just one indication. We're seeing lots of inventory overhangs. Even online sales are suffering. Amazon just had its second prime day. And it showed no increase, which is really from a year over year, which is telling us that either units are down or prices are down. So I think the CPI that we got today is a lagging indicator. It always is a lagging indicator. And we're seeing a lot of prices in the pipeline that are falling. So, Kathy, let's talk about what this means for the Fed. And your open letter to the Fed, where you urge them to consider some of what you're talking about right now. The market after today's data is now more fully pricing and not just a 75 basis point increase at this upcoming meeting. But at the one after that as well, do you think the Fed should be done? Do you think they should even raise 75 basis points at this upcoming meeting? Or do you think they should stop here and give some time for their increases to make their way through the economy? Yes. As we're thinking about this question, we compare what Chairman Powell is doing to what Chairman Volcker did in the late 70s, early 80s, when he was fighting an inflation problem that had been building for 15 years, Vietnam War, Great Society, Closing the Gold Window. That was a real inflation problem that built up over 15 years. This inflation problem has been 12 to 15 months by the time the Fed started addressing it. And we think it's much more a function of supply chain imbalances, caused by COVID, and then again, by Russia's invasion of Ukraine. These are very, very different circumstances. So what the Fed has done this time around is it has increased interest rates. If they go another 75 basis points, which is very likely on November 2nd, they will have increased interest rates from 0.25 to 4%. And that's a 16 fold increase. What did Volcker, in the early 80s, he took interest rates from 10 to 20%. That's a two fold increase after consumers and businesses had gotten used to dealing with inflation and working around it over 15 years. This is a real shock to the system. And I do believe we will see the ramifications. In many ways, we're seeing housing shutting down. And I think we're going to see a lot of other activities shutting down as well. We believe we're in a recession. And we believe this recession now will be sustained. And if we see an increase in GDP, it's probably because either inventories are continuing to increase or imports are coming down as companies try to unwind their inventories. Kathy, so do you see a severe recession? And then how long do you think this bear market will continue? Well, what's interesting, I think many people are coming around to the idea that we're in a recession or we're going into a recession. The first two quarters with real GDP growth negative to us means we're in a recession. And now that many people are worried and are beginning to see recession for us far as the eye can see, we are looking at this recession a little bit differently. We think it's going to be a function of this massive inventory overhang and that it's going to be a serious inventory correction. But it's not going to be anything like we saw in 0809. That was a systemic financial problem caused by the mortgage and financial meltdown. We don't think this is the same thing. So now that many economists are starting to agree with us that we're in a recession or going into a recession, we feel that they might become a little bit too alarmist. If this is just an inventory.",https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GRIayi6dbGM,33,2022-10-14 16:19:01
3327," or in a recession or going into a recession, we feel that they might become a little bit to alarmist if this is just an inventory recession. And I think the Fed will have a lot to do with whether or not it is. This is a shock, though, to the system. And this idea that we have an inventory overhand, we think it's going to get bigger as consumers pull back, low saving rates, 3.5% versus 8% where it was before COVID. And so we'll see. We think this holiday season is going to be pretty tough. And so as you kind of read your shopping list for that holiday season, Kathy, when you think about some of the kind of ways that equity valuations are starting to price in that recession to the best of their ability, is there a big buy that you now kind of think through or evaluate going into the end of the year here? Well, you have to consider the source here. And our focus, our sole focus, is on disruptive innovation. And we also believe that innovation solves problems. We had a tough time going into COVID with our kind of strategy. And then we had a boom in our strategy during COVID, because guess what? We needed the genomic revolution to help sequence the coronavirus and figure out tests and vaccines. And our kinds of companies helped with that. We think with supply chain issues and with the food and energy prices caused by this shock, this Russia's invasion of Ukraine, that once again, innovation is going to help solve these problems. Electric vehicles, there's an accelerated consumer preffership towards electric vehicles, like Tesla, because of oil prices. And we think there's no stopping that trend now. And in terms of food prices, we do believe that gene editing is going to help us figure out how to produce crops in areas that are less fertile than the Ukraine, the bread basket of Europe, with less water, less fertilizer, less pesticide. So we're going to continue to see the miracles associated with the genomic revolution. But our other strategies as well, whether we're talking about robotics, solving the labor shortage, energy storage, I mentioned electric vehicles, pulling us away from oil consumption, artificial intelligence, which is going to help every company become more competitive if they use their data and combine it with other data in effective ways. And then blockchain technologies, which is going to take the middleman out of a lot of businesses, and take the cost out of a lot of businesses, helping us to solve this inflation problem. So again, consider the source. We think innovation solves problems. It certainly gave us an appreciation of that. During COVID, our strategy was high flying. And we think we have even more problems right now. So stay tuned.",https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GRIayi6dbGM,34,2022-10-14 16:23:15
3328," you Natalie Lec Shima. Kathy, this economic shock that you talk about in large part at the hands of the Fed, does that cause a shock to one of your long-term holdings in Tesla in terms of the stock price and also the company's financials? Well, certainly all stocks are experiencing difficulty in this environment as the market tries to understand how far the Fed is going to go and how deep this recession is going to be. So, Tesla, as I mentioned, is a solution to the problem. It's very interesting. If you look at gasoline demand this summer in the United States, it dropped below COVID levels, the worst of COVID, and it dropped to levels that we have not seen since 1997. That's real demand destruction, and it couldn't have happened. We do not believe without electric vehicles at the margin taking huge share from traditional automobiles. So, if we had to be concerned about an industry, it would be the traditional auto industry, we think that gas powered vehicles are going to be obsolete within the next five to ten years, and the traditional auto industry has to figure out a way to migrate into electric vehicles and into the next big phase, which we think Tesla is leading, the autonomous taxi platform phase. So, lots of changes here. Traditional industries are in harm's way as innovation pushes through accelerated by some of the turmoil out there. Cathy, when we last talked back in the spring, I believe it was just at the beginning of the Elon Musk Twitter saga. Now we are maybe getting to a little bit of closure in that case, but I would post you the same question that I asked you then, because a lot of time is elapsed in different events have happened. Are you at all concerned about Musk's attention wavering now that it looks like he is in fact going to be taking over and likely at least having a pretty heavy hand in running Twitter? Well, we are prolific users of Twitter. Our gives away its research. We give away our research not when it's finished, but as it's evolving. And our most prolific platform, social platform out there, is Twitter. I'm kind of excited to see what Elon will do. I actually think he'll work closely with Jack Dorsey and maybe open up the ecosystem, take away the censorship, make it much more transparent, and I think add more value to that ecosystem. You don't think it'll be a mess if that happens? It'll just be sort of a free-for-all where it's tougher to find commentary of value. You know what's interesting about Twitter and what we found this? We have a lot of debate around our own strategies. We can filter that debate ourselves so we can unfollow people if we think there's bad behavior, but that's our choice. And we can follow those people who we think are moving discussions, whether it's about innovation or the economy, moving discussions along. So I think there's a lot of wisdom out there.",https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GRIayi6dbGM,35,2022-10-14 16:27:53
3329," whether it's about innovation or the economy, moving discussions along. So I think there's a lot of wisdom out there. And we're kind of sick of the nonsense that we see on some of these social platforms. And Twitter, I think, is going to give us more tools to filter out the nonsense and get right down to business. I certainly would like to filter out a lot of the nonsense sometimes on Newark Addy. I want to ask you more broadly about our converse and your funds. I was looking at art K in particular and the fun flows that we have seen, which were seeing sort of bigger swings to the up end to the downside. Earlier in the year, they've gotten a little more muted as of late. You talk a lot about your three to five year time horizon, which I think makes sense. But I wonder how long, how patient investors are going to be, particularly in an environment where they are seeing losses, not just in our K, but in lots of other areas as well. Yes. And I think one thing that helps our clients is our research. And they see that it's first principles research. We have the long term time horizon. And we're seeing spectacular exponential growth opportunities. And not only one by one, the various platforms I just described, but the convergence of those platforms. So one ask her feeding another. And I think many of our clients understand that they're short innovation, truly disruptive innovation. If you own the NASDAQ or the NASDAQ 100 right now, and you look through that index, this is not the index that I grew up with. In the 80s and 90s, when we were looking for innovation, we'd go to the NASDAQ. But if you look through the NASDAQ now, and especially the NASDAQ 100, what you see are 25% of the names touching disruptive innovation, the rest of them are kind of me too. They look like other indexes, the fangs, Microsoft, Nvidia, Tesla would be our only overlap. And then you look further and more deeply into these indices. And you see names that you'd never expect to be there. Food and beverage, utilities, rails, brick and mortar retail. These are not innovation companies. And so what we've done at ARC is we are pure play innovation. And we'd like to think we are what the NASDAQ used to be in the 80s and 90s. And it used to be a very productive place to invest with a long term investment time horizon. So I think our sharing our research, and our pointing out to investors, look, what you think you own in innovation is not what it used to be. And what ARC is doing is really back to the future. We're all about investing in the future as opposed to indexes, which are more about past success. Those companies that have been extremely successful have risen to the top of these indexes. But if we're right in these five platforms that involve 14 different technologies are going to disrupt the traditional world order, then investors need to get to the right side of change. And one of the other things that we do, it's one of our missions and values, is to educate. That's why we give our research away. And we want to educate not only investors, but parents and grandparents about how the world is changing, and how radically it's changing, and how it's ever more important to get, especially students, on the right side of change, so that they can enjoy these incredible growth opportunities and not be disrupted by industries that will be sunsetting, shall I say? Kathy, a three to five year time horizon means not only kind of mid-term or recession-proofing your companies. You're not just recession-proofing your portfolio. You're also kind of mid-term-proofing your portfolio. You're a general election-proofing your portfolio. And so, you know, Eric, how do you go about identifying disruptive innovation that then doesn't get disrupted by public policy or political agenda? Well, we have a six-metrics scoring system.",https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GRIayi6dbGM,36,2022-10-14 16:32:01
3330," then doesn't get disrupted by public policy or political agenda. Well, one, we have a six metric scoring system, very much focused on innovation. One of the scores is thesis risk. Thesis risk has a lot to do with government policy. And so in the, in the early days of arc in 2014, 15, we were thinking, okay, government may be very concerned about the safety of autonomous vehicles. But as we've moved through these last eight years, what we've seen, thankfully, is the government and regulators in particular very focused on data. And what does the data say? The data says that most fatalities and accidents, 85, almost 90% of them are caused by a human error. If we take the human being out of the equation, then we're going to save up to 35, 40,000 lives in the United States, the fatalities per year, and up to 1.25 million around the world. So that is a noble goal. And we've been very gratified to see the regulators looking at the fatalities in Tesla's vehicles and informing us that for the most part, most of those fatalities were caused by human error. And for the second, that people who are driving Tesla vehicles are much safer thanks to the various automated driving capabilities now. Up to 40% safer than in most other cars. So we're very focused on what governments are studying in terms of the data. And if they stick to the data, innovation typically solves problems and makes the world a better place. Really, always a treat to get some time with you. Kathy Wood, ARC, Invest Founder, and see you. Always nice to see you. We'll talk to you soon. Appreciate the time. Thank you, Ryan. Julie as well. Thank you. America has long run on Duncan, but a change in the company's rewards program has some loyalists rethinking where they go for their a Java run. Let's talk more about all things Duncan and what's on the menu here with Duncan, President Scott Murphy. Scott, great to get some time with you coming to us from inside a Duncan location. Curious on what you're seeing in traffic? There's so much economic cross-currents coming at consumers right now. What does that breakfast day part look like? Yeah, and first of all, thanks for having me. I really appreciate it and can't wait.",https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GRIayi6dbGM,37,2022-10-14 16:36:08
3331," So much economic cross currents coming at consumers right now. What does that breakfast day part look like? Yeah, first of all, thanks for having me. I really appreciate it and can't wait to talk about our new loyalty program, Duncan Rewards. In terms of traffic, you know, been listening to your segment all morning on inflation and everything that's going on with the consumer. We feel really good about the breakfast segment. We feel really good about our brand and how we stand tall. People need their coffee and their breakfast sandwich to start their morning. So we've seen really strong results for our brand in the last couple of months. Scott, full stop. I was critical to changes in the Rewards program, but it's coming from a place of love. I have to dunk an app. I go to dunking all the time and a lot other people seemed to have caught my vibe. Have you looked at what you made here and are making any changes now to respond to consumers? Yeah, so and I know it comes from a place of love from you, Brian. Absolutely. Here's what I would say. We rolled out our Duncan Perks program in 2014 and we haven't made any changes in the last eight years. And we went out and we talked to our core users and we said, what do you want from a program? And they said they wanted three things. They wanted more variety because in the old program, you could just get a beverage. They wanted more flexibility. And we've now given them a chance to stack points so they can buy a drink for themselves. They can buy a sandwich for their family or a whole meal for the soccer team. And they said they wanted recognition. So big users like you want to be recognized and we now have a boosted status. And so we've put those three things in place. We're really excited about this new program. We gave out four billion free points in the last three days. And the response has been overwhelming with positive. Okay, fair enough. That's good to hear. But the birthday drink is the industry standard. Like I know I would like to get a free birthday coffee until I ultimately dropped dead and six feet on your, I mean, do you think you'll bring that back? So we're talking about that for sure, Brian. But one thing we did do is, well, we did take that piece away. What we added is come in either the day before your birthday, the day of your birthday or the day after, get three times points, points that won't expire as long as you come a couple times a year. And you can actually get something besides just a beverage. You could get a donut, you could get a sandwich, you can get avocado toast, a lot more flexibility, which is what our guests wanted. So you're really monitoring some of the taste profiles, the trends on what consumers are moving towards in their purchases for anything from lunchtime to starting off the day. So where are you still seeing the most traffic at what point in the day to really make some of the menu decisions and changeovers there? Yeah, we're certainly a morning day part business. So 70% of our business happens before 11 a.m. And honestly, when COVID happened and we had that shutdown, we were all very nervous when the commute was not happening. But people shifted their behaviors a little bit and they came to us a little later in the morning and they came for a couple beverages, maybe to share with their spouses while they're working at home. But really, the trend that's happening is all around ice beverages. And we invented ice coffee. We're a leader. Whether it's ice coffee, whether it's cold brew, our new refresher line, it's all about ice beverages and great attachment with snacking items to that. Hey, Scott, it's Julie here. I mean, I gotta say it's like, I guess I want to know a little bit more about the whole recession, spending patterns, et cetera, because you sound super positive. And I'm just wondering what signs if any you see a of trade down, for example, of a drop in traffic of any kind of sign that, you know, the anecdotal and data pain that we are talking about every day if you guys are seeing any evidence of that. Yeah, we do see some of it. And here's what I'd say anecdotally. What happens in our business is when things happen like fuel prices or you see other spikes in inflationary environments, people pull back a little bit and maybe they stop coming quite as frequently to a Duncan or some other restaurant. But especially with Duncan, I think after a couple days or a week, people realize they need their morning Joe to get started, right? They need their coffee to fuel their day and we've seen it come right back up. And I think uniquely positioned for us, Duncan, it is a value offering, right? So we've got great products, both beverage and food at a great price point at the speed of Duncan. I think that's an unmatched combination out there. Scott, I go to my local Duncan every Saturday. It's just a ritual I have. And every time I'm in line, why don't you...",https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GRIayi6dbGM,38,2022-10-14 16:40:57
3332," Duncan, I think that's an out there. Uh, Scott, I go Duncan every Saturday, I have and every time I'm in line, launch a huge in the morning, which is a good thing I'm sure, but everybody's buying coffee notably ice coffee. How big a percentage is donuts now on your business? And what does that menu look like? Yeah, donuts are about 20% of our product mix right now. You're right. Ice coffee is the future of the day. And I think that last year was the first year we sold more ice beverages than hot beverages. That's what the next generation of consumer wants. They want these ice cold beverages. They want highly colorful products that they can share on Instagram. But I will say our donuts. No one does donuts like we are. We are obviously a national and a global leader on donuts. You got to come try our spider donut, which we just rolled out for Halloween. We just rolled out. We just rolled out for Halloween. We just rolled out for Halloween. We just rolled out for Halloween. We just rolled out for Christmas. And when it comes to the first year, we have a number of donuts. I think we're going to have one more time that I don't have. As you've got more people returning either to office or to schools that breakfast was that's continuing to brew and and heat up. What's Duncan's positioning in that breakfast the digital value. So through our app, we're going to have the ability to have laser focused offers that go right to you and what you want and give you incredible value in our program. And then the last thing I'd say is we've got it through our app our ability to order ahead. So Brian, when you see those long lines, you download the app, order ahead, it'll be ready when you get there and the crew will hand it to you and you'll be off and running for your busy day. Scott, I just I need the birthday drink back. I'm going to dunk it anyway, lad. I'm going to get off of here. I'm going to dunk it on your birthday. I just need the birthday drink back. Please, please. Brian, I'm going to come deliver coffee to you personally on your birthday. I'll take that April 4th. There we go. Done deal. Duncan, President Scott Murphy. Thanks so much for joining us this morning. Appreciate it. you you you. We're going to talk to Wall Street plenty. Let's just speak to Main Street for a minute who's just confused because we get a we get a bad inflation print. We get a good reaction from the market. We get a great job report. And the market through the opposite. Tell Main Street what to make of today. Yeah. Well, first off, thanks for having me on a day where things are green. Yeah. Yeah. Yeah. Yeah. Yeah. Yeah. Yeah. Yeah. Yeah. Yeah.",https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GRIayi6dbGM,39,2022-10-14 16:45:37
3333," and the market through the opposite, tell Main Street what to make of today. Yeah, well, first off, thanks for having me on a day where things are green. Actually, something to talk about here. That's nice, nice change. But just today, we had the disappointing number, obviously markets were lower, but you look at what happened, we just corrected 50% of the overall bull market that we had off those 2020 lows, okay? 3,500. That's a normal type of retracement. So we found some buyers there, wasn't shocking. The VIX, the fear gauge. It didn't, surprisingly, didn't spike massively higher this morning. And then that would be a clue. The obvious market knew something and the rally came on. Last thing for Main Street, the people are really worried. Believe me, you're not the only ones confused. This year is very confusing for a lot of people. But think about this. In June 16th, we made those lows 200 approximately, 200 stocks in the S&P made a new low. Just yesterday, we made new lows less than 80 stocks, made 52 week lows. What does that mean? Price is making new lows, but less stocks are. That Main Street, everyone listening is an improvement. That's how major lows conform. There's less stocks going down, and that's a real positive sign. Well, Ryan, speaking of that positive sign, the Dow up over 3% S&P not too far behind, NASDAQ up over 2.5%. Do you think today's gains does this rally that we're seeing have legs? Yeah, we think it does. I mean, there's lots of ways we can look at this, right? I mean, I mentioned the VIX. You look at sentiment polls. We're near some of the most bearers we've seen, guys, since major lows, March 2009, March 2020. Expectations are so low. It's not like things are great. Believe me, we're going to see this earnings season how corporate America is looking. Roptimistic earnings are still going to justify this economy growing. But expectations have just simply gotten so low. And let's not forget this. Look at the last 17 bear markets, six of them bottom in October. Believe me, it could be random, maybe not. October is more of a bear market killer. The worst two-starth year ever, other than this year, this is the third-war start, 74 in 2002, all right? Bottom in the first two weeks, two weeks of October. Did we just do it again? Believe me, tune in and watch later. But we think we're optimistic that we can have another pretty good low in October. And in those regular fourth quarter strong seasonals that take place in a midterm year can take over. And we can have a pretty good size rally the rest of this year before the year is all set and done. And Ryan, how about the fact that it's a midterm election? Yeah, what are investors hoping for in this sort of environment? Yeah, great question. So let's put it this way. I think gridlock, right? You don't want too much power one way or the other. And you look at the way the election, how it might swing. You know, you know, the incumbent party that won the presidency, tends to lose some seats. But we don't think there's going to be too much power one way or the other. And that could be what matters. But for the average investor listening, just know this. We say do not invest in your politics, right? Just invest in the fundamentals. But think about this. If you looked at what the S&P did, the day of the midterm elections, go back to World War II, all right? One year later, the S&P was higher every single time, up 14.1%. So whatever happens, markets hate uncertainty. Get that election out of the way, the uncertainty out of the way. Then markets tend to do pretty darn well. Last point on this, the second year of a new president. So this year, historically, extremely weak. Believe me, this year's weaker than we expected. At the same time, this isn't abnormal to see weakness the second year of a new president. And things get a lot better that third year. And the economy can keep growing in our view. It should lead to pretty good size gains into this year and into next year. Don't get me wrong, man. We love to see the rally. We love your positivity. You know that. But if I said dinner on the S&P being higher in one month, then it is today, you'd say what? And that's an awful thing. Where are we going for dinner is what I would say. What I mean. OK. Some more expensive. Yeah, good steakhouse. No, I'm going to hire. I mean, believe me. So let's put it like this. October and November are the top two months in a midterm year. We talked about some of those things. I know we know inflation's high. But overall, this beach ball is really low, right? Really, really low. Once you let go, and that momentum go up, we think this time next month, you can buy me a steak. I'll come to New York. And we think the S&P is going to be a decent deal higher. I'd be happy to buy you dinner, man. If I lose this bet, and that is a bet, it's on tape. Is there anything that you see then that tells us inflation might be cooling? Yeah, I mean, believe me, this number is disappointing. Yesterday's number is disappointing. But yes, you look at some of the individual surveys, like rents. Rents are actually down month over month last year. The government data doesn't show that, because government data takes like...",https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GRIayi6dbGM,40,2022-10-14 16:49:56
3334," supporting yesterday's numbers Yes, you look at some of like rents rents are actually government data doesn't show like nine months for to get cars and really start government data doesn't show that is real time when it comes potential positive just look around commodity prices have come back significantly some shining potential bright spots in a really dark see when it comes to inflation but at the same time what's priced in and what's not the market is pricing in massive inflation massively higher rates the fed is not infallible this time 15 months ago the fed saw one rate hike this year all right I'm not calling them out I'm just saying that's what it was six months from now I doubt if the feds will be nearly as hawkish as they are right now. When you take a look I guess what we're going to see play out in the markets over the next several weeks a big earnings with some of the bigger banks we heard from Pepsi earlier this week they were actually able to weather the sensor in environment high inflation very well what are some areas or do you think do you spot any trends just in terms of companies that are best position to weather some of the downturn that we could see even though you you have a pretty optimistic outlook here yeah that's a great point so earnings coming up right energy is supposed to have massive earnings growth we know that but the number two is industrials industrials so see over 20% you over your earnings growth you don't usually have a recession when that happens and you look under the service at industrials on a relative strength basis versus yes and p500 industrials are breaking out to like one and a half of your highs on a relative strength so to see industrials that strong under the service with small calves with gin violated the June lows with health care hanging in there with regional banks actually making new highs in relative strength things are perfect we get it but these are some shining lights and some some positives that are under there and industrials to me is a really good looking group that could be a big one or this earnings season so Ryan then for investors watching this wondering what to make of this period between now and November how should they be viewing the market where are the opportunities yeah kind of hinted at some of them so we like value over growth still your industrials your energy you know those materials I mean those those some groups still look pretty good to us we haven't liked big cap tech for a while more neutral at best I just look at this multi-year running growth right in technology some of these names still look kind of top heavy honestly so we like kind of small caps look pretty good in value those are some areas we still like just big picture this big bear market that we've had we think you know this time six to twelve months or down it's cliche to say but there are some really good opportunities and honestly look at small caps small caps are historically cheap relative to large caps that's another positive we think there all right lots of great stuff a big thank you Ryan Dietrich for joining us this afternoon have a good one you all right well that CPI print is the big story of the day",https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GRIayi6dbGM,41,2022-10-14 16:53:48
3335," I'm going to be back. All right, well, that CPI print is the big story of the day coming in much hotter than expected inflation rising 8.2% in September and a year or year basis. We want to bring in Vince Reinhardt, Drifus and Melon, a chief economist. Vince, it's great to see you. So certainly it's interesting when you take a look at the market's reaction, but from an economist perspective, I guess the this change your outlook at all, just where we are in the economy right now and what we could expect in the coming months. No, it just seals the deal for what the Fed will be doing in the near term 75 basis points that it's upcoming meeting in November and other 50 in December. What it tells you is that inflation, once it gets high, gets entrenched. The worrisome thing about the Consumer Price Index report this morning was core inflation. Strip out food and energy. That's growing 6.6%. That's a 40-year high. It's getting into the prices of goods and services that are sticky and sticky lives up to its name. Hard to bud, but once they start going, they have momentum and that's the Fed's problem inflation is broader based now. We know that the Fed is playing catch up and at this point they want to do too much rather too little to really get inflation under control. When you pass through some of the minutes that we just recently gone, how does that factor into some of these data points that are going to continue to come out? I think that this is the last CPI print we're going to see before the midterms. You're exactly right. That was the headline they wanted out of the minutes that were published yesterday. FOMC participants basically said you could do too much, you could do too little. There's more danger if you don't do enough. While they fred it a little bit about what it means economic activity, they were much more concerned about inflation getting embedded and inflation expectations rising. Right now, monetary policy choice is pretty easy. It's unpleasant, but it's easy because when inflation is so far above your 2% goal, they all know what to do. What they need to do is raise rates and that's what they'll be doing. They'll be doing tighter longer and just about every CEO in the conference boards suggest a mild recession next year and just about every guest on this show says the same. But Vince, is that going to be enough to drive down inflation? We're seeing earnings at least early on that show people there's no demand destruction despite dramatically higher prices. What will bring down inflation to 2% of its just mild? We get anywhere near it. Ultimately it would be the Federal Reserve that returns inflation to its goal by being willing to keep the policy rate high for a long time. I actually don't think they'll get there next year and that is because inflation is stubborn and as you say, the economy slips into a recession when the unemployment rate starts rising as inflation gets nearer to their goal, not near enough to it. They're going to have much more difficult policy choices and chances are they'll blink. They won't keep rates high enough to get inflation back to 2. They'll satisfy themselves that inflation in the neighborhood of 2, even if it starts with a 3, is sufficient progress to ultimately get to their goal. And Vince, you've been in the room before you've been part of the very similar types of discussions. What do you tell us? What do you think the conversations are like now inside the Fed when we do get a print like today's? So I think it's a combination of what I alluded to earlier. A lot of unanimity when inflation is so high, the urge to tighten is across all FOMC participants. But you're beginning to see them put markers down about the next fight. And the next fight is next year when the unemployment rate is rising, when the economy is in recession, some of them are going to want to slow the process down. And so underneath all that good feeling, underneath them all saying the same thing about the need to raise rates a lot in front load policy accommodation is a beginning of this showing of the scenes. Where they're worried, where there'll be a difference of opinion, where's the show up, concerns about the right.",https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GRIayi6dbGM,42,2022-10-14 16:58:13
3336," of this showing of the scenes. Were there worried where there'll be a difference of opinion? Were it set show up? Concerns about arising on employment rate or recession and global economic recession. That's back on the board now, particularly this week when the IMF and the World Bank annual meetings are ongoing. They're all going to the same meetings. They're all here in the same thing. Yes, you need to tighten. You also need to be aware that everybody is tightening monetary policy and their significant risks of financial stability. And then obviously the IMF releasing their global outlook, seeing reduced growth. Also in some of the major economies expecting a slow down there, they talked about the EU, China, and the US. How do you see the fact that we're such an interconnected world now with our economies? How do you see that playing out in terms of the pressure it might put on the US economy? A lot. And it's not global monetary policy and carbon date. A coordination is actually emulation. When the Fed raises interest rates, it puts upward pressure on the exchange value of the dollar. It puts downward pressure on everybody else's exchange rate, which is a force for inflation in Europe, in Japan, in emerging markets. Most central banks don't like it, and they're forced to follow the Fed up. So part of the message this week is recognize Fedors or we're all following you. That means your footprint is bigger on the global economy than you may appreciate. And that problems in the global economy will blow back to the US economy. That's the concern about next year. And as I want to close with the housing market, now mortgage rates certainly don't rise and fall dramatically with rates for more than 10 years, but needless to say another 75 point hike is probably going to take us above 7%. What do you see in the housing market? What do you think the Fed sees? It appears to be the first breaking point. So look, the Fed's got to work the tools it has in terms of the monetary transmission mechanism. There's basically two reliable features. You raise rates, you choke off housing, you raise rates, you tend to put upward pressure on the exchange rate of the dollar. That's unpleasant for people looking for homes. And it's unpleasant for our trading partners facing downward pressure on their own exchange rates. I would think that housing is going to be troubled for a while. And the place to see that is actually abroad. In the UK, where more of mortgage activity is at variable rates, you see a much more sharper contraction activity. Indeed, you see an inability to get mortgages at some point over the last couple of weeks. That's the future for the US. It just takes longer because we rely so much more on fixed rate mortgages. But as you said, fixed rate 30-year mortgages has been more than doubled in a year. And it's going up probably into the sevens next year. Indeed it appears, Sue. All right, Vince Reinhart, appreciate your time here, sir. Thank you. I'm going to give you a big ball. To be a strong, vibrant, global power, meet a strong, vibrant, advancement-factoring industry in the United States of America. I really believe 20, 30 years from now, when we look back, or maybe even 10 years from now, when we look back at COVID, and we look at what are all the lasting negative impacts, the biggest one will be what happens to our kids. Hello, everyone, and welcome to influencers on.",https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GRIayi6dbGM,43,2022-10-14 17:02:25
3337," Hello everyone and welcome to Influencers I'm Andy Sirware and welcome to our guest U.S. Secretary of Commerce, Gina Romando here at the Department of Commerce Secretary Romando. Great to see you. Thanks so much for taking the time to speak with us. Thank you. Happy New Year. Happy New Year to you. I want to jump right in and ask you about chips and the semiconductor shortage. I know this is top of mind for you and understand where things are but also to sort of ask you about the connection between the shortages of chips and these reports of very high inflation that we've seen lately. Thank you. This is a direct correlation. I mean the inflation numbers came out yesterday and you know higher I think than anybody would want to see but if you did if you get under the covers of the numbers you realize that a third of the increase in inflation is due to car prices which is stunning you know a third is due to car prices. Why is that? Because last year auto production of cars was down by almost 8 million cars, 7.7 million cars. So supply is down, prices of cars are up 20% and the reason like the single reason or biggest reason that car production is down so much is because car companies can't get their hands on enough chips and they will tell you that. If you go to production facilities of cars and trucks by the way you will see many many cars fully assembled but for chips. So it's pretty simple supply and demand you know I'm thinking back to X10 which I took 30 years ago. It's like we need to increase the supply of cars so prices will come down and in order to do that we need to increase in semiconductor chips. So there's really a direct link between the two and we need Congress to act so they can fix the problem. And so there is the chips act out there and I'm wondering where that stands right now and then how that would address this problem. Yeah so it's kind of stalled in Congress to be very honest that the Senate worked hard, got the chips act passed and I think last summer and it's been a little bit stuck in the house. Speaker says she's for it I mean she does support it but we need to move it and so why does it matter? It is essentially it's it's incentives that the Commerce Department could provide to chips manufacturers so they will make chips in America. If you ever you know have time for kind of a really scary read you should learn more about how dependent the United States is on other countries especially Taiwan for our supply of semiconductors. Like right now in the United States we make zero none of the most sophisticated semiconductor chips none of them and we get the majority from Taiwan. So apart from the fact that we need to make chips in America so we can make more cars, we do some inflation, create jobs, it's a national security issue as well. We cannot be a secure nation economically or you know nationally secure if we get 60-70 percent of all of our chips from a single company in Taiwan. So in any event Congress needs to move they need to take action now it'll send money to the Commerce Department we'll set up a program here where we work in partnership with semiconductor companies asking them to set up shop in America making chips in America. And so would this bill then prospectively help Nvidia AMD Intel micron those US companies set up fabs here in the United States which you know cost a billion dollars they're very expensive. Yeah. And also would there be money for foreign companies as well say like Taiwan semiconductor to build facilities here. Yeah so yes and yes.",https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GRIayi6dbGM,44,2022-10-14 17:06:39
3338," And also, would there be money for foreign companies as well, say like Taiwan semiconductor to build facilities here? Yeah, so yes and yes. Yes and yes. We need, they cost many billions of dollars as you said. I'm dating myself. I don't remember when they cost a billion, that's a lot more than that. Yeah. It's multiple billions of dollars. And look, these companies could be building more fabs or fab is just a word for semiconductor facility where they make chips. They could build them now in Malaysia, Taiwan, lower cost settings. We want them and need them to build them in America, hiring Americans to make this stuff on our shores. And by the way, yes, we hope that one's Congress does its job and gets us the money. We hope, you know, Samsung, TSMC companies that are not American, but in allied countries, will be eligible if they put their facility in the United States of America. And just one more question about that. I mean, do you think companies really get it that the supply chain, which was optimized for cost, needs to be optimized for other factors as well, like security? Yeah, I think they get it now. I think they get it now. As you say, so well said by you. I mean, there's been an obsession for decades with just in time, you know, obsession with efficiency. And we're realizing that in a world of severe climate change events where storms can take out a manufacturing facility or pandemics or other kind of disruptions, you need redundancy. You need resilience. Frankly, you need stuff near you and near your customers, not all of it in Asia. So I think that absolutely, they've learned a very painful lesson. If you talk to folks who run auto companies or trucking companies, it's been a really brutal year. I mean, like I said, their production is down so significantly they've had to layoff workers. They have whole facilities filled with half-built cars and trucks. They can't finish them just because they can't get chips. So yeah, it's been a huge wake-up call for the private sector around how to build in resiliency, redundancy, just in case to their supply chain. Does all that speak to a decline in globalism? And you're the US Commerce Secretary. And I don't know what your thinking is on that. I mean, obviously you have China on your mind as well. And they're the political considerations that impact supply chain. So what is your thinking on that? Yeah. It does. I did listen. I think globalism isn't should be alive and well. In fact, you speak of China. I mean, the president is very clear on this. We have to work with our allies as we confront the threat and competition from China. And we have to actually do a better job of that, working with our allies in the Indo-Pacific, with our allies in Europe. That being said, look, we have, the United States, over decades, has just walked. We've watched our manufacturing base wither. I mean, quite literally, just wither. We've lost, I think, 30 percent of small and medium-sized manufacturers in America have gone out of business in the past few decades. So there is a balance. We need to work with our allies. These supply chains are enormously sophisticated and global. And they should be. That was in Malaysia at the end of last year, and I visited the semiconductor packaging facility of an American company. It's sophisticated. It's huge. Thousands of Malaysians work there. That is a good thing, but we can't make nothing in America. You know, it's just, we have to, it's the balance is out of whack. We've taken a right off the ball to be a strong, vibrant, global power. We need a strong, vibrant, advanced manufacturing industry in the United States of America with the workforce who can do those jobs. And that is a critical element.",https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GRIayi6dbGM,45,2022-10-14 17:11:05

3340," And the CDC reduced its quarantine guidance from 10 days to five days. Is that helping, do you think? I think so, yes, I think so. But still, folks got to get vaccinated. Right. I want to go back a little bit to inflation, Secretary Romando, and ask you, beyond chips, are there other factors and why is this difficult to address perhaps, or what is the best way to address it besides the chip situation? Yeah. So, obviously, the primary lever with respect to inflation is held by the Fed. So Chairman Powell and his colleagues have their work cut out for them, and I trust that they will do the right thing and use the tools in their toolbox to combat inflation. That being said, the President has been very clear with us, we have to use every tool in our toolbox to help the American people and reduce inflation. So some of that is getting all these supply chain disruptions behind us, the ports, congestion at the ports has been a huge issue. We've leaned into it. It is much better. You know, the shelves were full for Christmas. But, you know, we have to put that behind us. Anything that relates to supply, again, back to Econ 101. Supply of goods has to go up to meet demand, so prices can come down. So whether that is the actions the President took around meat processing to increase supply, you know, if meat, whether that's chips, ports, anything we're doing to increase the supply of goods will fundamentally help to dampen inflation. Also, look, there are provisions in the President's billback better package that will increase the labor supply, you asked about labor before. We have to get more folks into the workforce. Women will be able to get back to work if they have affordable childcare, if they have affordable care for their elderly loved ones. Now, that's longer term. Billback better is kind of investing now for the future. But the supply matters, supply side matters. You get more folks working. We got to increase the supply of goods, so prices come down. You sound like you're using a lot of your Econ knowledge from graduate days. Were you an Econ major? I was. I think that's right. I was an Econ major. Going back. And sometimes they ask you, does any of this stuff do you ever really use it in the real world? I do. I went on to study. I wanted to get a doctorate, so I come back to it frequently in this job. Right, absolutely. You talked about billback better. Are you optimistic about it? I am optimistic. I am realistic. I am optimistic. It's going to get done. It will get done. It'll look different. Whatever the President signs. This is a prediction I'm willing to make. The final bill, the President signs, he signs, will look different than what he proposed. Will look different than what came out of the house. But fundamentally, it will be transformative. It will make these investments in climate, in workforce, in bringing down health care costs that we need. And yes, I think it gets done. Can I ask you about broadband and expanding access to broadband? You've got two fronts there, people in urban populations who can't afford it, don't have access, and then the rural population is where it's an abomination, quite frankly. Where do you stand? That's part of your remit as well, right? It is. That's a huge piece of business here at the Department of Commerce. The bipartisan infrastructure law sent tens of billions of dollars to the Department of Commerce. Our job is to use that to make sure every American has broadband. The rural, tribal, urban. You're exactly right. The issues are different. In urban areas, it's less about access and more about affordability. I was the governor of Rhode Island. There's no rural Rhode Island. It's a very, it's urban. It's densely populated. It's fiber everywhere.",https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GRIayi6dbGM,47,2022-10-14 17:19:53
3341," And more about affordability. I was the governor of Rhode Island. There's no rural Rhode Island. It's a very, it's urban. It's densely populated. There's fiber everywhere, but it's not affordable everywhere. So in those places, we have to work harder on affordability. Also, I'm providing digital literacy to folks. In the rural areas and tribal areas, we have to lay fiber. And we have to use other technologies. Right now, it's so heartbreaking, Andy, to spend time as I've done in rural America. There is no broadband for hundreds of miles, which means you can't work from home. You can't visit the doctor with telemedicine. Your kids can't have virtual school. When tribal lands, at West, teachers would literally drive worksheets once a week to their students. So the kids could do the work on paper and then mail it back or drive it back to the school. So anyway, yeah, we have to do it. We will do it. We'll do it in partnership with the providers. At the end of this mission, every single American ought to have high speed, affordable broadband.",https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GRIayi6dbGM,48,2022-10-14 17:24:18
3342," I also want to ask you about tech companies, big US tech companies, and their struggles with the EU and my understanding and listing your help are asking for help from you. Google, Facebook, in particular, where does that stand? Yeah, so I think everybody recognizes that there is a need for changes in the way we regulate tech companies. That being said, some of the provisions being debated in the EU feel discriminatory. They are specifically designed to only affect three or four companies in the United States of America. That doesn't feel right. What I'm saying is, yes, of course, update regulations change regulations, be pro-competition, be pro-transparency, be pro-privacy, but don't just specifically take aim at four companies in the world and also just have an open ear to some of the legitimate concerns of American and American business. That must be a tricky balance to strike. They're not just four ordinary companies, right? They're pretty remarkable with huge amounts of power and then there's people like Lena Khan who have very perhaps different perspectives, perhaps, but certainly a mandate that would suggest that their power is maybe too large. And so how do you factor that in? Yeah, and by the way, that's true. The president has been very clear about this. We are pro-competition. We do believe there's legislation working its way through the House and the Senate in America right now dealing with that. That being said, some of the provisions of what the EU is considering is, as I said, there's not taking into account some of the very real concerns related to cybersecurity and privacy and security that American companies have and we're asking the EU to have an open ear to that. Right. What part of your portfolio are people not aware of Secretary Romando? It's a big portfolio. Maybe everything we have to do with oceans and climate. So 40 percent of the Commerce Department is related to the ocean and the atmosphere. 40 percent? Yeah, it's big. It's a big piece of business what we do here and that's all of course related to climate. So I spend a fair bit of my time. I was the governor of the Ocean State in Rhode Island. Ocean State, that's right. I really love it. So you know the license plates? Exactly. In the Ocean State, I grew up going to the beach, I grew up clamming, I feel we have to preserve the treasure of our coastal lands and our oceans. So in any event, I think people probably don't realize how much the Department of Commerce has to do with resiliency, climate, oceans, undersea efforts. You talk about being governor of Rhode Island. How is this job different from that job? Yeah, it's pretty different. You know, Rhode Island is a small place and you can make things happen quickly when you're the governor. So this is obviously, you know, just the building where we're sitting is gigantic and we have almost 60,000 employees just in the Commerce Department. So I'd say that is different. In many ways though, leadership is leadership. You know, you set a vision, you manage your team, you drive to results. So in that way, it's very familiar. Working with the legislatures.",https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GRIayi6dbGM,49,2022-10-14 17:28:17
3343," You know, you set a vision, you manage your team, you drive to results. So in that way, it's very familiar. Working with the legislature is also very familiar for me. I enjoy it, I like it, it's part of the job. I did that as governor, I'm doing that here. Right. When you were governor of Rhode Island, you were out front back then saying that schools should stay open. I know you're not education secretary, but what are your thoughts on what's going on with their schools right now with the pandemic? I still feel kids need to be in school. You know, these vaccines are safe. That's safety, obviously, we have to keep our teachers safe and our kids safe. No doubt about it. That means good protocols, more testing. Everyone has to be vaccinated. But with those precautions, kids ought to be in school. I really believe 20, 30 years from now, when we look back, or maybe even 10 years from now, when we look back at COVID, and we look at what are all the lasting negative impacts. The biggest one will be what happened to our kids. The mental health issues, how they have fallen behind in their education. And of course, this will just, this again will contribute to the lack of equity in America, because it'll be the children who didn't have broadband, whose parents couldn't stay home to teach them, who are already a little bit behind, who are just so much further behind. So, I have religion on this topic. I also have two teenagers, and I see it. We've got to get kids in school. There is a recent article out there talking about your future and being a bright light in the Democratic Party. I wonder what your ambitions are, Secretary Armando. To get through the week. I mean, like, I have a big, big, big, big job here. We just touched on it. So, this is what I'm focused on. All right. And finally, a sort of related question, but a little different, I hope, is, what do you see as your legacy here and maybe personally? Gosh. Wow. Here, I think this, the broadband that we talked about will be, if I do it right, my legacy. This is fundamental. You know, this is, this, this, done properly. It will be comparable to any of the biggest infrastructure implementations in our nation's history. And as I look towards, like, the economy and the divide, the digital divide, and how that plays into the economic and opportunity divide, there's a huge sense of urgency around getting broadband to everyone. So, I think in this job, that'll be a big portion of it. Focus on that. Yeah. All right. U.S. Commerce Secretary, Gina Armando, thank you so much for your time. Thank you. You've been watching influencers. I'm Andy Surwer. We'll see you next time. Welcome back. You're watching Yahoo Finance Live. We've struck this the top of the 10 a.m. hour here, Brad Smith here with Julie Heimann and you're seeing Brian Sazi on screen there as well. With 30 minutes into trade, let's take it swiftly on over to Julie Heimann, who's got some fresh news, breaking news and consumer sentiment as well. Yeah, consumer sentiment coming out better than estimated from the University of Michigan's October preliminary reading 59.8 is that reading 58.8 is what analysts have been. Economists had been estimating. It's also an increase from the prior month. Current conditions, whoo, lot better than estimated 65.3. That's, economists weren't even looking for a reading above 60. There are expectations, though, are lower. So, people that feel good now, but they don't expect that they're going to continue to feel good. 56.2 is that expectations number. The one year inflation number, expectations ticking up to 5.1%, and the five to 10 year inflation expectations ticking up to 2.9%. So, pretty fascinating here. And also kind of in line with what we have been hearing, right, from corporations as well. So, kind of a confirmation that just as Jamie Dimon said today, consumers are in good shape right now, right? They're feeling good right now. The consumer balance sheet is in decent shape. People...",https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GRIayi6dbGM,50,2022-10-14 17:32:50
3344," We're done and said today, consumers are in good shape right now, right? They're feeling good right now. The consumer balance sheet is in decent shape. People are spending. It's what's happening next that people are worried about. Yeah, exactly. Continue to uncertainty over future trajectory of prices, economies, financial markets around the world, indicating a bumpy road ahead for consumers that all kind of laid out within the commentary on this as well, Sauce. Yeah, just an interesting report. And I would say, just strange, shortened to the point better than expected. Doesn't really, I would say, job with the retail sales report, but nonetheless a good read on the consumer. Welcome, read for the consumer ahead of the start to the holiday. Shopping season. But let's get back under earning season, which is now officially in full swing. Results from the JP Morgan City Morgan Stanley and of course, Wells Fargo. David Allison runs point on the Hennessy Large Cap Financial Fund. David, market has seemed, at least initially, seemed to like some of these big bank earnings. Do you think that enthusiasm is justified? Well, I think the stocks have been down a lot. So the fact that they're up a little bit tells me that the world didn't come to an end again. So I think the stocks have been really bad. And so the fact that they're rebounding is sort of a sigh of relief. I think generally the fundamentals are good. I mean, obviously the margin is expanded because rates are moving up and there are primary beneficiary of that. But what you're not seeing is any real credit deterioration. So you've had a massive move in rates. You've had a massive move in the market that has gone down that's taken money away. Sentiment is not great on Wall Street. And yet you don't really see any movement in credit. So it's interesting to note how strong these banks are, even though we have this fear of recession in the end of the world that seems to be the talk every day. Yeah, I mean, the end of the world trade can at least from what I've been told only be right once. And you hope that we don't reach that point. But when you think about some of the activity even that we're seeing here on the day as well, David, as the markets have slipped back into negative territory there, we had a moment to go all three major averages in negative territory. After beginning the day, pretty strong, and what seemed like would be another add on to yesterday's momentum, even though it was a whipsaw day yesterday, as you kind of look into the rest of this quarter, what would you need to see in order to have some confidence that a bottom had been set in during this fourth quarter going into what economists are expecting in a recession at the midpoint sometime 2023? Well, my general broad thoughts are that we've had a pretty good move in rates. Two years ago, I think the two year was like 15 basis points, and now it's four plus percent. So I think we're through the bulk of the rate increases, meaning we're not going to go to eight or 10 percent on a three-month T-bill. At least that's my opinion. I think what we're heading into now is an earnings issue for all of the companies, not all of them, but enough of them. Obviously, the financials aren't seeing any earnings issues. There's concern that there will be that rates will go up, credit will kick in, loan demand will decline. And I think it would be interesting to see what happens the next couple of weeks as the non-financial start to report and tell you what's happening away from the financial economy. Even the banks came into this downturn very strong, very conservative. They haven't made, they don't want to make bad loans. They've got plenty of capital. They're benefiting from the rise in rates in the NIM. So this group is not really indicative of what's happening out there in the marketplace yet. Well, there are some hints of it, right? If you look at this, David, in JP Morgan, for example, yes, net interest income doing fantastically, but if you take out net interest income, revenue actually didn't do as well. They're raising their provisions for credit losses. They're seeing a decline in lending already. How much worse do you think some of those indicators, even if the banks are going to get worse? Well, I guess as an investor in these stocks to be...",https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GRIayi6dbGM,51,2022-10-14 17:37:08
3345," to get worse. Well, I don't, you know, it's, I guess, as an investor in these, in these stocks to be completely honest, I am looking forward to credit troubles. I am looking forward to higher rates. I am looking forward to the market getting very concerned about the health of the banking industry because that's going to generate the opportunities for me to buy the better names and outperform on the way up. So, you know, that's the, that's the raw truth of what I do is, you know, I don't want what we have now to continue because I can't really compete with the other companies in the marketplace that grow, they create new products. We need cycles for this industry to really make money for investors. And my hope, again, I'm, you know, I've been doing this for 40 years, you know, I'm hoping we have a downturn, I'm hoping we have a recession, I hope we have higher non performers that creates lower stock prices that I can buy as the economy recovers, the Fed if it's and all that stuff. Okay, so David, tell us what. So, what are the better names then? What are the ones that you're looking to get cheaper? What are the ones you're most excited about getting cheaper in this kind of tumultuous period? Well, the ones that, you know, are going to have credit problems. And I don't think the, you know, the bigger companies are going to have that. They've just been too conservative, they're too liquid. So the smaller banks, you know, the mid, the mid tier banks, maybe not the real small ones where they've made loans, loaned to deposits are higher, they don't have as much liquidity. If credit kicks in on a negative thing, then they'll hopefully go down a lot more and I'll be able to buy them. But right now, there's no problems in the industry. And this is the frustrating part for an asset manager. If there's no problems, there's nothing to get better. There's no reason for the stocks to go up. So we need things to go wrong for this group to get really attractive. And right now, you, the first eight, four or five companies that have reported everything's great. Non performers are okay. Lone growth is okay. Yeah, they're preserving, they're reserving here and there. But they're just being super conservative. And I would do the same thing. You know, so, you know, we'll see what happens. But I think you'll see more issues with, with the economy in the non financials for the next couple months. I think that the struggle, the real challenges in the, in the world is not the financial system. It's away from the financial system. David Wells Fargo is the top 10 holding in the fund. Does that company frustrate you? They had a couple I would argue two good comeback quarters to kick off this year. They come out here this morning. I would argue, expense are still high. They announced a charge. The home business under pressure, auto is under pressure. What do you make of that name? Well, it's a, again, it's a, it's a large, again, it's a, you know, this is a large cap fund. So I'm not going to own a $2 billion bank. So you have to own something big. But this is a, the valuation is reasonable. They've got a great historical franchise. They've had some management issues for the last four, five years, which have been very frustrating, not quite as bad as city court. But certainly, they've had some struggles. And the valuation is just too cheap to ignore. And the embedded franchise value of those deposits is just too large and too powerful. And you're seeing the benefit of those deposit franchises now in higher net interest income. Just while we have you here as well, David, there's an interesting tidbit within the consumer sentiment survey that come out just a moment ago. And particularly as we think about the consumer and the higher end, or higher net income consumer as well, if you see them start to be impacted to the same kind of detriment, or maybe not the same detriment. But as they're citing your negative influence on their personal finances, the highest in five months, what does that start to spell out more broadly about where consumer mindset in the economy is trending towards? Well, presumably, the Fed is doing, or is making things happen the way it wants to have them happen, meaning they're slowing the economy down. And that's showing up in certain things. Obviously stock prices are down, home prices have stopped going up 2% a day.",https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GRIayi6dbGM,52,2022-10-14 17:41:31
3346," happen, meaning they're slowing the economy down, and that's showing up in certain things. Obviously, stock prices are down, home prices have stopped going up 2% a day. So I think the issue here is who's going to really feel it more? And I just don't believe that the financial, the large financial companies, the banks, are going to feel the real bite of this recession, at least not yet. It's going to be the other companies. It's going to be the companies that have reported, even you look at Nike and you look at, those companies are going to hurt a lot more than the banks are. The banks since 2008 have been in a box, they've been regulated, they've been forced to be liquid, forced to be conservative, forced to have tons of capital, and now that's paying dividends for them in a sense that they're not seeing the struggles. So you're not really seeing what's happening yet in the economy, and I think the financials are not a good example of that yet. And so I think the numbers you're seeing are going to impact the non-financial a lot more than the financial phone. David Ellison, who runs point at the Hennessey large cap financial fund.

Get a present at Mary Daley. You won't want to miss it. We'll be right back. There's nothing better to say. All right. Thank you.....",https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GRIayi6dbGM,53,2022-10-14 17:46:11
3347," Welcome back to Yahoo Finance. I'm Jennifer Sean Burger. Well, on the back of that hot CPI report that showed a core reading, rising to the highest level in 40 years, investors are wondering what this means for the Fed and if they'll get more aggressive. Here to weigh in is Mary Daley, president of the San Francisco Federal Reserve Bank. President Daley, welcome back to the program. So wonderful to have you. It's wonderful to be here. I look forward to it. So I want to kick off this conversation and get your reaction to that CPI report and whether it changes the course of policy for you. If we look at the reading on inflation, it appears to be actually moving in the wrong direction, right? We saw core inflation, which excludes those volatile energy and food prices rise 6.6% last month up from 6.3 in August and 5.9 in July. Do you still see the Fed funds rate rising somewhere on the order of 125 basis points this year or does the Fed need to get more aggressive on the back of this report? Sure. And you know, the CPI is one part of the dashboard of indicators we look for. It's an important one and it does show the data not cooperating. It was a very disappointing report, but I would offer it wasn't that surprising, right? We would hope that inflation would start to come down faster, but I was prepared for it to just be sluggish in its response. It's a lagging indicator. And so what I'm also looking at is what's going on in the inputs to inflation are demand and supply showing any signs of coming back in balance. And here I would offer two things that you see the labor market cooling. It's still very strong, but it's cooling. You also see housing demand cooling. So the housing market is softening. And then today's retail sales report, which had showed flat spending is really another sign that we're getting some cooling and that we will eventually feed through to inflation. So my own sense is that we went in, I went into this, uh, intermeeting period, if you will, thinking that we needed to continue to raise rates to further restrict the economy and we'll have to be data dependent about what actual rate hikes we take because we have domestic conditions, but we're also working in a global economy. And there's a lot of, you know, uncertainty and risks out there. And we have to think about those in the context of exactly what we do, but there's literally no doubt in my mind that we need to put more restrictive stance of policy in the economy to further get demand and supply and balance so that consumers don't have to worry about such high inflation month after month. So given that you think this is a bit of a lagging indicator and you do see some signs of cooling elsewhere in the economy, does this keep the fed basically on course for what's been set out for the next couple of meetings or what's your sense there? Well, let's go back to the summary of economic projections, lovingly called the SEP. And that, you know, often isn't, it is stale right after it's produced, but in this case, I think that's a really good guidepost from our last meeting about what the path of policy is likely to look like. And then it's all about how do you get there? What's the path? And, you know, the SEP, if you remember it, it came out in between four and a half and five percent rates as the best estimate of what rates would be at the end of next year. And it also said that we could get up, you know, into the into the fours, into restrictive territory by the end of this year. And I still think that's a reasonable, really reasonable way to think about it. And I'm quite certain that some judicial restriction is going to take place. And I do know that that's right for the economy. We are tightening into a strong economy. And so we need to bring it back down to something that looks a lot more sustainable in terms of the pace of growth. Okay. So then to be clear, 125 basis points higher on that, but, but, funds rate this year. And then looking at a peak of around four and a half to five percent next year, still seems to be the run of play in your mind. Is that correct? Well, what I would say, Jennifer, and I just want to be crystal clear. I know people would like us to write down the exact numbers for the rest of the period. But there's too much uncertainty for that to be prudent for us. We need to be data dependent.",https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GRIayi6dbGM,54,2022-10-14 17:50:13
3348," want to be crystal clear. I know people would like us to write down the exact numbers for the rest of the period, but there's too much uncertainty for that to be prudent for us. We need to be data dependent, extremely data dependent. So clearly the domestic data are pointing to further rate hikes. And I'm very supportive of continuing to put restrictions in place. I see the SCP is a good starting point guide post for people to say that's generally where the Federal Reserve will be heading. That's consistent with my own views. But I also want everyone to hear. I'm listening to recognize that we're not on a preset course. We are a data dependent fed. And if more is necessary, we'll take it if less is necessary. We'll adjust. But we're not talking about at this point in my mind, you know, pausing or stopping. Nor are we talking about, you know, changing our overall strategy because the data are coming in about like we would expect monetary policy acts with a lag. Inflation is a laggy indicator. It is a hardship that continues to print so high and I am very focused on that hardship. And I'm very mindful as my context tell me all the time that we want to make sure that price increases that inflation doesn't become embedded in psychology. And that's why you'll hear me say again and again, we are res live as an FOMC as a fed at restoring price stability. Even that you said monetary policy operates with a lag, you still think he would raise up to about 4 and a half 5% and then pause at that point in 2023. Well, I think that's exactly the question we have in mind and then why there's a big difference between what rate you get to and then holding it that you holding the economy in a restrictive stance of policy also continues to bridle it. So we'll end at a rate that we think is appropriate in in terms of where to stop and look around. But we still need to get the rates up before we ever do that and then we'll go to what I would think of as what I call oftentimes a raise and hold strategy where we raise it and then we let that sit for a while. But we are always even in that raise and hold piece adjusting to the economic conditions as they come in. We are not on some sort of course that can't correct if the economy needs more bridling or needs less bridling, but really that's how I think about it. Get you between 4 and a half and 5 is the most likely outcome and then raise to those levels and then hold at that point for some period of time. You said there is a narrow path to engineer a soft landing for this economy. There is a window for that. You think it is possible. That said this week we heard that the IMF downgraded its global outlook. It says the worst is yet to comment it warned about over tightening from global central banks and the possibility of precipitating an unnecessarily harsh global recession. At the same time we also heard from JP Morgan CEO Jamie Diamond who believes we could see a recession in the next nine months or sooner given the impact of inflation on the consumer. They also said in their earnings report that they're setting aside 800 million for loan loss reserve. My question is where do you pin the odds of a recession in the next six to 12 months. It is fascinating to me that we continue to be asked mostly by the media and others about recession. When I'm out in my context of nine western states that travel all over the United States, I'm not hearing signs of recession. I'm hearing signs that we would like to grow more but we can't find workers or consumers saying when is inflation going to go away. My life would be great if we didn't have such high inflation. People have plenty of jobs opportunities. We still have a strong labor market. We have good consumer spending even though it's flat. People are spending. People are doing things that they want. But inflation is the troubling thing. I also point to one more data point that you didn't mention yesterday. I believe the conference board came out with their CEO survey and those CEOs 98% expected some sort of a slowdown. But they all, you know, what I remember from the report that was really meaningful and it's consistent with what I hear when I talk to business contacts workers, community groups, is that people expect the slowdown to be there, but they expected to be short lived and not very deep. And that's a very different landing. That would I in my mind is the soft landing we're trying to achieve. We need to slow GDP.",https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GRIayi6dbGM,55,2022-10-14 17:54:34
3349," for lived and not very deep. And that's a very different landing. That would, in my mind, is the soft landing we're trying to achieve. We need to slow GDP growth substantially to get us back in demand supply balance. The labor market needs to cool further. We're adding over 200,000 jobs per month in the last report. And that's another 100,000 over what it takes to just keep things steady, to just absorb the new entrance that come into the labor market. So clearly we're running fast demand and sluggish supply. Those things have to come back into balance. The Fed's tool, while it's blunt, it does directly affect the strength of demand. And we're committed to bringing demand back in line with supply. You mentioned that business executives expected there is a recession. It would be a milder one. How deep of a recession is the Fed willing to tolerate as you try to quell inflation and bring it down? And frankly, as a recession, what's needed to really get inflation under control? You know, that's not how I think about my work. Actually, we have a dual mandate, full employment and price stability. My job, as I see it, is to treat those like they are. For most people, those things are related. They don't want only one or only the other. And so our job is to ensure that we can get a balance of both, get jobs. Everyone who wants a job can find one, even if it takes a little bit longer as the unemployment rate moves up. They're still going to find a job. And inflation comes back down to something closer to 2% in next year, something closer. And then gets to 2% in the course of the next two years. Those are critical things for us to achieve. And so I'm not thinking of it in terms of recession. I do think of it in terms of cooling the economies and the demand and supply come back into balance. And Americans can go to bed at night and get up in the morning, not worried about whether the prices they pay today are no longer going to be there tomorrow. And they're not going to be able to afford the basic things they need to have their lives and livelihoods. That's what I think. I do want to ask, I do want to ask you about one other economic scenario since inflation has proven pretty sticky. And if that does expect below trend growth this year and for the next couple of years, as your hiking rates to pool the demand side of the economy, what's the risk that a stagnationary environment could emerge and how would the committee approach that? Well, so again, I think of stagnation. That's a, it's frankly a big scary word. But look at the consumer sentiment that came out today. It's rose. And then the future expectation slowed, of course, for growth. But that's consistent with what the economy needs. I think of what we're doing now as bringing inflation down so that we can have a durable expansion. And we know that durable expansions are the ones that are best for the labor market, best for all the groups that we care a lot about. And that high inflation is a tax, a regressive tax. That's literally eating away at the lives and livelihoods of Americans least able to bear it. So when I think of that, I think of slower pace of growth, delivers lower inflation, puts us back in balance, gets us in the best position to grow once again at trend. And I don't have any data right now that suggests that that's not possible. President Daly, I want to thank you so much for your insight, so appreciate it, and hope to talk with you again soon. I look forward to it. Thank you so much. Thanks so much. That's Mary Daly, president of the San Francisco Federal Reserve Bank. We'll be right back.

3350," [""Singatures"". In哲 association with Welcome back to Yahoo Finance, everyone. The US retail spending came in flat in September, however, consumer sentiment coming in above estimates, even as Americans' expectations for inflation, they worsened. For more, on the state of the economy, we have Stephen Rashido, who is the Mizzouho America's Chief US Economist. Great to have you here with us this morning. First, just help us break down the market reaction that we've seen over these past two days to some of the economic data that really factors in everything from prices that consumers are paying to the sentiment from consumers right now. Well, I think when you're looking at the overall economy in this environment, you have to keep in mind, too, thanks. One thing is, if the economy is showing more resilience, then people had expected, given the pace of Fed rate hikes, that's number one. But we often forget that they've only been tightening since March of this year. So it's what, seven months into the process and the shortest possible lag between monetary policy and economic impacts of six months. That's the shortest possible lag. It's a long and durable lag, then need to be sometimes to the much longer lag. So the fact that we're continuing to see inflation remaining stubborn on the upside and we're continuing to see a more resilient underlying economy, always back into the fact that the labor market has not had any major significant change. And this is the critical issue. The labor market continues to be a critical piece of the equation to get inflation down and to slow the pace of underlying economic activity. And in an environment in which we're dealing with a real labor market shortage, it's really hard to do this. And therefore, there's going to be much more additional rate hikes coming down the pipeline from the Federal Reserve. Steve, I don't know if you were able to catch it, but we just had San Francisco Fed President Mary Daley on and she gave a range of potential rates where they would like to go potentially 4.5% to 5%. If we reached that 5% level, is the US economy still growing and by how much? Well, again, I actually have a higher terminal rate at this particular juncture than President Daley has. And that's not surprising. The SEP issue was quoting, did not take on board the latest inflation numbers or the latest retail sales numbers or for that matter, the latest weekly unemployment claims numbers. And the answer to your question is the economy could still be growing because we're going to be there by the end of this year and early next year. So it might not be into the real recessionary environment until we get into the second quarter.",https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GRIayi6dbGM,57,2022-10-14 18:03:21
3351," just we're going to be there by the end of this year in early next year. So it might not be into the real recessionary environment until we get into the second quarter of 2023, given the underlying resilience in the economy. So the answer is we're going to have to see higher rates than are currently discounted in the marketplace and higher rates than she's discussing in her commentary a few minutes ago. Steven, it's Julie here. We've had a lot of folks come on the show and say the Fed is not quite looking at the right indicators and that that means there is this big risk of overshooting. But it sounds like you think the Fed should be even more aggressive or will end up being more aggressive here. So what indicators are you watching right now is sort of giving us a good snapshot of what's going on? Look, and watch the weekly initial unemployment claims numbers. They are the best real-time measure that we're looking at in terms of labor market. And what we're seeing is, yes, people may be losing their jobs, but they're getting alternative jobs very quickly and not showing up either in the claims numbers or showing up in the continuing claims numbers. The labor market is the key here. And given the fact that we have a real labor shortage, this is the battle that the Federal Reserve is fighting against. And this is the battle that they have to win before they can get any declines of inflation that are going to be considered sustainable on an ongoing basis. And until we get there, we're not... Two of those things we're going to know it when we get there. We're not going to be able to forecast it ahead of time. So all this analysis that we're doing about what the terminal rate should be really... It has to be viewed against the live input of data coming in, which is why people at the Fed like President Daly are telling you, we're data dependent. And what we see so far is nothing has really changed that would change our view with regard to monetary policy. And I tend to agree with them as well. Steve, you said in your notes to us that the... By the dip strategy here is misguided. What is misguided about it? And is it still for those who are asking themselves, should I be buying this dip? Is the answer from your perspective still knowing? And the answer is yes, it's still knowing. And the reason for this markets don't really yet discount what's going to come. There are going to be corporate failures. There are going to be banks that have significant problems. There is going to be economic pain that comes about as a result of what the Fed is doing. But the Fed really has no alternative, which is the other thing. See, people seem to think the Fed has an alternative. There is no alternative to what they're doing. Allowing inflation to get embedded in the system is a long-term problem that is going to require even more pain down the road. So the Fed's prescription is take your medicine now, get it over with, and let's get it done with. And I think they're doing exactly what they're supposed to be doing. And I think people keep on wanting to look through to the other side of this story. The problem is this other side of this story could be further out in the calendar that investment horizons are set to. And that's the real reason why it's misguided. Stephen Rosciutto, a Mizzouho America's Chief US Economist, always good to get some time with you. Have a good weekend. You too. Have a great weekend. Home Depot, co-op down to Bernie Marcus, slams the body of administration in a chat. I had with him about his new book. We'll have that interview. Next. Martha picked up the opportunity of Kitas.

3352," tow), I'm Deepo Co. Founder Bernie Marcus. Had some choice words for the Bonnett administration and my exclusive chat with him on his new book called Kick Up, Some Dust. He also reflected a bit on starting home depot during a period of high inflation. If you don't read history, you don't know history. We're right back where we started and we opened up during the Jimmy Carter days and inflation was 20%, interest rates was 20% to some percent. And people were struggling. Manufacturers were struggling. We opened up in the middle of this. And fortunately because of the capital market, we had cash. So we had to pay our vendors ahead of time. We paid vendors the day they delivered the product, which is uncalled for. I mean, it just doesn't happen. But we want to keep them in business. And I can tell you, there are hundreds of manufacturers who are major manufacturers today that we kept in business those days by paying our bills quickly so they could have the cash to buy product to keep their people working. And it was not an easy time. But here we are all over again. We don't learn less. Inflation is killing us. People struggling. You know, a gallon of gas versus putting food on the table is not a place you want to be. But our customers now have that. It's unfortunate. We just don't learn. Just don't learn. Do you feel as though the economy doesn't feel like the same economy that it did back in 1979? Well, it's it was easier. It was easier now to fix it than it was then. He caught her didn't have the tools. You know, he had all these people kept captive in an Iran. He had, he opact really against him. And if you remember oil and gas rationing was pretty horrible. You had numbers so you couldn't get gas if you didn't have a certain number. Well, we have a president that just doesn't believe in that. We're sitting on tons of oil and gas and he doesn't allow us to drill. This is the rocket device. I Now have someone in your friends in your city.",https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GRIayi6dbGM,59,2022-10-14 18:12:41
3353," Now, we have a president that just doesn't believe in that. We're sitting on tons of oil and gas, and he doesn't allow us to drill. It's basically stupid. I can't come up with another word. It's stupid. And we will continue to suffer this inflation, and our people will continue to struggle with high prices. As long as he maintains this facade of climate control versus allowing us to do the things that we should be doing, I don't know. I have people live on a different planet, I think. I feel one day I wake up in the morning and say, where the hell are they coming from? I don't understand it. Why are they defending, not drilling, when in fact climate change? We could put it off over a period of time and do it over the next 30 years, 40 years, and do it intelligently, but not slam down on it and kill everybody today. So it's hurting everybody today, not good. I know you're a big free market guy, Bernie. I mean, that's how you created or helped create Home Depot. Do you mention capitalism a couple minutes ago? Do you think capitalism is under attack in this country? Oh, yes. It's under attack in universities. You have professors who are socialists, who are teaching you to the young people. And we had a poll at one point that was very frightening because it showed that almost 50% of the young people would vote for socialism over capitalism. They just don't know. They get to their hearts, they don't get to their brains. And unfortunately, we have a whole group of people growing up today with a thinking in terms that socialism is good for America, whereas in fact capitalism is what puts food on the table. It's allowed people to grow, allow people to develop economics in independence. And they don't get it. When they get it, it's like so many friends of mine say, their kids were socialists. I put till they got their first job and they took all that money out of their paycheck to pay taxes. And all of a sudden, they became capitalist. So that may be the story. Always an entertaining, entertaining child with Home Depot, Co-founder Bernie Marcus, again, author of the new book, Kick Up Some Dust. All right.

3354," I do know that they were testing this also in the UK and in Asia and it wasn't very successful. I think that one of the big problems there is that a lot of people that are purchasing things from creators like the authenticity factor of it. They like feeling like it's just a creator going about their regular life, making videos about the things that they enjoy. And so I think if you kind of take away that natural element of it, there might be a problem. So I know they had issues getting creators on board in those other markets. So it would be curious to see how that happens here. I mean I always set up a ring light in a camera when I'm doing my plant dead duties in the house. Of course it's authentic, right? I mean but this is a big deal because TikTok reportedly they went through a round of layoffs in July. What does this new kind of e-commerce push really tell us about the future of the company here? Yeah like you said they went they you know they started off with about 1500 employees here in the US in 2020, which is pretty strong. They've been going you know at a pretty great clip ever since then but then as of July they did you know pull back and say that they were going to halt a little bit of their hiring. But I think that's just kind of following suit with what other tech companies are doing at this point. You know they're looking at the economy and they're not really sure what's going to happen. But I do think that you know a lot of their revenue right now is coming from add dollars. And so I think that they're trying to find a way to diversify the way that they're making their money. And they see so many people like millions of dollars at being spent through these affiliate networks like style link and reward style. And they just they want to get a little piece of that. Right it's all about making this advertising kind of element really attractive for the marketers out there, especially knowing that they're looking for conversions. That's why all these platforms are trying to make it more shoppable. We'll see what that looks like within TikTok. Would you buy anything on TikTok? I think so. I have you buy anything on TikTok. Yeah, okay. Oh, all right. Well, I'm behind the curve here. Thanks so much for joining us here in studio. Yeah, we'll find it in Celsipar Barbario. Coming up everyone, Julie's got this week's winners and all losers on the other side of the brick. Yeah. Yeah. Yeah. Yeah. Yeah. Yeah. Yeah. Yeah.",https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GRIayi6dbGM,121,2022-10-14 18:25:57
3355," From red hot inflation data to volatile market swings, we've seen it all this week, and Julie's got some thoughts here. It's time for our winner and loser of the week. All right, so where should we begin, Julie? Let's start the winner. Let's start with positive, right? Because maybe because I have a little more to say about the loser of the week. The winner of the week, actually, if you look in the S&B 500, the best performer on the week is Moderna. And Moderna is down again today, and it's been down quite a bit this year, something like 47-48%, but it did have a positive week up about 12%. Because the big question surrounding Moderna has been what next? Now that it proved the viability of the mRNA platform, not just it, but of course the Pfizer Beyond tech vaccine for coronavirus as well, how then was that platform going to be used? And we got one sign of that. This week, when Moderna signed on with Merck, that the two are going to try to make an mRNA-based cancer vaccine. Now it's early stages, but this is one of the early sort of concrete signs of what we're going to then see from it. So that was one of the winners of the week after the stock has been a loser this year. Soz. And this was some losers, Julie. What do you got? Okay. I got one big loser for you, and that unfortunately for those in the UK is Quasit, Quarteng, who is the now resigned fire, depending on how you want to put it, a chancellor of the checker over there, who had been really closely allied with Liz Truss. And he came out with a letter today talking about his resignation. Of course, he was really the architect, along with Truss, of their big mini budget, which among other things was going to change the check structure that came out of fire for proposing a tax structure on high earners, for example, a reduced tax structure. He sent his letter today. The economic environment has changed rapidly since we set out the growth plan on 23rd September in response together with the Bank of England and excellent officials at the Treasury. We've responded to those events. And I commend my officials for their dedication, the economic environment changed because of this plan coming out. So it's just to come out with a statement like that. Yes, the conditions continue to deteriorate in the UK in terms of inflation going higher, just like it is here in the US. But it's a little disingenuous to say the economic environment has changed rapidly when you were one of the architects of that economic environment changing rapidly. In other words, seeing really a plunge in the British pound, for example, and a lot of pension funds in the UK becoming stressed, and then the Bank of England having to step in and help them with some easing to the system. So quasi-quartong, sorry for him, loser of the week. Loser of the week there. You mentioned depending upon who you asked, whether it's fired or resigned. If it's the BBC- Oh, it's a shit out. You can't put that out. Well, the bricks, they say, sacked according to the BBC. That's it. That's it. All right, everybody. Hope you have a great weekend. A key cove, Jeeta will continue our big bank discussion on the back of those earnings reports with speed capital management, bills, and don't forget on Monday are all market summit happening. Monday, the 17th, featuring interviews with CEOs from Target, General Motors, Microsoft. You don't want to miss that. It will be a full day of very big stuff. And have a great weekend.

3356," Welcome to Yahoo Finance Live. It is 11 a.m. here in New York City. I'm a Kiko Fujita. Here's what I'm watching at this hour. Big banks kicking off earnings season this morning with JP Morgan, Morgan Stanley Wells Fargo and city leading the way. We're going to break down the numbers with speed capital management, CIO, Bill Sneed in just a few minutes. Oil prices down as global recession fears and waiting demand outweigh concerns over supply. The global head of energy at KPMG joined us this hour to discuss the repercussions of the recent OPEC plus decision. And China braces for a historic party congress, President Xi Jinping, expected to secure an unprecedented third term, but concerns about a slowing economy could rain on his parade. But first let's do a quick check of the market action on this Friday. Another choppy session on our hands here after the historic turnaround rally that we saw yesterday. You see all three majors right now in the red, the Dow down 42 points, the S&P 500 down 29 and the Nasdaq down 129. Result season kicking off with some big banks announcing their Q3 numbers this morning. And that is the focus of our show JP Morgan was the headliner topping estimates thanks to higher rates. Those CEO Jamie Diamond once again pointed to hurdles and headwinds on the horizon. That's bringing Bill Sneed, Sneed Capital Management, CIO, Bill, this is kind of the super bowl for you, right? We've got all the big banks reporting today. It certainly feels like if you look at somebody like JP Morgan, we're kind of back to the discussion we had a few years ago. Last year we were talking about low loss reserves being pulled back. Now we're seeing an increase there because of the concerns on the horizon around the economy. Yeah, it's so interesting that after all the work that's been done, these banks have way more capital than they need even during a sharp recession. It's all set up that way. So you've taken the worst of the downside out of the risk associated with these companies because they have a wide mode that they have the deposits of the largest adult population group, the millennials because they have the best mobile banking apps. And now over the next 10 years, those millennials are going to be outstanding customers on the lending side. And if the world does get much tan we want to look back on the accepted share basic building order all that you will see outside. So we let them think too much about what we're looked at.",https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GRIayi6dbGM,123,2022-10-14 18:36:31
3357," population group, the millennials, because they have the best mobile banking apps. And now over the next 10 years, those millennials are going to be outstanding customers on the lending side, what they call the liability side in the business. And then the second picture you got from these reports is Wall Street is stinking and Main Street is doing well. I'll elaborate on that one for me. Well, trading and IPOs and all that kind of stuff is disappearing as a profit center. And at the same time, the average person in the United States is seeing their wages go up quite a bit. So it looks like the have-nots are going to win for a while. And that could be true of the next entire next decade, which is the way that the 1970s were where we had inflation, that have-nots were getting better bargaining position from a labor standpoint. And capital for the most part was treated very poorly unless it was invested in something that benefited from inflation. Yeah, I mean, let's talk about that bit more, Bill. I mean, JPM, one of those names that you do own. Obviously, we look to these bank earnings for any kind of color on where the economy is headed. And yet, there still does seem to be a bit of a disconnect between where sentiment is and where actual spending is. And we kind of heard that from JPMorgan today, when they said they haven't necessarily seen a significant pullback in consumer spending. Yeah, that's a great point and a great question. So about 80% of what goes on in the United States economy goes on regardless. Just go back and look at 07 to 09 and you'll realize that 80% of what goes on always goes on. It's that 20% of variable GDP that the recession hits, right? So if the economy contracts 4%, it means 20% of the 20% that's variable got hit. And so we feel the pain, right? Because people live a lot in that variable part of their life, not in the fixed part of their life. So that's where the concern is, but from an investor standpoint, a company is worth the net present value of the future income stream and the future cash flows. And 4% less for a year in a 20 year time continuum doesn't really change the net present value of a business very much. And that's where people make all their mistakes. They sell their stocks because of recession. Because they're going to get less 4% less affection from the economy. They don't do that with their spouse. They certainly don't do that with their spouse. Bill, you know, another sector we've been watching really closely is housing. And we got some color on that front from some of these bank earnings in terms of where mortgage rates are right now. Home lending originations, at least with Wells Fargo, down nearly 60% in year over year at JPM. That was down 71%. How much worse do you think things are going to get on that front? Well, they've lost all the stupid stuff. You know, the people buying four houses and flipping, you know, all that stuff is going away, all the fluff. And I think Stuart Miller, the head of Lenard, said at best two weeks ago on his earnings call, he says, we're going to manage our way through this difficulty the next 12 months so that we come out on the other side with dramatically larger market share. We own the largest home builders because over the next 10 years, there's 92 million millennials. They were seven years slower than other age groups getting started buying houses and they will buy houses the next 10 years. And that happened in the 70s with high inflation rates. We had the biggest home building boom of the last 60 years in the 1970s with sky high mortgage rates. So that sounds like you're not so cynical moving forward. I mean, you're not, you're not a cynical some others who've said that, you know, these higher rates are really going to accelerate some of the losses we've seen on that side. No, you're talking to a guy whose first mortgage was 13.5% in 1983 on a state buydown. We were anxious to get it because we had one child one on the way. That's why we like you, Bill. Some context there, right? Historical context. Important. Let's talk a bit strategy right now. You sort of alluded to some of these names that you think would be good buys right now. Obviously, you know, sort of the traditional thinking has been that with these big banks, especially they could benefit on the back of higher rates. There's the macro story sort of weighing on that as well.",https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GRIayi6dbGM,124,2022-10-14 18:39:40
3358," Obviously, you know, sort of the traditional thinking has been that with these big banks, especially, they could benefit on the back of higher rates. There's the macro story sort of weighing on that as well. Which one of these names do you think is best positioned to write out some of the choppiness we're likely to see over the next several months? Well, we have owned Bank American JP Morgan since 2012. And if you think people are skeptical of them now, you should go back and relive 2012, right? I mean, people didn't know whether they were going to survive. Remember we had the C-car meetings and the Fed would give them a hard time and wouldn't let them buy back their stock when it was cheap and wouldn't let them pay dividends and so forth. So this tribulation compared to that tribulation is peanuts for these folks. They're way overcapitalized. They're super strong. So we like Bank American JP Morgan. They are the largest deposit banks to millennials because they have the best mobile banking. And now they're going to get to have them as people that borrow money for necessity purposes. And by the way, that's a powerfully positive influence in the economy. And then we love American Express because they're the favorite credit card of the millennials who, despite the fact they're getting married in record numbers this year and going to have kids in X-5 years, will still drag those little kids all over the place on exotic travel with the travel points they get on our American Express card. And I hear you're chuckling. You're probably a customer. Just laughing at the context here. Well, we love to have you on the show. We really appreciate your time today. Bill Smith, Speed Capital Management, CIO. Thank you. Well, retail sales remaining unchanged in September or missing. Economist forecast of a 0.2% rise to help break down the report.

And so keep in mind that retail sales also, they are not adjusted for inflation. And remember that retail sales include many categories like groceries, a like vehicles, furniture, etc. But two interesting points from this report. First of all, excluding gasoline and autos, retail sales grew by 0.3%. And also what's interesting is the weakness in some of these categories that we've seen. So electronics fell, furniture fell, also auto sales. Those came in weak. So these are some big ticket items. And you could say that, for example, with electronics, well, a lot of people during the pandemic were buying electronics. And now they're using services more and going out more so they don't need more of that. A furniture, you know, that this housing market is slowing down. So you would see a slowdown in furniture sales as well. And auto sales, well, auto prices have gone up too much. And so perhaps this means the consumer is really pulling back. Another big story we're watching and not in the US across the pond here. UK Chancellor, quasi-quarting, ousted by Prime Minister Liz Trost just 38 days after taking that role. Obviously, this on the back of that initial proposal on the tax cuts, which, you know, I think by all accounts was quite disastrous in the rollout. But what can you more can you tell us about the market reaction that we've seen on the back of this? Yeah. So we did see the pound falling. We saw a bond yields being volatile. The 30-year guilt of 11 basis points, the 10-year guilt of six basis points. Prime Minister Trost is saying that the U-turn for this corporate tax cut basically that this is going to reassure the markets. Because we know what the markets did when these tax cuts were announced. And she said parts of the mini budget just went too far. This is to reassure those markets that were going wild. I think it's also to state the bond market as well. Yeah. Put one too far kind of putting it mildly when you look at the market reaction on the back of that. That's certainly a story we'll continue to watch. And that's thanks for that. Thank you. Well, deal making in the grocery space, leading to some big stock moves, shares of Kroger and Albertsons. Both moving to the downside here. After the second largest grocery agreed to buy Albertsons, the deal's valued at $24.6 billion with Kroger buying shares of Albertsons at a 16% premium to its closing price Thursday. The boards of both firms unanimously signed off on the deal. It still needs approval from regulators. And you see both of those stocks taking a hit today. Kroger down about 3.5% Albertsons down nearly 7%. Coming up, bearing the lead, oil supply concerns dominate after OPEC plus.",https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GRIayi6dbGM,125,2022-10-14 18:44:06
3359," A hit today, Krugger, down about 3.5% Alpertzens down nearly 7%. Coming up, bearing the lead, oil supply concerns dominate after OPEC plus cuts, but isn't it demand we should be watching a signs point to recessionary cliff edge to talk energy on the other side? squaredHyun from 7.0S Or the follow-up from the OPEC Plus decision to slash supplies it can be used to present a Biden has suggested a review of the relationship with Saudi Arabia, which is of course a long time Washington ally. The move by the oil producing group stands in direct conflict with Biden's goal of ensuring lower prices for US consumers. And this coming just weeks before the all important midterms here. The US says the Saudis presented no market basis for the cuts. Let's get to Regina May or KPMG's global head of clients and markets. Regina gets a talk to you today. Let's start on that comment that we got from President Biden saying there's no market basis. And yet you look at where oil is trading right now. We're right back below the levels we were at when that OPEC Plus cuts decision was first made. So I mean what does that suggest in terms of where the real fears are at the end of the day? Is it about a potential global recession? And a significant pull back into demand? Well I think the market reacted to the headline of the figure of two million barrel per day cut when the reality is that OPEC is producing three and a half million barrels per day lower than their stated production photos. So I saw it more as just a realization and acknowledgement of what's actually happening on the ground. The one thing that was important was the Saudis are starting to signal that they don't have their capacity. But I think we understand more of the supply side constraints because that's what we've been living with for the last few months and some of the peak pricing that we saw in the summer. Now the price is coming back down.",https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GRIayi6dbGM,126,2022-10-14 18:48:59
3360," But I think we understand more of the supply side constraints because that's what we've been living with for the last few months and some of the peak pricing that we saw in the summer. Now the price is coming back down to earth because I think, as you mentioned before the break, the demand side pressures are where there's a lot of uncertainty. China still not come back fully online. There's lots of concerns now about what COVID could do over the winter. We're worried about a recession. I think that's brought the price back down. We saw a nearly 20% jump in WTI just in the last two weeks and I think it's coming back down to a more realistic price projection. Specifically on the supply side, we had so many oil analysts come out on the back of that OPEC plus decision saying essentially look despite this announcement of 2 million barrels caught a day. At the end of the day, most of these OPEC members do not meet their quotas. What's the realistic number we should be looking at in terms of how much comes offline as a result of this decision? I think the real number that I was looking at is about 800,000 barrels per day because I just looked at what the reductions were from Saudi, Kuwait and the UAE. Those are parts of the world that do have spirk capacity. When I visit the region, you hear different things from the different executives. That was what the real cut was. The EIA is forecasting that the US is going to exceed 2019 production into 2023. I think the world is starting to get a little more comfortable that we have the supply that we need, especially if we face into a reduced demand environment. If we see a really severe winter and we don't see the recession that folks are expecting and we see demand continue to spike, then we're going to see a lot of upward pressure on price. Let's talk about where those prices could move. You pointed to some demand concerns there, especially coming out of China. We're all watching to see what kind of messaging comes from this party congress over in China from President Xi specifically on the economy. You said we're still talking about a tight supply here. When you say upward pressure, how much more upside do you see going into the winter? I'm worried a lot about a potential big spike in the winter. If we have a really, really cold winter, that's where I think we could see prices back close to 100, maybe even in triple digits. But I'm hedging against that. I really think the prices are closer to where they should be. I've said WTI and Brent should be in the 80s. That was what OPEC plus was trying to do is shore the price back up because they saw the market potentially overreacting to some of the demand concerns and not paying enough attention to the supply. So I think that's in part what drove their 2 million barrel per day headline cut, which is just making transparent to the rest of the world what was actually going on. And Regina, I know you can't speak to specifically the political environment in all of this, but it does feel like there are increasing lines being drawn geopolitically when you think about what happened between Saudi Arabia, Slash, Russia, OPEC and the US. And you've got the Western European countries in pushing their sanctions as well against Russia. I mean, at the end of all of this, wherever that end may be, how is the oil market going to look? I mean, how fragmented do you think things could get? I think I keep the same that has always surprised me is there's four fundamentals of how countries and markets need to manage energy. And that first and foremost is energy security. Second is affordability. Third is reliability. Fourth is sustainability. No doubt the climate agenda is huge and we are facing a climate crisis, but the world was focusing more on number four. There's almost like a Maslow's hierarchy of needs. If you don't have the energy that you need and it's not affordable and it's not reliable, then governments and policymakers need to get very heavily involved. And so that's how I would characterize what we're seeing today is the realization your previous gifts talked about the 70s. I'm a child of the 70s. I remember long gas lines during oil embargoes. We're relearning the lessons from decades ago. And hopefully we do a better time this time around. Yeah, a lot of people kind of drawing parallels looking back in time and history right now with so much going on at KPMG's global head of clients and markets, Regina mayor. Good to have you on today.",https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GRIayi6dbGM,127,2022-10-14 18:52:29
3361," I'll be looking back in time in history right now with so much going on. KPMG's global head of clients and markets, Regina Mayer. Good to have you on today. Well coming up the final frontier, Elon Musk, Warren, SpaceX can't help Ukraine indefinitely. So the question here, could the crucial Starling terminals be pulled? And if they stay, who pays? We'll get into that on the other side. Well, SpaceX is saying it can no longer pay for critical satellite services in Ukraine. And it's asking the Pentagon to pick up the tab. That's according to reporting at a CNN. Musk appears to have confirmed the report in a tweet, writing in part. Strange that nothing was leaked about our competitors and space launch and communications, Lockheed and Boeing, who get over $60 billion. Now the same CNN report, reference SpaceX figure shared with the Pentagon. Take a look at this. 85% of the 20,000 Starling terminals in Ukraine were paid for or partially paid for by countries like the U.S. Poland or other entities, who also paid for about 30% of the internet connectivity. Now SpaceX says that costs about $4,500 each month per unit for the most advanced service. Musk has said there are around 25,000 terminals in Ukraine to break it all down. Let's bring in Prague, it's supermanian. And the reason we're talking about this, some context here, is that earlier this year, Elon Musk sort of seemed to apply that we're doing this good thing, where we're going to be donating Starling that this was all being paid for by SpaceX. It's not necessarily the case in this story at a CNN really does point to the cost of operating it, who's funding the bill, and what this means ultimately for the future, because Ukraine has really come to rely on this for connectivity. And what I understand is...",https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GRIayi6dbGM,128,2022-10-14 18:56:40
3362," to the cost of operating it, who's funding the bill, and what this means ultimately for the future because Ukraine has really come to rely on this for connectivity. From what I understand, it's a huge part of their operations against Russia. They need this connectivity. When we first heard about Musk donating the Starlink service, we thought this was free. They were actually out of their pocket, sending them the actual terminals and then paying for the service. But it turns out, it looks at 85% is inputted by the US and actually pulling paying a lot for those terminals. So a little surprise there. Also the odd timing, it's like Musk also kind of noting the fact that after he put out that supposed controversial peace plan and then the Ukrainians were... Queen Russia and Ukraine, which seemed to suggest that he was more in line with the Russian thinking. Exactly, not so much the Ukrainian side and then Ukrainians were upset about that and then all of a sudden, oh, by the way, you get to pay for this. According to the CNN obtained report letter that they sent to the defense department. So, I guess at odd timing here, it's sort of a strange sort of... I really don't understand why Musk would even put out this sort of image that he's actually donating this stuff in actual actuality was not. And it's not a cheap service. Like, SpaceX is not a charitable organization. It is a company that's trying to be profitable and it's cost a lot of money. So I understand that part. But guess what, SpaceX worth 120 billion valuation. Musk worth around 200 billion personally. So I think it's hard for people to sort of round out the, hey, you need to get paid for the service when the actually you guys are actually worth. I've got a lot of money. Neil and Musk obviously never want to stay silent especially on Twitter when he's been getting a lot of pushbacks since that report came out from CNN last night. What have we even hearing from him today? Well, we saw it today. I mentioned that tweet from late last night about how, hey, the LEO connectivity is a very expensive business. It's not cheap. We are digging out of our own pockets to do this. So don't expect us to pay for this going forward. We're talking about 120 million through the end of the year. And then I think 300 to 400 million through next year. So it is not cheap. SpaceX is trying to get their model off the ground. So I totally understand that. So that's what he's saying right now. But I think you sort of caught in the cross here. Is it do you support Russia or Ukraine? And why are you actually kind of debating this right now? In the grand scheme of things, now that we kind of know that the numbers in terms of, you know, what the connectivity, the service itself is going to cost, how significant is Starlink to the future of SpaceX? Because this is something that, you know, it's been getting a lot of attention because this is a real use case in Ukraine. They have to your point really come to rely on this service. But in the grand scheme of things for SpaceX, how big is Starlink? I believe it's, it was supposed to be a big component of their profitability. It's a service that they can offer. Not only is it 4,500 for that high in terminal service, but also it's 50 bucks a month for families and other people to use that in places like India, for instance, like they want to deploy that there. It is a big part of their sort of mission to kind of not only just, you know, send elevators into space with rockets, but also to sort of connect everyone through the world through global satellite internet. So it is a big part of that story and a big part of that profitably component, but I guess right now it's still not fully profitable. Okay, something to watch there. According to Elon Musk. According to Elon Musk, always according to Elon Musk. Pros, thanks so much for that. We're continuing the never ending saga between Elon Musk and Twitter. Core documents and SEAL Thursday reveal that Elon Musk is under federal investigation for actions connected with this $44 billion Twitter acquisition. That's bringing Yahoo Finance is Alexis Keenan, Alexis, what, how many days ago were we talking about? How well, the deal's probably gonna get closed. And here we are talking about another investigation. What is this specifically a lullaby round? Okay, so it could be investigations plural because of the way that this filing is phrased. Now, why are we learning about this? It's because Twitter is asking for the judge in the Delaware case, the dispute over the acquisition that's currently stayed, the trial is stayed, not the case going forward.

You can see the Dow off just around 337 points Nasdaq moving to the downside off nearly two and a half percent S&P just below a 3600 off nearly 2% today in terms of some of the other broader movements that we're seeing Russell 2000 that small cap index off just over 2%. Let's take a look at the Philly semiconductor index. We know that has been under pressure and we're seeing that a lot of people are looking at the market action. We're seeing that a lot of people are looking at the market action. We're seeing that recently this semi is falling once again today with that index off just over 3%. 10 year yield moving to the upside back above a 4% you could see the 30 year up another 5 basis points.

All right, getting you up to speed now on the shake up in the UK. The British pound falling again as Prime Minister Liz Truss replaces her finance Minister Quasi Quaritan with former health and foreign secretary Jeremy Hunt. Truss today also revered the US today also reversing course on another of those proposed cuts on corporations and insisting she will stay on as Prime Minister. The Bank of England has also wrapped up its bond buying program that was in response to settle markets after all the upheaval. Of course, you'll recall the tumultuous three weeks for markets, pensions and the Bank of England itself after Quasi unveiled his mini budget. And that included a raft of unfunded tax cuts that were highly criticised. What a rollercoaster ride it's been in the UK. Alright, let's get you up to speed now on a major acquisition. The second largest grocer for even shopping for even greater markets share. Croger agreed to buy Albertsons at 3410 a share.

3364," Grocer for even shopping for even greater market share. Croger are green to buy Albertsons at 3410 a share. Deal worth 24.6 billion dollars. This merges the second and fourth biggest super market chains. Together now they employ more than 700,000 employees and more than 5,000 stores. Little context though, Walmart still has more than twice the number of US stores and employees. How are the stocks reacting? Croger shares down more than 5% Albertsons and buy the rumor sell the news reaction was way up yesterday. Down with some percent today. Both companies boards though. You dynamically approve this agreement, which will have some regulatory hurdles ahead. But again, let's take into context how much bigger Walmart is by comparison if that matters. And now for more on the markets we turn to Invesco. Global market strategist Brian levitt to break down a wild week in the markets. Brian, yesterday we get the bad inflation print. Market skyrocket today. They fall through the floor. What do you make of the last couple of days when you take it all in context? Yesterday was a bit surprising. I mean, you get a consumer price index report that's worse than expected. You would expect the usual risk off trade to move after that. And then it didn't happen. I mean, it happened briefly. Today makes more sense where you've got rates going up again. So we're pushing up short rates and equities coming under pressure. And in my opinion, that's the trade until we get the proverbial pause from the Fed. I think the market will start to sniff it out before the Fed even announces that pause. But CPI report this week suggested it's still. We're still waiting for it. And so I think today's market action makes more sense than what we saw yesterday. Hey, Brian, what do you think needs to happen in order for the Fed to pause? Well, the good news is we've got inflation expectations that are anchored. So that's good, long term. But you're going to need to see a headline CPI come down pretty consistently. And so it'll start to happen as the year progresses. I mean, yesterday's CPI report wasn't great. So if the market goes up 0.4 for the month, consumer price index. If you can 0.3 every month between now and next year, you're at 3.1% year over year. So that's the moderation. That's what the Fed's looking for. And as it happens, as the reports come in better than expectations, that's when the market is going to start to price in that recovery trade, it'll commence even before the Fed admits that they're going to pause. Hey, Brian, just in terms of that hot inflation that we did get yesterday. I think it did catch some at least on the street by surprise. Anything in that report change your view of the markets over the next month or two. Not really. I mean, we all been hopeful that inflation had been hit. It's had peaked and that's probably right. But it's, you know, it's coming down not as quickly as we would have hoped. It's pretty clear that the goods inflation story is behind us. We see the declining commodity prices. It's the thickness and shelters and rents and the bit wages. And so we know that that's going to be a little bit sickier that takes, you know, higher rates takes time to work through the residential market, but will ultimately do so. You know, so the challenge here is the feds data dependent. I wish they were using more forward looking models, because that is going to take some time. But I think it's pretty clear from all of us to all of us where it's ultimately going. So the messages in your term caution on markets were still in a contraction, were still tightening. But inflation is going to come down. And usually when inflation comes down, markets do very well. And Brian, you mentioned looking ahead, obviously, this is a midterm election. Yeah, I know you've been following some of the historical context between midterms and markets, especially with this last CPI print before the midterms. What is history telling us about what we can expect? Well, what you usually find is your two of a presidential cycle is the worst with regards to returns in year three. It ends up being significantly better. Now you could just say that that's a coincidence. But if you want to set a narrative around it or reason it, it would be that it's just one less uncertainty to weigh on the market. The most likely.",https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GRIayi6dbGM,131,2022-10-14 19:11:23
3365," You just say that that's a coincidence, but if you want to set a narrative around it or reason it, it would be that it's just one less uncertainty to weigh on the market. The most likely outcome here is a divided government. Now, it's above my pay grade to tell you which way the House or the Senate are going to go, but I can watch the polls. And it suggests a divided government, which suggests not a lot gets done. And so when you're fighting inflation, you saw this in the UK. I mean, in the UK's fighting inflation, and you get a budget deal that the market views as inflationary becomes problematic. Armit terms are going to likely lead to not all getting done. So not a lot of fiscal support, which I think the market will embrace. The biggest point I like to make to investors is that markets have gone up under all combinations of government. The economy has largely performed the same, whether it's single-party world Democrats, single-party world Republicans, divided government, politics elections don't matter nearly as much for markets as I think investors believe. Brian, you said you wish the Fed used more of a leading indicator rather than the lagging that they do generally look at. What would give, I think Kathy would, by the way, jumped up and said you got that right. But what are those indicators that you wish the Fed would look at that give them a better picture of the inflation story? Well, you've seen financial conditions tighten. We've seen the dollar strengthen pretty significantly. The yield curve is already inverted. So all of those are suggesting a pretty bad economic outcome, or at least a recession. The other thing is inflation expectations. So typically, when you're in a contraction, you start to ease economic policy. You're in a contraction and we're still tightening because we're afraid that inflation is becoming unhinged, but long-term inflation expectations are somewhere between two and a half and three percent. This is not 1974 where long-term inflation expectations were 10 percent. It's a very, very different environment. It's a unique, pandemic cycle. If I'm the Fed and I've got the bond market, 1, 3, 5, 10 inflation expectations telling me inflation's not a problem, it's going to come down rapidly. Why am I tightening so meaningfully into a contraction? This is the risk of an accident. Tighten a lot. What's the what it means for the economy before we keep doing more, but it doesn't matter what I think it's the Fed's going to do what they're going to do and we know rates are gone higher from here. So Brian, in terms of what you're seeing with the markets, what is it signaling about their expectations for recession? For those who don't believe we're already in one, what the expectations are for next year? Yeah, there's a likelihood that we'll have a recession. The major things point into a strong dollar inverted deal curve. We all get that. The question is, what does that mean for investors? We've already gone down 26, 27 percent peak to drop in the S&P 500. The average in recession times is 31, 32 percent. So we've maybe done a good amount of it, but most of the market downturn has largely been evaluation adjustment due to higher rates. The question is, what type of earnings hit you get in a recession? If you figure somewhere between 10 and 15 percent, that could take you to earnings somewhere around 180, 190. If you're willing to pay a 20 multiple on that, then markets are fair value. If in that recession, inflation stays too elevated, valuations are going to come down and we may need to see somewhat lower levels from here. For the most part, the market does a pretty good job of pricing these things in beforehand. Recession seems to be in the cards, but for longer term investors, if you focus on an peak in inflation and how that comes down over time and what that means for markets, usually a buying opportunity, even if there's near-term drawdowns and volatility to have to contend with. All right. So some vital opportunities to be had there on the cons. Invest go global markets, strategies, bright and levied. Thanks so much for joining us this afternoon. All right.

Here to discuss what this means for the economy and Fed policy moving forward, we want to bring in Austin Kool-Zi. We have Chicago professor and former chairman of President Obama's Council of Economic Advisors. Mr. Kool-Zi, it's great to see you. Certainly a lot of news happening this week. We got that hotter than expected inflation print 8.2 percent retail sales out this morning. They were flat in September. Just give us your sense of the economy given that new data that we've been getting over the last couple of weeks. Yeah, thanks for having me back. I mean, I think we're in this transition period and it's a transition on multiple dimensions. One, consumers are shifting back to spending on services from spending on physical goods. Two, inflation continues to be hot. You saw core inflation coming in higher than expected, higher than the Fed wanted. And in an environment like that where the real wage is going down, salaries are not rising as fast as prices. You're going to see some slowdown on the consumer spending front. And I wouldn't be surprised if where you really start to the rubber hit the road, see it on consumer spending on durables, automobiles, and housing, the most interest rate sensitive parts. That's a good issue.",https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GRIayi6dbGM,133,2022-10-14 19:18:17
3367," that the rubber hit the road, see it on consumers spending on durable, automobiles and housing, the most interest rate sensitive parts. Austin, good to see you. What do you think the likelihood of a recession is? And do you think the Fed will at some point call it a win if they get an inflation number around 3% rather than the ideal target of two? I say recessions absolutely a real possibility. As you know, the main cause of recessions, post-World War II, has been the Fed raising interest rates faster than the economy can handle. What we have to hope and for sure what the Fed is looking for are improvements on the supply side, that all the negative supply shocks that in my opinion drove a lot of the inflation in the US and around the world, that as we get out of the COVID times and maybe if the war doesn't deteriorate in Ukraine, we could start to get some positives on that side. That's how you would avoid recession and have a soft landing. But if not, I think that's absolutely on the table. And I don't think the Fed will, you would, from the public announcements, you don't see much wiggle room in the Fed saying, oh, well, if we get one month of beneficial reports, then we'll declare that our job is over here. I think they will need to see sustained slowing of inflation before they're going to think that it's time to pause. Also, what do you think of the Fed's job so far, just in terms of how much progress they have made up until this point? You know, the Fed's gets criticized from all dimensions and all sides. This has been an extremely difficult period for the Fed to navigate what to do. Not just because you have to figure out is the inflation coming from supply shocks, which raising interest rates doesn't fix or from excess stimulus and excess demand, which interest rates could, you also have this whole added bit that our recession was, look, nothing like a previous recession, the one in COVID, because it was concentrated in services. And this issue of pent up demand for services makes the normal Fed job of we apply the break to counteract how fast the economy's growing. It makes that based on no historical record. There's never been any business cycle that looked like this. So it's very hard to weigh off how many, is everybody going to go to Disneyland for two weeks this year and go out to restaurants every night of the week because they've been locked up in their houses for a year and a half? If so, then the economy might overheat on consumer spending grounds, but that's never happened before. So we really, the Fed doesn't know exactly what to do. When you see two different companies in two different sectors, I'm talking Pepsi here, who said we dramatically increase prices, we saw no demand destruction, Delta Airlines, same thing with airfare is up 43% year over year, no waning demand, record demand. What does it tell you the Fed is going to need to do in order to bring, get cost control as they call it? Well, this is back to the fundamental religious divide of, do you think the inflation and the price increases are coming from supply shocks and cost problems? Or do you think it's coming from excess demand? If you think it's mostly from excess demand, then what the Fed is going to need to do is keep raising rates to try to tamp down demand. But do you think it's supply? If you think that a lot of it's coming from supply, and the fact that you've got inflation rates of 10% in Germany, 9% in the UK, and high inflation all around the world, and there's not a single country on the planet that's below the 2% inflation target, those make you think, whoa, will the Fed be able to do anything other than generate a stagnation? So I think this is really the nugget of where we are and what we're trying to deal with. Awesome. Where does this leave jobs and all this? Because we know the Fed has said that we need to see job losses in order to get inflation under control. That, of course, has been up for debate. Where do you stand on that?",https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GRIayi6dbGM,134,2022-10-14 19:22:45
3368," Awesome. Where does this leave jobs and all this? Because we know the Fed has said that we need to see job losses in order to get inflation under control. That, of course, has been up for debate. Where do you stand on that? Well, be careful. The Fed said that they need to see a cooling of the job market. But I think what the Fed is hoping is that they could reduce the number of vacancies without driving up the unemployment rate or putting people out of work. And for a couple of months, at least, they have been able to do that. The job market remains remarkably strong. And if the unemployment rate went from three and a half to four and a half, four and a half unemployment rate is still a very low unemployment rate. There are periods not that long ago where people would be saying four and a half is full employment. So I'm hopeful that the Fed can navigate this with a little good fortune on the supply shark front that they could navigate it without having a dramatic increase in unemployment. If not, if we don't get improvements on the supply side, then we're in the kind of the old fashioned environment where there's just a direct tradeoff. And if you want to get inflation to come down, you've got to administer pain. I'm sure you're always looking at the labor force participation rate, which we can stubbornly be low where it was pre-pandemic. And maybe a million of those people retired and are gone for good. How can the Fed get that labor force participation rate back to where it was? Maybe the million, million and a half back to work? Well, again, be careful. You've seen a dramatic increase from the trough upward in labor force participation. It's trending down to over a 10, 15 year period, partly because you got the baby boom retiring, partly from demographics. And then you've got the two that you got the double whammy of long COVID and people taking care of people with COVID. That's half a million to one and a half million out of the labor force. And then you've had a massive drop in legal immigration into the country. Those two things are longer term, unfortunately, than what we wanted them to be. Hopefully we can get past the long COVID part. But without returning the flow of immigration, I think we're still going to be dealing with this labor shortage type issue for some years to come. Rough road ahead. Austin Gooseby, always great to have you here, sir. Appreciate your time. Great to see you again. All right, coming up, Tesla shares are sliding as we head into the close.

3369," Triple play, the three stocks that we're watching in the final 30 minutes of trading. We've got plug, eutannics and Tesla. So plug, my pick plug power, tick a PLUG at the stock in the hydrogen and fuel cell maker under pressure today. As you can see, they're down about 5.5%. Now that's after warning, full year 2022 revenue would be 5% to 10% lower than the expected 900 million to 925 million that they laid out in their August call with investors. That's now dropping to between 821 and 867 million. Now this is because of timing and broader supply chain problems. And this also means that completion of some of its larger projects is also being delayed from 2022 to 2023. Now the company did say demand for the fuel cell applications and electricalizer business does remain robust. They also expect an accelerated path to profitability and positive cash flows. The stock has had some wild swings though a year to date. It's down more than 30%, but big banks are still bullish on the long term future of hydrogen. We saw Goldman Sachs predicting that hydrogen generation will eventually become a $1 trillion per year market. City Group also bullish on hydrogen fuel cells. And that's despite some of these full starts for the industry. But they see more impetus from policymakers, especially as we consider the energy crisis in Europe really putting some of these alternatives into the forefront. Yeah, Michelle. I think we can sum up what's happening with this stock today, similar to what we've seen from other companies who have guided lower, didn't meet Wall Street expectations or simply is not any room for that in terms of the market today. We're seeing that reflected in the stock price day, which shares off just around 5.5%. Ahead of today's drop, the stock had actually been doing relatively okay for the past three months. It was up 8% over the past three months through yesterday's closing price. That of course, better than the S&P's, a 3% slip during that same time. So obviously a huge headwind here for club power at least in the immediate term as a company does work out some of those supply issues that you were just talking about. All right, my play today is Nutanix. Now the cloud computing company shares a surging. I'm reports that it's exploring a possible sale after getting some takeover interest now. Nutanix is expected to target a private equity and industry players. This is all according to report from the Wall Street Journal. But this deal is far from done. We know Nutanix's market value is currently just around 5 billion. The potential buyer would likely have to pay a very attractive premium. Dave, you're looking at shares surging here. So we could get some M&A news maybe pretty soon when it comes to this player. We don't get much though in this environment. In fact, Q3 saw the worst quarter in the prior five years. It just over $500 billion of M&A activity. And there was only one quarter that was even close to that. That was Q2 2020. What happened then? Of course, the pandemic just stopped the economy and it's track. So not a real good environment for such activity. We shall see. My play is Tesla shares of Elon, ZVMaker slumping to end this week. Though it's our Goldman Sachs reiterate.",https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GRIayi6dbGM,136,2022-10-14 19:31:56
3370," We shall see. My play is Tesla shares of Elon's EV maker slumping to end this week. A week though, that saw Goldman Sachs reiterate a buy rating with a $305 price target, implying 45 percent upside. We can which ARK Invest Kathy would told Yahoo Finance Tesla is a quote solution to the economy's problem. The bad news, well, it's probably the man more than the company. A Twitter filing saying, a court filing Thursday that Elon Musk is being invested by federal authorities over his conduct in the $44 billion takeover deal for the social media giant. And I'm searching for more bad news. I figured that couldn't be enough to justify 7 percent down. Analyst at Wells Fargo have lowered their price target from 280 to 230 citing waning demand for the EV. So that probably has a bigger factor on this 7 percent drop. Down 47 percent. It's been a rough year to date. That appears to be what is pushing a tough day for Tesla, Richelle. And we are seeing some other EVs falling as well. We heard from Morgan Stanley there concern that what they what they might hear from China at the Communist Party meeting might mean some of this trade rhetoric might make it a bit more difficult for the EV space. And China obviously the biggest auto market in the world. It's not really what you want to hear. If you're an EV maker and trying to either get your things manufactured there or sold there as well. Yeah. Yeah. One of the worst performers in the Nasdaq 100 today. Well, coming up next as a Biden administration, it was a chip crackdown on China.

3371," Chinese President Xi Jinping on the cusp of what some are calling his imperial moment. In a break from their prior two-term limit, Xi about to be given a third five-year term as Communist Party leader at the end of the major party Congress that opens Sunday. What does that mean for China? I want, and of course, for U.S.-China relations, Max Balkus, the former U.S. ambassador to China and was a Montana senator for more than 35 years. Mr. Ambassador, great to see you. Appreciate you coming on. Let's start with the latter. Headline of the Wall Street Journal reads, a China prepared for conflict with the United States. What does Xi's extended rule mean for the U.S.? I think he's going to consolidate power. We'll see that after the 20th Party Congress. Xi is very proud. He tends to be more of a Maoist than following a Deng Xiaoping who opened up China. He's very proud of China's tradition and, of course, China's rightful place in history, after all, China began thousands of years ago. He wants China to be a co-equal global power with the United States. I don't think he wants to control the United States. He wants to be a co-equal power. He wants to be respected. I think that's just been goal. So Ambassador, as we look at what's on the agenda for this conference, obviously, you have the zero-covid policy. A lot of people wondering if that's going to get lifted. And also what this is going to mean for economic growth and the strategy in China. Where are expectations for what we're going to hear? I don't think we'll see much change in zero-covid. It's hard for Xi Jinping to change. Xi's going to want to save face. It's a policy that's right thing to do, frankly, they're much bigger country than we population four times ours. Vaccines not nearly as good as ours. He doesn't have a lot of choice. Zero-covid is a, you know, the pursuit. But it's a big problem for the economy, clearly. It's disrupted supply change. It's caused the economy to suffer significantly, but he's not going to change it for a while, anyway. We're going to try to probably spend a little bit more money, showing up the basic industries in the country, instruct banks to loan a little bit more. He sees this as a major confrontation with the United States. That is when he looks at actions we take the United States, the Chip Reduction Act, and more recently, the restrictions on export controls, they're serious. They're very serious. And, frankly, if you look at the rhetoric both sides, they're pretty much similar. Each wants to compete the other, whatever competition means. We're really evolving into a Cold War, despite words to the country by the United States and China.<|zh|><|translate|><|zh|><|translate|><|zh|><|translate|><|zh|><|translate|> In fact, if you look at the rhetoric both sides, they're pretty much similar.

3372," the local economy, but exports, they're doing pretty well, but they know that they're going to prosper long when they have to focus much more on the domestic economy. They'll do what they can, in addition, they're going to really double down on chip production. I can't overefacise the importance of the recent Biden-Notspin on export controls. That's a big shot across China's, you know, Huawei's bad enough. This is much worse in their view. So the economy will suffer, but they're sure going to look and don't forget China thinks in the longer term. And I was serving in China over and over again. I was impressed with how much they think in the long term and also how proud they are and how working they are. I don't overstate it, but they are very proud working people. And we Americans, frankly, don't know enough about China. We don't spend much time over there. We don't know China. And probably that's due to quarantine restrictions that we can't go over. But if more Americans were able to spend more time in China, I think we have a little more realistic view of what's happening. Interesting. What do you think she's extended rule third term means for the likelihood of a confrontation with Taiwan? And how do you believe the United States would respond? Well, those are two different questions. Taiwan is the redest of red lines for China. It's existential. It's non-negotiable. It was once part of China. The Japanese took it over. Shanghai Shack took the nationalist over to Taiwan. It's part of China and their view. There's no question about it. They point out to our one China policy. Say, hey, you Americans, you'd agree there's one China policy. And I think she, Jim Bing, is to try to play the long game. It'd be a slimy slicing. That's very Chinese. And I was really sure learned that a little still a bit here. Step at a time. Maybe a little bit across the Taiwan straits, a little bit here. They're slowly, slowly, slowly. They wake up one day. It's like the frog in the pot of water. It's just all in macro. They're really in charge. Just like they did in the South China Sea, dumping sand on submerged reefs and pretty soon we get islands. They're slowly, slowly, slowly. That's their M.O. They needn't be able to afford to do that, but that's their M.O. They really feel, they don't believe the United States words. When the United States says, we support a one China policy. That's just words. You don't mean that. They look at Biden statements. Biden's four times. It said something that's much stronger than that. And US politicians, in the passage of the Taiwan policy act, really push more and more against that tripwire, which means that China is going to cite enough so enough. We're playing a very dangerous game in Taiwan, in my view. We should continue our policy of strategic ambiguity, but don't support Taiwan too much. We're going to get to the point where it's going to cause a huge problem with China. China is certainly playing a long game. It's got a hundred-year plan. It's certainly a very different game they're playing indeed. A big thank you to former United States ambassador to China Max Balcos. Thank you so much for joining us. Welcome.

3373,". this is the city's city. The quarter bank earnings are under way. JPMorgan city Wells Fargo all beating the streets expectations. Shares moving higher here. As you can see, Morgan Stanley on their other hand is the city's city. The city's city and Kenley on his CFRA research director of research. Ken is great to see you. Taking a look at these results JPMorgan revenue of 10% here. Morgan Stanley missing expectations. Profit of nearly 30% city profit dropping. 25% although better than what the street was looking for. It seems like Wall Street was looking for a lot of things that the US economy is resilient. The consumer is healthy. Business loans are going on. Of course, investment banking activity has really no-stied from last year. The stocks were a lot this morning, but they have really faded this afternoon because the real issue is that they have a lot of things that they have to back performance. Some further weakening of the consumer. It hasn't happened yet in terms of delinquencies or bad loans. But the banks are adding some reserves. Again, today's results is a good picture of what happened from July to September. The banks are going to be going down to 50 basis points and then 25. So, rates do matter. It will create some demand destruction. Unfortunately. So, Ken, within the banking industry, what do you credit JPMorgan doing so much better than some of these other banks? Well, Wall Street also did well. And the real thing is that when you have rising rates, it drives higher net interest income, widening spreads, you can just sit and sit and sit.",https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GRIayi6dbGM,141,2022-10-14 19:54:14
3374," The real edge of the beauty of banks is that when you have rising rates, it drives higher net interest income, widen spreads, you can just sit back and so long as there's a loan activity, you're going to show higher net revenue. Unfortunately, that probably will not be the picture in 2023 because loan activity is going to subside for both consumer and commercial and industrial loans. So that really is what was expected. We did get that fourth quarter probably will be a decent quarter, but again, every time you raise rates, it's really squeezing the U.S. economy more than before, and that's what the Fed has to do to get inflation under control. Can one thing that you mentioned in your note that stuck out to me was JP Morgan's head count, and actually went up 9%. We haven't really seen the reduction in head counts at the bank yet. As you talk about this uncertainty over the next several months, potentially a potential downturn here, what do you think that head count will likely look like? Do you think we're going to start seeing some reduction? Well, it's a great issue, and JP Morgan, 9% increase in global head count. A lot of that is investing in technology, software, taking on the disruptors of Fintech, maybe something from blockchain. But again, you get these senior management around the table in November. There's probably going to be some tactical cutbacks in investment banking, because the book's not going to be there in the fourth quarter, and the pipeline, even if you say it's there, it's not likely that we're going to see some V-shaped rebound in the first quarter of next year. I've been covering the capital markets for a long time, and this unfortunately is going to be a stretch, where it's just going to be tough. And Ken, as we're looking at shares of Morgan Stanley under pressure today, you still have a buy opinion on it, and you have a price target of $90. What is the base case there? Yeah, the base case. So we downgraded Goldman Sachs a month ago from strong by the whole. We kept Morgan Stanley as a buy, and our view was it was trading at a discount to names like BlackRock and Schwab. They're the leading and wealth management that got a high recurring revenue from wealth, but they still have an investment banking business. So it's not our best buy rating, but we're going to state the course. They also have the most dry powder for buybacks, and they had the most room from the Fed stress test last June. So I like what James Gorman and Morgan Stanley are doing, but I'm fighting uphill because the investment banking equity debt underwriting is not likely to be much better in the fourth quarter. MNA probably will take up a debt. Well, so let me be keeping in mind that thank you for joining us with your insights. Ken, Leon, CFI research director of research. Have a good weekend. Michelle, let's take a look at the strong dollar. You've heard it mentioned numerous times. It's a head one for the economy. It's a big challenge facing corporate America. And here is why the strong greenback, while it gives Americans more purchasing power overseas, it also means that US exports are more expensive for foreign citizens. Now the company's most at risk are those dependent on international sales that can take a chunk out of their bottom lines. Money made overseas when it was when it's translated back into dollars, lessons of value given at the current exchange rates. Now it gives foreign competitors an edge here making it more difficult for US companies to remain competitive with those local alternatives. Now Microsoft and Nike, IBM, Deer, AdV, Netflix, just some of the companies to recently warn of the risks that the strong dollar poses to their business. And we know that it's going to be a very common theme on earnings calls this quarter. Since roughly get this 40% of S&P company sales are actually generated abroad. Now to put this in perspective, let's take a look at the dollars jump. Here we were at the beginning of the year below 90. You can see the jump up of nearly 17 and a half percent. Now we're trading right above 113 just off the highest level that we were at in about 20 years. Now in the past year, let's take a look at the dollar versus the euro. And as we pull up this chart on a one year basis, you can see a 19% jump in terms of the strength of the dollar.",https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GRIayi6dbGM,141,2022-10-14 19:54:51
3375," Last year, let's take a look at the dollar versus the Euro. And as we pull up this chart on a one-year basis, you can see a 19% jump in terms of the strength that did the dollar versus the Euro. And taking a look at the British pound, you can see it up just around 22%. The dollars gained in the third quarter was actually the biggest quarterly jump that we've seen since 2016. Bank of America expects the dollar strength to shade 5% to 6% off earnings for S&P companies. In the third quarter, technology and materials, those are the two sectors that they say are most at risk. All right, well, coming up, a hearing and disgrace to get their nose at founder, Elizabeth Holmes, big to get a new trial is about to begin. We've got those details for you next. zur temporale Welcome back to Yahoo Finance Live. Now be sure to tune in to Yahoo Finance's All Market Summit on Monday, starting at 9 a.m. Eastern. Power out CEO Bob Bakish and Film and TV producer Jerry Brockheimer, that just two of the many industry leaders who you'll be hearing from. You won't want to miss it. Just a few minutes, hearing is scheduled to begin. The ongoing legal saga surrounding Theronos founder Elizabeth Holmes. Yahoo Finance is Alexis Keenan here. This is hearing is part of Holmes bid for a new trial. What's ahead? Okay. So today is a hearing that got moved up. It's at 4 p.m. It's just about to start. And it's a set of the document requests that Holmes has made against Adam Rosendor for as a former laboratory director for Theronos and testified for the prosecution at her trial. She wants some documents because she's got another hearing coming up on Monday that's a big deal and that's her motion for a new trial. She wants to toss out that old conviction for counts of criminal fraud. She's facing 20 plus years in prison on each of the counts that she was convicted on.",https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GRIayi6dbGM,142,2022-10-14 19:58:15
3376," Well, and that's her motion for a new trial. She wants to toss out that old conviction for counts of criminal fraud. She's facing 20 plus years in prison on each of the counts that she was convicted on. So what she wants to do on Monday has everything to do with what's going to happen in a little bit here today. But big deal is Monday. She wants a new trial and she wants the judge to say, we're going to have a redo. And that basis that she's making for that redo, she says that Rose Endorf visited her partner, Billy Evans, unannounced after the trial and sort of wanted to apologize for his testimony. And according to Evans, according to Holmes, partner, that Rose Endorf said that the government made his testimony about conditions at Therno sound worse than they actually were. So what we're going to hear is there's judges going to ask, did you testify truthfully at him, Rose Endorf, or did you not? But look, he's facing perjury if he goes ahead and says, I testified untruthfully. Right. So you're leaning in which direction here? So this is a really big bar to reach for any criminal defendant who's already been convicted to get a new trial is a tough road. So it's not looking like chances are so good for Holmes. But look, we have to listen to what the evidence brings. We have to see if he somehow comes in and recants any of his testimony in any little sliver. I didn't want to put my finger on the scale, it had a feeling that's where he really was. Yeah, your feeling was right. Alexis Keenan, good to see you. Thank you. All right, coming up, we're just counting down to the closing bell on Wall Street. Stick with us here on Yahoo Finance Log. Here's a wedding showcase. We're just a few minutes away from the closing bell for the week for that. Let's bring in Yahoo! Finances and there's for it to break down the market action. Hey Anis. Hey Richel, and it looks like we're going to close near the lows of the session. This was a big week. We had the CPI print earlier this week. We had retail sales today, also bank earnings. The down right now down 1.3% the NASDAQ down more than 3% the biggest loser out of the major averages. And the S&P 500 down 2.4% for the last five days the S&P is going to end in negative territory. The NASDAQ also ending in negative territory. Looking at the sector's consumer discretionary is the biggest laggard today. It's also the biggest laggard for the week as I...",https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GRIayi6dbGM,143,2022-10-14 20:01:57
3377," Hasdak also ending in negative territory. Looking at the sector's consumer discretionary is the biggest laggard today. It's also the biggest laggard for the week as I pull up the five-day chart here followed by technology. And inside consumer discretionary is Amazon in Tesla. Take a look today at the charts for today. Amazon down 5%, Tesla down more than 7% set to close. About 50% below its November closing high. We've also got Apple that's down more than 3%. A lot of red is what we're seeing on the screen on the NASDAQ 100. And over on the Dow, we only have Verizon that's barely in the green, JP Morgan also in the green. In fact, I'm going to pull up the bank stocks here. And you can see a mixed picture. Here's a closing bell for today. And that wraps up a wild week here for the markets. Again, at least for the day, all three of the major averages ending in the red. You can see right there on your screen right around the lows of the day, Dow off 390, 2 points. S&P off just over 2% than NASDAQ. Look at that. The worst performer of the three off just over 3%, all 11 of the S&P sectors closing in the red today. Big of losses. Consumer discretionary, energy and material. All right. Well, let's bring in Melissa Brown, contigo managing director of applied research. And we also have Sylvia Jablonski, Defiance ETFs, CEO and CIOs. Sylvia, let me start with you just in terms of the wild action that we saw this week. It's back and forth. You want to look any further than yesterday's action. After we got that hot inflation print, initially we sold off and then the start and the markets actually spiked. What do you make of the action that we saw? I should agree to see you. I think that this is all sort of par for the course in terms of what we're seeing in the markets. So there's just too much uncertainty right now. So this range ground volatility, whether it's quick pullbacks that feel pretty meaningful and impactful or quick pops that feel pretty meaningful and impactful, I think that the market just doesn't have any kind of steady footing here. And really it's the same old story. We have all three indices in bear market territory. Inflation is sticking around a little bit longer than we would have liked it to. And that means that the Fed and us waiting to hear the news of every great hike is going to stick around longer than we wanted to. And I think that until we sort of get some confidence that the Fed is either going to pause for some period of time or that we see inflation trending downward for a series of reads. I think that we'll kind of see this range ground volatility for the next few months. Yeah, of course, to hold your breath for a pause at this moment. Melissa, you say investors are likely to react strongly to bad news, potentially ignore downplay good news. How in the world than to explain yesterday at S&P snaps a six day losing streak on the heels of a bad CPI print? It is a difficult move to explain. I think we were looking at not relatively low trading volume. And I think it's just that investors, they're getting sick of being negative. They're getting sick of being bearish. And so perhaps yesterday they just decided to say, okay, when market's down a lot already, let's come in. But then today they got punished for that. So tomorrow, Monday, will that happen again? It's hard to say, but with that negative sentiment, again, I would expect that bad news to lead to much bigger downturns. Then good news will lead to downturns. So in Sylvia, in terms of the outlook, that obviously the Fed is not going to be taking its foot off the pedal any time soon. When do you see the opportunities in this sort of environment knowing that volatility is going to persist until we get the Fed to pivot at some point? Yeah, I think it's important to think about which investor we're kind of talking to and what his or her strategy is. So if you're a longer term investor, and I'm going to say three years is sort of the bottom line there, and you plan to hold even beyond that, then a consistent strategy of dollar cost averaging into your favorite quality stocks that have gone from 22 to 15 multiples.",https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GRIayi6dbGM,144,2022-10-14 20:06:20
3378," into your favorite quality stocks that have gone from 22 to 15 multiples, but probably it's a wire span than that and are down to the tune of 20 to 50 percent. Maybe even a wider span of that. I mean, this is a great opportunity for that. Could the market move on you in reverse another 5 percent? It could, but over the long run, I don't think it's going to matter because we've all been talking about this for quite some time, but since the 1950s, kind of a year out after all of this mass, you tend to see those double digit returns. So long term dollar cost averaging, great opportunity for that. In a short term, though, I think you have to be positioned in a different way. I think it's, you know, if we're talking about getting through to year end, you're probably better off holding, you know, some of the biotech and healthcare names, some of the names that are holding up, you know, Merck is one of the few stocks that has double digit returns this year. They pay a nice dividend, United Healthcare, you know, some of these names are not really impacted by recession, the aging population is continuing to increase. So there's just a good story there in terms of just, you know, safety and overall diversification. And if you're like a super short term trader, I mean, there are bare funds out there, you know, you can kind of short the blockchain crypto ecosystem, you can kind of, you know, short some of the tech and some I conduct your names in a short term. But that's sort of, I would say for a buyer or an investor that's a little more on the professional side. So long term dollar cost average is your quality companies, you know, your Apple Amazon Google's semi conductors, you know, the 5G trade things like that that'll play out over time. And the short term may be sick to defensive names like, like the healthcare names or the alternative energy space too is a good one hydrogen solar things like that. Well, so what do you make of earnings season so far because we certainly have started to get the ball rolling here. We had a number of banks report this morning Pepsi earlier this week, actually much better than what the street had been anticipating. Is this a sign that maybe earnings season isn't going to be as bad as bad as we had initially feared? Well, I don't think you can use, you know, one or two good earnings reports as a sign for what's going to happen for the entire quarter. But it certainly is better to start off the quarter with better news than it is if, you know, we were already in the hole because of some really bad earnings reports. You know, the impact of inflation, you know, you were talking about the dollar before, but, you know, we also have the impact of inflation on both the top line and profit margins that I think we're going to get a lot more clarity on what that impact is over the next couple of weeks. But certainly it's hard to imagine we're going to see a positive impact from inflation across the board. And Sylvia, to touch on the same thing on earnings, anything you learn today from the earnings, the big banks, or that you expect to learn next week when we get a glimpse at Goldman and Bank of America. Yeah, I mean, I would agree with those previous comments, you know, a couple of good reports that does not make a good earnings season just yet. It's a great start. What I would say is that I took some solace in kind of, you know, digging into the conversations behind the earnings releases today and one saying that kind of feels good in terms of worrying about, you know, will we have a deep recession? You know, we may have a recession, we may have a light recession, but when you think about the banks, you know, it's clear that they are, you know, well capitalized that, that, you know, you're not in that 2008 financial crisis sort of state of the world and companies like Pepsi, you know, even CarMax and Micron, like some of the companies that have, you know, guided lower come out with, with poor forecast, they still have great balance sheet. They still have, you know, decent revenues. They're, they're falling, but they're decent. You know, so, so I think what I take from this is that, you know, perhaps the bottom of the market comes before the economy bottoms out, but I don't think that the economy is going to have, you know, kind of like that full on recession that a lot of people are worrying about just because the company's sort of the major corporations, bleach of companies are looking a little bit too good for that to happen. All right, great stuff. We'll have to leave it there. Melissa and Sylvie have a wonderful weekend. Appreciate the time. Coming up, President Biden says there will be consequences for Saudi Arabia following OPEC plus a decision to cut oil production. Find out why the Saudis probably don't care after the break.",https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GRIayi6dbGM,145,2022-10-14 20:10:58
3379," This Saudi's probably don't care after the break. The US and Saudi Arabia trading accusations over oil supply cuts, the US now claiming Saudi Arabia pushed other OPEC plus nations to vote to cut oil production last week. Look at the next-day epaulure, someone's gone to the US and the Iran Central Conference and said they've been outlining the dramatic parties of Standards on the transitions would much worse. United States of favor here and there being pretty overt around it about it. So let's recall President Biden did make a pilgrimage, if you will, to Saudi Arabia over this summer. This is after he called the Crown Prince Mohammed bin Salman a pariah for orchestrating the murder of Jamal Qashoggi four years ago. So Biden basically went over to make amends and we know he did that because he wanted Saudi Arabia to pump more oil to get prices down and help with the economic war against Russia. So Saudi clearly has been behind this agreement by the OPEC plus nations, which includes Russia, by the way, to actually cut production rather than increase production. So now Biden says there will be consequences for this. The Saudi foreign ministry, this was unusual. They actually released a statement a couple days ago saying we're pushing back against these allegations that were trying to help Russia out. These were purely for economic reasons that we want to cut production. And you've got a lot of members of Congress now, including some senators who run important committee saying we need to do something like her tail arm sales to Saudi Arabia or find other ways to basically punish them for this decision. So it's getting ugly. So then Rick, in terms of actual leverage, obviously there tends to be a lot of rhetoric when these things come up. In terms of what can actually be done, how much leverage does the US have?",https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GRIayi6dbGM,146,2022-10-14 20:16:35
3380," So then Rick, in terms of actual leverage, obviously there tends to be a lot of rhetoric when these things come up. But in terms of what can actually be done, how much leverage does the US have, either on its own or if it teams up with allies on this? The United States is a major arm supplier to Saudi Arabia and Saudi Arabia needs those weapons because they have a militant foe right across the Arabian Gulf in Iran. Saudi Arabia and Iran are long sworn enemies and there has been a kinetic military action between those two nations in the past. So they need American weaponry, including things like Patriot Air Defense, missile batteries. So the United States could remove some US weapons there to help defend Saudi Arabia. The United States could also decide not to sell Saudi Arabia weapons and say, well, why don't you go to your buddy, Russia, and get weapons from them. Of course, Russia is running out of weapons because they're firing all their own weapons at Ukraine. So that's one thing the United States could do, but it might backfire in terms of the oil markets because we are just going to be somewhat dependent on oil producing nations such as Saudi Arabia because in those nations, the government decides how much oil to produce. That is totally different from what happens here. The US government cannot go to Exxon or Chevron and say, you need to increase oil production by 10% or 20%. And here in the United States, energy firms, they do not want to invest in huge fossil fuel energy projects anymore because they don't think they're going to get their money back. They know this is a declining industry. The Saudi government, on the other hand, can keep making those types of investments. So in the future, I think governments like Saudi Arabia could be even more important to fossil fuel industries than they are now. So President Biden has to think about the long term consequences of anything he's likely to do. So, on the Adelaquat Balancing Act indeed, thanks for breaking that down for us, our very own Rick Newman, have a good weekend. Well, post spreading misinformation continued to mount as midterm elections near. A new report from advocacy group the Integrity Institute tracks which platforms are amplifying the spread of misinformation the most. We are who finances tech editor Dan Howley has the details. So down who made the list? Yes, so this is a list from a nonprofit basically looking at what the kind of companies that we see is social media, giants, Facebook, Twitter, TikTok, relatively new still are doing as far as spreading misinformation, not themselves but their platforms. And essentially what the result is is that Twitter is on top. And the reason for that is because of the fact that the ability to share, reach, we quickly, any kind of content that comes out is so easy. It's a click away, a tap away that it just allows this kind of information to spread this again through the Integrity Institute basically saying that, you know, that is the number one vector for misinformation to spread easily, easily, not necessarily among social platforms. TikTok also very easy to spread that because of its algorithm. And so, you know, just to give you a sense of the type of misinformation spread, it's because it gets more of a reaction from people. This is what we've heard in the past. It gets more of a reaction. People get angered by something that they see. You know, the cat litter in the classroom thing is one that's going on right now obviously. And so people see that. They think it's a wild idea and so they'll start treating it or re-tweeting it or sharing it along those lines. And so that's why Twitter is on their TikTok on the other hand because of that algorithm. Yeah, that's interesting. So I never thought about just the ease of re-sharing something on Twitter. Now, we're not going to get any reaction likely from TikTok. Is there any reaction from Twitter and anything they can do or have been discussing doing here, Dan, that might change this? Yeah, I think it really just comes down to the different companies and their stance on misinformation and disinformation. You know, there was in this report a kind of reference to what Mark Zuckerberg had put out where misinformation, the closer it gets to or the more of a red line the companies put in the sand, the more it'll start to kind of increase the spread of disinformation. Bye.",https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GRIayi6dbGM,147,2022-10-14 20:19:15
3381," or the more of a red line that companies put in the sand, the more it'll start to kind of increase the spread of this information. So when you kind of see stuff that's getting wildly out of hand, companies will put a red line there and stop allowing it to be spread. But you know, it's kind of a moving target at all times. So companies have a difficult time trying to figure out how they're going to set that up. And I think, you know, Facebook has talked about how they've worked on this, though they have pulled back as they're cutting spending. Twitter has talked about this, but Elon Musk doesn't want to have much moderation. And you know, it's looking increasing the lake. He's going to buy it, but hey, you know, it's a day of the week that ends in Y. So that could change. And you know, TikTok, as you said, we're probably not going to get much out of it, though they said they do try to tamp down on this information, disinformation. So, you know, as long as social media is out there, as long as there's stuff that's easy to spread, as long as people are easy to anger stuff that they see, we're still going to see misinformation disinformation. I mean, it's tough. It's 6,000 tweets per second. When you figure in retweets and everything else, it's like playing whack and we're trying to sort this out. A big thank you, Dan Howley there for us. All right. Well, could the iPhone be getting a new look? An analyst who thinks a foldable iPhone could be on the way joins us next. A new warning from the Centers for Disease Control about the spread of Omicron sub variants Angelic Amlani is here with the details for us. Hi, Anne. Hey, Shana. That's right. We've got some concerns about the growing spread of some of the Omicron sub variants really globally. Right now in the US, we know that's and get ready for the alphabet soup that everyone's been talking about. But the XBB is the one that, you know, oversees has been doing a lot of damage. BA for six. We saw in the US climbing a little bit. We also have another one.",https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GRIayi6dbGM,148,2022-10-14 20:23:36
3382," But the XBV is the one that overseas has been doing a lot of damage. B for six, we saw in the US climbing a little bit. We also have another one, the BQ one and 1.1. And so those were two separated joined. They were about 10% of all cases right now. And so that's where the CDC is really keeping an eye. And that's where some of the concern has been coming in recent months. You've been hearing a lot about experts looking at the winter and what the concern over flew as well as surging COVID cases might look like in the pressure that hospital systems might have to face. And that's really what's coming to a head right now. We're starting to see some of these slightly more transmissible variants come through. And that's where the CDC has their warning come in. It we're not quite sure which one might cause, you know, a specific concern for the US yet, but definitely keeping an eye on these and watching and tracking those cases. Especially as we head into the cold, the colder months we want to keep an eye on. Now, Angelie, another story that we're watching, the FDA warning of a shortage of Adderall, what's happening there? That's right. So Adderall, this actually is a couple months old of an issue that is now coming to a head, a Tava pharmaceuticals, which is the largest maker of Adderall in the US, was experiencing some labor shortages. And so that resulted in a shortage of the product as well. And then it puts stress on more generic makers to have to fill the gap. And even there now on back orders. So the FDA has issued now a warning about that notification that there is there is a shortage now. Tava has said that they expect to be able to get back into production and get back into normal production by the end of the month. But those generics might not get back on track until early next year. So it really is a concerning issue right now and just something that's, you know, nothing manufacturing based, but more of a labor issue. And the story that we will continue to watch right. Angelie Camelani, thanks so much. All right, with Apple earnings less than two weeks away, there are no shortage of headlines. Tim Cook, teaming up with Goldman Sachs on bank accounts, a new mixed reality headset on the way, even a report that Taylor Swift music will be featured in Apple Fitness workout programs. Jim Suva is the sitting managing director of equity research out with the new Apple note, essentially saying you can shake it off to those reports of waning iPhone 14 demand. Yeah, I said it. You didn't your price target is 185 that implies a 30% upside. Why Jim? Well, David, it's great to see you again. It's been a long time, but to catch up now as we head into Halloween, it's really not that spooky. The markets have pulled back mostly on the increasing interest rates by the Fed. That being said, consumers, certain pockets are very weak like personal computers. Other pockets like for Apple are quite strong. When you lose or break your iPhone or your AirPods, you replace them very quickly. You don't think about it. Yes, fuel, gas, food and inflation costs have gone higher, but mobile computing and smartphones are here to stay. We believe that Apple has upside and a lot of the press reports about order reductions aren't going to come to pass. Apple actually over orders because there's usually a bottle net or a supply chain hiccup. Those will be remedied. We simply think that pull back in here on Apple warrants a good look at it from investors with a $185 target price. Jim, in that bullet point in your most recent note about the iPhone 14, you also talked about a foldable phone next year. What can you tell us about this? I guess what do you think this will potentially do for Apple's business? Is it going to lure in people that maybe haven't converted to iPhone yet? Or do you think it's just going to help uping the average selling price? Definitely, it's going to up the average selling price. But bringing in more from the Android ecosystem. Right now, there are some Android phones out there. They're doing quite well, but the average price is very, very high. People ask me mostly, what is the business use for it? Hey, it'd be great to be able to walk down the street with maps open and still be getting emails at the same time. Or for those who play video games, have a bigger screen or a split screen, we think it will be...",https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GRIayi6dbGM,149,2022-10-14 20:28:05
3383," on the street with maps open and still beginning emails at the same time. Or for those who play video games have a bigger screen or a split screen. We think it will potentially bring an upgrade cycle, but we want Apple to be able to work out the crease or the fold in the phone. The last thing people want is to open a closet 300 times and start to be a hairline craft in the screen. That's why Apple is taking its time coming to market with a foldable phone. But once people start to catch on that this is what they're doing, the market will bring that forward and discount it and it will be a driver to the upside for people spending more money in the Apple ecosystem in totality. And especially for people who love the gadgets and have been looking for some innovation on the product side, not always on the service line for Apple, which they've been focusing on. That'll be a big selling point. I know you're also talking your note about what we've seen with the strong dollar offsetting some of these supply chain concerns, which is now started to ease. How much of a game changer is that going to be for Apple? You know, it's something definitely to keep an eye on foreign exchanges. Very important, but also note the COVID shutdown in the closures, whether it be in China or other parts of the world, China, India, all these other places that had to have big shutdown. That hurts Apple to front both on the product side and also on the services. The Apple stores are closed. You can't go in and get warranty. You can't get help. You can't get upgrades and you can't get additional peripherals. So simply put, we believe that internationally as COVID gets behind us, yes, FX is a headwind, but we believe that opening up a society of people getting out and going shopping more is going to be a positive for Apple. They've navigated through COVID remarkably well with the hard work of their suppliers, their supply chain and the employees themselves. Once people get back and do more, they start to break their phones, drop their phones and then look to replace them, but simply put, Apple has navigated this very well. FX is negatively impacting all the U.S. companies, but their supply chain has been remarkably impressive. Jim, want to talk some sports streaming here. Apple has the deal with major league soccer, still no deal between Apple and the NFL and this expected Sunday NFL ticket package. What is your expectation in terms of Apple making an entry into sports streaming beyond the MLS? And what do you make Eddie Q had a service to saying we were not interested in buying sports rights earlier this week on a panel in New York? And if I could just tack on one more, how significant is sports streaming for the investor story? Dave, that's a brilliant question and spot on that's important, but that's one of the pedestals they're looking at, but there's many, many, many more. Whether it be movies, whether it be artists and you started off the show by talking about some of that, there's just a lot of content that Apple wants to put on its platform. Yes, my family is on Apple TV, Apple TV, plus we watched up, we stream it. But the amount of content while it's wholesome for me and my family, the number of options is still fairly limited. Any way to increase that is a positive sports, music, artists, entertainment, lots of ways to do it. We viewed as a positive sports can be expensive. You got to do it right. You got to entertain it with people. You got to have the backgrounds, the foregrounds, the speakers, the commentators. It's live. You can't do a repeat. You can't do a retake of it. Other things like movies and contents, they're doing more and more with that. But we expect the Apple TV for it to be plus plus plus as we go down the road to be more and more. But right now it's lacking a lot. Sports is one of those things that it's lacking. And Jim, I want to ask you about this report from the information talking about Apple's mixed reality headset, perhaps offering some of this iris scanning to incorporate payments. Where do you see the Apple ecosystem going and growing? You know, that's a very forward looking question that is spot on and why people should own the stock. It's the ecosystem and the platform. Right now we've been talking about iPhones a lot. And the reality is going down the road. There's no reason why people in education or pilots or other people shouldn't be putting on AR VR goggles. And see what it's like in biology class looking inside the human body to learn. Bingo.",https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GRIayi6dbGM,150,2022-10-14 20:32:45
3384," people shouldn't be putting on AR VR goggles and see what it's like in biology class looking inside the human body to learn. Why developing countries can't get better education in medical sciences. Why to get your kitchen or your house renovated in architect, can't go in and take pictures and you put on headsets and see the different paint colors and where the appliances go. This is all eventually coming. People talk about gaming. Yeah, gaming is important for AR and VR but there's a lot of society that can really do better. You think about the home repair person coming to fix a water heater. They can put on the goggles and learn what's wrong instead of having to go out and be taught by an apprentice for two to three years. AR VR we think is going to be very big for Apple down the road. And this important platform of family of products will just add to the economics that are positive for Apple. I'm looking forward to those headsets. They may not be the first out in the market but they're typically tested and a very good experience. And that's where the magic meet. The hardware plus the software for our magical experience. And that's what Apple is all about. Jim Suga always great to have you come visit us again. Thanks so much for joining us. Have a good weekend. Thank you. Bye bye. Supermarket giant Kroger just acquired a competitor in Albert Sins. A new survey reveals how many companies are looking to make a similar move in the next 12 months. Also be sure to tune in to Yahoo! Finances all markets. Summit Monday starting at 9 a.m. Eastern Moderna CEO. Stephanie Bankel and Target CEO Brian Cornell just two of the many industry leaders joining the program. Get on one of this. Breaking news now. Nikola founder Trevor Milton has been found guilty of defrauding investors.",https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GRIayi6dbGM,151,2022-10-14 20:36:29
3385," Breaking news now, Nikola founder Trevor Milton has been found guilty of defrauding investors. Prosecutors alleged the former CEO lied to investors about his electric truck startup technology something Milton denied. Milton was charged with two counts of securities fraud and two counts of wire fraud. George found him guilty on one count of securities fraud and both of the wire fraud counts. Well two of the largest US supermarkets are merging. We talked about this before. Kroger has agreed to buy Albertsons for $24.6 billion. Now this comes as a majority of executives find themselves altering their investment plans. As we take a look, 93% of CEOs say they've made alterations to investment plans and made geopolitical turmoil and that's according to a new survey from EY. That over half still say they expect to pursue an acquisition in the next year. Mitch Berlin, EY America's strategy and transactions vice chair joins us now. Then you talked about this being that everywhere all at once, similar to the movie, a lot of things that some of these CEOs are having to contend with. How is this affecting the landscape? What were the biggest findings in your study? Well, I think not surprising, inflation is top of mind for all the CEOs that we spoke to. We interviewed over 760 CEOs around the world and 65% of them expect their earnings to be impacted by inflation. That's really due to the input prices, which include labor, raw materials, energy and freight. There's only so much of that cost they can pass back on to the end consumer. The CEOs that I work with on a daily basis actually are looking at ways to take out costs so they can still meet their bottom line and other ways so they can reimagine their business to be a leaner, more efficient version of what they are today. So I would expect it over the next six to nine months. You're going to see a lot of restructuring and reorganizations in corporate America. And Mitch Rochelle, let the intro there with the news today from Kroger and Albert Sins in the surveys at 52% of the CEOs are still pursuing M&A. Any idea just in terms of why and I guess why they would be a little bit more optimistic than I think we would have initially thought at this point. Yeah, well the interesting thing, Sean, is that when we look at the difference between the US results and the rest of world results, the US CEOs are more bold. They know that they need to transact to transform. And they're still very bold on what's going on. They're bold on growth and they know that in order to stay ahead of the competition, the fastest way to get there is to remanate. And you said it's more about prudent deal making. What are some of the conversations that they're having when trying to determine what should be an acquisition versus say a joint venture? I think they're really concerned around not overpaying. The multiples last year were off the charts. And so what we're seeing is particularly with corporates that they're doing much more diligence and making sure they're doing the right deal now for the right price. We haven't seen a lot of private equity in the market over the last couple months. We expect that they will come back as a cost of capital. Continuous to increase. We would expect that the corporates would retreat a little bit because the deals become more expensive for them. But the private equities are still sitting on a lot of dry powder. They'll re-enter the market and take advantage of the lower valuations and that's important for them because I think there was a lot of overpayment in the last year. Mitch, one big trend that we've been following very closely, obviously, is this tightly labor market has spent a huge challenge for companies to lure in some of that top talent? Did this come up in your conversations with CEOs? And I guess what are they doing in order to attract talent to their firms? Yeah, the input costs was a big issue for our CEOs in terms of inflation. And so talent is one of the major input costs. The survey really did not touch a lot on the different things that they're doing to attract talent. But we do know that clearly it's been a significant impact. I mean, unemployment is its lowest rate in what, 50 years now, at 3%. So it is a tightly labor market out there. And Mitch, obviously, we're in a very different place than we were two years ago when the pandemic was first kicking in. In terms of our CEOs and our thinking of the pandemic and the pandemic-related issues that they're focusing on when they're trying to come up with their strategies, what were their priorities? Well, it's interesting because the pandemic is still the number one concern. I think you're earlier segment around the-",https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GRIayi6dbGM,152,2022-10-14 20:41:09
3386," What were their strategies? What were their priorities? Well, it's interesting because the pandemic is still the number one concern. I was listening to your earlier segment around the CDC sort of concern around the rise in COVID. But when the CEOs are talking about the pandemic, they're really using it as a proxy for broader issues. So it's not just the health concerns that we had two years ago. It's the inflation. It's the increased input costs, labor and such. It is supply chain issues that factory shutdowns in China. Those are all top of mind for our CEO. So the pandemic was the number one concern for them. But following behind that, like eight points behind that, though, so a distant second was regulatory concerns followed by geopolitical concerns and then also climate change. Okay. Certainly lots for them to continue with a big thank you. Mitch Berlin for joining us from EY. Thanks so much. Thank you. All right. This week ended with a bang in terms of bank earnings. It continues next week. Here's what I'm watching for Monday. Bank of America reports before the open consent assessment show total revenue climbing by about 3% as rising interest income more than offsets, falling investment banking fees. Tuesday, Goldman Sachs reports before the bell. Estimates calling for net interest income to grow by 31% from a year ago. And while total revenue is expected to decline for a third consecutive quarter at the courting to Jeffries, Netflix also reports on Tuesday. The big question, will they add subscribers after two straight quarterly losses? This on the heels of Thursday's announcement that the ad tier will cost 699 per month. Wednesday, you got Tesla reporting earnings following a disappointing third quarter delivery. Volumes falling short of expectations. Thursday, snap the first of the big tech companies to report after the close and give us a glimpse of the softening digital ad market. We wrap up with Friday American Express reports before the bells to the downgraded MX to sell, warning that the possible deceleration and spending volume is not fully considered by investors. All right. Some breaking news now, the Wall Street Journal reporting that Rupert Murdock is looking to recombine newscorp and Fox corporations. Allie Canal is here with the details. Interesting this was broken, of course, by Wall Street Journal. Right. Which she technically owns. Which will be dramatically impacted by this. What are we learning? I mean, it's very interesting. It's an interesting move. A recombination, right? If you remember, in 2013, these two holdings were originally separated. The publishing side and then the TV and the film side. But at 91 years old, apparently reportedly he wants to re-emerge those entities. And if you think about the brands under all of this, obviously under Fox, you have the broadcast network along with some local television stations, 2B, which is a popular streaming service. And then newscorp is the parent company of Dow Jones. As you mentioned, the Wall Street Journal, HarperCollins, as well as some other news organizations in the UK and Australia. Now, currently, FoxCorp has a market cap of about 17 billion newscorp, roughly half of that at 9 billion. But according to the report, we're in the very early stages of these talks. It's possible. It won't happen. But maybe he's just looking at the media environment right now, because there is a lot of consolidation. We had the Amazon purchase of MGM, ViacomCBS merger, Warner Brothers discovering merger. Maybe he's reassessing what's going on in the landscape right now. It just seems. Trial balloon. Because there's going to be some major blowback, big personalities and big wigs in the media world learning they're going to be back in bed with Fox News. That's going to be... That is true. They're will be. And also just from a completely business standpoint, just taking a look at the performance, we had the one month chart up of both of the companies. But we take a look at the year-to-day chart of newscorp. It hasn't necessarily finished Trump performance for the company year-to-day. It's all 30% through a need of some help. Maybe this is something or what they see as a strategic opportunity here in order to boost the business going. Right, and that's true. And like I mentioned with the market cap too, newscorp, just $9 billion, Foxcorp, $17 billion, maybe they'll take some of that money and help newscorp out there. But that really, to me, is the only main, I guess, motivator for Rupert. Yeah. It's interesting. I was surprised to see...",https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GRIayi6dbGM,153,2022-10-14 20:45:27
3387," this court about there, but that really, to me, is the only main, I guess, motivator for Rupert. Yeah. It's interesting. I was surprised to see this report. I'm not going to lie. Well, it's something that we will, of course, closely follow here. Allie, while we have you, let's stick with the media space because Netflix. We're going to be hearing from the company next week. They report after the bill on Tuesday. The sauce gun, a bit of its momentum back over the last couple of months. But what do you think we're going to hear? Well, this earnings report is going to be very interesting because in the first time for a very long time, it's not going to be all about subscribers. It's going to be about profitability. New revenue streams. Obviously, a big one there is the advertising tear, which we got a lot of details on yesterday, after that announcement from Netflix. If you take a look at the number, so revenue expected to come in at $7.85 billion, adjusted earnings per share, $2.22. And then subscriber net additions, Netflix guided 1 million. That's roughly in line with consensus estimates. I do think we are going to see net additions this time around after the platform shed 1.2 million subscribers in the first half of the year. And I largely think that's going to be because of content, right? Like, DOMER, which we've talked about all together. That's just been crushing it week after week. And then, you know, overall, it's really all going to be about advertising. Analysts are very bullish on this. UBS raised its price target by $52 to $250 a share. Getting that ad tear could provide a 10% boost to total revenue. So that's going to be the main focus. Of course, we have those macro headwinds, potential pressure from foreign exchange. That could impact margins and revenue. But overall, I don't think really investors are going to care too much about that. They're going to want to hear about the ad. It's down the road. We're all waiting to see the impact of that ad tear. All right, Canal. Good stuff. Have a good weekend. Thanks. All right, coming up, if you're interested in buying a pre-owned Rolex, you might be able to get a deal. I'll tell you why next.",https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GRIayi6dbGM,155,2022-10-14 20:53:14
3388," All right, as we wrap up the trading week, let's take a look at some of the biggest stock Movers. First up, a mega deal in the grocery space. Croger reaching a deal to buy Albert Sense for 24.6 billion. The combined company is going to employ more than a 700,000 people across about 5,000 stores. Take a look at the movement that we saw in New yesterday that a deal was imminent sense shares of Albert Sense above $28 per share. Although it looks like it was a buy of the rumor, sell the news type of deal. Also questions about whether or not this is going to be approved from regulators. I think that's a big driver in the stock price today. You see Albert Sense closing the day off just around 8.5% on a two day basis. You're still looking at a gain of just around 2% Croger on an intraday basis closing the day off 7%. All right, let's take a look at Pepsi. Now the company kicking off third quarter earning season on a pretty upbeat no here in a five day chart. You can see that shares up just around 5% the company beating up both the top and bottom lines. Also raising its guidance to find any fears of a slowdown. Sending shares up about 4% on Wednesday. Taking a look at that five day chart, you can see the pop in shares shortly after Pepsi did report. Now third quarter revenue jumping 9% from a year ago while profit expanded more than 20% Pepsi. Now sees full year revenue growth of 12% the latest raise. Mark the third time that the company is actually up to its full year forecast this year. And again, that week to date performance here was shares closing up just over 5%. All right, let's round it out with Delta now the stock jumping a third quarter profit of 695 million as higher fairs. Health offset some of those rising jet fuel prices. Now the carrier offered up beat fourth quarter guidance to noting a resurgence in corporate travel and also signs of a strong holiday rush. A bullish note from Calence sending shares up once again today. You see the second a daily basis at least closing up just around 2% that five day gain there for Delta up nearly 6% and really setting the tone from what we could see from some of those larger carriers. All right, finishing the week strong there. Well market volatility though now impacting the luxury watch market according to a recent note from Morgan Stanley. Now the finance is price to Romanian and watch connoisseur is here with the latest so price what do we need to know? Yeah, you know, Rochelle, as you can't actually buy these watches and stores, you can't actually buy them online secondhand market and that's where they're sort of getting smoked right now from a price point of view, the big three Rolex, Patek Philippe and AP, they come from about 70% of the market. You've seen their prices down at least 8%. The Rolex they tone it down 21%. This has dealers and sort of people that are collect watches, have been flooding the market recently trying to get trying to sell these Rolexes and APs and things like that as their values had kind of shot up. Now we're seeing a weakening macro environment. People are trying to sell into that and that's going to see these prices come down a lot. I do want to say though that watches as an asset are up compared to the markets since January 2021 compared that that's a few top 100 and also compared to Bitcoin. So you still have some value there but right now into Q4 especially you're going to see these prices come down dramatically according to Morgan Stanley. Luxury shopping market has shown very little demand destruction. I assume the retail market is healthy and is there never had a Rolex watch? Is there like a stock X goat as there is for sneakers? Where do you buy these? There are sites like Bob's watches and others that do sell these watches secondhand. They verify their authenticity and things alike. I think Chrono 24 also. So these actually they've taken the stock, they verify and they sell it. And those guys are seeing their stock of watches sort of skyrocket right now. So that's why we've seen these prices like Rolex, down 8%, paddock down 8%, which is kind of dramatic in the last quarter or so. But you see a move like this. I mean lots of questions about what this market is going to look like a quarter maybe two quarters from now. When you see this drop today is this something that they see as a new normal do you think? I think it has to be. There was such a run up pushing the Bitcoin kind of craze. These watches got so much. I mean the draw state owners I think is like average.",https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GRIayi6dbGM,155,2022-10-14 20:54:56
3389," As a new normal, do you think? I think it has to be. There was such a run up, pushing the Bitcoin kind of craze. These watches got so much. I mean, the Drollist Daytona is the thing is like average price, 30,000. You could buy it if you could find a retail for like 13. So that's why we're seeing these corrections happening. Probably we'll come closer back to retail. I mean, why should the second AMR could be way more than retail? It's just out of control. Yeah. Resonate with used cars for a while, right? Like people returning their these cars, they were selling over the price. I do want to say one thing. I was at the vacation recently at the Rome airport. The Rolex are walking. Just to see what's going on. They had watches on display. Can't buy. You can try them on, but you can't buy them. They're just display watches. Wow. I don't get it. No supply. Where are you going in my one if you good? No, God. He's already gone. Prowl, thank you. Have a good weekend, my friend. Appreciate that. Coming up, workers at several California-based tech companies are among the happiest with their pay. According to new report, find out which firm is at the top of the list. And we come back. Music. I want to give you an update on a story we reported earlier in the show. A federal judge has denied a request for a battle-theranos founder, Elizabeth Holmes. Holmes sought documents from the company's former lab director who testified against Holmes at trial. The former lab director may have testified untruthfully at trial. The ruling is a setback for Holmes, hearing on Monday where she's asking for a new trial. We'll keep you posted on that. Well, high inflation, the possibility of a recession, there's no shortage of reasons for employees to be unsatisfied with their pay. But comparably.com compiled a list of companies where staff are the most happy with their pay. We are Adobe Ring Central and Meta, which is interesting because we...",https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GRIayi6dbGM,156,2022-10-14 20:58:40
3390," But comparably.com compiled a list of companies where staff are the most happy with their pay. The top three are Adobe Ring Central and Meta, which is interesting because we haven't heard too many positive headlines about Meta so I was surprised to see them up there. Any surprises for you in this list, Sean? You know, yeah, I would be very curious to exact date that this was taken because I don't think Meta would any longer wish I'll exactly write the in that top five, maybe not even top 20 list. I don't know. We'll see how everything plays out there. And I don't think it was any surprise here when you take a look at the top names in this list, majority of them are tech firms. And we've known that for a while just in terms of the incentives that they offer employees, the fact that they have so many benefits. One Adobe employee was cited in this survey saying that they really appreciate the child care costs. The coverage that Adobe pays for when it comes to their child care up until the age of six. So I think once you have incentives, pay equals what you think you should be making benefits, exceed sometimes what you necessarily expected. It's no surprise that these employees are very happy. I was a little taken aback by the prevalence of California firms on this list. Eight of the top 10 companies in terms of happiness were from the state of California where taxes are through the roof. So clearly they are being compensated for the high tax environment. But what you'll find underneath a lot of these companies is a satisfaction with pay transparency, which is really coming of age, we're going to hear more about that in California and New York. And when that happens, it tends to spread throughout the rest of the country. And I think that is something you're going to be hearing a lot more about in the years ahead. People need to know ballpark what the people next to them are making to be satisfied. Yeah, just clear standard. How you pay and the path to growth will show. Yes. And one thing that was interesting with the people's happiness with stock prices, and when you consider what's been happening with tech this year, the fact that that was one of the things that was considered, I thought I was very interesting. Yeah. It is very interesting. But a good group here, at least if you're in the market for a new job, you need to check out with this list. All right, we'll be sure to tune into Yahoo Finance's All Market Summit. On Monday, starting at 9 a.m. Eastern time, a slew of industry leaders will be joining us. You won't want to miss it.

3394," than the cloud economics. The other way is if you're not building cloud native applications, I mean, just to put it in perspective, you know, if you are just doing application development like you did even three years ago, four years ago and are not using some of the things like the container technology or some of the stuff like our Cosmos DB, it's like 100x different, you know, in terms of efficiency. Or using tools like teams and Viva to drive hybrid work because after all, that's a reality we all face. So I think in each layer of this technology, you wanna make sure that you are on the right cost curve and you're using the best tools to drive productivity and your ability to do more with less. So that's what's exciting for us. We know that this is a great time, but frankly, to be having all of these conversations with customers and also making sure and that we're delivering for them. All right, Microsoft, CEO, Satin Adela, thank you for joining us. Thank you so much, Dan. Up next, how record executive Steve Stout is empowering artists and sending shockwaves through the music industry. E blurry news everywhere.",https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=z4hExsMyQNo,1,2022-10-17 14:02:37
3395," Do Steve Stout is the founder and CEO of United Masters and translation LLC. He's a music industry pioneer and advertising entrepreneur who has produced albums for Mariah Carey and Nas and let production for Gwen Stefani and Enrique Iglesias. Funding from Alphabet, Apple, Andrews and Horowitz, and Disney Stout's companies operate at the intersection of technology, culture, innovation, and storytelling. Steve thanks so much for joining us. You've been in the business back when they were trying to legislate hip-hop and back then. Yeah, if you didn't legislate it now as well. Still, yes. And if you didn't have a contract, you just couldn't break into the business. Once talked about being dependent, it didn't take on. Now we have artists talking about being independent. What happened? Well, I think when Prince said it, nobody really understood what he went. He was way ahead of his time. He's a visionary, he's a visionary musically and he was a visionary on understanding the music business. In fact, he changed his name to the artist formerly known as Prince to get out of his contract. But I think just in general, people thought it's Prince, it's eccentric, not that it was actually a fundamental business reason why. And over time, people really started to understand the value of ownership. They can own your name, they own your likeness. It's in the recording contracts. That's the fundamental understanding of a recording contract is that they own you. And as music has gone, digital distribution and TikTok and Instagram has become the new MTV and Apple Music and Spotify has become the new record store, per se, and radio. The value of a record company is absolutely diminished. And that's where United Masters come in because we connect the artists and the creator directly to the distribution platforms. Now I went to culture con and Lena Weith talked about the correlation between show business and the music industry. And in it, I was asking about generational wealth. And she talked about, she's like, you realize that even now, she's like, we give away our intellectual property. Yeah. But she's like, we don't even get money from residuals from streaming. No. So this so same thing, you have a lot of people who are talking about going independent and particularly now with the pandemic, we had so many, you know, what they call the gig economy. People going independent. How do you see this coming up, particularly with corporate, you know, you talk about the studio industry, we're talking about corporate America. This whole kind of like move and they're talking about the great resignation towards, no, I need to become the master of my own fate. Yeah, well, so there's a couple of things that I'd like to discuss. So Lena is correct. If you don't own, you can't create generational wealth. That's the hope, you have to have an asset to pass down. You have to have an asset that keeps putting off money and putting off value or creating value in order for you to pass it to your siblings and pass it to your next generation. So if you sign a record deal and you give away those rights, I mean, you have nothing to pass down. But if you do give your last one comment of over there with me or in the final Flexibility hilarious else. And we are talking about things that are really cheery.",https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=z4hExsMyQNo,2,2022-10-17 14:05:26
3396," to your siblings and past to your next generation. So if you sign a record deal and you give away those rights, I mean you have nothing to pass down. You have this short term financial gain of the money they gave you to purchase those rights. I think what you've seen is this generational, this sort of shift as generations have evolved where we've gone from the indented servant to slavery, to the employee, to ownership. And I think that's where we are. And just sort of to work in the cycle of value creation is like I don't want to be an employee, I just don't want to be employee anymore. I want to own. Even if you work at a company, you want equity. And if you are creative, you definitely want to retain the value of the intellectual property that you created. So that's just the evolution of the way things have evolved. And that's a good thing because those stories that we all grew up on watching, I don't know if it was the five-heart beats, but whatever tragic story of a creator who created something and then looked up and ended up, they didn't own anything. And their name and their likeness in their work was gone. Are not stories that people want to replicate anymore? These next generation of creators are entrepreneurs. And that's actually sighting for me to go from being in the record business and not understanding as the record executive, actually economics of the business. And I tell a lot of people who are friends of mine that work at record companies, they work there. They don't realize that what they're doing is empowering these companies to take these rights. But as I've evolved as a person, we're able to build this business to help provide these opportunities. You see, it opened up a lot of eyes. And that's why out of all the things that I've done in my career, I'm really most proud of United Masters because it's not about me. It's about helping the next generation of artists own themselves. Going to United Masters. So I just remember, you know, people growing up, if they grew up on NPV and making a ban, you look at that, there was a big thing about people weren't talking about ownership, it's like I want to chain. Yeah. How does United, but yeah, people had to chain, but... Jane and Jacket know anything. It's too short to say it. Some symbolism, some short-term symbolism. Nothing that you said that was an equity or asset. And I think too short-wrapped about, you know, it doesn't matter if you're at $80,000 a car, but you live in your mom's basement. Yeah. How is United Masters helping these independent artists come into their own and own their own stuff? What does it do? Well, the first thing that we're providing is a very simple interface so that you can distribute your music. And, you know, when you go through us, you don't have any issues about ownership. But yours, you retain the rights period, right? So we're first providing that. And that's just distribution. On top of that, we also provide brand services. So we have a company translation that works with some of the greatest brands, the NBA, State Farm, AT&T, and many others. And between the brand side of the business and having the artists, we actually make connections. And we've created a marketplace where the brands and the artists connect. Brands want to be on the front end of understanding culture. These artists are creating culture. So there's obviously a synergy there. And we put that together at scale, whether it be sync. So you're watching a commercial, you're watching an instant feed on social media. The music behind that feed, we're trying to provide all that through our independent artists network. So we're providing artists' distribution plus brand opportunities to underwrite a lot of their, a lot of the things they want to do on going their first tour, shoot their videos, whatever they want to do, we have brands that are helping underwrite that and putting money in their pocket. So it comes distribution plus opportunity, which no one else in the marketplace even comes close to providing those services. So you talked about distribution plus opportunity. You started off in the record industry. Why did you make the switch into brand-in advertising with translation? That's a long story, but it started with, oddly enough, but I worked on the film Men in Black, the soundtrack Men in Black. And it was one of these things where the glass is sold 14 million.",https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=z4hExsMyQNo,3,2022-10-17 14:09:56
3397," I worked in the film Men in Black, the soundtrack Men in Black. And it was one of these things where the glass is sold 14 million, and the album sold 10. And the glass is not only sold more, but we were a big reason why the glass was selling, but we got no credit for it at the record company. And I was like, I'd much rather, if we can create culture, and then somebody else monotizes it, I'd much rather be on the side that monotizes it. So it wasn't a coincidence. I knew that music actually creates cultural moments that then creates consumer behavior, contagious consumer behavior, where you got it, I want to buy it, like you got that haircut, I want that haircut, that kind of thing. And I went on the advertising side, the company that did the product placement to put the glasses in the music video and all that, is a company that I first went to, and I left the record business, and I wanted to learn the advertising business, and I learned it. And then in 2004, I left and I started translation. And I've owned the company since 2004. I can't believe it's been... That's... It's 18 years, 17, 18 years. So we talked about branding. One of the things that I want to bring up is, in 2020 after George Floyd, a bunch of companies, Black Square, we're involved in ESG environmental social governance. We care about social justice. Yeah. However, it is now 2022, and we've had more cases since George Floyd. Yeah. How does this whole branding ESG... That's in the DI, diversity offices and stuff. You know, it's sadly enough to say that every time something happens, you see industries. I could talk about the advertising industry for a second. They would say, oh, we got to do better. And then they'd just go right back to what they were doing before. And I wrote a lot about this, because unless the brand say, unless you have a certain amount of people that are diverse, or this is your employment requirements, then why would I be in business with you? I want... I hold you to a standard... Unless it affects your money, these agencies, specifically on a creative agency side, they're not going to police themselves. So then they go around and they go... On the brand side, they go, we're going to put a Black Square. That's not going to do anything. A Black Square means nothing. That's not commitment. That's commitment to somebody, a social media manager, just making a square black. What are you going to do about the infrastructure on your hiring process? What are you going to do about your board? What are you going to do about your marketing campaigns and how inclusive are they? Like, those are the infrastructure things that need to be checked. And unfortunately, what I've seen over and over again is that this stuff, when it's in the top right hand corner of the Washington Post, or the New York Times, everyone cares. Then as soon as it dissipates and something else comes up like the, you know, war in the Ukraine, all that stuff just goes to the side. So nothing really changes. I'm doing the best that we can. United Masters that my companies were hiring with fully diverse, like I'm committed to that. But I've always been committed to that. Like, it's not a new thing. The commitment is real. And now some brands that I will say that has done a really good job and have reached out and said, I want to do better. I'm trying my best to do better. Show me the way. And I'm proud of those partners. Google is one of those partners. Apple is one of those partners. There's some brands like the NBA that is absolutely Adam Silva believes that his core in diversity. So there's some, but then there's others that honestly didn't visit the subject right when the sun is shining on them. And then as soon as it goes away, then they go back to business as normal. Yeah, normal usual. That kind of thing. And it's sad because you really do want your board and your marketing to reflect society. You become actually a much better business when you have diverse thoughts at the table. You become. You make your much. It makes it better. It makes it better. That you have, but like it's almost like.",https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=z4hExsMyQNo,4,2022-10-17 14:15:05

Thank you so much Steve for shining a light and coming to AMS and sharing these words with us. Hopefully our independent artists who are watching are listening and learning and also those creators out there who want to become their own employer. That's right. Well, thank you so much for having me. It's such a pleasure. And I love the fact that you asked me those questions because I cannot talk enough about helping our people. I can't talk enough about helping independent artists and providing them the tools and the education to own their future. Thank you. Thank you.

3399," the abgeser selections Welcome back to the Yahoo Finance All Market Summit. We're speaking here now with a long time healthcare executive who's running one of the world's largest clinical laboratory networks. It is at the forefront of the testing and diagnoses for various diseases and conditions, including COVID-19. Joining us now is LabCore's CEO, Adam Schechter, and Yahoo Finance's David Briggs. Welcome guys. This is going to be a fun conference. Nice to meet you here. Nice to see you in person. I know. I guess the pandemic's over, right? We just wrapped something up. I wish it were over. Well, speaking of, I think it's clear that the first thing we have to start off with you today, obviously, is just what's the market looking like right now? We know that PCR testing, those testing sites close down. That was a huge boon for you guys. But where do you go from here? Have you been able to return? Well, first of all, we learned a lot from the pandemic. We learned a lot about innovation, about science, about technology. We learned about scale. So at one point, we were able to do over 300,000 COVID tests a day. Since that time, we're doing less and less COVID tests. And as we sit here today, we're doing less COVID tests than what we did at the beginning of this year. But the real question is, what's going to happen as we go into the flu season? We've seen an increase in COVID cases in Europe. And that typically is an indicator of an increase coming to the United States. So a lab quip, we're prepared to run as many tests as we need to. We currently have more capacity than we need. But we're going to make sure we do everything to get people through the upcoming flu season. Are you anticipating a surge over the holidays in cases and ideally in testing? You know, I would assume, based upon what we're seeing in Europe, that there will be an increase in cases and testing required as we go into the end of this year. We'll be prepared for it. Let's hope we don't need it, but I want to make sure that we have the capacity just in case we do need it. So for that capacity, you're maintaining that. And you plan to maintain that, especially for COVID for some time? So we're maintaining about four times more capacity than the current number of tests that we're running. And we always want to stay at a significantly higher number that we can run versus what we are currently running. So we'll continue to watch the cases. If they go us, we're going to increase our capacity again. You know, what we've learned is we can scale quickly now. So we'll be prepared for whatever we need to do as the United States go through the winter and flu season. Good to be able to surge up and down. What about the at home testing part? That's something that at the very beginning, you weren't necessarily very big on. And of course, as you mentioned, innovation, that's something that now we see is a huge market and people are maybe more willing to take tests. Yeah, I think people, if they don't need to go to the doctor's office, they prefer to stay home. And if they don't have to be exposed to other people that are sick or may have COVID, they'd rather stay at home. So we launched Lab Corp on Demand and you can now run over 100 different types of tests from your home. Either you go online and you can order the tests that you want and then you can collect the samples at your house, send them to us or run the test. I can give you the results. Or in some cases, you can actually order the test. Go to one of our service centers. Our phlebotomists can take the blood for you and give you results. So we are seeing people more and more apt to do at home collections and we want to make sure of two things. One, that we continue to communicate with the physicians because we believe that the physicians are so important to the health care of the patient. But at the same time, if patients want to do some testing on their own, we want to make",https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=z4hExsMyQNo,6,2022-10-17 14:23:07
3400," indicate with the physicians, because we believe that the physicians are so important to the health care of the patient. But at the same time, a patient's want to do some testing on their own, we wanna make sure that we give them the results, not only in an accurate way, but in a way that they can understand the results. It was, for many reasons, a devastating pandemic, not just for the economy, but for families around the world, and still is. How significant is silver lining worthy advances, though, in diagnostic testing? And what do you think is the best application when we come out, officially out of this pandemic? Now, that's a great question. And I think the world has a better understanding and appreciation of diagnostic testing today than it did before COVID. And what we've learned is that people want to know more about their health, and not just the United States, but around the world. And we learned that the science and the innovation technology that we've brought to the US has applications around the world. So we're gonna be bringing more of our innovative test globally as we go into the future. But what we've learned from COVID is that you have to be aggressive, and you have to challenge the big scientific issues. Our scientists are remarkable, and the things that they did for COVID, I don't think anybody would have dreamed they'd be able to do. They were just met with these big challenges, and they found a way to be successful. We now need to do that in cancer, in Alzheimer's disease, and in other areas. So for example, for cancer. Right now, if you wanna see what type of cancer people have, sometimes you have to do surgery, take a piece of the tissue of the organ to understand that. Our hope is in the future, we'll be able to do that with the blood test, and those are the types of things that we're trying to... A biopsy. Instead of a biopsy, we're trying to find a way to do it through a blood test. Extraordinary, how close are we to that? We're still years away, and it's gonna take a lot of science and innovation, but there are some tests today that are called liquid biopsies, that are beginning to give us an understanding of how we can move forward and get better and better at doing it in the future. I wonder, we've talked about all the positive and the growth, but obviously, number one, you had to scale up and down with staff for COVID. And secondly, LabCorp really had a really big market when it came to business and employers. How has that shifted with work from home, with the difference in drug testing? We've seen a push for legalized marijuana as well. So how has that all come together in terms of shifting how the business functions? Yeah, that's a great question. And once again, I think COVID had many unintended consequences in the world, whether it be children that had to study from home for a period of time, whether it be parents that no longer wanted to go into the office, leaders had to change. I mean, hopefully I'd become a different leader and I hope a better leader than I was before COVID. But we've learned to have to be more empathetic and to understand that our customers are going through a hard time, that our employees are going through a hard time, that almost everybody around the world is having difficulties based on what's happening in the world today. So I think we've learned a lot about leadership and how to lead through these difficult times. What we've also learned is that you can't be stuck in the way your business ran in the past. You've got to be open to new ideas, to new ways of doing to business. Things that if you would have asked me four years ago, can you actually have these jobs done at home? I would have said no way, we've learned you can. And in certain instances, we've learned we can do things remotely that we weren't able to do before. When it comes to hiring and finding ways to get people employed quickly with our work that we do with employers, we found that a lot of employers are much more distributed now than they were before. So we have to find ways to interact with them as opposed to going on site, but do it through things like at home testing and so forth. Testing when it comes to you guys are heavily involved in drug testing. cannabis marijuana was mentioned there. There is a multi trillion dollar quest for a roadside cannabis tester. You guys looking at that? At this point, we've not pursued that, but we continue to look at every test where we think we can bring science, innovation, technology to make a difference. So in the future, there may be an opportunity for us, but not at this point. So explain to me this at home market opportunity because it seems like on one hand, there's this push for non-clinical spaces. And by that, I mean the retail pharmacies. And we're retail outlets for people to find your tests or the at home option. And one of the biggest conversations throughout this pandemic has been health equity. And this plays a huge role in that. Who has access? Because I know there's a statistic about, you know, every human, every American lives within, you know, Start会?",https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=z4hExsMyQNo,7,2022-10-17 14:27:46
3401," And this plays a huge role in that. Who has access? Because I know there's a statistic about every human, or every American lives within, or 90% of America lives within five miles of a pharmacy. Well, that's five miles. No one's walking five miles from, right? So put that in context of this prospect of an 8.5 billion market by 2030. And what's stake, you've been a leader in testing so far, what stake do you think you're going to have in this market? Yes. The first thing I say is health equity is important. And it's something we all have to pay attention to. And to be honest, there were things we thought we were doing great when it came to health equity. And through COVID, we learned a lot. So for example, we thought by sending kits to people's homes, if they have COVID, we can make a difference. But there's a lot of people in this country that don't have homes today. So there was no place to send the kits. So therefore, we had to find mobile ways to get kits available to people in other parts of communities. Like you said, people live within 10 miles of being able to get a sample to lab group. But 10 miles is a lot for a lot of people. So we continue to look for new innovative ways to ensure that we can bring our testing to everybody across the country in a fair, equitable way. There's still work to be done there. The at-home market's going to be interesting, actually, because I think COVID has changed things a bit. Typically, people said, I want a highly accurate test. But I can get the results in a day or two. But that is fully reimbursed by my managed care plan. For COVID, they said, give me the result as fast as you can. I'll pay whatever it takes in order to get what might not be the most accurate result quickly. I don't think that's going to be the dynamics as we move into the future. So we have to be careful with some of the learnings from COVID and how it may apply to other diseases in the future. So I still think the at-home market has yet to be defined and determined, and there's still a lot more work we have to do. Is the best practical application flew testing at home? So we have flew testing at home. We have a combination test of flew RSV and COVID, all in one test for an at-home test. I think that's a great application, because a doctor can ask their patient to be tested without having to come to the office. But for something like cholesterol or diabetes, the question is, is that a good use of at-home testing? And I'm not quite sure yet. We'll have to see that over time. What about broader costs for this? So on one hand, you have inflation, kind of a big issue. And then on the other hand, you have a lot of focus on health care costs broadly. With this pivot to at-home, you have individual testing shipped out. Is it as cost-effective? Are we looking at, you know, you're able to kind of shift things so it's not increased cost for the patient? So the first thing I'd say is, I think health care costs in this country, and almost every country around the world is a very significant issue that's getting worse by the day. Whether it be the United States or being parts of Europe, we are spending more in health care today than we were prior to COVID, and those costs are increasing. We have to find a way that what we do in health care, including diagnostics, helps reduce cost. The good news is, diagnostics is about 3% of health care spend, but over 90% of decisions are made with some type of diagnostic test. I think that we can show through prevention of disease, detection of disease earlier, things like liquid biopsies in the future of a cancer, that over time, we can help reduce health care costs. I think it's incumbent upon all of us in health care to find ways to help the United States and other parts of the world reduce cost. One thing to help in that capacity would be identifying Alzheimer's earlier, and you mentioned that earlier when we talked here. Where is the science on that finding an early biomarker? It doesn't get the attention. Certainly that COVID does. And really that it should. Where is the science on that? I don't know. So it's still evolving, and there's no doubt that Alzheimer's disease is one of the most significant issues in the world. Every one of us knows somebody that suffers from that devastating disease, and it costs trillions of dollars in cost around the world, not just for patients that have the disease, but for caretakers and other people that are caring for people with the disease. So we are dedicated. We are spending a significant amount of energy and resources in research and development to help find better biomarkers for Alzheimer's disease. Also, some of our pharmacologists are working on new potential drugs and treatments for Alzheimer's disease. I think you need both of those together, because it's not a...",https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=z4hExsMyQNo,8,2022-10-17 14:31:55
3402," Drugs and treatments for Alzheimer's disease, I think you need both of those together, because it's not enough to tell somebody that they could get Alzheimer's disease. You need to tell them they could get Alzheimer's disease and there may be a treatment or things that they can do about it in the future. You've seen the controversy of the FDA approval process when it comes to Alzheimer's drugs. What do you make of that? You know, I have a lot of faith in the FDA. I think the FDA is one of the best regulatory, if not the best in the world. And I think it's just a lot of complicated data that they work their way through. We saw some new data that looks promising and I have no doubt the FDA will do its due diligence to decide whether or not that deserves to make it to the market in the future. You mentioned just a moment ago the idea of costs increasing generally in healthcare. I know during the pandemic we also saw hospitals and other clinical settings where people weren't coming in to get those tests and so it was really squeezing those healthcare settings. Do you anticipate that you're going to feel a little bit of that squeeze with the reduction in people going to get care? Yeah, I mean the first thing I'd say is that our frontline healthcare workers are the true heroes through the pandemic. I mean the people in our hospitals that came in every day are, there are the heroes of the entire pandemic, our frontline workers. But there's no doubt that hospitals are suffering right now and it's very difficult you see in their quarterly earnings how difficult the environment is for them. I think as a country we have to do everything can to support what I believe is one of the best healthcare systems in the world. So I do believe it's going to be hard for them. I do think that we're going to have to find ways to support them. There may be some impact on our business but overall our business is very broad, it's very global and you know it's not just hospital-based, it's also physician and other healthcare professional-based. So I think we'll be okay. I do worry about our healthcare system in general. Those hospitals like just about every profession in this country are seeing an employment shortage. Dyer, are you seeing that across your business and the 100 countries, frankly the trend? Yeah, so we are seeing a shortage of workers across many aspects of our business and I think it's across many aspects of all businesses. So we're doing everything we can to attract, retain and develop the employees that we have. And there's no doubt that the hospitals and other parts of the health system are feeling that same pressure. You do see it in other parts of the world, frankly. And I think it's something we're going to all have to figure out how to deal with. Or acute here. I would say there's other countries that it's equally acute in but I think there's multiple reasons for it. There's some people that don't want to go into an office or into a hospital or into a service center any longer would rather try to find ways to work from home. I think there's a whole host of issues that we're trying to solve for there but it's something that has a healthcare system across all healthcare we have to solve together. Definitely. And when we're talking about the whole world, obviously that's something that we didn't touch on a lot right now but talking about the global trends, do they all kind of align with what you're seeing in the US when it comes to this at home testing as well? Or is it different, especially in remote areas or places that you don't necessarily get chance to get medicines too? Yeah, I think it's a bit different, frankly. I was in Japan a couple of weeks ago and I got into Japan for 25 years. They have a terrific healthcare system. They were interested to hear about at home testing. They don't typically have that. But the first time I've been there in years where they've actually were asking questions about what did we do for COVID, what did we learn, and when I would talk about the at-home collection, there was certainly some interest there. So we'll see. I imagine universal healthcare systems or government run health care systems would be a little bit easier to deal with when it comes to that kind of a market, maybe. I think they all have their new answers. Yeah, of course. Nothing's easier, right? All right, well, Adam Schuchter, CEO of LabCore, thank you so much for joining us, including David Briggs here today. Good to see you. It's such a pleasure to be here. Thank you. Up next, his company created the vaccine for COVID-19. Moderna CEO, Stefan Bonsel, tells us how the life-saving technology is a game-changer for future medicine.",https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=z4hExsMyQNo,9,2022-10-17 14:35:54
3403, Allright. I'm going to put it on the top right corner of the head. I'm going to put it on the top right corner. I'm going to put it on the top right corner. I'm going to put it on the top right corner. I'm going to put it on the top right corner. I'm going to put it on the top right corner. Welcome back to the Yahoo Finance All Market Summit. Moderna has had a historic rise from a small biotech to a major vaccine player in the past two years. The company just in to a deal with Merck to license its cancer vaccine candidate and has a growing pipeline targeting other diseases. Joining me now to this.,https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=z4hExsMyQNo,10,2022-10-17 14:39:36
3404," in the past two years. The company just ended a deal with Merck to license its cancer vaccine candidate and has a growing pipeline targeting other diseases. Joining me now to discuss all this and more is CEO, Cephan Benzel. Cephan, thank you so much for joining us once again, absolute pleasure to have you with us at this summit. Thank you so much for your invitation. I wanna start off with the news. Obviously that deal with Merck really big game changer for you guys when it comes to just a trajectory of the company you're no longer on your own, you're no longer just a COVID company. Things are moving along, tell us about this deal. Yes, so we're very excited that Merck decided to exercise the option on our personal cancer vaccine. You might recall we've done a partnership in 2016. We are Merck funded the manufacturing infrastructure for cancer, the phase one and the phase two that is still ongoing, the phase two full without we can in 24 this year, so we're the TIP caper morphs now. But Merck decided recently to exercise the option so that we're gonna be 50-bit TIP properties as partners. As you know Merck is a leading company in immunology. The product is being tested in combination with the TIP. And it's really, I think, offering the data is positive when it comes to that in Q4, where we'll be very transformative for patients because that's a personalized product we make for every human being. Nothing would be sequencing about DNA so that could potentially be sort of a guaranteed joint cancer. Yeah, and this, I know you've been waiting for me to ask you about anything but COVID, right? At this point, you're just like, please ask me about more than the COVID vaccine. Well, now's your chance because I also wanna ask about all the other candidates you have in your pipeline. You do have an RSV candidate that you've been pursuing as well as a combo of flu and COVID candidate. So talk to me about that and where we're looking, especially for respiratory diseases that we know are still on the horizon for this winter. What are you looking at when it comes to the timeline for these other candidates? Sure, I mean, as you see, and as you know, modernize a platform company and, unfortunately, most people know us about COVID, we're very of a thankful and grateful for the ability to help that we have with the pandemic and still now we're being on booster. But modernize a platform company. So let's start with vaccines where indeed in addition to the unneuroblated booster, for COVID, we are gonna get in Q1 of 23 or phase three data for flu. And we have feedback from the regulators like BFDA that that's the dish to be enough to fight for the condition of a provoder of a product. So we do the product for flu on a market in the fall of 23 and in a few countries around the world. When as you see RSV goes so calm, around Q1 timeframe, this one's a bit more difficult to know because it's a case basis. So we need to be more physically contacting the disease that we have in the COVID-based pre-study. But that's becoming the Q1 timeframe according to current epidemiology analysis. And now of course, the combination. As you know, we are working with a COVID-19 that's through in a single dose. Also COVID-19 has flu plus R has been a single dose. So you see more than that, we're really pushing the vaccine portfolio for respiratory disease better so for late and viruses. Those viruses that once in a body, I know putting four out, we're working on HIV, working on CMV, EBV, the virus causing mononetrosis for which there is no vaccine on the market. So we are trying to build a very large franchise on vaccine. Then we spoke about cancer a minute ago. And then another big news that we shared at all annual on the day in September last month was some early indication, I think we need a couple more months, but this start to look good in regenerative disease where we inject a MAIN AID, going into your liver to basically give an instruction to the kids that have that regenerative disease for the protein that you and I have in your liver that makes us not sick. And so we think it's a very large opportunity as well. Those products should move very quickly to the market because you know your face went to directly to patients. You do not go in and people on sales. And if you have good signal in the clinic, you go very quickly into people's arms. The regulatory agency helps you to move fast because those kids are no more, they've snatched.",https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=z4hExsMyQNo,11,2022-10-17 14:44:46
3405," And if you have good signal in the clinic, you go very quickly into people's home, the regulatory agency help you to move fast because those kids are no more, there's no treatment to the market for those disease. So that's a third pillar of Moderna. And as we know, our partners at Gerdex have said that before the end of the year, they will fight to be a D&D to go into the clinic. We'll be yet again another fourth technology for Moderna to inhale M.I. in this case, against CCF roses. So you can see the company is very proud, expanding. And in each of those very proud because we're not for, we have a little scale very good. Absolutely. Talk to me about that because it seems like not only do you have the pipeline and the platform but also now you have a robust manufacturing network. So how does that play in with what you built up through the pandemic to what you can now do? And that's the next question. Indeed, COVID accelerated the company by around five years in terms of manufacturing infrastructure. As you know, we took to the Atlantic in no more massage resets, it switched around. But we're also beginning in Canada, we're beginning in the UK, we're beginning in Australia and in Kenya. So very strong network across the world. And so now we can scale this platform. As you know, the pharmaceutical industry is a world of analytical medicine. If you can any great company or bread bugs a company there is no correlation between two other assets because the chemical structure is very different. Well, in case of Moderna, all of our drugs are made into same technology we just changed the order of a nucleic acid, the code of life, the folate of life, like software is made with zeros and ones. And we go out together. If you look at it today, we have 26 vaccine in development. 26, that is almost as loud as the entire vaccine in clinical trial by the rest of industry combined. And you're going to see us doing the same in reactionative disease. If we have good data, we've got texts in the lab. We do the sales bringing many more drugs against lung disease. And again, the cancer vaccine is yet another example of what can be done in Germany that you could not even think about over technology, which is to make a drug for every human being that's different. You could not do that to the small money group. Yeah, absolutely. So tell me about that because obviously, COVID set up the company to do more. You had the validation with getting to the getting your first commercial product out there. And everyone's still, unfortunately, like you said, just knows you as the COVID company. But you are now with relationships with the FDA. You are able to get some of these candidates further ahead. But there also is some competition in some of these sectors, such as RSV, such as cancer. So do you feel like you've set up the company now that you're at a position where you can compete with some of these traditional players? Definitely. I mean, if you look at it in some of our, in this scale, we 46 program, we have more program than most biotech company and looking like it kind of midsize, large for our company. We have many dozens of drugs that are in the lab right, that I will expect in the next 12 to 24 months to move into development. So would I see a world in the next 12 to 24 months where we have 100 drugs in development? I think it's highly possible. And we have a capital for it. We should forget modernize around 17 billion dollar of capital, which is an incredible number for biotech company in only 10 years old. And so we are already accelerating. And I think that from a manufacturing standpoint as we discuss, we have a very broad commercial network. And then in the countries, we are today presenting 11 markets, the top 11 markets in terms of EBITM margin around the world. We're opening another 10 countries this year. And so we're going to be basically presenting most countries and we're not directly present. We're going to use distributors. And so I do think modernize is getting ready to compete with last players that we have done in the vaccine front. If you look at it, you know, G&J had a vaccine, you know, number of other vaccine, you know, AstraZeneca had a vaccine. And at the end of the day, the MRN technology showed the superiority of a product. And they have a need to update the product with a variant very quickly, which is why MRN is the factor of technology now for COVID. So talk to me about the COVID market now. You're still in it. But first of all the sensors information ability",https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=z4hExsMyQNo,12,2022-10-17 14:49:18
3406," the products we've learned very quickly. She's way emanated. The fact of technology now fought for it. So talk to me about the COVID market. Now you're still in it. It's still a significant portion of revenues, right? So you do have to still pay attention to that. Talk to me about the global market. You just mentioned all the countries you're in. I know there's also a lot of focus on the health equity aspect. And Moderna has a track record of slowing down clinical trials to ensure equity to opening up the doors for the mRNA hub in Africa. And also distributing low-tiered prices. So how do you see the company now with all these other candidates playing within that same realm? Do you see this continuation? And do you have the room to continue distributing to low- and middle-income countries as well? Sure. I mean, does that great question? So first, the commitment of Moderna has to fight COVID forever. Because as you know, the virus is not living the planet is unconditional. We believe we have a massive public health responsibility to always update the vaccine, to bring the best possible science to protect people. We believe people are going to need once a year of booster. As you know, this year, it's a virus. It has two mRNA in the doors. But if in the future, we need three mRNA, four mRNA to give the breadth of coverage, we would do so. That is the commitment. And then as we discuss, we're going to combine this with the global vaccine, which is through and over respiratory virus, to make it easier for people to get strong growth protection against many viruses. So to reduce healthcare costs, as we know, when you go to get different vaccination, the cost of administration is a big part. In some hospitals, it's actually higher than the cost of a vaccine. So I think there's a big role we can do there. And in terms of low-income countries, we actually, this morning, we have announced an extension of our partnership with COVAX, what one is running for it. COVAX is available at cost for low-income countries, as you know, the planet in Kenya, that Moderna is building. We've all kept it up, it's yet another proof of our commitments to low-income countries. And so we want the products to be available to people around the world, not only people in America. I'm glad you brought that up. I saw that announcement. And I wonder when it comes to the mRNA platform, let's let me get nerdy with you for a second here. The mRNA platform does have that quick, very strong efficacy that we saw, but also does win. As do most protection, we do see that with the antibody titers. But is this something that you are looking at? Is it something that needs to be changed or tweaked about the platform to give longer, maybe more stable protection? Or is this just how the technology works? So I think we should not forget with COVAX, which is the virus has changed a lot. And if you remember, when the virus was rotating very slowly, that Alpine Demtile 2021, you saw great performance of a vaccine. We should not forget that we've all made from the genetic drift was so gigantic in only one step that I think no vaccine, no technology would have been able to hold efficacy of infection strongly. Because it's thing to antibodies, and antibodies when we've time, that is not linked to mRNA, that is linked to all immune system as humans. The pitat is very important to see is that despite the lowering of efficacy against infection, the efficacy against hospitalization and deaths are still very, very important. And that's because, as we believe, there is very strong T cell immune memory components in terms of technology. So I think it's a bit like flu. You need to get a new flu shot, not because the protein technology is not good. I believe it is really good. But because it's a different virus, and so you need to radicate your immune system for these different virus, especially if you are high-risk. Again, a 25-year-old who doesn't get an annual flu shot, are they gonna die? If they have no common PT, highly unlikely. But a 60-year-old person that has a commodity factor needs their booster, because their antibody is a very important component of their protection. Right, so I'm so glad you brought up the annual flu shots, because we know that people's, the one question that everyone has is, is the code vaccine going to become that? Is it going to be an annual COVID booster for a very long time to come, or maybe for the rest of our lives? And how do you, you know, how do you merge that...",https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=z4hExsMyQNo,13,2022-10-17 14:53:24
3407," going to be an annual COVID booster for a very long time to come or maybe for the rest of our lives. And how do you, you know, how do you merge that with the fact that there's already low uptake of this new variant booster? So I think it's interesting. The uptake is actually stronger than a seasonal clue from the data I've seen recently. So we have to see to the end of a season what does it look like? It's a first time when the beam going in and then it's setting, then the pandemic setting. So I think we'll be smarter in a more fortu. But the correct data surely is a better uptake than the seasonal flu shot. And I think it's going to be a flu, which is, again, if you're 25 or you need an annual booster every year, if you're healthy, you might want it to protect over people, you might want it because you don't want to get sick and miss work or miss vacation or so. But I think it's going to be very similar to flu, where the kids are with people at high risk, people above 50 years of age, people with comorbidity, people with cancer and other conditions, you have transplant. And that's really important to think about. And if you look at it around the world, that is 1.5 billion people. So it's a lot of people that's going to need an annual booster and people that are younger, going to have to decide for themselves what they want to do. I mean, the example I always use is myself, you know, I've been taking a flu shot for the last 20 years, you know, I just found 50. So my first is in my fourth is I took an annual flu shot. Is it because I was worried or being hospitalized? Of course not. I just didn't want to be sick. I wanted to be able to work. And I believe that the best thing we can all do in medicine is prevention. And vaccine is one of most amazing. I've got to we were happy. So I took a vaccine against flu. So I didn't get sick. And so I could, you know, have a normal life and work and take my medication. Do you want my friends to tell me something we all want to be able to do, especially during the holidays? CEO of Moderna, Stefan Benzell. Thank you again for joining us today. Thank you for being in the vision. Coming up, he's finances Dr. Doom, famed economist, Noriel Rabini joins us next with his take on the state of the global economy.",https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=z4hExsMyQNo,14,2022-10-17 14:57:19
3408," Yyhh h claps H o H a e music. Nureel Rabini is a best selling author and economics professor at New York University's Stern School of Business. He doesn't consider himself a pessimist, that his warnings about global economies have earned him the nickname Dr. Doom. And Rubini's predictions have been spot on. Among other events, he foresaw the global financial crisis of 07 and 08. Because he's been so right, everyone from pundits to policymakers wants to hear what he has to say. As the New York Times put it, he's the seer who sees it coming. Rubini's new book, Megathrex, is sounding the alarm about the next great crisis, which he says could be bigger than anything we've seen before. Noriel, great to see you. Congratulations on the new book. I guess Megathrex, a little bit gloomy and doomy, but realistic as you like to say. You have 10 Megathrex that we're facing. And I want to get into all of them. But I was struck by the very last two sentences of the book, which says, fast in your seatbelts, it's going to be a bumpy ride through a very dark night. So just collectively, is the picture right now really that bad? Well, I just spent the last few days in Washington for the annual meetings of the International Monetary Fund and the World Bank. And there are people literally starting to talk about the risk of World War III, literally, because we are in a geopolitical depression. One of the many Megathrex in the book is one that we have now a confrontation between US and the West on one side. And a number of revisionist powers. It's not just Russia, it's China, it's Iran, North Korea, and even Pakistan and effect is an ally. They're essentially challenging the economic, social, and geopolitical order that the US and Europe and the West created after World War II. We have a Cold War, and there's a chapter of the book about the new Cold War. But there is right now that this Cold War eventually ends up into a hot war. There's already a hot war in Russia and Ukraine. This conflict can escalate and get NATO, the US, and allies involved. It's a risk. Russia is seriously threatening using tactical nuclear weapons. The negotiation between the US and Iran on the new pill.",https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=z4hExsMyQNo,16,2022-10-17 15:04:04
3409," NATO, the US, and allies involved its risk. Russia is a seriously threatening using tactical nuclear weapons. The negotiation between the US and Iran on the nuclear deal are not going anywhere, and Israel is saying if they're going to become nuclear and they're one step away from it, we're going to attack them. We'll have another major shock. And look at what's happening between US and China on the South and its China Sea and Taiwan and so on. We are also, unfortunately, in a collision course with China. So right now, as a Cold War, it's getting colder. And economic consequences are severe. De-globalization, decoupling, fragmentation of the global economy, decoubalization, vulcanization of global supply chains, trading goods, in services, in movement of labor, capital, technology, that information is going to be split. Where it divided world, and there will be a world in which it will be more inflation, less economic growth. Because instead of producing the most efficient parts of the world, we're now talking about French-oring, about secure trade rather than free trade. That is a fairly gloomy picture. And there are 10 megathrefts in your book. Let's talk about economics, so for a stagflation, which, of course, is inflation and a stagnant economy at the same time, which we saw in the 1970s. But you said that what we're going to be going into right now makes that look like a walk in the park. Why is that? Well, we are having, like in the 70s, a number of negative supply shocks. Three of them, currently. One was the COVID shock, the light to a shutdown of economic activity, bottlenecks in global supply chains, reduction in the labor supply, and so on. Second one was the Russian invasion of Ukraine. The light to a spike in energy prices, food, fertilizers, industrial metals. And third one, this year is the continuation of the zero tolerance COVID policy of China. Those have led to a reduction in growth and increase of cost of production. And we've lost monetary and fiscal policy of cause inflation, and now a sharp sludano growth, where it was a recession. However, in the book, what I point out is that the era of great moderation, where growth was OK, inflation low, 2%, is over. And now we're going towards an era of what I call great, stucfulationary, and that instability and crisis. On the supply side, there's not just the three negative supply shocks. In the book, I identify 11 other ones that are more medium-long term. They're going to reduce potential growth and increase cost of production, just to be brief. First of all, de-globalization and protectionism. Secondly, reshoring or manufacturing from locusts, China to high cost European US. French-shoring. Three, ageing of population, not only advanced economies, but also in major emerging markets like China, like Russia, like South Korean, so on. Young people produce and save and consume less. Older people don't produce and dissafe. That's inflationary. Four, we are having restriction to migration. In the past migration from South to North, from Puerto Ritch was keeping a lead on wage growth. Fifth, we have de-caplicated the US and China. Six, a broader geopolitical depression. Seven, we have now climate change. And in many ways, creates a reduction in growth and increases the cost of food, of water, of energy, and a few else and so on. Additionally, we have other shocks. We have cyber-warfare. We have pandemics going to be coming more frequent and more virulent because of climate change. Climate change causes more zonal diseases. And finally, we have a backlash against liberal democracy and populism of extreme right on the left because there is a rise in income and wealth inequality. Autoritarian, aggressive autocrats, populists of the right on the left are coming to power. They blame the rest of the world and they go to war like that in Russia. We're also weaponizing the US dollar as a tool of national security and foreign policy that all the system of the global international monetary system is breaking down and that's going to lead to more friction, more cost of production, less economic growth. So on the supply side, these are 11 factors that are medium-long term and on the demand side where under a mountain of debt, not just public debt, but also private debt. This is a debt trap. So central banks have no option by monetizing these fiscal deficits. And like in the 70s, we have negative supply shock. We monetize fiscal deficit, we end up with inflation, recession, stagnation. But we end up also with debt crisis. Why so? In the 70s, we had negative supply shocks, but debt ratios in advance economies were low. So we didn't have a debt crisis. After the global financial crisis, whether debt crisis, mortgage, rate value,",https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=z4hExsMyQNo,16,2022-10-17 15:07:01
3410," We had negative supply shocks, but that ratio in advanced economies were low. So we didn't have a debt crisis. After the global financial crisis, we had a debt crisis, mortgage debt, housing banks, but we had a negative demand shock and a credit crime. So we had deflation. So we could have massive monotony fiscal easing. Today, we have the worst of the 70s. We've negative supply shocks and the worst of the post-GFC period where we have right now that ratio that are higher than ever in history. Let me ask you a question. We have a staff stationary debt crisis. Right. Often recessions or downturns are caused by a lack of demand, but you're saying that this could be caused by supply constraints. Is that correct? How unusual is that? Well, in the 1970s, we had two negative supply shocks. One was the young people were between Israel and the Arab states that led to a spike in all prices. In 1973, the second one was the arena revolution that led to a spike in all prices. This time around, the spike is not just in all prices. Is in all prices, is in natural gas, is in food, is in fertilizer, is in industrial metals, is in the region. Samey conductors, global supply chains have bottled next, they've not been resolved. The zero tolerance policy of China is leading further to this supply bottle next. And as I pointed out, these are just in the short run, Russia Ukraine, COVID-China. There are 11 other forces, there are medium-long term that are all of them also negative supply shocks, reducing growth, increasing the cost of reduction. We've lost monetary and fiscal policy, they lead to inflation, recession, therefore stagnation. Now, another problem you see out there, also an opportunity, is artificial intelligence. A lot of people are pinning a lot of hope on AI, but you see potential downside there. Yes. The downsides are the dual AI machine learning, robotic automation, increases the economic pie potentially, it also leads to losses of jobs of labour income. And initially people thought will be only routine jobs that are mechanical, like some kind of low-value-out-and-look-color jobs. But increasing right now, even cognitive jobs that can be divided in a number of tasks are also being automated. And even creative jobs, that are now AI's we can create actually a script of a movie, or make a poem, or write art, or paint, or even a piece of music that soon enough is going to be top 10 in the Billboard magazine chart. We're getting to a point in which AI is going to disrupt massively also some jobs. This is giving one example. It's only a matter of time until we're going to have autonomous vehicles. It's great, because there are about 300,000 people who die every year of car accidents, two million web series injuries. If we can even reduce that by 99%, social is a great thing. But you have what, five million Uber and Lyft drivers, five million trackers and Timster, their jobs are going to be gone for good, which kind of jobs they're going to get. Initially people have in agriculture, then they move into industry, then they move into services. Now, most of the automation is occurring in services, including transportation. Let me ask you about de-globalization, because it seems to be a big theme. And obviously there's a lot of authoritarian regimes in the world, which are cutting off the WTO, all those agreements. Why is that? What is it in the human being's mindset that goes from democracy to authoritarian and back and forth that seems over time? What does that happen? First of all, there is a backlash against globalization, because globalization led to benefits, the economic pie grew. But like technology, it led to winners and losers. And we did not compensate or give new jobs to the losers. Also people in low-value-added industry, but now even services are losing their jobs in income. That's why there's a backlash. They're also environmental issues. Now there is geopolitics, like French-oring and security trade and so on and so on. I think that they rise of these authoritarian regimes of extreme right and left. And by the way, Putin in Russia is Erdogan in Turkey, is Kazin in Poland, is urban in Hungary, is melonian out in Italy, is this Swedish Democrats right now that just won in Sweden, is the Brexit decision. It was on the right, of course, the election of Trump. And there are also populists of the left. In Argentina, there used to be populists of the left in Venezuela. But in the last year in Peru, in Chile and Colombia.",https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=z4hExsMyQNo,17,2022-10-17 15:10:41
3411," The election of Trump, and there are also populists of the left. In Argentina, there used to be populists of the left. In Venezuela, but in the last year, in Peru, in Chile, in Colombia, and most likely in the elections in Brazil, populists of the extreme left are going to come to power. I think that it's driven mostly by economic malice. When there is a rise in income and wealth inequality, and we've seen it across the world, in advance, it's emerging markets, those who are left behind, and it doesn't matter whether they vote for the right or the left, those who vote for the right are usually socially and religiously conservative, those who vote for the left tend to be liberal. But on economic issues, they're nativists, they're nationalists, they're against migration, they're against free markets, they're against the forces of economic reform. Why? Because they're left behind, and they blame the elites, economic, financial, political, for leaving them behind. That's why there is a severe economic reason behind this backlash against liberal democracy, and extreme populists who are the right on the left. But as we know, populists who are the right on the left doesn't lead to economic opportunity. Eventually, it's to inflation, stagnation, and financial disaster and default. How were it should we be about the US-China relationship? It's a very serious issue. I believe that we are already for sure in a cold war, and we'll have a decoupling between US and China, trade in goods, in services, in the movement of labor, of capital, investments, but more importantly, right now, everything that's important is to do with technology, data, and information that is from a national security point of view, severe and important. So the decoupling is occurring. The cold war between US and China in terms of overall political and geopolitical relations is becoming worse. And the reason why Xi Jinping right now is seeking a third time and possibly a fourth is not because he wants to pass to a history as the man who reformed China, is because he wants to pass to a history as the man that united in England with Taiwan. So I believe the next five to 10 years is going to be the time where there's going to be a confrontation between US and China on the issue of Taiwan, and that could be a trigger of this cold war becoming a hot war. We don't know whether it's going to happen, how's it going to be resolved, but that's where we get to World War III, among other things. But in some sense, World War III has already started, it's started in Ukraine, because this conflict has broadening implications that are going well beyond Russian Ukraine. And it's the beginning of something else. You didn't mention climate change, so I'm assuming you're not worried about that. Well, there's a full chapter about an unhabitable planet, about climate change. And it's a long discussion, but there's a lot of talk about doing something about climate change. There's a lot of talk about ESG investment, environmental, social and governance and so on. But reality is a lot of it is greenwashing. A lot of it is green wishing. A lot of it is green fig leaves, or people would say we're going to do something, governments, firms, individual. They're doing nothing. Glass will and cop was a total failure. At the current level, we're headed towards an increase of temperature by the end of the century of three degrees. Even two will be a disaster. Three means that half of the world will be in places that are either underwater or too hot to live. And if you worry about a few hundred thousand migrants from Central America moving here, wait until they be. Not a few hundred thousand, but millions or billions of people who have to move from places that you cannot live to other parts of the world. That's going to be an economic and financial disaster. All these mega threats, scenario. Yes. What can we do about them? Well, in the book, after they 10 chapters, when I discussed them one by one, in each one of them there are solutions, there are two paths for the future. One is dystopian and the other one, what I call utopian or less dystopian. In the dystopian one, of course, all these things feed on each other and there's an interaction between each other and them. And then we end up into essentially disaster. We can destroy each other with a nuclear war, with geopolitical collapse, with climate change, with financial meltdowns, with collapse of liberal democracy, with pandemics and you name it. There is another path in which we have policies, the national level, and international levels slowly, slowly resolve this problem and therefore the future. Maybe it's not utopian, but we avoid the disaster. It's still a challenged future. It's one that has lots of trouble, but we manage it. However, in the epilogue of the book, after this 11-12 chapter, I say from my point of view, I believe that the dystopian one, as of now, is more likely than the utopian. So the utopian, of course, the bizarre...",https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=z4hExsMyQNo,18,2022-10-17 15:15:17
3412," After this 12, 11, 12 chapter, I say from my point of view, I believe that the dystopian one, as of now, is more likely than the utopian. So the utopian, of course, is the desirable one. The question is whether it's a political will, domestically, internationally, to cooperate, and collaborate, to avoid an incoming, meltdown, and disaster. I fear not. Quick, two-part last question. What do you think of the nickname, Dr. Doom, which is what people call you, number one? And number two, are you ever optimistic? First of all, I usually say that Dr. Realist, not Dr. Doom, but is more catchy than we call Dr. Doom. And I think that warning about the risk is very important. Because until now, we've been kicking the count down the road. We've been sticking our head under the sun like Austria. And right now, we're facing major, megatrade, economic, monetary, financial, social, political, geopolitical, environmental, health, trade, and technological. And unless we address them, we're headed towards disaster. So it's worth to have people like myself who warn you about the risk. And for every problem, there is a solution. But at this point, we cannot keep on kicking the hand down the road, reaching the point in which these things are going to materialize in a way in which not only in the next 10 years, each one of these megatrades that I discuss about the next decade is materializing today. If you look at one by one, that inflation, stagnation, environment, geopolitics, pandemics, and generalize things that happen today. So we have to worry about it today, not about the future. No, Yel Roubini. Thank you so much for joining us. Coming up, new challenges present new opportunities. How Yahoo CEO Jim Landzone plans to take this internet pioneer into the future?",https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=z4hExsMyQNo,19,2022-10-17 15:19:54
3413," vi Me you Jim Lenzone is the CEO of Yahoo. With more than 20 years of leadership experience in technology and media, he's built a track record of driving growth and innovation. In a world where internet companies come and go, Lenzone's big opportunities for Yahoo, which is still one of the most popular websites nearly 30 years after it was founded. Before coming to Yahoo, Lenzone served as CEO of Tinder, the highest-grossing non-gaming app in the world. He was also president and CEO of CBS Interactive and the first Chief Digital Officer in the history of CBS. And let's welcome Jim Lenzone into the Yahoo Finance. You're first time. First time? First time? I'm a rookie. I'm glad to finally be here. Downstairs from my office. Welcome. We work in the same building. Don't always get you down here. As we just pointed out, you have been at the helm of some major companies that I think a lot of viewers are familiar with. CBS Interactive Tinder-as-G's if we want to go back. But I want to start with a company that I think some viewers may not be as familiar with, which is E-Tour. And that is of course a startup that you founded back in the 90s. And it was right in the middle of the.com boom. And I want to start there because I get the sense in looking through a lot of your interviews that your experience in the.com boom, the Intu-In Crash, has really informed a lot of how you think about operating these companies. So my question to you is how do you think about that period of time? And knowing what you experienced then, how do you view what's happening today, especially in the Tech Landscape? Yeah, I mean it really is a great question. And again, I want to say I love being down here. It's great to finally be here. And hey, we follow Dr. Doom. So we can spin this. And we're positive. But you know, look, that definitely informed it. I was one of the co-founders. I wasn't even, I wasn't the CEO. I was like the product guy co-founder of E-Tour, which by the way was not a travel company. It was touring the web. It was like a search and navigation company that was founded in 1998. So a long time ago. And we went.",https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=z4hExsMyQNo,20,2022-10-17 15:23:57
3414, company was touring the web. It was like a search and navigation company that was founded in 1998. So a long time ago and we went way up and way down. Raised $50 million when that was a lot of money and almost went public and then the market crashed and we crashed and it's heartbreaking to put your in that company. We found out a business school. I mean I never really had had a real job before doing that. I'd just been an intern and so you know you put your heart and your soul and people trust you and believe in you and it's it sucks to go through that and that that crash which you know more movies should be made about that time period but certainly informs it because you know you first of all I learned a lot that I know about product management and how to manage internet companies that help me later on. A lot of hands-on experience and then yeah going through that which then happened again in 2008 happened again 2020 happened again this year and you know what I would say is every one of them is different you know if you kind of look at the causation of each one of these right you can't really equate the you know the dot com boom and crash to covid and what happened with the world shutting down or the global financial crisis or now which is kind of an instant combination of both they're all unique they're all different but certainly and we could talk about it some of the ways that that could inform both opportunities and challenges. Yeah I mean let's talk about that a bit more what do you see as the parallels that are there and how does what you experience in the 90s kind of inform what you're seeing today? Yeah and again I think you know I it's ironic but after that startup I wind up at Ask Jeaves which we then which was a public company we then sold at IEC in 2005 I became CEO right after that and was there for a long time when I left I then actually got funding to do another startup and the market crashed again two weeks after that so right in the heart of me getting funding and what I'd say in both situations and I think it's a parallel for today is first of all if you're an existing company you know one that has been through the boom and raised money during the boom evaluations that were pretty rosy and you know you went through hiring and perks for your company and probably you know easier on the revenue side because other companies weren't going through those challenges you have to really reevaluate quickly and get those costs of control kind of reevaluate you know how you view your market and your valuation you know in a lot of cases if you're a public company you know again it's it's easy to sit there and think about the way things were and and and operate that way that I think the companies that adapt the most quickly if you're an existing company are you know are the ones that are going to make it through I think Bill Gurley who was one of my investors at a clicker which was my second startup said it right a couple weeks ago he said you know this is this is the best time to get funded as a company and I agree you know if you look at every one of these crash periods those are when some of the best companies have been born or when early stage ones could make it through the gauntlet you know then the rewards and the other side of that are great I actually know that leads us to Yahoo but I think we're in a very similar situation here so let's talk about Yahoo obviously you're the CEO you're a big boss this is a brand that's gone through many iterations started in the early 90s co-founded by Jerry Yang it was a search engine since then it's grown many tentacles into content we've got Yahoo news obviously Yahoo finance Yahoo sports when you look at it today how do you define the Yahoo brand well coming in from the outside the great thing is that you're not tied to the past so and I always say this about about this opportunity and I just passed my one year anniversary here but if you didn't know what it was called and I think the brand has a lot of strength I had somebody pre-promote and tell me a couple weeks ago he thinks the brand is worth as much as Apollo paid for all of Yahoo so you know there's a lot we have to do to earn that but it is I think a great brand that has a lot of goodwill if we treat it right things can happen but the truth is if you were to come in today and just look at it objectively without the brand you would say,https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=z4hExsMyQNo,21,2022-10-17 15:27:44
3415," has a lot of goodwill if we treat it right, things can happen. But the truth is if you were to come in today and just look at it objectively without the brand, you would say hundreds of millions of users doing billions of revenue that's very profitable and is pretty entrenched in the various verticals in which it's strong, right? Top two in email, sports, news, finance, and these are amazing categories. We have a huge advertising business for one of the biggest ad sales forces on the internet. We have a real ad tech behind the scenes. There's a lot of other things we haven't even talked about, including AOL, which again in my past I've learned how things like that, which is even older than Yahoo, it's very, very profitable. If you were to take an objective look at those assets, you would say that's an amazing investment opportunity, given the fact that we've been spun out of Verizon, we're private again, and that allows you to do the things you need to do behind the scenes to improve it. And if I were to look at again objectively, I'd say it's not, I think one of the things people can mistake about Yahoo is thinking of it as one thing. You've said you hate the question whether it's a media company or a tech company, a concept company, but there are a lot of people who are saying what defines Yahoo, right? It's a product company. Email is a product. We still are in search and one of the top three players in search, that's a product. Yahoo Finance. Content is one of the products that we offer on Yahoo Finance, stock charts, information, these information sets that we provide to allow somebody to become a better investor. Those are all product features. I do think at the core we have media, technology enables literally all of it, but at the end of the day we are a product company, vertical by vertical. I look at the brand independently as well. Yahoo Finance is a very strong brand, one of the best, and one with some of the most traffic in the finance vertical. So does Bloomberg, so does Dow Jones, so does CNBC. That's very different than Yahoo Sports with the SPN, or it's very different than news or email versus Gmail. So as a brand I think about them pre-independently, will they get woven together at a larger level? Yes. Are the days gone when you think of it as a portal? Yes. So you mentioned some numbers here. I know you like to highlight this a lot, 900 million users, talking about Yahoo assets, billions of dollars in revenue, you talk about the profitability, and yet I know over the last year you have been asked over and over what the turnaround story looks like. Why do you think it's been defined as that if those numbers are there? Probably because it hasn't historically been successful at point that off. Again, I think the bar changes. I think what the team in the 2000s were dealing with was coming on the heels of a decision you could not reverse, which was giving search to Google, and literally paying them to do it, to do it. And then the aftermath of that, and trying to figure out what the business could be. Again, you were talking a much bigger company, which with much more to lose at that point. You had to turn around and attempt into 2010s again, and not just Yahoo, but the AOL properties as well. That all got solved in a way by being brought inside of a horizon for five years. And so our team comes in at a very different spot. What I do know is that this has all of the bones of a great turnaround opportunity. As I know it, as I've been through them before, a ton of traffic and very important monetizable categories with being number one or number two in those categories. Those are things I can work with. We can put great teams against that, reinvigorate these products, which certainly needed in a lot of these ways. There are reasons why these things are number one or number two. There's also reasons why it hasn't totally fulfilled its potential in each one of these. So that you can work with. And coming from where we're coming from now, coming out, is an incredible investment opportunity for those who have been behind it. And it's why, in this case, I ran towards the fire to want to do this. Because people have asked me, what is the thing that surprised you the most about about?",https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=z4hExsMyQNo,22,2022-10-17 15:32:08
3416, you know in this case i ran towards the fire uh... to want to do this because you know people ask me you know what is the uh... thing that surprised you the most about about yahu and they've asked me continually and it's been the same two things number one is how many people are rooting for us you know i think in this world people want for whatever reason they would love to see you have to be successful still this isn't a brand people are rooting against they may wonder whether we can do it that's a different story but i think they would love to see us do it and the others is that in a lot of ways it's not a turnaround you know turns are in trouble that this company isn't really good financial position uh... and has amazing assets so let's talk about the strategy that you have put in place uh... you've you've added maybe she's a shake shaken up the structure of it right individual assets now have their own general managers that's what have been the first thing we have seen the changes or inside baseball but you've also talked about seeing a spin-off in these individual brands that you think that they can stand alone and i can help but think that if you think about you know sort of that that the major you know tech companies and i know you don't want to define you as just a tech company but you'll get somebody like an alphabet or somebody you know like a meta they've got multiple brands that have sort of come together what why think about them separately and why that the idea of going towards that well let's work backwards first of all i think they think about them separately they weave them together again youtube is woven into google but those are two different teams to different brands instagram and facebook and now the the vr side these are all in the individual divisions run by general managers season is an amazing cio runs youtube uh... with neal uh... that's very different than the team running you know google kind of dot com uh... or the cloud business with with thomas so this so amazon is very much the same way and so if something about yahu are people want to think about it at that you know it's got to do with the history of it being a portal think of it as one thing certainly the brand is consistent in this case but i think and that story could take care of itself but the the first step is to work in them individually now if you do that and i'm not worried about it so the the notion of what we do with these things will they all go public together will they all live together will they spin off those are all things we have the option to do uh... but i don't think about them because i've still feel like i just got here and we want to our team wants to be the one to create this value uh... and create them across the board so i think these are all investment opportunities uh... the the end game for each of them is is something we don't think about yet one and on a uh... a personal question because in prepping for this looked at a lot of your interviews and correct me if i'm wrong but i get the sense that you like being the underdog you have a bit of a chip on your shoulder so my question to you is what whatever you want to define yahu as let's call it a turnaround story that's what people are saying what do you have to prove by building out yahu to where you want it to be it's interesting i'd say of the things that i was i could have done i would say in a way they may be would have been more in the realm of something i could have proven in this case this is something i've done a few times before we my teams have been so very successful doing them we have we have great people we've met great people here as well brought in new people that we didn't work before i'm loving the way the team here is shaping up i love being a part of that right the two things i love to come to work to do are to build great products and have a great team and of great people who love working together and if you can do those two things with an asset that has the ability to be invested in the right way and create upside-off opportunity i love doing that you know there's not a day when i don't love getting up and coming to do this uh... there's not a day when i've angst about whether we can do this i have anxiety sometimes about just the amount of things you have to do but that's different right there's no question to me that this is doable and so yeah look what i had a uh... another CEO as a compliment call me a journeyman the other time i've got to go because i've been to you know several different internet companies at this point and doing this twenty five years uh... but for me i know it when i'd i'd see that you know that uh... that opportunity and and so uh... you know that that passes all the right i'm not afraid of being the underdog and i do kind of you know like it that's,https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=z4hExsMyQNo,23,2022-10-17 15:36:43
3417, you know that that opportunity and and so you know that that past is always there and I'm not afraid of being the underdog and I do kind of you know like it it's easier than being or sorry it's harder than being just somebody on the rocket ship and you know it's going to go anyway whether you're there or not you know I'd like to make a difference the people I work with feel feel the same way so I think about it probably a little more like that Jim Lazone thank you so much for joining us today.

Hai 이� съbig adjoent works for the Norway Global turnover and comparable draws on the momentum and still since the start of the year. S&P coming off its fourth down week in the past five trading weeks. We just got another hot inflation print for the month of September. Help us make sense of where things stand today. Well, Shana, first of all, thank you for having me. Today it's a pleasure to be here in the studio with you. Finally. Finally. So great to be here. And yes, it's been a really tough time for investors. But I think a little perspective is helpful during times like this. And you know, as you noted, we're in a bear market doubtless. But we've been here before. And if you look back at history, you know, over the last 100 years, we've had 26 bear markets. We've had 14 since World War II. We've had three since the year 2000. So in some ways, this is uncomfortable, but familiar territory. And we know bear markets end. The average bear market lasted about a year. We entered into this bear market in June. So, you know, perhaps we're hitting the mid-mark of the average. The backdrop certainly matters. And you know, more severe bear markets tend to take place with more systematic risks or deep recessions. We don't see either of those things. And so I do think that kind of history is important. And it also is important to look at returns. And as you noted, of course, we've had a very tough time for equities. Equities fall anywhere between sort of 20 and 40% in bear markets. We're just over 20% today. But we also know that during bear markets, there tends to be a lot of volatility. And there tends to be a lot of updates. And we, today's a good example. We had a couple of examples last week where we have these incredible rallies in the middle of a bear market. So I do think investors should have some historical perspective. And then perhaps take a deep breath because although it's really tempting to try to time investing over a bear market cycle, gosh, when you see those numbers ripping up and down, you feel like you should do something. Unfortunately, the best, but most uncomfortable thing to do is to do nothing because we have these great days in the market that are quickly followed by some tough days. And they all happen in the middle of a bear market. And you know, Shana, I was thinking this morning, over half of the best days of the market happen in a bear market. So again, I think it highlights the perils of trying to time markets and the risk that you're going to be out of the market on those best days. And they think real damage that can do to your return over even a 10-year period. It certainly is important not to time the market here. Before we get more into that, though, Katie, when you take a look at current valuations, S&P, like you mentioned, on more than 20% here to date, NASDAQ down more than 30%. Here to date, you mentioned the fact that you don't see a deep recession on the horizon. Do you think though we are at risk of a recession? And what does that potentially look like? Certainly, Shana. I mean, I think absolutely we can...",https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=z4hExsMyQNo,25,2022-10-17 15:45:23
3419," And what does that potentially look like? Certainly, Shana. I mean, I think absolutely we can anticipate a period of economic softness here. And I do think the definition of recession sort of ebbs and flows. But let's just say for the record, a period of economic softening is what we anticipate for 2023. But I think that you mentioned valuation. And that's really, really important. Because if you think about this particular bear market, it kind of is in two phases. The first phase is very much evaluation driven experience. And interestingly, you even mentioned like the NASDAQ and then the S&P. The NASDAQ is the growthiest index. The S&P is also a pretty growthy index. And they're very sensitive to changes in interest rates. We know the market is a discounting mechanism. And when you have a higher discount rate, you have a lower present value. So the growthiest NASDAQ was hit the hardest. The S&P's been hit pretty hard too. And valuation contraction has been more than 100% of the market downturn this year. Earnings have been up. So all of what we've seen this year has been a contraction in valuations. That's phase one. The second phase is related to your question about a recession. And that is what's going to happen to the E of the price to earnings, the earnings. And we think earnings are probably going to be soft in 2023. We have an estimate far below what Wall Street analysts have right now. We think they're just a little bit too optimistic on the go forward view given the fact that we are entering a soft period. And Katie, what is your estimate on earnings? And why do you think Wall Street is a little bit too optimistic at this point? So I mean, we've seen corporations, US large corporations, be incredibly resilient in the face of an incredible amount of headwinds. We've had higher rates, we've had pandemics, we've had problems in getting workers back to work. Despite that fact, we have had pretty good earnings and I think everyone was sort of waiting with baited breath for the shoot to drop in the second quarter. And it didn't. We had a good second quarter. Estimates have come down to the third quarter, but the third quarter might shape up to be pretty decent too. So I think Wall Street analysts are just building off those kinds of estimates. But for us, with the softer growth outlook in 2023 and the fact that the S&P 500 has about 40% of their revenues tied to overseas growth. We just think those headwinds are pretty strong and we come in sort of around $228 for S&P earnings for next year. And you mentioned that statistic there, 40% of revenue coming from overseas. That of course brings up the strong dollar, the risk of the challenge that that poses for companies here. How are you assessing that risk and I guess how long do you see that risk lasting here? Because it doesn't seem like anything is going to take some of that strength out of the dollar anytime soon. Well, you're right to bring up the dollar as they say our currency, your problem. And it has been a significant problem for US corporations overseas. And also for the translation of non-US investments back to US dollar terms for our investors and for our clients. Developed markets, XUS have outperformed the US on local currency terms. But when you translate it back to the dollar, it's been a huge headwind. So what could stop the dollar? Well, what propelled the dollar has been a very aggressive Fed coming out first and very aggressively with this rate hike path that has been extremely front-end loaded to face inflationary pressures. We think we're closer to the end of the policy tightening. We'll probably see the last rate hike in early 2023. And we also see inflation coming off the boil. Those two things should help to stabilize the dollar. So we don't anticipate we're going to see the kind of strength that has created these headwinds in 2023. You mentioned inflation coming off the boil to put it in your terms. Do you think we have seen inflation peak? So inflation has so many dimensions. And many of them, particularly the ones that were really pressured because of COVID, have been abating supply chain constraints have come off. We see prices coming down and use cars. I mean, we're all talking about use cars these days. It's a pretty important price barometer. So we see inventories that price is down. And some of the things that have been really impacted by COVID. So generally speaking, we do see inflation coming down. We saw an empire state manufacturing survey this morning that had some interesting insight on prices coming down where we are still concerned, though, is in wages. And also, frankly, in owners equivalent rent, these two pieces of inflation.",https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=z4hExsMyQNo,26,2022-10-17 15:49:49
3420," insight on prices coming down where we are still concerned though is in wages. And also frankly in owners equivalent rent, these two pieces of inflation are sticky. Owners equivalent rent we can all see that prices have stabilized and have come down, but it takes a while to get that through the inflation pipeline. So we're not going to see the benefits of that until well into 2023. And wages have stabilized but at a high level. So we do see lots of inflation elements coming down and we are watching really closely what happens to wages because that's going to really dictate what happens to CPI and core CPI and core PCE in 2023. Yeah, the last jobs print that we got inflation or excuse me, wages were moving to the upside. Unemployment rate actually went down. So even though we did see a little bit of cooling in that headline number, those two factors were really something that a hawkish Fed obviously would keep a very close eye on what your assessment just of the jobs market and how substantially we need to see maybe some of that growth begin to cool in order to get inflation under control. You're absolutely right. It's economics 101. We have more demand for labor than we have supply and it's really shocking actually to look at the numbers. When you look at the Joltz data at over 10 million job openings and then you look at the number of unemployed people in the US at around 7 and a half million, there's just a mismatch. So yes, the ultimate soft landing would be slowing demand enough that the brunt of that is felt on the opening side. So companies just freeze hiring versus actually increasing unemployment. That's a pretty tough needle to thread. It's, yeah, certainly is a very tough needle to thread. Kady, I want to go back to what you said earlier when you were just talking about you gathered some data I know on the cost of panicking pulling out, pulling your money out of the market in a volatile time like this. What can you tell us about that and why it's so important to stay invested through uncertain times? I know, it's so important always but more important during volatile times. If you missed just the best 10 days out of the last 10 years, so you're talking 2500 days, your return went down by 40%. If you missed 20 of the best days, it went down by 2 thirds. So there's a really high cost of missing out. And as I said before, we tend to see very strong days of the market during bear markets and the really tough time for investors. And again, it goes back to market time. It's always difficult. But it's really difficult during these times of high volatility and bear markets. The reason is the best days and the worst days tend to clump together. So you're never going to get it right because you're going to have a terrible day followed by a great day. So the best advice, the best guidance for investors, especially during times like this, is stay the course, stick with your strategy. Make sure that your equity risk, that your risk assets are aligned to your longer term goal. So you don't have to worry about short-term volatility, but you really need to stick to your strategy or your risk missing out. So you don't want to try and tie in the market. You don't want to panic and pull your money out. You mentioned strategy there. Where are you seeing the most opportunity today? So it's really interesting because I do think it's an opportunity right now for investors to rethink fixed income. We've been talking about the bear market and equities, but my goodness, we have had a steep reset in interest rates and a bear market in bonds. And right now, fixed income is actually paying income. So investors who had been forced to take risk in prior periods because there was no return can really think more deeply about their risk tolerance. And fixed income might be a good place to be right now. We're seeing 4% type yields in muni bonds. So you are seeing some pretty nice current returns out of fixed income. So that's a place I would say would be a great place for investors to reconsider. Those who have been sort of bearish on bonds because the rates were so low. Well, now we seem to have much better rates. The last thing I would say on that, though, is from an equity perspective, we still do see the best opportunities in U.S. equities, just the best visibility, the best transparency around what's going on. And we do see areas outside the U.S. as having some exogenous headwinds specifically related to energy that are just really hard to price into markets right here. When it comes to the growth versus value debate here in the U.S., obviously growth has under performed is now the time to put money to work in some of those undervalue names. We always preach diversification. And I will say that with an economy that's slowing and interest rates probably stabilizing, it's not about...",https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=z4hExsMyQNo,27,2022-10-17 15:54:09
3421," value names. You know, we always preach diversification and I will say that with an economy that's slowing and interest rates probably stabilizing. It's not a bad opportunity for growth stocks because in an environment where growth is dear, investors will pay more for growth. So we would say stick to our diversified strategy. You really want to have both because trying to time those factors is very very difficult. Katie Nixon always great to speak with you. Thanks so much for taking the time to stop by the studio. All right, let's get a market check with Julie Heinen. He Julie. Hey, Shana. Thank you so much. Well, we are seeing stocks show some real strength here once again today. The S&P 500 right now up 2.7% Around the highs of the session. If you look at the five day chart, you can see the big swings. Of course that we have been having here in the volatility that continues in this market. But really it does feel like a more risk on day today. For example, we've got yields moving lower below 4% here. We've got the dollar moving lower as well, which has tended to help stocks as of late. So that's something else that I'm watching. Take a look at some of the other elements here. Banks is something else that we're watching in today's session for a couple reasons. Bank of America, of course, was out with numbers that beat estimates. So I'll record net interest income. And that's as we have seen the Federal Reserve raised rates net income overall was down, but beat estimates, but net interest income. Up 24% in the shares are up 5% today. We also got news on Goldman Sachs, which according to Bloomberg and the Wall Street Journal is doing some restructuring, including continued sort of wind downs of its consumer banking business. Those shares up 2.5%. Just quickly here, if we look at the sectors, you see the strength and the broad strength that we're seeing within stocks. They with all of the groups up consumer discretionary real estate tech leading the pack, but really you're seeing a broad base gain here. And then NASDAQ also seeing broad base gains almost all green. One more mover that I wanted to point out to you because it's the top trending ticker on the finance platform. And that is shares of and I'll just wait for it to come up Roblox. Roblox shares of 21% today. And that's after the video gaming platform came out with its daily active users for September. Coming in at 57.8 million in the company is now forecasting for September bookings of 212 to 219 million dollars. Just the biggest one day jump that we've seen for shares of Roblox going on till May and since May. And again, sort of reflective of this risk on sentiment that we are seeing come back into the market. It's a marked contrast with what we've seen from all blocks this year with the shares down some 58%. So benefiting from risk coming back in broadly today in terms of commentary. We're hearing about the gains that we're seeing. Most are still calling it a sort of bear market bounce here, but Mike Wilson and Morgan Stanley says we could see maybe another climb up in the S&P 500 from here. Even as high as 41.50, he's still a bear over the longer term, but is looking perhaps for this bounce to continue for a little bit. Much more all market summit and Yahoo Finance coming your way next.

3423," Yeah, I mean, you've been in this position since 2019. So you're going on four years. You've built out a team of about 20,000 workers globally. Tech-specific. Earlier this year, the UN announced about 5,000 people you're adding to this team with hubs and places like Atlanta as well as Toronto. Where are you along in that journey? And what does that say about how Walmart sees tech driving its next chapter? Yeah, I am leading a global team of wonderful technologists across the world. And we are building the next generation of retail. The experiences for our customers. And we are building the tools and technologies that are completely transforming our business. As you know, Walmart's purpose is really about saving money and helping people lead better lives. Technology is such a critical part of delivering on this promise. And that's what we are setting out to do, whether it is enabling the customer to be able to buy right in the middle of their social feed when they get inspired or having their products delivered all the way into the refrigerator. We are building the technology that enables all of this to happen. And we are building tools and capabilities that are completely transforming our business. Retail is getting disrupted. And the role of technology really is to actually help Walmart be the retail leader in the disruption that's already starting to happen. And we can see that in customer experiences, we can see that in the way in which we use data to drive efficiencies, we can see that in the ways in which our associates are working in order to be able to serve our customers better, all of this is part of the transformation that is enabled by technology. And that's what me and the team are setting out to do. And we'll get into more of the specifics in just a bit. But I want to pull back because you've talked a lot about the transformations that have happened in retail. And you've said, look, they happen about every 20 years. I think a lot of our viewers are familiar with the most recent one, which I would argue is the push to e-commerce driven by your competitor, Amazon. But you say we are in the middle of another cycle. What does that look like? Yes. See, every industry goes through disruptive cycles. Typically, all of these things are actually driven by advances in technology. Like you mentioned, the last big disruption in retail was really the introduction of e-commerce that was enabled by the growth of internet. But since then, we have seen so many improvements in technology. We have got incredible computing power in the palm of our hands. We have mapped every single square inch of the planet. We have computers through deep learning that can recognize and understand natural language. And we have computers that can recognize objects. All of these things are coming together. And they are the fuel for the next round of disruption that we are already starting to see. We are starting to see that in the way in which customers are finding, discovering, and getting inspired for new products. We are seeing disruptions in terms of how people shop. We are seeing disruption in terms of how products get delivered to the customers. Walmart is in a unique position because the true disruptors are those who are going to really be able to look at the entire whole customer experience. It's not just about online. It's not just about the stores. It's about making sure that the customer experience is a delightful experience from the time that they get inspired all the way to when the product gets delivered. It's not just only about reducing friction. It's about creating a delightful experience. And that is actually going to continue to get disrupted. Walmart, like I said, is the company that can take care of the entire whole customer experience and the role of technology is to be...",https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=z4hExsMyQNo,30,2022-10-17 16:06:38
3424," Like I said, years of the company that can take care of the entire whole customer experience and the role of technology is to be able to enable that in a way that only Walmart will be able to deliver. And so when we look at that and changing the shopping experience number one, I mean, you've sort of taken a two track approach, number one developing technology in-house, but also partnering with those like Adobe. Let's talk about the in-house part of it. How are you determining where to put your investments? How much of this is about driving efficiencies to improve the experience? How much of it is about the shopping experience itself? Absolutely. So the way in which we look at our technology investments largely, there are three different things that we concentrate on. First like I said is really about the customer experience. We want to create absolutely delightful customer experiences no matter how they shop and when they shop and where they shop. Great example is what we just rolled out which is be your own model. Shopping for an outlet, we want to make it as fun as possible. When you're shopping for an outlet, you don't want to rely on some model that we have chosen to see what the output actually looks like. So this is the technology that we have used advanced machine learning so that we know how the outlet will actually drape on your particular body. So you can be a lot more comfortable about buying that particular outlet. It reduces friction, it makes it more delightful and it increases trust. So those are one area where we really are focused on. How to make shopping not just friction free but really delightful. The second area is really about enabling our 2.3 million associates to help serve our customers better, more efficiently so that they can focus on what they need to do best. Same types of advanced technology can be used for our associates as well. One good example is what we call as Wispic. This is where our associates can use AR to be able to be guided in the back room to figure out what products they need to pick and put it in from the back room, bring it from the back room and restock it on our store. Makes it very, very efficient for them. They don't need to print out a list. The system guides them. So they can focus a lot more on being efficient in what they do. The third area is really around transforming the business through automation by extracting insights out of the huge amount of scale and data that only Walmart has got to not just automate but to optimize every part of our decision making. Whether it is about how we choose our assortments that are local, that are customized for the market that we serve, all the way to how we price, how we mark down, how we optimize our supply chain in real time. All of these things are enabled by the scale, the data that we have and our ability to reason over that using machine learning, using advanced models. That really allows us to be able to reduce the cost and really go back to our purpose of saving people money. And Sir Asch, you just pointed on a keyword that I'm thinking about when you're talking about all these products you're rolling out, which is the collection of data. I mean, that itself is such a big commodity for so many companies. Number one, it tells you what chopper behavior is going to be like. It allows you to sell ads online against some of that. I mean, how are you thinking about the commercialization of that as you integrate technology more and more into the Walmart experience? Yes, so the great thing about Walmart is that we serve our customers in a whole, what we talk about is the whole customer experience, right? So whether it is online, whether it is inside the stores, we serve our customers the way they want, where they want and how they want. And this basically means that we can get a lot more insights about what.",https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=z4hExsMyQNo,31,2022-10-17 16:10:55
3425," We serve our customers the way they want, where they want and how they want. In this basically means that we can get a lot more insights about what is the best way to be able to serve our customers. This comes from both the whole customer experience nature as well as obviously the scale at which we operate. What we are focused on is to take that data and turn it into insights that ultimately serve our customers better. When we talk about commercialization or when we talk about taking the data, ultimately we want to do two things. We want to be able to serve our customers in a much more personalized, much more, in a much deeper way. And we want to create an ecosystem where not just Walmart, but all of our partners and all of our suppliers and all of the ecosystem partners also benefit from that. That is what we are trying to build over here. So that it's an open system, it's not a world garden. We want everybody to be able to participate and ultimately benefit the customer. You are the global CTO. I can't let you go without asking you about crypto because Walmart did make some headlines. At the end of last year when you filed a number of key trademarks that appear to point to the company's intentions to sell as well as market virtual goods. You already got blockchain technology integrated into the system here. What's the role of crypto in Walmart's future? It's a great question. I think that there are three major areas of disruption. Crypto falls in sort of the middle of it. I have talked before about the way in which customers are getting inspired and discovering products. That is changing. Part of that is going to happen in the matter of it. Part of that is going to happen on live streams inside your social media app. So whether it is physical goods or virtual goods, they play a part in terms of what the customer wants. Crypto will become an important part of how customers transact. We want to make sure that we make it as friction free for customers to be able to transact and to be able to buy. How they are able to drive value out of it. That is where I think a lot of the disruption is going to start happening in terms of different payment methods, different payment options. The role of crypto is going to continue to play a very important role in that. Obviously, we want to be there where the customer really needs us to be. The last part of it is how products get delivered. A lot of disruption going on over there. When you specifically talk about crypto, it is going to be about discovery of products whether it is physical or virtual inside, either the metaphors or upfront and then how people transact. Okay, certainly a lot of people are going to be looking for an announcement potentially from Walmart. At least, short medium term. At Ceresh Kumar, global CTO for Walmart. Really appreciate your time today. Thank you. Straight ahead, our focus is crypto with GraceGale CEO Michael Sonnenshine. Stay with us.",https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=z4hExsMyQNo,32,2022-10-17 16:15:02
3426, palabra Welcome back to Yahoo Finance's All Market Summer sponsored in part by GraceGale. It's been a volatile year for stocks and crypto is no exception. I'm here with GraceGale CEO Michael Son and Shine. Michael great to see you. Thanks for having me. Great to be here. I have a lot to talk about but why don't we start off with talking about your lawsuit that you filed against the Securities Exchange Commission and get us up to speed on the whole legal dispute there. Sure. So GraceGale operates today the largest Bitcoin fund in the world. GraceGale Bitcoin Trust ticker GBTC. It has been trading publicly since 2015 and we have long held conviction that this should be an ETF. We want to work towards having it become an ETF and work proactively with regulators. Thank you.,https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=z4hExsMyQNo,33,2022-10-17 16:20:30
3427," and we have long held conviction that this should be an ETF. We want to work towards having it become an ETF and work proactively with regulators. We had filed an application to convert it to an ETF and that was rejected by the SEC this summer. The same day the SEC rejected that application, we filed a lawsuit challenging that decision. And we really feel that this lawsuit is not, Andy, it's not just about Bitcoin. This is about putting forward, you know, straight forward common sense legal arguments that really ensure that investors are protected and that the SEC is acting within their mandate. And so since that time, our legal team has been behind the scenes working furiously on the case and just this last week, we filed the opening brief for the lawsuit. Some new arguments outlined in there and probably the most significant of them is this idea of a significant market test. The SEC created the significant market test really out of nowhere. We've never seen them do this before for any other product, any other commodity that we've ever seen. And it applied it very, very stringently to spot Bitcoin ETFs like GBTC, but very leniently to Bitcoin futures ETFs hence why we have several of them on the market. So the SEC is really acting outside of its authority under the Exchange Act and that's really one of the strongest arguments. But again, this is not just about Bitcoin, this is about straightforward common sense arguments when it comes to the SEC. Michael, can you put yourself in the shoes of the SEC though and understand their argument? And first of all, they're looking to protect investors. But why are they taking this position against your ETF, do you think? Andy, I can't understand why. As I said, this product is trading every single day, hundreds of millions of dollars, over 850,000 investors in the US own shares of GBTC, all 50 states represented. You have bills passing across the floor of Congress, both sides of the aisle supporting it. You have companies moving outside the US because our regulatory landscape isn't catching up fast enough with the innovation taking place here. Why our regulator would not take the opportunity to bring Bitcoin to bring investor protections closer into the regulatory perimeter? I just don't understand. It's exactly what they're here to do. I want to get back to that a little bit in a second. But first of all, maybe you can remind us or tell us a little bit more about grayscale. We have these ETFs. What else? So the grayscale family of products today has now 17 digital currency investment products. So really our mission has been about lowering the barrier to entry for investors to access crypto. So we have a whole family of publicly traded securities so that investors can buy and sell crypto exposure and their brokerage accounts, retirement accounts, you name it. We also launched an ETF earlier this year, the grayscale future of finance ETF, which was our first foray into an equity's offering. And I think as we kind of move through this crypto winter, we're starting to explore some really new offerings and new wrappers and new ways of giving investors access to the digital economy more broadly. Are you mentioning the crypto winter? I'm glad you brought it up because now I want to ask you more about that. I think Bitcoin is down what 70% year to date. Why is that? And is it really the case that it goes down and then goes back up to new heights every single time? Or maybe this time's different? So this is a crypto winter. And we call it a crypto winter because we're talking about sustained lower prices across the crypto ecosystem. We've been here before and unfortunately Andy, I'm going to tell you and anyone tuning in, we're probably going to be here again at some point, right? And that's the kind of cycles that the crypto asset class has. We see it go on to take out new all time highs, comes to some level of correction, starts to form a new base, and during these times it's really a time to build when you see this retraction. What we're hearing from investors is actually not that they're shying away from the asset class, quite the contrary. I think you and I now for years have been talking about diversification within this asset class. People have that core Bitcoin, core Ethereum position, but they're now looking at things like infrastructure, for example, right? How do they marry that crypto exposure? They have in tokens with the underlying infrastructure that powers these protocols. So we just recently launched a new offering, the GraceGale Digital Infrastructure Opportunities Fund. And that would be...",https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=z4hExsMyQNo,34,2022-10-17 16:24:29
3428," with the underlying infrastructure that powers these protocols. So we just recently launched a new offering the Grace Guild Digital Infrastructure Opportunities Fund. And that really gives investors the opportunity to invest in Bitcoin mining, for example, right? An industry that maybe took on too much leverage and we're really giving them a distressed opportunity. So this crypto winter too soon and too tough to predict how long it will last, but investors are not shying away from the industry. And if anything, looking for new opportunities. But there is all kinds of risk. I mean, hackers have stolen what, $3 billion of Bitcoin and crypto coins this year. How do we protect against that? It really is a question of who you're working with as you think about crypto exposure, right? If you think back to the early days of the internet, many companies were building products and services and the regulatory environment hadn't caught up with it yet. You didn't see the emergence yet of some of the, you know, web 2.0 applications that we today couldn't live without. Things like Amazon, things like, you know, AWS, Google, you name it. And I think we're in that kind of a phase when it comes to crypto, where we're learning lessons as an industry. There's certainly going to be missteps. But as an industry, we get stronger, we become more resilient. And we start to weed out bad apples over time. What is Bitcoin for? And maybe this gets to the SEC situation. Is it an investment? Is it a currency? And is it losing market share to Ethereum and things like NFTs? So great question. So Bitcoin depends on where in the world you fall, right? Over the past couple of months, if not over the last year, you've seen all kinds of volatility across a variety of asset classes, massive movements in fiat currencies all over the world, sometimes to unprecedented, you know, levels of volatility that just really never seen before. I think here in the US and in other developed economies, you're seeing Bitcoin being used more as a store of value or as an investment. I don't see necessarily yet how or why we're using Bitcoin day to day in our everyday, you know, transactions buying a cup of coffee, things like that. But if you wake up in other parts of the world today, and the currency that your government issues that you use to buy that cup of coffee, lost 20% of its value last night, well, something like Bitcoin, something that's non-government back, something that's non-government issued, actually become something really attractive. And so as you're seeing these different macro factors continue to change the landscape, I think depending where you are in the world, Bitcoin will mean different things to different folks. Is Ethereum getting more market share than Bitcoin? Well, it's expense. No, not necessarily. I think there are today last count over 17,000 different digital assets out there. And so something that we're certainly committed to, a great scale is continuing to make sense of that universe for investors. Where do you even start when there's so many options available to you? And you know, there is a world today and a future state where multiple digital currencies will coexist with one another or digital assets. They'll have different use cases, different addressable markets and different prices. And you know, Bitcoin is, you know, gonna coincide with things like Ethereum. And it's gonna coexist. And it's okay that they coexist and have different use cases and different markets. What about coexisting though with Fiat currency? I mean, what do you see, you know, 2030, 40 years down the road? Are we gonna have Fiat currency and cryptocurrency coexisting? Well, I think we're certainly seeing new use cases emerging out of this asset class every day. We are certainly moving towards the tokenization of a lot of new kind of ideas and a lot of things today that may have frictions or maybe not the most efficient types of settlements or oversight of ownership or perhaps authenticity. That's one of the things that NFTs as a technology are helping us to understand. So I think from an investor standpoint, we are certainly moving into that realm where a pie chart that investor has, which is diversified across equities and fixed income and commodities. Certainly is gonna have a slice that goes towards crypto or digital assets more broadly. How diversified that'll be depends on who the investor is. And how they actually start to think about crypto affecting the other things they invest in. I mean, is crypto really better than the US dollar? That is a loaded question, Andy. Well, I think that the US dollar has certainly.",https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=z4hExsMyQNo,35,2022-10-17 16:28:49
3429," I mean, is crypto really better than the US dollar? That is a loaded question, Andy. Well, I think that the US dollar has certainly maintained its dominance as the global reserve currency. No question about it. Arguably, Bitcoin is one of, if not the most incredible invention that we've seen over the last call it two decades. Or so it was literally invented out of thin air and has now been used by hundreds of millions of people around the world. And anytime anything challenges it, it somehow, you know, becomes even stronger and more resilient. So I think it's too early to say, and there's also not necessarily a winner between those two, right? The fiat world, the crypto world, these are two worlds that can and will likely coexist. Yeah, when you get ransomware attacks, they want to get paid in Bitcoin though, right? I mean, how do you get rid of that stigma? I mean, I kind of think that stigma is dying, Andy. It really is. You've got to understand that because the Bitcoin blockchain is immutable and traceable, unlike, you know, exchanging physical dollars for someone doing something nefarious, Bitcoin would be a really bad mechanism to use if you didn't want to get caught doing something. So I don't think that that is as nearly as prevalent as it once was. And for that very reason. And how do you look at some of the experiments that some of these countries have undertaken with crypto? I mean, like El Salvador, maybe a mixed picture there? I mean, it's one of those places in the world, right? Where a lot of these economies have been either dollar-based or they're not doing a terribly great job managing their own currency. A lot of people have moved into leveraging mobile technology. So they're living their lives on their phones. It doesn't have to be a brand new iPhone or a brand new Android. But they're moving into a state where the connectedness of cell technology is bringing them together. And their banking either hasn't caught up or isn't allowing them to have access to those types of services. And so Bitcoin and these types of technologies are actually allowing people to enter the conversation, create savings, pass money to the next generation. Things that just the traditional banking system may not be catching up to you in certain parts of the world. I mean, is it possible then that because we're in a place in the world where we rely on the dollar and fiat and legacy systems are so prevalent that we don't see the change coming in the rest of the world? I think that's one of the unique things about being a grayscale. You know, being at our parent, part of our parent company, Digital Currency Group, we have investments in over 40 countries around the world. And so we don't sit in a room all day and tell each other that Bitcoin is happening. We actually have companies that are building products and services in every corner of the globe and seeing how volumes are changing. See what customer adoption looks like, seeing how often people transact. And the numbers tell a really compelling story. And we've talked about this before, Michael. But what about the correlation between just plain vanilla equities and crypto? And let me have you answer that and we get to other correlations. So it's a great question because the narrative on this has flipped very recently. When you look at where and how crypto has historically been categorized, it actually has followed tech stocks and a lot of the momentum trades that we've historically seen in the equities market. Some of those assets are down 70, 80 plus percent year to date. And what's interesting is that even though crypto has fallen precipitously in Bitcoin in particular, it's actually now been trading very tightly in this band. And so the volatility that you're seeing in crypto has come down tremendously. So a lot of folks are now looking at that narrative and saying, well, is that going to hold up when crypto does wake up from this crypto winter? Is it going to continue to follow those types of trades and be that kind of momentum? Or is the macro environment really reshaping the way people might think about crypto's role in a portfolio? What about the economy then, Michael? I mean, a lot of talk of recession and there's a crypto winter correlated coincidence. What do you think? Probably more coincidental than not. I mean, it's early days, right? Because you do have some folks calling for recession and other folks not so much saying that this is just a relatively momentary blip in the grand scheme of things. Eventually, we might see things move to all time highs and in the not too distant future. I think crypto does this. It's done this multiple times and unfortunately, we'll probably do it again. We've seen drawdowns of 50, 60 plus percent before.",https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=z4hExsMyQNo,36,2022-10-17 16:33:00
3430," I think crypto does this. It's done this multiple times and unfortunately it'll probably do it again. We've seen drawdowns of 50, 60 plus percent before and again what hasn't killed crypto has made it stronger. How is your business as a CEO looking out and seeing growth, customer relationships? Are you seeing a slowdown? Maybe that would have to do with overall economic activity rather than adoption of crypto. Well certainly investors are continuing to average down on their positions. I think a lot of investors realize that anytime you see this type of pullback and your conviction on something has fundamentally changed, that's something you should be taking advantage of. So investors are not shying away from that perspective. So investors are now also, I'd say, as informed as they've ever been on the asset class itself and so they're always looking for new opportunities to either diversify their exposure. And we're starting to see that they're developing interesting narratives around different sub-themed or sub-categories of crypto, much the same way they do around the equity space. And final question Michael, talk about the demographics of people who are buying crypto and maybe how that's changing and some trends you've seen recently. The stigma that crypto is only for young males rose. It's over. It's over. What we've seen is that crypto has continued to pervade men and women. We've seen it actually creep up into older demographics. They realize the staying power of the asset class. And as a result of that, the momentum has been there and I think it'll continue to move into other demographics as well. Michael Sonichine, CEO of GraceGill, thank you so much for joining us. Thank you. You're watching the 2022 Yahoo Finance All Market Summit. We'll be right back after this. We'll be right back after this. We'll be right back after this. We'll be right back after this.

3431," birdie Welcome back to Yahoo Finance's All-Markets Summit sponsored in part by Grayscale. As the crypto world faces volatility, it continues to flourish with institutional adoption and real-life use cases. Joining us now to discuss the crypto landscape beyond just where the market price of Bitcoin happens to be sitting. We've got crypto council for innovation CEO Sheila Warren and Apollo Head of Digital Investments and assets. Christine Moey along with Yahoo Finance's David Hollerith. Great to have you all here with us for this conversation. First and foremost, just to tee up where the conversation is going to go, we should acknowledge that we are in a crypto winter right now and David, I'll kick things over to you to really kind of set the scene, especially as we've seen kind of this deceleration or this decline in some of the crypto prices right now and where that kind of influences some of the investment decisions going forward to. Yeah, Brad, my first thought is sort of just to tee it up, you know, in the second quarter we saw crypto assets fall first under macro conditions and then a lot of sort of idiosyncratic sort of issues with the asset class, insolvencies, all that. And you know, that was obviously something unique since then, cryptocurrencies have mainly stayed fairly flat compared to other assets like equities. And so I think that's a good place just to start, just to turn it over to each of the panelists, Sheila and Christine and just sort of ask you what's different about sort of this crypto bear market compared to previous cycles. Sheila, we'll go to you first on that. Sure, thanks so much. You know, I think I think the last time in 2017 to 2018, there was still this question, is crypto as a class? It really was kind of the Bitcoin or blockchain days and is this just a flash in the pan, is it all going to vanish and just evaporate? And this time around, I think there is a sense of the stickiness, the inevitability of this, not just as an asset class, but as a technology, it's going to have tremendous impact, I think, across a broader variety of industry ecosystems and subsets than just financial services. Christine, same question to you. What's different between this crypto winter and past crypto winters that we've seen? Yeah, sure. I mean, as Sheila mentioned, in the last crypto winter, there was a lot in development, but there hadn't been any mass uptake or adoption. People had bought some Bitcoin and Ethereum through crypto exchanges, maybe a very small set of..",https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=z4hExsMyQNo,38,2022-10-17 16:42:28
3432," in development, but there hadn't been any mass uptake or adoption. Like people had bought some Bitcoin and Ethereum through like crypto exchanges. Maybe a very small set of people started participating in token sales or what we're called ICOs. But generally, even in the enterprises when we were using blockchain technology, it was still in pilot or prototype stage. Now, in the last bull cycle that we just saw going into today's crypto winter, we've seen mass adoption in a variety of different forms. So, you know, we saw, for example, a number of technological enthusiasts, financial enthusiasts participating in yield farming through the DeFi summer of 2021. We saw a long tail of creatives and non-technical consumers participate in the NFT markets in 2022. And then across this whole time, a broader adoption of stablecoins for payments and regular business use cases like just trying to pay like my employees globally. You know, now the result of this is that a broader audience has become more informed around this technology. A number of those use cases required being able to set up a self-costive wallet, a self-costive crypto wallet. And so, you know, basically what we're dealing with now is a more and like kind of invested audience and intellectually invested in terms of like having done the work to get set up with this ecosystem. The last crypto cycle was really brutal and long. And for those that managed to survive, they went on to become the biggest companies and protocols in our industry. And so, I would say that in this crypto cycle, or in the last bull cycle, you know, many of the investors and the companies raised, oh, what sounded like a regis amount of money at the time, but basically building a war chest to whether this particular winter. So, you know, basically, whilst we do see this winter being severe and long, because, you know, before we didn't even have the broader macroeconomic uncertainty around inflation and the potential recession, you know, I would say that the industry is a little bit better prepared. And additionally, institutions, enterprises are continuing to build in this space, you know, just recently announced Bank of New York, Mellon is now offering Bitcoin custody as just one example. Okay, so I want to take a brief step back, because there's a lot to unpack there, right? For better and for what we still need to work through too. But first, perhaps just defining for the sake of the conversation, Web 3, this is a more decentralized internet. This is an internet that's running on or a connection point that's running on blockchain technology. This is new for a lot of people. This is also new for the way that investors like yourself are also evaluating some of these companies, right, Christine? And so with that in mind, there's the traditional thought of what's the path to profitability for some of those companies? And is that perhaps that path to profitability hindered because you don't necessarily have the immediate return? And it's a much further looking out type of investment that you're really evaluating here. How does that really influence some of your investment thesis around Web 3? Sure. Just taking a step back, a lot of buzzwords in the space. It's got crypto, blockchain, digital assets, NFTs, DeFi, Web 3. And so for someone who's not following this space, it can be quite intimidating. However, I like to just explain what is happening right now as a multi-year technology shift that is accelerating financial innovation. It's driving new investor behaviors, and it's creating new financial markets infrastructure that has already begun to start impacting payments, capital formation, lending and borrowing, and asset management, and then a long tail of other things including culture. Now, we blockchain nerds that are in the industry like to think of what's being built as the internet of value. Now, the internet that most of all of you know and love, we think of as the internet of information, basically the set of technological protocols that made it possible to make 24, 7, 365 distribution and exchange of information around the globe, the democratization of content and information creation and distribution through platforms like social media, where individuals were empowered to become platforms empowered by this technology, and information gatekeepers or incumbents were challenged and forced to evolve.",https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=z4hExsMyQNo,39,2022-10-17 16:45:41
3433," where individuals were empowered to become platforms empowered by this technology, and information gatekeepers or incumbents were challenged and forced to evolve. Now, if you take that framework and you apply it to not information, but now technology impacting value and value transfer and value creation, you can see where we're going with this now, like in this new internet of value. Basically now that digital value transfer can be 24, 7, 365 and peer-to-peer. We're seeing that now with the advent of stablecoins, or how there's been a broader democratization of value creation and distribution. We've seen that with the fits and spurts of capital formation through token sales, as an example, or how financial services at large are being unbundled into financial primitives, more jargon, but basically turned into tech microservices, basically libraries of code to do things that typically banks and financial institutions would do. And NFTs broadly an experimentation in creating post-spoke digital assets with the new ability to ascribe value to something that previously would just have been just another copy of a JPEG, but now because we're able to track digital scarcity and provenance with this new Web3 technology set, we're able to ascribe cultural and historic value to digital things. And so with this large technology shift that's happening, institutions like Apollo, and by the way Apollo is a half a trillion dollar asset manager with over a 30-year track record investing and participating in public and private activities, fixed income, credit, retirement services, and insurance, we believe in a world where this technology shift will basically impact existing financial market infrastructure and business models as more real world assets and real world applications emerge with this technology. Now, to be clear, it's not going to be a lift and drop of existing markets onto blockchain technology. I think that has all been tried in the previous years of the last half decade. That didn't really necessarily work, nor is there really a business case to do that. And it won't be magic internet money that ignores the financial realities of appropriate risk and return. I think that the recent crypto markets unwind and market idiosyncrasies we've seen have proven that, but it's going to be a unique, never-before-seen intersection of crypto-native, new product and market development that has been grounded in the financial realities of risk and return relative to the broader tradeable markets. Powered by automation and composability, we've seen through smart contracts and digital ledgers. So, at least here at Apollo, we're focused on being real world practitioners of Web3 technology, rolling up our sleeves, actually testing out the blockchain protocols, building on smart contracts, helping to build new products to help support and shape this industry as this technology shift is happening. And then additionally, we've started investing across the technology stack, focused on identifying ambitious founders that can benefit from our markets expertise across those markets and our scale. And so, it's been an incredible entry point for us at Apollo, since we're just starting with a bunch of drive powder in this space in this winter cycle. Certainly. I mean, look, if you find any of those founders that can help me turn any of my old JPEGs that I created in paint into something valuable in the future too, I know this is just a small part of the broader NFT landscape and broader crypto and blockchain landscape, but I would certainly appreciate that as well. Working on it. Yeah, David, out there and over to you. Well, yeah, I mean, Christine, to your point, I mean, you've been working in the space for a long time and you're deeply in mesh and it sounds like looking at some of the cutting edge sides of the technology. But, you know, Sheila, if we turn to, you know, Washington, the story of regulation at least in the US, but I think you could say sort of more broadly is like very unclear. And, you know, we've seen President Biden release his executive order on cryptocurrency and we're starting to see agencies, federal agencies respond with reports coming out. And I was sort of curious, how was the conversation in Washington around cryptocurrencies changed everything?",https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=z4hExsMyQNo,40,2022-10-17 16:49:57
3434," Agencies, federal agencies respond with reports coming out. And I was sort of curious, how was the conversation in Washington around cryptocurrencies changed over the last six months? I mean, it's often sort of a topic of sort of what is holding back maybe the asset class from getting more adoption. Well, it's changed a lot. And I think to the point you're making, David, it's not just about Washington. We're seeing a lot of activity happening all around the world from the regulatory space. I think the thing to know is a technology is moving so fast. Christine did an acronym dump on us earlier, right? You've got Dify, you've got NFTs, you've got Dow, you've got so many of these concepts that are still being formed. The market hasn't yet weighed in on the direction of if these things should go or will go. At the same time, you've got regulators scrambling. I think that's the right word to keep up and provide some clarity around this, both to help the industry shape and build on more solid foundation, but also to help consumers make sense of what all this means. So we're seeing activity out of Europe, we're seeing activity in South Korea, Australia, the UK, India, Japan, I mean, really all over the world. In the States, in Washington, tremendous activity, both federal and the state level as well. And I think that the thing, right now we've gotten a two very active bills that are being discussed, one focusing on kind of which agency ought to have the stronger hand or a hand at all and regulating this space of the other unstable coins, specifically thinking about what should happen in that environment, how do all these things play together? Will there be a digital dollar in the US, like the digital euro that Christian Lagarde announced earlier this year? It's complicated. And so I think the next six months are going to be, have a different place. We're going into the midterms now. There'll be a potential shakeup and how the voices, that are the most prominent voices and positions that they hold on various committees. But all I can say for now is it's a space to watch. It's critically important to the entire ecosystem and the decisions made I think over the next six months, certainly over the next year are going to play an outsized role I would think in the development and the way that this technology ultimately lands with consumers. So Sheila, with that in mind, and perhaps it's trivial of me to ask to kind of apply the rule of threes to this, but if I were to ask, what are three big things that regulators need to get right when they're thinking about and working through what crypto legislation should look like, especially here in the US, what would those three things be? Oh, gosh, it's so hard to pick, right? So here's the three things I think that are important to keep in mind. And one is this is global. Nobody's waiting for the United States to act or not act as the case may be. And so while there is some influence the US still has significant influence over these markets, that's not going to last forever. We are seeing Mika, which is a big comprehensive legislation that's landed in Europe, start to be implemented. That's going to have huge implications potentially on how builders build, how consumers engage with this technology offerings. The second thing I would say it's really important to note is despite the attention on the price and this entire framing of this conversation is about how that's not the most important or only thing, this is about a lot more than just financial services products. This really is about building a new version of the internet, decentralized internet, Christine laid out what Web 3 with that concept means. So thinking about how this will work in spaces like data, spaces like creative, the creative economy, all of that is really, really important. So global frame, more than financial services and products. And the third thing I would say is that the details really, really matter. So I think a lot of folks tend to think of regulation as just kind of providing this very broad playbook, but actually there's a lot of nuance and detail and the competitions are happening live right now. And a lot of that is going to be critically important. So meeting with technologists, making sure there's understanding about what's actually happening in the trajectory, what's moving forward is also just a critical, it's just critical and crucial here, even more than it's ever been before I'd say in other industries. So Christine, hearing all that, what's the time table for Web 3 to be part of everyday person's life? I mean, if we're going to transact and get our coffee or whether we're going through a car transaction, what is the time table that we have to look out towards? Okay, that's a really good question. I mean, I guess the thing with technology evolution, it's one of these things where, when you're in it, it rolls out quite slowly and incrementally, but then in retrospect, it looks like it happened very fast. And so.",https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=z4hExsMyQNo,41,2022-10-17 16:55:06
3435," When you're in it, it rolls out like quite slowly and incrementally, but then in retrospect, it looks like it happened very fast. And so what I mean by that is, you know, you mentioned I've been in the industry for over six years. And in those six years, I've seen the building blocks of blockchain protocols like actually become like be created and get adopted. Or, you know, stable coins like get created or, you know, the primitives around like lending and borrowing via smart contracts, which later evolved into DeFi. Like all of these things started as like very big ideas against a backdrop of like, you know, a difficult reality. In fact, that it didn't exist. And also there was a lot of regulatory, you know, stuff to navigate. But in the past six years, all of that has actually come to fruition. Think like ideas have come to life. And they've been used and actually tested with real money. And actually have had multiple teams around the world with different, you know, levels of expertise around technology and financial markets and infrastructure all contributing in open source code. So, you know, it's moving fast with very moving fast and slow at the same time. In terms of, and so, you know, I feel like we're just kind of at the stage where, you know, the key building blocks of the infrastructure have been put in place. But now it's about the real world applications. And this is like where, you know, the real world assets that were hyper focused on from Apollo's point of view, you know, may start to emerge. But then additionally, a lot of work around user experience, you know, blockchain technology is actually back end technology. And, you know, if we do this right, Web 3 doesn't become a noticeable part of our lives. Like it just like sinks into the background. It's just stuff that like drives, you know, the applications and our use cases. And in fact, it becomes a little bit boring. And so, you know, basically it would say like in the next couple of years, we should see an acceleration once the foundation now that the foundational pieces are in and now it's more focused on what do people find compelling. I think NFTs were a glimpse of how a broader user base could be compelled with, you know, use cases that were broadly cultural, like maybe less financial. And so, you know, we're a small subset of us nerds that, you know, we're kind of building really interested in, you know, all of the hyper financialization overall. So I think the path to, you know, broader adoption is probably something more fun, funny than that. Absolutely. Well, that's a few years. We'll see the discovery. But it'll be slow and fast at the same time. Yeah. That's about all the time we have. So I think we'll cut it off there. I was going to leave it for closing remarks. You know, Sheila, what should we expect in the next quarter as far as regulation goes? We only have about 30 seconds, Sheila. Yeah, very, very active conversation, very active conversation in the US and Europe and all over the world. Hopefully there'll be some, I don't know symmetry at least compatibility in what comes out of these different places, but maybe not. So it's just a place to watch for sure. So I think we'll go ahead and do that. Up next, the new director of the National Crypto Enforcement Team, director Ewing Young Choi, on how the federal government is protecting investors while allowing innovation to flourish. In the right place.",https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=z4hExsMyQNo,42,2022-10-17 16:59:18
3436," Aaahhh... Welcome back to Yahoo Finance's All Market Summit sponsored in part by Grayscale. I'm David Hollerith. A year ago, the Justice Department stood up the National Cryptocurrency Enforcement Team to effectively lead enforcement of crypto-related cases. Since then, the team has prosecuted cases ranging from crypto-mixing services to scams, insider trading, and national security threats. Joining us now to discuss the team's role in shaping the market integrity of cryptocurrencies and how it balances that without forwarding innovation is Unyoung Choi, director of the National Cryptocurrency Enforcement Team. Unyoung, thanks for being here. Of course, thanks for having me, David. So to start off, can you just tell us what is this team?",https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=z4hExsMyQNo,43,2022-10-17 17:04:50
3437," The National Cryptocurrency Enforcement Team. Unyoung, thanks for being here. Of course, thanks for having me, David. So to start it off, can you just tell us, what is this team in set? What does it do? So the National Cryptocurrency Enforcement Team was set up by the Department of Justice to really be a one-stop shop of subject matter experts drawn from across the department. And the reason for that is because the department realized that there had been a situation in which we've seen digital asset criminal use evolve. Early days, it was darknet markets, and it was people buying and selling all sorts of contraband in our products on those darknet markets. And these days, we're seeing it pop up in every single type of criminal activity the department looks into. We really need to bring together those who had been working on this issue for some time in order to address the more cutting-edge issues that we're looking at. And so, as you mentioned, one of the focuses we have is to make sure that we are appropriately addressing the ecosystem, looking at mixers, tumblers, and exchanges, and other money laundering platforms that help facilitate that type of criminal activity. And we also want to basically up everyone's baseline game when it comes to digital asset prosecutions and investigations, because we're seeing it in ransomware, we're seeing it in frauds and thefts of all sorts. And we want to make sure that it's not just the specialists who have the tools necessary to fight and disrupt this type of criminal activity, but that prosecutors from throughout the department can have access to those tools, understand how best to use them, and know where the resources are throughout the department to help them and their fights and their cases. Yeah, and you're speaking obviously to this prosecutor network that was recently announced. And so, I'm curious there, what does success look like for that? I think, well, just to give you a little bit of background, digital asset coordinators network is a dedicated network of 150 plus prosecutors drawn from across the department. That's the 94 US attorney's offices as well as a different sections. It may just as they deal with things such as national security issues, antitrust, environmental and natural resources, crimes, and even in the civil division and the tax divisions as well. And the idea is to be able to have a network of prosecutors devoted to being the first line of fence in each of their offices. So, in any investigation in which digital asset or cryptocurrency issue comes up, people will know where in their office to find the help that they need to understand these technologies and to stay abreast of all the developments that we're seeing in the ways in which those technologies can be abused by bad actors. So, that's really what the network is about. And success for us is making sure that each prosecutor feels empowered and armed with the right tools, knows how to apply the authorities that we already have to combat these crimes, and realizes that each prosecutor realizes that for every investigation, there are going to be challenges, digital assets is one that you can address using the tools that we have in many instances and just understanding the new ways in which we're applying them to a new problem set. And how is prosecuting cases involving crypto different from other assets? So, I think there are a few technological aspects of cryptocurrency that make them pose certain challenges and also certain benefits along enforcement. So, I think the easiest thing to think about is public ledgers for the most part, most of the cryptocurrency crime that we see still rely on public ledger technologies, in which case you have a ledger that is available, you can see all the transactions that anyone's ever had. Now, that is very useful in terms of trying to chase down the flow of funds for any criminal activity, but we still need to understand how to get behind the addresses that are on that ledger. We'll know that the transaction may be criminal, but who is actually behind that particular, but that particular transaction, that particular address. And that's one of the tricky things about cryptocurrencies that it has built in this sort of anonymity, pseudonymity factor, because it does not necessarily put a one to one on the address and the actual real person that's behind those types of transactions. These are also very cross border in nature. So, you know, an example I like to give is, you might have someone who's a victim of a cryptocurrency crime in the United States. The bad actor might be in country number two. They may be using infrastructure such as a cryptocurrency platform, a mixer that may be incorporated in country number three or registered there even, but the data is in country number four, and the people who work for that platform may be in country number five, and trying to deal with bringing together all the different.",https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=z4hExsMyQNo,44,2022-10-17 17:07:48
3438," or registered there even, but the data is in country number four, and the people who work for that platform may be in country number five, and trying to deal with bringing together all the different sources of data that you really need to do, both off-chain and off-on-chain, in order to get to the bottom of whose behind criminal activity can be tricky. Like it is in all cyber cases across border investigations, generally. And also that it's, you know, these transactions are immutable and they're irreversible. That's one of the benefits to cryptocurrency in some instances, and that these transactions can oftentimes be relatively frictionless and quick, but it also means that if we identify a particular transaction as being criminal, we can't go to some centralized, you know, financial institution and ask for that money to come back. That's not how the blockchain works. And so finding ways to deal with that and still be able to chase funds to places where we may be able to capture those criminal proceeds back and provide them to the victims is one of the challenges that we face in this area. Right, and the decentralized area of crypto, which defies a broad term, it can mean a lot of different things. You know, it's one of the most promising areas, at least people working in the crypto industry, say, but it's obviously a place that, you know, has been fraught with what you call security exploits this year, or, you know, hacks to people sort of say they're the same thing, sometimes they're kind of slightly different. So I was sort of curious, given the amount of hacks we've seen, it seems like one every week. This year, you know, what's you, what is the responsibility of sort of the private sector versus the public sector, in sort of reducing the level of exploits in crypto? And added to that, what do you think the root problem is? You know, I think what is going on here is that the crypto industry and DeFi in particular has really exploded in market cap and size over the past few years, even. And so I think it's, you know, unprecedented in the amount that the industry has grown and the ways in which DeFi have evolved the technologies that have traditionally been used in a variety of different ways, but now are being used to create financial products that in sophisticated multi-chain, you know, means. And so I think especially in these cross-bridge hacks situations, which what you're alluding to. The bottom line is that the industry is still in our view in a maturation phase. A lot of respects we're looking at companies and hoping that they will understand that doing things such as basic risk reduction, having robust compliance programs, and ensuring that they are decreasing the opportunities for these type of exploits on their own platform, it's sort of the first best line of defense. And I think, you know, a lot of these exploits, as we see them, are situations in which the code is exploited in part because, you know, maybe there would have been if there had been more robust code audits, for instance. People might have caught these particular opportunities for exploitation before the code gets pushed out writ large. And so in those situations, we're hoping that people will now see every week we have multi, you know, million dollar exploits along those lines. People will start trying to think about ways in which they're making their code more robust before it's pushed out. I think that's the bottom line. Yeah. And I mean, how does what does a partnership look like between the private sector and public sector and sort of enabling more security auditing, I guess, before kids pushed out? Because obviously this is a, you know, this is a fast-moving industry. Yeah, I think it's just, I think it's a recognition that we have to work with the private sector and ensure that they understand the ways in which we've identified particular tactics that bad actors might be using in order to exploit these types of platforms. I think generally there is an understanding that every single week, if you see a new one of these, perhaps people within the industry are going to think twice before sent pushing out code or invest more in the front end auditing and basic sort of cyber security concerns that we see, you know, as a general matter that we have is an issue that occurs within the private sector. I mean, I think people are now in the mindset where they realize it's hyper security is a serious concern from a business risk perspective and it requires investments on the front end from those who are responsible, not just sort of rush.",https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=z4hExsMyQNo,45,2022-10-17 17:11:50
3439," In the mindset where they realize its cybersecurity is a serious concern from a business risk perspective and it requires investments on the front end from those who are responsible, not just sort of rushing to market with a particular product, but really making sure that you've kicked the tires on that product and so that you're eliminating opportunities for bad actors, especially in our perspective, or especially concerned with North Korean nation-state actors who seem to be behind a lot of these particular types of exploits and using them as a means to avoid sanctions regime design to limit their weapons of mass destruction program. For instance, I mean, these are serious national security concerns that really stretch beyond the fact that there are millions of dollars being stolen in single episodes that we see with DeFi hacks and exploits. Yeah, the national security topic is obviously one thing, but if we're just thinking about from for individual investors, what is the most concerning sort of digital crime trend or crypto crime trend that you've been following? So I think one of the things that we're particularly concerned about is that there's a lack of familiarity about the technology, but the average American consumer or investor might be looking at historically pretty significant returns on certain types of cryptocurrency investments. And so it's a combination of fear of missing out, FOMO plus a lack of familiarity in the technology that allows some investors to have sometimes be duped by fraudulent schemes that are out there that people who would abuse the name of crypto and the promise of innovation, and quite frankly participate in a series of old school Ponzi schemes or rug polls or other types of thefts and frauds that happen with the American public. And I think just sort of making sure that investors understand that they should be applying the same type of scrutiny that they apply to their normal investments and traditional finance to crypto would go a long way. So if someone something sounds like it's too good to be true, maybe it is in fact too good to be true, like guaranteed higher returns on investments without a real clear explanation as to what's going on. If you don't understand the technology and what exactly the product is doing, then perhaps try to do more research to figure out this is the type of thing that you want to be investing in. And generally using your good sense in trying to make these decisions and not trying to be swept up in the FOMO and the jargon that gets used in the crypto industry to make investment decisions that you might regret later on. I mean, there have been good returns in certain circumstances, but it's an incredibly volatile asset class. And so people need to be wary of that and think about that when they're actually investing in their overall portfolio. Absolutely. On your guide, thank you so much for coming to talk. Of course. Thanks for having me. Up next, the post-COVID travel boom, Hilton CEO, Chris Nassetta joins us right after the break.",https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=z4hExsMyQNo,46,2022-10-17 17:16:04

He's also former chairman of the World Travel and Tourism Council. Nassada manages almost 7,000 properties with over 1 million guest rooms spread across a multitude of brands in 122 countries. He's leading the hotel giant amid a sharp rebound in travel and tourism after the COVID pandemic. And welcome back to Yowell Finds. It's all markets summit presented by Northern Trust. I'm here with Hilton Worldwide, CEO Chris Nassada and Brad Smith. Chris, welcome back to the Yowell Market summit.",https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=z4hExsMyQNo,47,2022-10-17 17:20:47
3441," And welcome back to Yowell Finance. It's all market summit presented by Northern Trust. I'm here with Hilton Worldwide, CEO Chris Nesetta and Brad Smith. Chris, welcome back to the all market summit. So let's get right into it here. If the 2020, 2021 period in the logic industry was a depression, what would you coin? What we're seeing right now? You know, first of all, thanks Brad and Brian for having me. I'm great to be back. I think it was on a couple of years ago. You know, it was interesting in our industry, right? 20 and 21 were terrible. I mean, in the beginning of the pandemic, we were down 90% in revenues and then sort of clawed our way back through the latter part of 2020 and into 2021. But as we had different variants between Delta and Omicron and other things going on, we sort of, you know, we're going back and forth. But, you know, as we started to get stability, you know, coming through the Omicron variant in the spring and throughout and into the fall, we've seen very, very steady recovery. So I would say we're at the beginning of what I think is going to be a new golden age of travel. I mean, what happened is a lot of people thought. In fact, you guys were asking me two years ago, was anybody going to want to travel again? And it turned, and I said at that time, of course, people need to travel for all sorts of reason. They want to travel because they want to see people in places they need to travel for, you know, for business purposes, they need to travel to congregate as part of meetings and events for all sorts of reasons, whether it's, you know, culture building, whether it's sales conferences, whatever, whatever it might be. And they're doing it. And so we've seen a very strong recovery in all segments of the business led by the leisure business, but very strong recovery and business travel, very strong recovery in meetings and events. And it continued throughout the summer, and it is continuing into the fall. So I'd say, you know, we're in the midst of a very strong rebound coming out of your words, not mine, a depression for hospitality businesses in 2021. Chris, take us further into that demand rebound that you're seeing right now. And especially as it relates to the corporate travel, this is a cohort of consumers that really accounts for so much of the profit margins for leisure and hospitality businesses. So when you're re-engaging with them, you know, what have you been able to track to say in your forecasts, going even into next year that this is going to continue to return, especially as they're looking across some of their own travel and expense policies. And that's tightening a little bit right now. Yeah, well, I mean, yeah, clearly that is, and we expect it to continue. Having said that, there's a huge amount of pent up demand, Brad, that is being released for all sorts of business travel. When you back up and look at the core of our business travel population, even pre-COVID, it was 80% small and medium-sized businesses, that's probably about 85, maybe even a little bit higher today. And what we found during COVID, certainly in recovery, is that there are a lot more resilient. And the reason is that they're running their businesses, they have to get out and travel. They have to meet their partners. Their salespeople have to get out. They have to go to their other offices. And so they don't have as much of the luxury of saying that they're not going to travel. And so what we've seen is the big corporate business transient has been, is recovered nicely, and is recovering in a very strong way now, but is still not back to historic levels where small and medium businesses are above 2019 historical high water marks. And I think it has a lot to do, as I said, with just people going for an extended period of time without doing the basic things that they needed to do to run their business. And I think it was a really neat idea to think that you could do everything virtually and everything on Zoom, and you could do all your culture building and all your innovation, and all your sales, and all the partner and relationship work in a very efficient format, but the real truth is you can't. And I think that was proven. And so I think what we're seeing is sort of the other side of that where people certainly are.",https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=z4hExsMyQNo,48,2022-10-17 17:25:02
3442," in format, but the real truth is you can't. And I think that was proven. And so I think what we're seeing is sort of the other side of that, where people certainly are going to use technology. I'm not going to be silly about it in different ways. And the technology as it advances will take certain tripocations and change them. But they're just being replaced with higher value tripocations because people realize they have to be out and meeting one-on-one or in groups with people. And so I feel very good about where things are going. And clearly the macro environment is more challenging. There's no question that here in the US and in much of the world with inflation where it is that central banks, including the Fed here at home, are going to do what they have to do to slow demand in order to get inflation under control. I think that's a given. I think it would be crazy to say that that's not happening and going to continue to happen. But what's happening in our business is, as you said, we were not a beneficiary of COVID. We got beaten up quite badly. And we're seeing sort of the unwinding of a lot of that that gives us quite a bit of wind in our sales. I think for a reasonably extended period of time, what are those things that are being released? Well, people are changing their spending patterns, right? They are spending, during COVID, they spend all their time online buying things, okay? Whatever that was, cars, washers, dryers, microwaves, things, phones, technology. Now they're shifting their spending patterns back to what they had been doing pre-COVID, which has been a multi-decade trend towards spending on experiences. Well, we're experiences. So we have this big secular shift back to experiences. The other thing we have going on is international travel. The world is almost all of the world is open up. There are parts that are still not, probably China being the most notable, certain parts of Asia, all of the Japan is opening up. And as that occurs, you're starting to get all of that international travel that occurred prior to 2019, sort of back in and going. We have a long way to go to get back where we were, but it is starting to happen. And then as I already mentioned, just pent up to man. Just people had two and a half years of not doing things they needed to do, whether that was for leisure or business or meetings and events. And that is being released. So in the face of some macro headwinds, we have some pretty nice tailwinds that are propelling our recovery forward still. And you can look at the industry data we haven't reported. So I'm not going to talk about our data, but you can look at all the industry data up through last week. And you're not seeing signs in any of the segments of our business that suggests that the consumer is that things are weakening. They continue to sort of power up and continue to recover in a positive way. Well, Chris, just some food for thought. I stated a Hilton recently and I did a Zoom call. So just to give you a little insight into how I'm the new face of... I love that. I'm the new face of business travel. Hey, Brian. Yeah. But here's the thing. Mobility is... You're making my case to a degree that I've... We didn't talk about today, but I've talked about many times. The world is getting more mobile. Technology is enabling that. You had a lot of other things that enabled it low-cost airlines and other things over the last 20 or 30 years. But technology is connecting the world, speeding the world up and making people more mobile. And the reality is COVID accelerated that process where the office environment is changing, how you work, how I work, how everybody works is changing. In a way that I think people are going to be on the road more. People being on the road more and being more mobile is very good for our business. Chris, my back at the envelope math right now has you being the CEO, a public company, for 22 years. Of course, first with host, now with Hilton. You've seen some economic cycles. Does it feel like what the Federal Reserve is doing is going to slow the economy down markedly? Does it feel like we're headed into recessions of recessions past?

3443, is going to slow the economy down markedly does this feel like we're headed into recessions of recessions past well it's really hard to know and i'm not an economist all of all leave that to others you're gonna have on that are smarter than i am on those matters i do believe that what the fed is doing is going to slow uh... the economy down i mean they've stated it that is their intention uh... that is what they need to do and so i think that they will do it uh... i am certainly hopeful that as a result of the actions that they're taking along with some of the natural things that are that are going on that that have pushed inflation so high sort of working their way through the system some of the supply chain issues around the world is those loosen up some of the labor issues around the world particularly in the west as as some of those free up some of the commodities issues that have been so uh... difficult which already have started to sort of ease not not just oil but other other commodities i think as you the accommodation of sort of the natural print you know process of those things sort of working their way through the system along with what the fed is doing uh... will slow the economy will help bring inflation down and and the hope is allows the fed at some point over the next six or twelve months to sort of stabilize having done their job with inflation more in a control and allow the economy to get its footing again and start uh... process of re-acceleration that is my hope i you know what are the odds right uh... i don't know that you know my own view is that there's a reasonably good chance that we will get a you know reasonable landing you know which is sort of soft to bumpy-ish landing with the economy and as i said it'll be what it'll be in the in the case of our business in industry i think that the tailwinds that we have you know we're are gonna take us for a while just because there's some natural structural things i already described that are happening that are that are wind in our sales that are going to you know get us through a decent period of time depends how long and how deep any slowdown is to know what the impact will be and obviously macro impact is could have impact on us ultimately but you know our businesses in fabulous shape are balance sheets and incredible shape our margins or higher than they've ever been right one in five rooms under construction the world have helped and brands on them were opening more than a hotel a day let's talk about that construction we're performing at the highest levels broadly you know if you look through q two uh... from a margin and profitability point of view that we ever have Chris let's talk about that room development because as i look across the number of rooms that you have in development at least as of the end of the most recent quarter it's in surplus of four hundred thousand rooms that are in development right now and so we think through the development pipeline and when those come online how long does it typically take for the property to be a creative to the business and has some of the more short term home stays that the trends in the market are clearly pointing to from consumers has that change the type of developments that you bring online that really that really hasn't so the gestation period once it's under construction at about half of those four hundred plus thousand rooms are under construction depends on where in the world you are but i'd say it's twenty four to thirty months uh... sort of on average you know maybe eighteen thirty months that depending on where you are in the world but things have gotten a little bit longer given all the supply chain issue so twenty four to thirty months before uh... once it starts before it's open and it's generating fees what we have seen is um... you know certainly the extended state business that and of which we are you know a huge participant with home with sweets and home to sweets by hilton have been uh... the best performers throughout covid uh... and they continue to perform well and so given more mobility i think those sorts of products you know have been somewhat favored but not to the exclusion of the others all of our brands at this point you know all eighteen are growing at at a healthy pace or driving the highest levels of market share that we've ever seen and the reality is that the man patterns whether or not exactly what they were pre-COVID and i do think there'll be a bit of a shift uh... when we get fully to the other side and get stabilized it's a lot more like it was uh... pre-COVID,https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=z4hExsMyQNo,50,2022-10-17 17:33:34
3444, COVID and I do think there'll be a bit of a shift when we get fully to the other side and get stabilized. It's a lot more like it was pre-COVID than you would think and so people are going back to the you know back to their you know back to their normal sort of travel habits by and large. Again a little bit more leisure a little bit more bleezure sort of the blend of the business and the leisure sort of put together a little bit more you know extended stay so longer stay which favors some of the extended stay brands we have a little bit more but nothing you know nothing off the charts that suggests that any of the brands that we have in our family brands today isn't really appealing to customers. Now as we think about new brands and we are and I'm not going to I'm not going to get ahead of myself but yeah we're definitely thinking about you know on the margin some of the things that did shift during COVID do they suggest us that there may be opportunities in terms of serving a broader customer base and I you know I do think you know watch over the next you know watch over the next six or twelve months I think you may see some things from us that sort of address that. Chris real quick before I let you go I went back to my notes from 2019 when you're at the all market summit I didn't ask you this I'm going to ask you now what is the secret to longevity you've been the CEO of building for 15 years how do you get that done give us some secrets. I don't know you know what it's balanced steady hand on the wheel you know have have a great strategy build a great culture have a great team you can leverage off of make sure you have balance in life and you know while this is of course really important to me that they're you know friends and family and other other interests that are important and you know keep everything in perspective but but but in life and business I think my longevity has a lot to do with just having an approach of having steady hands on the wheel whether it's my business life my personal life have a plan work the plan don't jerk the wheel around just steady approach. You my friend are timeless you still look 32 Hilton CEO Chris to set it thanks for joining us again a few few great a few more great hairs than I did in 2019 but that you know it goes with the territory you said that not me Chris has said always good to see you thanks for spending some time as we appreciate it good to see you guys thank you Brad over to you the stock market is still open still open indeed and in fact it's about lunchtime or lunchtime is wrapping up at least then you can kind of see that in some of the intraday activity here we've taken at least a little bit of a tick higher here most recently over about the past 30 minutes here in this 1 p.m. hour so taking a look at the Dow Jones industrial average you're seeing that up right now on the day intraday by about 2% 592 points added on today's session let's check in on the NASDAQ composite as well you're seeing that up by 3% more than 3% at this point in time catching a bid to the tune of about 343 points and the S&P 500 you're also seeing that in the green by about 2.7% want to dive into some of the sectors that we're tracking very quickly here we'll take you on over to a heat map view and taking a look at some of the 11 S&P 500 sectors well yeah they're all in positive territory right now with this rip your face off type of rally at least here today that we're seeing at this moment we've got more broadly the S&P 500 up by about 2.7% but outpacing some of the move higher yeah you've got consumer discretionary keep a close eye on excel y as we move on throughout the rest of today's session that's up 4% also want to take a look at tech here you've got that up by about 2.9% and here's why let's get on to another heat map we heard you like maps so we've got some more maps for your heat maps out there the apple stock apple shares you're seeing that up by about 2.9% here on the day some other mega cap tech also ripping to the upside here amazon that's up by about 5 and 3 quarters percent Microsoft MST up 3 and a half percent google alphabet alpha google whatever you're calling them at home call them up right now they're up by about 4% there you've got some lingering red here in the screen here of course you've got applied materials that looks like it's in negative territory right now by about a quarter of a percent but then even more so as we get into some of the Dow components as well you're not going to find too many laggards there in fact none all 30 Dow components are in positive territory right now being led largely by some of those tech names jp morgan also up by about 4.9% we've got more earnings that are coming forward over the course of this week and so keep a close eye still on some of the,https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=z4hExsMyQNo,51,2022-10-17 17:38:01

And so keep a close eye still on some of the banks that have yet to report. We'll get into the regionals as well. But even more so as we get some more of these Dow industrials that start to report, that's exactly where the markets could latch on to what they have to say about their future forecasts. We've got more right after the break. Coming up, believe it or not, the holidays are right around the corner. We'll take a look at what's ahead for the retail sector with Target CEO Brian Cornell.

Cornell is tackling some big issues head on, inflation, a slowing economy, and those pesky supply chain issues. But in a year of retail train wrecks, yeah, that's you bet bet them beyond. Target has outpaced the competition. And the fight to stay ahead, Cornell has made some very tough decisions, embracing the athletes mantra, no pain, no gain. And so far, it seems to be working. Target, chairman and CEO Brian Cornell joins us now. Brian, good to see you. In person, yeah, we'll finance HQ. It's great to be back together. So I have been, I've been making a list. I've been going to Target. I go there every weekend. You know this. And I'm like, I have to ask Brian these things when he's in person. First, the retail inventory glut. Is it over? When does it end? Yeah. Well, Brian, one, I appreciate the fact that you're always in our stores. And you do send me notes, and I appreciate that. And you know back in June, we made a pretty bold and decisive decision. We said, all right, inventory is the built up. Consumer shopping habits have changed. They moved into different categories. And we said we're going to get out in front of us. So for Target, we put in that inventory problem behind us. And now we can focus on great execution, delighting our guests, getting ready for the big holiday season. So we were pretty decisive and said, we're not going to just let this roll into the next quarter. We'll deal with it upfront. And now we're excited that we're ready to play for the holiday season. I followed your entire time as CEO as Target. You've made a bunch of bold decisions. You exited Canada. First thing you did, I remember writing on that story as soon as it out. You 2017 investor conference. We're investing billions of dollars. Markets didn't like it. Now you're clearing out inventory. How hard is it to make these decisions as a leader? Well, if I think about each one of those decisions, there was probably a very similar model that we followed. Said, all right, what's the right thing for the target brand? What's the right thing for the target guest? What's the right thing for our team? And when we think about it through that lens, it's always the right thing for our shareholder long term. So whether it was leaving Canada and putting all of our focus on the US business or making that decision back in 2017, when others were closing stores, we said, we're going to double down on stores and put stores at the center of our strategy. We did the same approach as summer and said, all right, across all of retail, inventory is a reason. We're going to get out in front of this and make sure that we have the right assortment. We deliver great value. We protect that guest experience in our stores. And we also did the right thing for our team. I think you mentioned this is your ninth holiday season as CEO of target. How do you think this season will shape up compared to those other eight or nine? Well, Brian, you know we spent a lot of time talking to consumers, talking to our guests and the one thing we've heard throughout this year is they want to enjoy and celebrate seasonal moments. So the guests just told us they're excited about Halloween. Still a few days away. They're looking forward to Thanksgiving and celebrating with family and friends and they are looking forward to the Christmas holidays. So we know the consumer in America, the guest at Chocks Target, they are excited about seasonal holidays and we're going to be ready to make sure we delight them.

Well, everyone's talking about recession and, you know, sitting here today, there's different points of view. You talk to bank CEOs, some gloom and doom, others are saying really healthy consumer. What we've seen all year long is really healthy traffic. And a guess that's shopping in our stores and shopping online so that strength and traffic has been driving our business. We've delivered solid comps throughout this year. We expect that to continue over the balance of the holiday season. All right, that is good to hear. So back to my shopping list here, if you can, you can just indulge in. Let me do it. 42 count of tide pods online, $13. Now, I'm a dumb millennial. I don't keep track of things that I buy in terms of price. But to me, that seems like a lot. Our shoppers to your stores trading down. That seems like a lot of money for basic essential. Yeah. Well, Brian, you know core to our proposition is making sure we deliver great value and affordability. Every time you shop. So we measure pricing really carefully, burst our competition. And we want to make sure we're priced right daily. We deliver great value and affordability. So on those items that you're looking at, we've got to make sure we have the right price every time you shop. And the guess is expect that from Target. How is your private label business doing in this situation? It's a very good one. So we now have a $30 billion own brand business. $30 billion. And it's performed incredibly well throughout the pandemic and continues to grow. So whether you're shopping, good and gather, or getting something for yourself, you know, good fellow that you can wear on set, or shopping any of our great brands, we now have $11 billion own brands in our portfolio. So that business just continues to perform. And we'll perform over the holiday season. It's huge, Brian. So yesterday I was actually in Bayshore Target. All right. We can Bayshore Target, Shoutout Bayshore Target. 15 registers open. Two of them were self checkout, but 15 registers total. 11 of them were closed. Is that the worker shortage? Brian, we've been staffed throughout the pandemic. We have 400,000 team members across the country. And going back to 2017, you remember we made a big commitment back then to invest in our team. We said in 2017, we were going to get to a starting minimum wage of $15. Now sitting here today, we made another big investment just a few months ago to say, all right, depending on the market, we're going to start at either 15, but it could be as much as $24 an hour to make sure that we have the team in place. We're going to hire another 100,000 seasonal team members for this holiday season. So because of our investment in wages, in benefits, in training, you know that we launched a debt-free educational assistance program last year. We made that over 70,000 team members raise their hands. I want to take advantage of that. So those investments have allowed us to retain and attract great talent. And we'll continue to make sure our team is our most valuable asset. 100,000 workers, that's a lot. Are you confident you can get that number? We are. We're off to a great start. Interesting. So you spent some time in the grocery industry. Of course, Target is big in selling groceries. And I know you watched a competition. What do you think about this Coralger and Albranson's merger? Does this change the game for the grocery industry and doesn't make you change how you think about your grocery offerings? Well, we'll watch it carefully. Obviously, it's a new announcement. It's going to take some time to close. But we're going to continue to focus on our food and beverage business. I mean, we've seen really strong growth and market share gains for over 20 consecutive quarters. So the strength of that business has really connected with the guests during the pandemic and has come out of the pandemic is really a strong driver of growth. So we're all in on the food and beverage business. We'll continue to invest. We've had a couple of great, own brands there. The Good and Gather is a $2 billion brand for us now in Food and Beverage. The guest has really responded all to a brand called Favorite Day. So we feel really good about food and beverage driving traffic and complementing our multi-category portfolio. I think I've seen wine at a Target too. These are big departments. They are. They're really important. And it's important for our guests. So we always listen to the guest and they've told us Food and Beverage is an important category for them. It drives traffic, but I also know when they're there. They're shopping beauty. They're shopping in a peril. They're getting something for their home. So it compliments our business really nicely. They're new shops, the new cosmetic shops and inside of the...",https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=z4hExsMyQNo,54,2022-10-17 17:51:20
3448," Also, when they're there, they're shopping beauty, they're shopping in a peril, they're getting something for their home, so it compliments our business really nicely. The new shops, the new cosmetic shops inside a target, how are they starting? Oh, the ultra beauty inside a target, it's been great. Bayshore just got one again. Yeah, Bayshore target. It's a big part of the store, and the interesting thing is, Brian, and you know this, obviously, walk into the stores right there. It's the first thing you see when you walk into these stores. Well, beauty's been an important category for years now, and ultra just compliments our beauty offering. And it was one of the things that our guests told us. We said, all right, what brand would you like to see here? On the top of their list, they said, we love Starbucks. We love the fact you've got Disney stores. I'll take away my Apple stores. But they love the fact that we've added ultra beauty. So those partnerships, whether it's CBS and pharmacy and Starbucks in almost every store, more Apple shops, more Disney shops, and now, Ulta, it just compliments the great offering we have of national brands and home brands. You just signed on for another, I think the press release said about three years. So let's just say three years. What does the next three years in Brian Cornell's look like, life look like in terms of charm and sea of tardiness? I think it's gonna be another chapter of growth for our company and continuing to invest in remodeling stores and building new stores and great locations like Bayshore, developing our own brands, accelerating our national brand partnerships, and making sure that we continue to invest in our team. And there's lots of things I'm proud of. And the fact that we added $30 billion of growth since the start of the pandemic is something that our team feels really good about. What I feel to me, what really fires me up is the investments that we've made in our team. And seeing the diversity in our organization, seeing the growth opportunities, seeing our culture come to life. When I talk about culture, we always talk about a culture of care and growth and winning together. That's something that I'm gonna continue to focus on for years to come. Brian, I've only known you to be a fired up guy. You're fired up right now talking about the target's business in its future. Where does that come from on a personal level? Well, for me, this is an amazing brand. And I've gotta tell you, I wake up every day feeling the responsibility of leading the target brand. Those 400,000 team members that work for us, those families that depend on us across the country. So I wake up with a huge sense of responsibility. And the pride I have in the team, in that brand, in the role we play in America is something that gets me up each and every day, feeling great about the role that I sit in today. Growing up, did you see yourself as a CEO? Yeah. Well, Brian, I think you know my story. And I grew up right down the road here in Queens, as a poor kid who kind of has worked for everything I've had. And I never even imagined I'd be sitting in a chair like this, but I embraced the moment. And I just feel proud to work for a great company. I was just having a moment there. I very much identify with that, Brian, that much is for sure. How do you, how have you balanced it all? This has been a very challenging three years for executives, not just CEOs, CFOs, COOs. How do you balance this time? And how do you just stay grounded? Yeah. Well, I'll go back to. I work with a great leadership team. The best leadership team I've ever been part of. I have an amazing wife who's been married to me for 40 years now, a great family that supports me. And as you know, I take care of myself. I make sure that I get to the gym every day and I go, yeah, I told you out of that. Yes, I shouted that out. Full disclosure, when Brian, that news hit the wire that you were staying for three years. I said, look, Brian's a fit guy. He can stay on for another 15 years. How do you think about succession? At some point, you will not be the CEO of Target. Shareholder, I'm sure, won't like it, but is that one of your most important jobs right now outside of planning for holidays? I think for any CEO, succession has to be something you focus on every day. Not just for my role, but for my leadership team and the officers and those key roles throughout the company. So we spend a tremendous amount of time. I have a fabulous HR partner, Melissa Kramer. And we spend time every week talking about talent. Last week I was traveling, I was in Washington, DC. I had a group of 28 black target officers that were with us in DC. We visited stores together, we spent time with outside speakers. And I'm always investing in talent. And making sure I get.",https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=z4hExsMyQNo,55,2022-10-17 17:55:43
3449," that were with us in DC. We visited stores together. We spent time with outside speakers. And I'm always investing in talent. And making sure I get to know the team. I spend time with them. We travel together. But as a CEO of a company like ours, $106 billion growth company, you've constantly be focusing on talent development. And thinking about who are the future leaders? They're going to guide this company. Whenever that day comes, and I'm not here, fair enough. Well, let's just, before we let you go, we're running short on time here. Let's just go back to the economy real quick. Because we are up against the holiday shopping season. So you see nowhere session. You think consumers will spend this season like they spent last season? I think it's just a very unusual time from an economic standpoint. And we're coming out of a pandemic. There were lots of stimulus checks that have been written, lots of childcare support. We're starting to see a consumer get back to normal life. They want to travel again. They're out in restaurants. So sitting here today, on one side, we've got inflation that's at a 40-year high. But unemployment incredibly low. And I think those two things are balancing out right now. So we continue to see a healthy guest shopping in our stores and shopping online. We'll see how they react throughout the holiday season. But when we talk to them, they continue to say they want to celebrate the holidays. And we know they're out on the streets of New York. They're in restaurants. They're in our stores. So right now, we're seeing a stable environment. Do you worry about, and I'm sure in the green we heard, Hilton CEO, Chris Nacetta just talked to us about what the Fed may do to the economy. Do you fear the Fed and what they're doing? Well, we've got to watch it carefully. But in our business, Brian, we've got to be agile. We've got to prepare for any environment. It's part of the strength of our multi-category portfolio. We sell food and beverage products and household essentials. We have all your beauty needs. We have toys for kids and apparel and home items. So we'll balance our portfolio to make sure we're meeting the needs of the consumer no matter what the environment looks like. All right, let's leave it there. Brian Cornell, always good to see you. Great to see you. It's been a pleasure following your time as you have targeted. I'm looking forward to continuing to follow it indeed. All right, we'll be right back. Coming up, Farma forging ahead. Pfizer CEO Albert Borla lays out the company's plans for growth in a post-COVID world.",https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=z4hExsMyQNo,56,2022-10-17 18:00:20
3450," Too quicküyorsunary translation is tired of male nostra The world is trying to move past COVID-19. Many people in the U.S. are there already with large, maskless gatherings, pretty much the norm at this point. Pfizer, of course, one of the companies that helped us get here. It is still relying on COVID for a lot of its revenue, but it's CEO has his eye on what will drive the next phase of growth. And that's CEO, of course, his Albert Borla. He is joining me now. It's great to see you again. Thank you so much for being here. Thank you for having me here. You know, as I said, we are trying to move, of course, past COVID, but it's not quite done with us yet. You yourself had COVID a couple of times, I believe, in the August timeframe. And I wonder if we're ever going to get to the point where vaccines can actually prevent COVID and its variance entirely. Is that the end goal? Is it a realistic goal? First of all, I had COVID once in August and the one in October. And the second time was in the UK. I think that the goal is to bring vaccines that they can last a year. I think that would simplify things, because I believe that people will not be that diligent to do the vaccinations as they are tired of making too many vaccines, and they want stability. But if we have a yearly vaccine, which is something that people are used like flu, for example, this is something that will take a significant amount of people to be able to get it. And yes, I think with the right vaccines, we can prevent from infections, to hospitalizations, to deaths and severe diseases. But of course, the vaccine has shown that death and hospitalization, the prevention is very high. And it comes to infections, so the virus is a bit lower. So it's more comparable to a flu than say, a polio, for example, something that you're just trying to eradicate. Oh, unfortunately, this virus is very nasty and makes a lot of variations and insists. So I think, although nobody knows, most scientists are in agreement that for the years to come, the virus will be around us. But we are lucky because we have a vaccine that can adapt. As much as the virus stops, the new technologies allow us the vaccine.",https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=z4hExsMyQNo,57,2022-10-17 18:04:22
3451," The virus will be around us. But we are lucky because we have a vaccine that can adapt. As much as the virus stops, the new technologies allow us the vaccines to very quickly follow and have a vaccine that is very effective against the current virus. And indeed, you all have just introduced a booster that is targeted at one variant of that virus, Omokhan, specifically. Do you envision it where everyone ideally will get a booster every year or will it just be recommended for certain portions of the population? I think the health authorities will make those recommendations while they see what is the severity of the strains that are available. But in many cases, I do not expect that people will comply with these recommendations as they did may be in the first months of the pandemic that people were really scared. So, complications will be getting the way. So, I see that the volumes of people that they will be getting the vaccine will be less. And that's what we've seen already, right? Uptake of boosters has been pretty low. I saw one figure recently. One in 10 eligible people are getting them. You all have sold a number of boosters already to the U.S. government. So, that demand taking care of. You're forecasting $32 billion in vaccine sales for this year, $22 billion for Paxlovid, which is to treat it. What kind of visibility do you have beyond this year in terms of those sales? I have kind of visibility. They know orders that already have been signed and I can calculate the demand. But 23 is going to be a year that likely will transition to many markets from governmental purchases to a competition in the marketplace, which means that vaccines and treatments going through the normal challenge and dissipate that will happen in the U.S. in 23. Now, as with all our products, we will provide guidance to the best of our knowledge about how much we expect next year to make when we give guidance for 2023. Now, I saw an estimate today, the prices are going to go up as it goes towards a normal type of marketplace. I saw an estimate from a company called Airfinity that the average price for doses is going to go to $37 next year from $18 last year. Does that seem in line with what you all are planning? I don't want to speak about price, but right now, in our contact with the U.S., the average price was 30 and that was divided between some that they are less, some doses, multivials. And then all the way to 50 in the single vials and likely in the loans you will have all the way to 50. The vaccines will be priced based on their cost effectiveness. And the cost effectiveness is multiple of what it is right now. The price when we give to the governments in the pandemic. You, of course, came out with the vaccine in partnership with Biontech, which is the German company. And you split the revenue with them. How long has that partnership last? Will it last even as we get to different stages of the pandemic? Is it an indefinite partnership? Absolutely. It's an indefinite partnership in COVID. And we are both focusing and bringing new science into building new, most effective vaccines. Apparently, the one most important element is what we discussed before. The vaccine that will last a year. And, of course, combination with flu is another very important. Right. I wanted to ask you about that. You just started phase three trials, right? Of the combination COVID flu vaccine. I think that was in mid-September that that's right. But we started, it is a combination study of a flu. Right. RNA vaccine. Right. And we are about to start a combo as well. And what kind of timeline then do you look for for that? I think the flu vaccine likely based on events, because an event during study, if there's a lot of flu, will come in for a sometime next year. We don't do immunobridzing for that one. And we are very confident that the vaccine will have very ill-efficacy. So we went directly to study the efficacy of the vaccine. For regulatory purposes, you're required only to do immunostaties. So that would take their time. And then the combination, if you have already and approved COVID-19, and you have already submitted about to be approved flu, the combination is very easy. Now, you mentioned more international expansion as well. And different ways of marketing the vaccine. You have a partnership in South Africa with the semi-national company there, which is starting production of the vaccine now. But it sounds like that they may not actually bring it to market until next year.",https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=z4hExsMyQNo,58,2022-10-17 18:08:24
3452," I'm national company there, which is starting production of the vaccine now. But it sounds like that they may not actually bring it to market until next year. What can you tell us about where they are with that and whether that is sort of a model for other partnerships we might see around the globe with Pfizer? First of all, this partner is a very trusted partner of us in South Africa. And we did this project because there was a lot of requests to feel good, better, the African countries that were in their continent, production. But unfortunately, a few months after the first months, we had enough vaccines for all that were produced. But those countries did very small number of vaccinations. It was not the availability of the vaccine, but it was many other reasons, infrastructure of them to be able to administer it, a hesitancy from people. And I think this is the issue that we need all to address to make sure that those people will believe and they have a system that it's easily can vaccinate. Yes, that's been an issue, obviously everywhere, not just there, of course. What can we look for next from the messenger RNA platform? Because there's been a lot of talk about that this is just the beginning. It's been worked on for years. COVID was sort of the big breakthrough event for better and for worse, mostly for worse for the globe. But what now there's talk about cancer vaccines? It used for other applications. So where is Pfizer on that? I would say there are two horizons. One is these applications and the other is the technology itself. There's a lot of work that's happening to improve the technology. Now it's modified RNA, could be self-apprifying RNA, could be circular RNA. There are a lot of work happening right now that can have a way better even RNA vaccines. The other thing it is what applications. And I think the easiest hanging fruit, the lowest hanging fruit, will be other vaccines. So there is a lot of work right now that is happening. And we will know, I think, this year, next year, if those work. A second horizon will be in cancer. There is a lot of work that is happening right now. And then the third horizon, I think it is in zine editing. Zine editing is a very exciting technology that for people that they have a mistake from birth on their DNA and that causes a significant disease to them, you can go and correct this mistake and for those people is really salvation. So I think we will see very exciting things from this technology. And are you planning to do much of that work internally at Pfizer? There have been some questions on the part of analysts about whether you, how much progress you could make without a partner as in beyond tech in the case of the COVID vaccine. So talk to me about how that's working within Pfizer. No, there are issues with intellectual property who has the technologies and the platform and there are issues with the combined work of two companies producing more. I think with BioNTech we have a lot of collaborations. For example, we are about to enter in a zoster vaccine that again is happening with them. And we are working to expand even further. So there will be a lot of things that we are doing together with BioNTech. But they are doing a lot of things alone and we are doing a lot of things alone. We are not shy from collaborations. Actually we believe collaborations is a better way to bring science to the world today. For example, in zine editing we are partnering with another biotech company that they have appropriate technology and to have all the expertise and scale to be able to produce solutions faster. Now, we are going into the pandemic. Before the pandemic even began, there were a lot of questions about Pfizer facing patent cliff, etc., etc. Then the pandemic happened. You had recently come into the company and we are trying to change it culturally and the way that Pfizer did business. The pandemic sort of did that and you did that in concert. So where are you now in terms of that question of what is next for Pfizer? What is going to be the next source of revenue as you are going to see patents roll off for various products? I think the pandemic from that aspect, you know, the bad things that brought to the world, brought something very important that gave us to the Pfizer organization a belief that nothing is impossible.

3454," old, for free. So just from a financial barrier, there are not substantial. Now, let me be very clear, there's still other challenges. These things are widely available vaccines in 70,000 spots. Basically, almost everybody lives within five miles of a place where you can get a vaccine or a treatment. So then the question is, what are the barriers? For some people, it's still hard to take time off. We've been working with employers encouraging them to take time off. For other people, you know, if you're a mom, a single mom with three, you know, doing two or three jobs, it's going to be difficult. So we have been, we've done a lot of work to try to make child care more accessible. There are still those challenges, but I do think for a vast majority of Americans, access and financial barriers are not what's slowing people. What about indoor air quality? I know there was a recent summit to discuss that, and there's been a lot of attention from some advocates about how to go about addressing that and the role that it plays in the spread of COVID. When you talk about not needing to bring back mitigation measures, I think about indoors and what we really need to think about for this winter. Yeah. Now that's a great question. So let's take a minute to talk about that. You know, I have been a practicing clinician for 20 years. I usually am in the hospital taking care of patients in December, January. The hospitals are always full, pre-pandemic, largely because of the flu. Throw in COVID on top of that. Throw in potentially a significant RSV season. It's going to be very hard to manage our healthcare system if we don't make important changes. And one of the things that we can do is to bring the burden of respiratory viruses way down for everybody and for all viruses and improving indoor air quality, better ventilation, better filtration. Many of these things, by the way, are really cheap to do. So you don't need to spend billions upgrading massive things. These are relatively cheap and easy interventions. They can make a substantial difference. I actually am convinced if people get their vaccines, if we make these improvements in indoor air quality, that the government's been pushing and trying to help people do, we really can get through a good fall in winter season this year and make it safer in the years ahead. I should have a very, very serious follow-up question for you. Looking at your job prospects. We know that you came on board to help lead this response, but are you surprised that you're still in this role now? And do you see yourself returning to academia anytime soon? Well, am I surprised that I'm still in this role? No. Like, when I think about the work that we have to do every day, I get up early in the morning, I come into the office, we have long days, what are we trying to do? We're trying to help make sure that we have vaccines available for Americans and treatments and tests. We have to work tracking sub variants and making sure that Americans are protected against that. There is plenty for me and my team to do that no one has been thinking about, boy, we're bored, we're running out of stuff, we got to close up shop. That's not been part of our conversation. We are focused on doing the work ahead of us and none of us are thinking about kind of what happens after that. Well, I want to follow up on that. I remember, you know, back in April 2021, back when you were in your previous role, it was the day I was getting a vaccine and you were talking about the reports that have been coming about about the difference between who is opting for a vaccine and how it went along party lines and how that wasn't helpful. Now that you're in the hot scene, now that you're in the middle of all the politics, do you still stand by that? Do you, or has the job changed how you perceive or how you see how politicized everything is? Yeah, I still don't see this as a deeply political thing. I understand other people do that in political commentators, see a political lens on almost everything. The way I look at it is a majority of people who voted for Donald Trump have gotten vaccinated, the majority of people who voted for Joe Biden have gotten vaccinated. Majority of Democrats, majority of Republicans, people are getting vaccinated. More people need to go out and get vaccinated as we think about this fall and winter campaign. It is not helpful to look at how you manage a respiratory virus. It's killed a million Americans. It is not helpful to look at that through a political lens. It is helpful to look at it through a medical and public health lens. And in that context, whether you're a Democrat or a Republican, you're going to benefit from these vaccines. You're going to get, but you're going to benefit from treatments. And that's my message and that's what we try to do every day. And lastly, do you think that there are age limits or age parameters around who's really more in need of a vaccine than others?

3455," or individuals or more vulnerable individuals really should get the vaccine and younger healthy ones maybe able to pass. Yeah, the way I look at this, I don't look at it that way. The way I look at it is we know older people are at high risk. By the way, older people are at high risk for almost every condition. So that's not a new idea. A lot of people seem to have discovered that for COVID that's also true for the flu, by the way. What we know is that older people are gonna, they're at the highest risk, they're gonna benefit the most. Younger people are at lower risk, they're benefits still outweighs their risk of getting vaccinated, which is why I've encouraged all my family to get vaccinated, all my friends to get vaccinated, my nieces and nephews and kids have all gotten vaccinated because for them to benefit outweighs the risk, but no question about it, the biggest benefits are in older Americans. And if you're over 50, certainly if you're over 65, you've got to go get these vaccines because it's actually literally could save your life. It's a difference between life and death. Dr. Ashish, to your point, I think a lot of people learned a lot of things about health care throughout this pandemic, but Dr. Ashish, Joe Whitehouse COVID-19 Coordinator, thank you so much for doing us today. Thank you. Coming up, it revolutionized fast casual dining. Now Chipotle has some new tricks up its sleeve. CEO Brian Nicholl joins us next.

3456," Rattling Rattling Tr Express Brian Nichol is the chairman and CEO of Chipotle. He runs 2700 restaurants in North America and Europe. Nichol isn't still to culture at Chipotle of serving food that is both fresh and raised responsibly. Under his leadership, Chipotle has posted record sales and profits despite increased food and labor costs. Nichol plans to keep the growth story going by opening more restaurants and using new technology to drive sales. Oh yeah, and to keep that guacamole flowing. I'm here at Chipotle, CEO Brian Nichol and Yau finds his Brook Dupalma Brian. Good to see you here. Thanks for joining us. Look, we've been talking all day long about how the economy isn't isn't doing great. You have stocks in the tank. You have guys like me spending up to buy double meat bowls from a Chipotle. How do you explain all this? Well, you know, look, I think what we've really focused on is making sure that in challenging times and in good times, we ensure we've got great culinary. We've got our teams trained and ready to get people exactly what they want at the speed of which they want it and hopefully that's why guys like you keep coming back to the double meat. So I'm glad to hear that. Brian, is it just that your consumer is better off financially? You just focus on a higher income consumer and right now, buying large, they're okay. They have the money to go out there and shop and shop at Chipotle. Look, our brand is positioned in a really great spot. Obviously, as you mentioned, we have some higher household income on average in our customers. We also skew younger, but you know, we serve pretty much all income groups and I don't love to see some of the lower income groups being impacted the way they have, but we're fortunate that we're positioned the way we are with our commitment to food with integrity. And frankly, I think the job that the brand has done to position itself in this space of being, you know, an elevated food experience. So we get people trading down and I think we also get people trading up and just in a really unique position. So, you know, we're pretty fortunate. No doubt about it. Speaking of that younger consumer and Piper Sandler's fall 2022 team survey Chipotle was voted number three. It's also the most preferred Hispanic cuisine level for across upper income and average income teens there. You're also making headway on B real on TikTok. You have two million followers. How exactly are you viewing these social media apps as an asset to Chipotle and really engaging with that Gen Z community? Yeah, look, you know, we talk about this all the time here. We want to be a brand that's visible. We want to be a brand that's leading culture and then also in culture and you know, social media, you know, applications like B real are part of that. That's something that is just really taken off lately. My understanding is we've maxed out all our followers. We have to continue to figure out how we evolve that platform. But, you know, it's really important for us to show up in the places where people want to experience our brand and then do it in a way where it makes sense for us to show up. And, you know, we're very fortunate to have I think one of the best.",https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=z4hExsMyQNo,63,2022-10-17 18:50:48
3457," important for us to show up in the places where people want to experience our brand and then do it in a way where it makes sense for us to show up and you know we're very fortunate to have I think one of the best groups of leaders running our social media efforts or digital efforts and just really researching where young people are headed so that hopefully sometimes we're ahead of them and then other times they lead us to where we need to be. Another place that people can experience your Chipotle experience is on roll blocks. That's another interesting foray for fast food we see the others get into the game as well. So my question here is what exactly is the opportunity that you're seeing in the overall metaverse there? You know it's hard to like put it into dollars and actual sales it's much more to do with brand relevance and I think being visible and then playing a role in people's everyday. You know people make their meal decisions or their food decisions every day multiple times a day and I think it's important for them to understand what our brand stands for which is this idea of food with integrity, great culinary. You know we're going to do the right things for our people, our food and then our customers and if they're able to pick that up through programs like roll blocks to you know be real that's hugely important to us and then look we're going to always experiment and that's partly what we're doing with roll blocks. This is more about experimenting so that we can understand where potentially future sales may come from and at a minimum right now it's definitely the right place to be to communicate with young people. Brian, before you came on I talked to Target CEO Brian Carnell. He told me he is confident that they will be able to find 100,000 workers for this holiday season. I was just blown away given the labor shortage. Talk to us about your hiring plans right now. Are you able to find the workers you need to support not only the restaurants you do have open but also the hundreds of locations you plan to open this year? They looked at that's a great question Brian and I fully believe our you know opportunity to join our company and grow with our company and what we stand for will attract the right employees. You know we will open well over 200 restaurants this year and I've actually got to staff that with new people and then we also get to promote people into these roles and you know I think as people understand 90% of our promotions come from within we have industry leading benefits, both wages and those benefits that surround you whether it's healthcare, mental health, you know debt free degrees. We find that we're able to attract a huge amount of people and then the key piece for us is developing them, training them so that they become future leaders as we grow this company. But you know look I'm 100% confident we will get these restaurants staffed. Also 100% confident that our leaders in our restaurant will take the time to develop our crew so that they ultimately become general managers, our general managers become field leaders and you know you can see how this cascades into just bigger jobs so people have a growth their career with your poll A as well as move forward our purpose of cultivating a better world. So we'll get it done. And Brian on the employee front it seems like this is the year of unionization for restaurants not only at Chipotle but of course others in the fast food industry. This past late August one location in Michigan did choose to unionize I'm just curious if you could provide an update on the stance of Chipotle on unionization. Look I was disappointed to see that happen. You know I really don't think we need a third party to get between our restaurant teams and our company. We do a better job of communicating directly with our employees on what it takes to be successful at our company. What it takes have a great work environment and what it takes to provide a great customer experience. So it was just pointed to see it obviously we'll go through the process that we need to but you know I really don't see a need for it and hopefully going forward you know we'll continue to be able to communicate directly with our employees and grow our employees with that direct communication. Brian staying on employees if I'm correct 15% of your locations are in California. There might be law changes there coming up now that push up that minimum wage to $21 from $15 or so how would that impact Chipotle? Well you know look we already pay well beyond $15 an hour in California so the fact that national financial system goes through, you can have a hard career.",https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=z4hExsMyQNo,64,2022-10-17 18:55:16
3458," dollars or so, how would that impact it, Chipotle? Well, you know, look, we already pay well beyond $15 an hour in California. So the fact that, you know, there is legislation out there that has the potential to take the hourly to, I believe it's $21, $22 an hour. You know, that's going to put organizations like ours in a place where we'll probably have to raise prices. And, you know, it's unfortunate because it also impacts the economic model that could impact how many restaurants we even open in the future in a state like California, which is a real shame because our brand is loved in California, our employees love working at Chipotle in California. And I know the customers love getting our food. So, you know, hopefully the legislation doesn't get in the way of, you know, great economics that results in great opportunities for employees and customers. But if it does, you know, we'll deal with it accordingly, but it'd be a real shame. And in California, eight restaurants, you're also a test thing, new kitchen management system software that will help to monitor cooking times and ultimately tell employees or crew members, rather when exactly something is ready. I'm curious about how exactly these robots like this kitchen management system, but also a robot, especially like Chippy, really comes together with your crew members and how you ultimately see that spreading to other locations, rather. Yeah, look, this is something that we started down the path a couple of years ago because we asked our employees, they look, what are the tasks that either trip you up or, you know, you find very hard to get done? Or frankly, when people join our company, they say, look, I don't really love doing that work. And they're kind of figuring out how they can just be done with doing that work. So, some of the things we got feedback on were, hey, it's really tricky to know how much chicken to cook throughout the day because we get rushes, we get slow spots, then we get fast spots again. So, this is really taking, you know, artificial intelligence and understanding real time, how fast are you going through the chicken? How fast are you going through the guacamole? How many, you know, pieces of chicken do you need to go put on the grill now? Because based on what we expect happening at dinner time, this is what you need to cook. And so, it takes a lot of the guesswork out of it for the employee, and then it does it real time. So, that they can be, well, you know, our crew doesn't want to be out of anything, right? Because it's a disappointing situation for the customer, and then the crew doesn't feel like they're doing a great job. So, this is really a tool that will help them be more ready for the rush. And then if the rush exceeds what their expectations were, it informs them so that then they're prepared for the rest of their day so they continue to have a great day. You know, products like our chips, our customers always want us to be in on the menu with our chips. And so, what Chippy does is it helps us fry chips all day, right? Versus, right now we fry them at some points in the day, and then we sell through, and then it's like, oh, we're running out, now we got to go fry chips again. And, you know, look, that's a tough job, too, to be working on the fryer. And so, we got the feedback that, hey, look, if you could automate this for me, that would be a huge win. And so, there's other areas that we're working on as well. You know, we want to automate our digital make line. We're partnering with a company called Huythin, and we're really optimistic that we're going to be able to automate a lot more of that. So that our team members and crew are able to just focus more on the front line with the in-store hospitality. And then hopefully, the combination of robotics, artificial intelligence can take care of those digital orders so that they're accurate on time, and we just get people great experiences, whether it's online or in-line restaurants. Brian, two fun ones before you let you go here. Help the elephant's community know who Brian Nichol is. First, how'd you go from, from, I think I'm got this, some are in turn at PNG working on the scope, mouthwash account to being the CEO of Chipotle. Well, you know, look, it's one of those things that you never really know where your journey's going to go, but I was very fortunate to get my first job at Procter & Gamble. I got to work with a lot of great people. They took the time to invest in me so that I became, I think, much better at marketing and general management skills. And I've taken that with me down the road, and you know, here I am at Chipotle. One thing I did discover while I was at PNG at the opportunity to work on Pringles is I loved working in the space of food. And, you know, it just resonates.",https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=z4hExsMyQNo,65,2022-10-17 18:59:34
3459," And here I am at Chipotle. One thing I did discover while is FPG, at the opportunity to work on Pringles, is I loved working in the space of food. And it just resonated with me. And so fast forward here we are today. I still strongly encourage you to scope mouthwash, but obviously I'm a much bigger fan of blocker Mollie and Burrito's these days. I also know where to go with that, but let's end on this too. Because I also tell the Y'all finds, community, you were the guy when you were a talk about, you created the live moss campaign, when you came up with that, did you know that that would be the home run that has become? They still use this, Brian. Hope you're getting royalty checks. Well, look, that was another example having the opportunity to work on a great brand with great people. And we came up with what I believe was a very timeless concept around the idea of live moss. And it's great to see they continue to use it. And I continue to see that there have been success. So it's always fun to see places where you've been continue to have success with programs that you have the opportunity to work on. So very true. Well, we keep up the successful days over at Chipotle, Chipotle, CEO Brian Nickel, good to see you. And thanks for joining us as well. Y'all find this brook, Dupama. And we'll be right back.

3460," you you Welcome back to the 2022 Yahoo finance all market summit I'm Julie Heimen 2021 was a blockbuster year for IPOs more than a thousand new issues issues, plus direct listings, a surge in spack deals, it was a busy year. This year, market debuts have slowed to a trickle, and the companies that started trading last year, the class of 2021, as I like to call them, they've taken a steeper hit than the overall market, as measured by the Renaissance IPO ETF. I'm joined now by CEOs of two of those companies that came public last year, New Bank, CEO, David Vela's, and Billion Earth CEO, Beth Gerstein. Also, by the way, are co-founders of their respective companies. I talk about the same a lot, that there were so many companies that came public in 2021, and there aren't too many of them who stock prices at least have gained. Whether they're fundamental businesses have done well is a very different matter. I wanted to tease that out a little bit, but I do want to start in the beginning with both of you. David, you co-founded New Bank in 2013, Beth, you co-founded Billion Earth in 2005. How did you each decide to make the decision to go public last year? What made you decide to pull the trigger, Beth? I'll start with you. For us, it was a natural evolution. We've been operating for 17 years. We were growing. We were profitable. We had, I think, a lot of discipline originally being bootstrapped. We thought it was a good time for us to be able to raise a little bit of money, for us to allow our team members to participate in owning part of the company, which I'm really proud of, and I think we were right. It was a good time for us to go public. David, what about you? About 2019, we started thinking about going public and getting into a process of about two years' preparation. We obviously started seeing a lot of private funding available, but we are a business that needs requires a lot of capital, and at some point it was very clear that we were going to go public to really access that liquidity. We had also been building New Bank already for about eight years. So we put a stake on the ground in 2019 that by December 2021, we were going to do it as the market went in that direction in 2021. We decided that it was the right time, and we were very happy that we were able to sneak in right at the end. Yeah, you made that deadline just. And I was looking at how the stocks had performed. That your shares were 42% in the first day. Your shares went up around 32% over the first couple of days. They have trended lower with the rest of the market. You've seen, like I mentioned earlier, most of the companies that came public last year, that's their trajectory. And I ask a lot of CEOs about their stock prices, whether they're new issues or whether they've been on the market a long time. Most of them say, well, I try not to pay too much attention to the stock price, which you got to pay some attention to the stock price, right? So David, how do you think about the stock price action and how you interact with investors when you see the price going down? Yeah, so it took us out, say, we would price the IPO in December and then we went into this market and it took us a few months to try to figure out what was happening. What was the market telling us with the sudden movement in price? And after about two or three months, I've tried to understand what was going on. We kind of think the conclusion that, or thesis, that the largest provider of...",https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=z4hExsMyQNo,67,2022-10-17 19:07:57
3461," price. And after about two, three months, I've tried to understand what was going on. We kind of came to the conclusion that, over thesis, that the largest provider of financial services in the world, especially in emerging markets, will continue to be technology companies. And that the thesis fundamentally had not changed. And in fact, there were some trends in a market like this one that makes our business much way much more interesting than a year ago, although the market is a little bit more painful and the price is really not being able to price that effectively. And so what's happening is that effectively companies, everybody in tech, has been traded the same thing, has been punished the same thing. But there's some whose fundamentals are an alternative, whose thesis is an alternative. That's our case. We're profitable. Brazil and Latin America, macro seems more concerning in this environment, but we've actually have a very positive view since the very beginning. And Brazil will actually grow 3% this year, more than China, with an inflation lower than the US. Colombia will grow 8%. So you're starting a bit of a decoupling, at least to this year, I think next year will be a little bit harder. But in reality, what's happening is that everybody's sort of putting the same box without really understanding the differences between the different tech models or the geographies or profitability core or any specific details about the company. Well, and it's not even just tech, right? It's sort of like everything has been thrown into that. That's going to mean you guys, early in earth, are sort of tech first, if you will. But you're a retailer, right? You sell diamonds and different kinds of jewelry. So it's interesting that you two are two different companies, different types and categories. But yet, you know, you get this whole tard with the same brush thing when everybody's looking at these new companies. You mentioned a moment ago, you don't forget the timing. You think it was good timing still for the company. So how do you think about the stock price and the reaction that we've seen? I hear David, the direct to consumer has been a more challenging sector as a whole. And I think you end up getting lumped in with all of the companies that ended up going public at the same time period. We're very different. We've been operating for 17 years. We've been growing and profitable. I continue to be growing and profitable. So I think it differentiates us, but investors are still learning. And, you know, frankly, I think there's right now they're not really taking the time to look at each company. They're overwhelmed, based on just some of the volatility. So for us, it's really about how do we, you know, not pay too much attention to what the stock is doing on a day to day basis. You know, makes sure obviously the team is motivated and that we're focused on the long term while making sure that we have the discipline in the current environment. And it seems to me that both of you are probably in modes where it's not as though you would use your stock to go out and acquire that you're sort of organically growing. Would the plans have been different if the stock price had done something different? I think that, you know, at this point, we have a really strong balance sheet. So we have a lot of strategic options that are available to us, whether it's cash, whether it's, you know, how we want to think about organic growth is actually traditionally how we've been growing for the past 17 years. So I feel like we're really well positioned. We don't, you know, it would be nice to have that lever, but we have a lot of other opportunities as well. Yeah, we, we, organic growth is definitely the preferred growth stage at this time. We have already over 35% of the Brazilian adult population is a customer, but we have less of that market share across all the different financial services products. So we have significant opportunity to grow with the cross-cell to that very large base, almost 70 million customers in Mexico and in Colombia or new markets. We've already the largest credit card issuer. So a lot of opportunity to grow organically and we're seeing less competition in the environment. However, we raised more money than we needed last year and we are seeing some potential emanate targets that we were discussing with 12 months ago back on the table at evaluation, this kind of 50, 60%. So both organic and inorganic opportunities actually seem more interesting in a market like this one for somebody like us that is fully capitalized than competing 12 months ago. I agree. Like, we have a real opportunity to take share in a volatile environment and I think that, yeah, that is a unique thing in this market to really feel confident to do that. Right? If you have a good balance sheet as you were talking about. And a good position. Right. That's the key. Good brand. Let's also talk about the bigger environment, right? And recession talk, which of course has been everywhere. You were mentioning the%.",https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=z4hExsMyQNo,68,2022-10-17 19:12:28
3462," on sheet as you were talking about. And a good position. Right. That's the key. Good for hand. Let's also talk about the bigger environment, right? And recession talk, which of course has been everywhere. You were mentioning that Brazil is still predicted to grow this year. The US is expected to still grow, even if it's not growing very much at this point. But what are you seeing from consumers right now? What are you expecting for the holiday season, for example? Talk to us about the tea leaves that you're reading. Well, as a public company, we are in our quiet period. So I'll just start off that way. What can you tell me sort of high level about what you're seeing? From a high level, I think what we are really proud of is the positioning we have in our market. We have a really strong brand for Gen Z and Millennial audience. Love persists in all different types of ups and downs where people continue to get engaged and people to continue to celebrate with jewelry as a source of value. And we're well positioned because we're very asset light. So I think a lot of other companies have big inventories that they need to be able to discount for us, where very inventory light, we're able to scale up to meet the consumer demand. That puts us in a really powerful position so we can really navigate no matter what the current environment is. And it has been a volatile market. I've said that in the past and we're expecting for this holiday to be able to meet the customer where they are. And that's all I can really do at this point. When you say your inventory light and asset light, how does that work for you? Like if someone's ordering ring or whatever they're ordering, do you then do sort of on demand ordering? How does it work? Yeah, so the way we operate, we work with a virtual diamond inventory model. So the diamonds that we have, which is over 200,000, are actually on our supplier balance sheet. And then a customer will order a ring and we will make that to order. So it really depends on having very strong supplier relationships. And those suppliers are ready for us to scale up as we see the demand actually happen. So those typically take around one to two weeks. So the customer gets a highly personalized, really beautiful, unique product and we don't have the inventory risk. Which I think in this environment specifically is going to serve us really well. Yes, we've heard a lot of inventory build news from all kinds of different retailers. Let's get back to economic activity for you, which is a very different picture because we are talking about emerging markets here. You mentioned the Brazilian growth picture for this year. Next year, a survey of economists by warriors found that they're looking for growth from about 8 tens of 1%. So it's still expanding, but at a much slower pace. Again, what are you sort of seeing through your customer base and what are the indications? Do you feel like a recession is coming down the pike at some point? Yes, interesting about us is we grew since we started a business in 2013. We've effectively only grown through recessions and it's interesting to talk to other US companies when they see it's been talked about inflation and low economic growth as something that nobody has really ever seen. For us, it has been Brazil 101. We've only seen recession. We've only seen high inflation. We saw a 7% GDP contraction in one year as we grew. We saw the worst recession in 100 years. So as we look at 2023, yes, it's going to be more moderate growth, but relatively to what we have already experienced, it's actually much more positive. And a lot of the trends that we're banking behind are almost uncorrelated with the market. Regardless of where the market grows 1% or 3% or 5%, more people will go to digital banking because it's a better experience. It's lower fees. It's lower interest rates. Regardless of the growth, you have 250 million Latin America that has no access to banking that are migrating into the digital banking. And so a lot of the technology trends underlying the growth of the business tends to be a bit uncorrelated. We definitely have credit risk and that is the part of our business that has linked to the economy. So we have to have increased resilience in an environment like this one. We've been increasing resilience through the year. And in general, what we've seen so far is a bit of normalization from abnormally low credit the linkages through the pandemic. So much more going to normal basis where you still kind of parade with very healthy margins. So circling kind of back to the beginning here. So we're going on a little more than a year since you became a public company, almost a year for you to be a public company. What's the biggest change for you in sort of whether it's biggest lesson learned, biggest discovery, big SD.",https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=z4hExsMyQNo,69,2022-10-17 19:16:49
3463," many years since you became a public company, almost a year for you to be a public company. What's the biggest change for you in sort of, whether it's biggest lesson learned, biggest discovery, biggest lifestyle change or you're running around more? What's the biggest difference? Yeah, I'd say transitioning from private company CEO to public company CEO, it's a big change. It's humbling, I think, being able to balance the long-term strategy, articulate the long-term strategy, and also be able to deliver on expectations is, for me, I think, a good lesson to learn. I think it's made us stronger as a company. We've been more transparent with our team, with outside investors, and I think that also helps to clarify internally. We are really going after being the number one destination as a fine jeweler for this younger consumer. We have this really strong OmniChannel strategy. We're really expanding and fine jewelry. So all of that, I feel like we're able to deliver as that long-term guidepost, while still making sure that we are, are we meeting guidance? Are we able to talk about what's happening in the quarter? So holding ourselves to that standard, I think, is what the challenge is, but I think it's driven a lot of internal accountability. Interesting. David, what about for you? I would agree with that. I think first, always in communication, it's probably the biggest challenge. You need to be actively communicating with a number of different constituencies, especially when there is so much volatility in a market like this, when things are changing so much. And beyond that, obviously, we don't want to change or view of optimizing the company's value for the long term, with things that that still the right way to run the company. But we need to be able to also show investors that in the short term, we have very high rigor in terms of decisions that we're making, and that there has to be really strong economic fundamentals in the business. So it's balancing the rigor and the communication that we're doing the right things in the short term, with continuing to double down on the long term opportunity that the business has. And I think because we're both profitable, it makes it a lot easier. We're coming from a position of strength. And that's a differentiator too, among those public debut, really quick question for you. Most popular cut among engagement rings right now. One of our young producers wanted to know. Oh, ball. Oh, ball. Interesting. Okay. Long-haired advances are really hot. Change a lot over. You know, it changes over time. Yellow gold's really popular now. Mm. Couples are making decisions together. They're definitely changing trends in the industry. We'll have you back to talk much more about all of that. And we'll have you back to David. Great to be with both of you. Thank you so much for being here. David Vellis of New Bank at Beskerstein, of Brilliant Earth, much more AMS coming your way. You're watching the 2022 Yahoo Finance All Market Summit.

The progress of Fed policy has put the markets on edge fueling fears at the economy's headed towards a recession as the Fed remains committed to getting inflation under control here to discuss this and much much more. We want to bring in well-known business and economic policy leader Gary Coney's a vice chairman of IBM former director of the National Economic Council under President Trump. Gary, it's great to have you. Thanks so much for joining us here in studio. Thank you so much for having me. So let's just start a big picture. We have high inflation, Fed saying that it remains committed to getting inflation under control. And the markets are bracing for what's next, what's your assessment of where we stand today? I think you sort of summarized that, you know, everyone's talking about the last CPI report. Obviously we're 8.2% inflation in the United States here. A totally unacceptable number, a number that really hurts consuming Americans and really hurts, it's really regressive inflation. So you understand from the Fed's standpoint, they have to tackle inflation. They have a blunt instrument. They have a blunt instrument which is interest rate policy at this point. They're trying to increase rates. They're trying to increase rates to slow demand down, just take demand out of the economy. They really cannot affect the supply side of the equation. The problem that we have or the issue that people are debating now is the Fed started raising rates earlier this year. We've gone through quite a few interest rate rises already. And the economy has not slowed down from an inflationary standpoint. That said, we all know that this monetary policy takes time to feed itself through the economy. Unfortunately, it hits consumers almost immediately. So if you've got an adjustable rate mortgage, it adjusts the next day. If you've got credit card debt that adjusts it adjusts the next day. But the real policy affects on slowing down demand, that takes months, almost a year to a year and a half, to feed through the economy. So there's this discussion going on. Has the Fed done enough in interest rates to slow down the economy? And we don't know because the effects are still being felt of the first rate increases. Or they not done enough because we continue to see inflation move higher and higher. So I think the Fed is in a very difficult position. They were late to the game. They started raising rates late, which means they're now playing catch up. I think we all believe that they will raise rates two more times this year at the two more meetings. Probably at least 75 basis points in the November meeting. And probably another 50 to 75 basis points at the end of the year. So we will have gone from basically zero Fed fund rates in the United States to well over 4% rates in the course of a year. That's a fairly dramatic move. And we need to understand what impacts that's going to have longer term to the economy. And what impacts do you think it could potentially have longer term? And are we going to be able to do this without going into a recession? Well, the question is what are the impacts? And as I said, the Fed can try and affect demand, the demand side of the equation. They can make borrowing money more expensive. They can make homes more expensive. They can try and slow consumers down because things are harder to buy because they don't want to finance them. They can't affect the supply side of the equation. And right now when you look at the data and you look at what's going on in the inflationary front, a lot of the inflation comes from commodities and commodity inputs. So by raising interest rates, we don't create more oil. We don't create more food. So we're trying to create a balance of oil. We're trying to create a balance of food. We're trying to create a balance of workers back into the labor force. I think one of the big underlying components of inflation is wage price inflation. We keep seeing 5% plus wage inflation.",https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=z4hExsMyQNo,71,2022-10-17 19:25:25
3465," into the labor force. I think one of the big underlying components of inflation is wage price inflation. We keep seeing, you know, 5% plus wage inflation. Wages filter through everything we do. As the economy has shifted during COVID to where we're buying lots of goods because we really couldn't leave our houses. So we're buying things, we're having them sent to our houses, and we were consuming goods. We're now back into a more normalized economic cycle. In a normalized economic cycle, we as Americans, we're good consumers of services. We like to go out, we like to be entertained, we like to travel, we like to go to events. The service economy is all labor. When you go out to a service event, you're really buying mostly labor. So when you go to a concert or you go to a restaurant or you go to a bar, you're buying some inputs, some commodities, but you're buying an awful lot of labor. That labor cost has not come down. And it's another area where the Fed is trying to get some response. They're trying to get businesses to not grow as fast. They're trying to get people, the businesses did not hire as many people. But we saw, even in the last month's unemployment report, we saw 3.5% unemployment. We still see non-farm payrolls growing. So the interest rate impact has not fed through to the business cycle yet. We're going to have to see job destruction if we're really going to see inflation be curtailed. And I think that's hard because we've gone through a lot of fundamental changes in this country. Prior to COVID, we were all talking about the aging American workforce. Guess what? We're still an aging American workforce. We didn't stop aging during COVID. Unfortunately, during COVID, we lost about 2 million people from the labor force, either through long COVID or unfortunately, they passed away, which is a horrible event. But we've got to recognize we've lost people from the labor force. And then we had a bunch of people sort of late in their work cycle who decided to leave the labor force. So we've now have a smaller labor force population in the United States. So businesses to attract workers into the labor force are having to pay more to get workers in the cycle, which is inflationary. Wages go up. They pass those increased wages onto the consumers. And we're in this inflationary cycle. So the feds are going to continue to keep raising rates to try and break this cycle. They won't know they have broken it until long after it's broken. So what does this mean then for the equity markets? Because here we stand today, the S&P off more than 20% and you're to date. And Nasdaq down more than 30% and you're to date. And you try to gauge that downside risk here for equities. What does that look like? So again, the famous ad is, don't fight the fed. It's been true for this cycle. It was true for last cycle. When we had a zero interest rate policy, you wanted to own risky assets. When you've got the fed increasing interest rates and the alternative, the risk-free rate, the rate of return it now is sort of 4% for short duration treasury bills. That's an attractive rate of return for short-term treasury bills. And really what's happening more than anything is the equity markets trying to figure out, what are the future earnings of a company? So remember the value of S&P is the present value of future earnings. So if a company has higher input costs and it has higher labor costs, and hopefully if the fed is successful, lower demand for their goods or services, what is the forward earnings of a company look like? Then I could put a multiple on that. And right now, the market is trying to determine what forward earnings are going to look like and what multiple that should trade at. And as long as the fed is continuously raising rates, trying to slow down the economy, trying to make things more expensive, trying to make labor more expensive, the market is going to continue to try and find a clearing price for that. We again, it's like everything else in this world. We won't know we've met that clearing price till long after the bottom is here. We may have met it already. A lot of people think we have not got to that clearing price, but the market right now is trying to figure out what future earnings look like and what multiple we should put on that. Gary, I'm curious to get your perspective on this. The job that Fed Chair, J. Powell has done so far, are you satisfied with that? I think they relate to the game. I don't like to criticize the fed. I don't think any of us like to criticize the fed, but they've got a tough job, but they've got enormous amount of resources at their disposal. They stuck to this transitory inflationary argument way past where I think many of us, myself included, and I'll put myself, I'll make this personal.",https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=z4hExsMyQNo,72,2022-10-17 19:29:57
3466," at their disposal. They stuck to this transitory inflationary argument way past where I think many of us, myself included, I'll put myself, I'll make this personal, way past where I thought it was transitory. Maybe in the beginning, as we're bringing production back online, we're bringing supply chains back to normalize level, there was some transitory natures to it, but the Fed stuck to their transitory argument way deeper into the cycle. And it was clearly not transitory. We clearly had real inflation in the system. We had shortages, we had food shortages, we had energy shortage, we had tough time getting people back into the labor market. So as I said, the Fed was late. And when you're late, you're playing catch up and I could think they continue to play catch up. How much of it, because we know when we look ahead to the midterms or 22 days away from midterms right now, Republicans largely running on the fact that high inflation, slowing economy, that's the fault of the Biden administration and Democrats from your assessment. I guess how much of it is a result of White House policy versus factors that are just simply out of their control? You know, it's never, ever one factor. The one thing we learn is when we study the history, we'll know that it wasn't one factor. You know, a lot of people will point to the huge increase in money supply. So as the Biden administration was sending out stimulus checks and they're putting money in the hands of consumers, we were increasing the money supply. As you increase the money supply, you've got dollars chasing goods, those dollars are willing to chase the price of goods higher and higher. So we clearly saw some inflationary pressure from the consumer being in a very good position, having very, very good balance sheets unlevered. And by the way, we still see that today. If you see the bank earnings that we saw reported today, the banks were talking about the fact that they still have fairly high deposit rates. The consumers are still in relatively good shape, the linkancy levels are low. So we still see the US consumer. This far into the COVID relief, we still see the US consumer with a very good balance sheet, still have the ability to spend. And that clearly is part of the cause of the inflation. We also had a situation where you could talk about the supply side. We had a change in energy policy, a fairly dramatic change in energy policy, energy policy, drove a lot of this. We've clearly had some unforeseen weather events around the world in the food. We clearly have a war in Europe where we're having food disruption. So again, it's hard for me to put my finger on a single event. But all of these definitely have some blame and some huge contribution to why we're having this inflation. Gary, one of the priorities of the Biden administration has been the chip sector, the passage of the $52 billion chip sector. I knew you, along with some of your colleagues from IBM, me the trip down to DC to help that get over the finish line from your sources so far, how is the rollout going of this? I think the rollout is going fine. I mean, I can't tell you it's going poorly or great. It's a slower rollout, but we knew that. The Commerce Department right now has been empowered to go out and spend the money that was given to them by the government. But really, the opportunity there was not just giving the Commerce Department money to spend. But if this is going to be successful, it was going to be a huge public-private partnership. And I think we've seen the private sector get together. We've seen the private sector announce massive investment in chips in the United States. You've seen it in upstate New York. You've seen it in Columbus, Ohio. And these are not small investments. We've seen multiple billion dollars, tens, 20, 30, 40, 50, 60 billion dollars investments by companies, IBM, last week when the president was there announced a $20 billion commitment. You've seen Intel announced investments. We've seen multiple companies announce investments. So the government has done what they needed to do. They got leverage in the system. They talked about the importance of chips in the United States. They talked about being supportive of chips. We've got to get the permitting process sped up. But the private sector is bringing the money to the situation because ultimately the money that the government's putting in is just a little tiny down payment on a big huge issue of being chip independent in this country. And Gary, I want to switch gears here just a little bit and talk about a story that's been in the headlines recently, every recently. So that's a comment from Kanye West and what he has made public on his social media platforms, his large media presence out there, the anti-Semitic remarks that he has made multiple times. And I bring this up because it's been five years since.",https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=z4hExsMyQNo,73,2022-10-17 19:34:13
3467," by Semitic remarks that he has made multiple times that I bring this up because it's been five years since Charlottesville. And here we are today with a similar type of rhetoric, hateful rhetoric that's being said on a platform that has millions and millions of followers. What's your reaction to the remarks that we've heard from Kanye West? You know, look, they're just unacceptable. You know, I'll say the same thing about Kanye West remarks, as I said to the President of the United States at the time. It's just unacceptable in this day and age in the world that we live in for people in a leadership position with that big of a platform, with that big of a microphone, to make those type of comments. And Gary, real quick, we tried to ask you this two years ago when you were at AMS, whether or not you were planning to vote for President Trump in the 2020 election. So when asked this to you, but put it in a slightly different way. Did I answer back then? You didn't answer back then. So I'm going to give it another shot here. What would you say to people that might be inclined to support a second term for President Trump? Look, it's America. Everyone's entitled to vote for whom they want. That's the greatest part of our democracy is that we allow people to run for public office and the citizens of the country get to decide who sits in those public offices. We're in the middle of a midterm election right now and we'll see who takes control of the House and the Senate. Certainly. Well, 22 days away from those midterm scary cone, always great to have you here at Yahoo Finance. Thanks so much for joining us. Thanks for having me. Let's get over to Jared Blackree with a closer look at the market movers here in the final 30 minutes, hey, Jared. That's right, China. After a market route Friday, we are looking at the Nasdaq up three and a half percent the best day and weeks. Here you can see it on the intraday basis. Here's a look at the trailing week. You can see all the volatility. It is net up 1.3 percent over that time period. I want to take a look over a longer period of time. This is going to be the S&P 500 over the last three months. We are coming off of the lows of the year and this is that volatile CPI print that we got now. We do want to check on the bond market, five year TNO yield that is coming off of a four and basically a quarter percent that is down three basis points. But you move down the curve to the 13 week T bill, T bill yield that is up six basis points to the highest level since 2007, the 30 year at the highest level that is up four basis points since 2011 and the US dollar index easing slightly. That's probably one of the things that's giving a bid or at least allowing a bid to equities right now. We're seeing consumer discretionary that is XLY. That is in the forefront up over four percent followed by real estate tech communication services, the mega caps plus real estate really feeling the love today. And here you can see Tesla up 7 percent Amazon close behind up six and a half percent and video up 6 percent. And we take a look at some of the leaders here. You can see ARC. That is up 7 percent. IPOs, internet stocks, memes, Chinese stocks, cannabis stocks, software stocks and gambling stocks, all feeling some love, all of those are on the top row here. And we got to check in on the banking sector, banking bank of America reported earnings. Actually, I believe net interest, net interest margin was up 24 percent on the year. That stock up 6 percent. We're going to have Goldman Sachs earnings tomorrow morning along with Netflix after the bell. In the meantime, much more AMS for you. We're going to be right back. Breaking the glass ceiling, WNBA Commissioner Kathy Engelbert tells us how the league plans to capitalize on a historic season.",https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=z4hExsMyQNo,74,2022-10-17 19:38:37
3468,"agers You Welcome back to Yahoo Finance's All-Markets Summit. The WMBA just wrapped up its most-watch season in 14 years of the viewership jumping 16% from just a year ago in the league's shattering fan engagement and on-court records. Here for more on that, we want to bring in Kathy Engelberg, WMBA Commissioner, also former CEO of Deloitte Kathy. It's great to have you. Thanks so much for stopping by here at Yahoo Finance. Great to be here, Shana. So let's talk about that record-setting season that you just wrapped up here. Obviously, the sport is getting more and more popular. How would you sum up this most recent season? Yeah, you just named some of the viewership gains we had, but across social media, even in our partners like ESPN, they had 1.1 billion impressions on W related content. So it's important our partners see the value of the WN Women's Sports. And there's a huge changing of the guard going on right now with Sue Bird in her last year just retired. Sylvia Faust, two icons in the game, but great players like Asia Wilson, who was MVP of the WMBA finals. And just like an amazing, and just won the gold medal at the FIBA World Cup for the Las Vegas aces now, winning their first ever franchise championship. So he's changing the guard to the younger players and really great with our veterans too. That's 16% jump and viewership there that I just mentioned in the intro. What do you attribute this to? Part of it is when, if you build it, they will come. So one of the things we've done, more marketing, more digital, meet our fan where they are. Our fans use more diverse, our fans use younger, more women. And so finding that fan, bringing them in, retaining them in the game, getting them to games, getting fans and seats. We come off to tough COVID years for the WN Women's Sports. One in front of no fans in the 2021 season. So we expanded the number of games up to 36. We had an amazing, all-star game and amazing draft. Most viewed draft since 2004 when Diana Terraci was drafted. So again, we raised capital back in February. We're deploying that capital against things like digital and marketing and telling player stories and the players. The on-the-court records, triple doubles, double doubles. A sightment of the game is really driving it as well. I want to talk a little bit more about that capital raise in just a few minutes. But first, let's talk about when we talk about getting more eyeballs on the game. A lot of the focus when it comes to sports, at least over the last several months, has been the shift to streaming. I guess how important are streaming deals when you're looking to grow the sport? Because a lot of times we talk about Amazon when it comes with Thursday night football. We talk about the MLB's recent streaming deals. But WNBA, you have a deal with Amazon. You've also aired some games as a stream, then, I should say, on Twitter. Yeah, the whole marketplace in media is being disrupted, as we know. Not just linear and traditional, but also streamers are now being disrupted. And actually, you're trying to get into live sports. It's something that's still getting a lot of eyes on the game, both in linear and in streaming. So as we see the NFL roll, there's out. We were a little before them, but we didn't have the marketing quite behind us. So it's always going to be now a part of the package. And when your fan base skews younger like our fan base does, and you're trying to bring",https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=z4hExsMyQNo,75,2022-10-17 19:43:34
3469," a little before them, but we didn't have the marketing quite behind us. So it's always going to be now a part of the package. And when your fan base skews younger like our fan base does, and you're trying to bring in that digital native that Gen Zer, who has probably cut the core, and you've got to have Roku enable man, Apple TV enable man. You have to have all of that. And that's why you have to know who your fan is and look at the data and then drive it from a digital perspective. And Kathy speaking of that, I know you are your current broadcasting deal with ESPN ends in 2025. When you're looking for that next media agreement, what are you hoping or what do you want that agreement to include? Again, I think we're going to look at all different forms of how to bring the game to our fan base who does skew younger. And really, if you think about how it's being disrupted, it's also around marketing so people know where to find you and making the friction out of viewing a game for the fan. They have to know where to go on the spot, or they're going to lose interest. And they also the content around it, not just the game itself. And we're 120 minutes and you're done. So it's not our games are quite fast. But it's the content around it and the storytelling around it and the medium and short form content that's going to drive, I think, viewers in to determine how we think about media going forward. You mentioned that 75 million capital raise. You reached that in February since then. I believe that you've announced some plans to use some of that money for players to market the league in the off season. What can you tell us about that? And I guess if it is already underway, how that's progressing. Yeah, so it's just underway. We just finished our season. Just handed out that trophy to Las Vegas. And we have 10 players under contract to market the league in the off season. And it's going to be great. We've already had a couple of the players at the league office to talk to them about what this all means, how to build their brands, and drive them into the next generation of household names in the sport. So, and there's such great role models for young boys and girls. It's not just young girls, it's young boys too. And a lot of people I meet say, the first basketball game I want to take my kid to is a WMBA game, the pure form of the sport. So these players are great role models. Obviously, they're very strong social justice stances. And people view them as these kind of multi-dimensional role models. And we have moms in the league. And they're really great role models. So that's why we want to market the players more and spend a lot more of that capital on the players themselves. Kathy, when you speak about growing the league, I know expansion. It's been a major topic now for a few years. You currently have 12 teams in the league. Any insight that you can share with us, just in terms of what you're thinking for expansion or when you think that WMBA is going to expand? Well, one of the ways to grow the league is to have more eyes for more cities. And when I joined the league, quite frankly, I said we're only in 12 cities. This is the longest tenured women's professional sports league in America. Double any other will be in our 27th season this year. And we should drive off that strength. So we're looking at a variety of markets. We're using data, psychographics, demographics, NCAA viewership, current W, merch buying. You can get a lot of data by city to determine which cities would be the best. We have to find committed ownership groups with a greater rena situation. So there's a lot to think about. But that's certainly one of the areas now that the hard work starts in the off season around strategizing around those cities. But for instance, I'll just throw one out when technology's driving so much of your economy. And you don't have a team in the Bay area. That doesn't seem right. So that's on the list among, among another nine or 10 cities. Kathy, you mentioned efforts that the WMBA has in helping builders really, or players, excuse me, really build their brand. And it brings me to pay because pay conversations long been a topic. When you take a look at the WMBA, no salaries are increasing. 234,000, I believe is a super max salary for this upcoming season. The max just over 200,000. Even with these raises, though, players do still tend to make more when they play overseas. I guess how has this impacted your league? And what are you doing to address that? Yeah, so we're starting to chip away at an economic model. When I came into the league, I was hired by Adam Silver to look at the economic model and how to drive it. And we're actually, you're seeing a transformation before our eyes. But we're not there yet. And it's all around the ecosystem of how we get valued by corporate sponsors and how we get valued through media deals. And when less than 5% of all media coverage is women's sportship, 40% of the athletes in America are women. And when less than 1% of all corporate sponsorship dollars go to women's sports, that denominator is huge in men's sports. So we're chipping away. And there are just a couple hundred basis points is moving the numerator. And we really have our WNBH change makers.",https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=z4hExsMyQNo,76,2022-10-17 19:47:33
3470," So ship dollars go to women's sports. That denominator is huge in men's sports. So we're chipping away. And there are just a couple hundred basis points as moving the numerator. And we really have our WNBA change makers companies really stepping up. So we're getting there. We now tripled the top players pay. We've got a huge this marketing dollars. We doubled the playoff bonus this year, up 53%. We have a commissioners cup now price pool of over half a million. So we're just chipping away at all the ways to pay players. But you also you can't do it without being financially savvy about growing an economic model to not just support it for today's players, but support it for the next 25 years. And speaking of support here for players and also just growing your brand, I guess. How do you also increase the international component of this, which I think would be very important here when we're just talking about growing the value of the WNBA? Yeah, another reason I wanted to raise that capital is to globalize the game. I've seen I've really admired what the NBA has done through their global games platform and how they turn these players into global stars. So players go overseas and they're well known and their household names beyond the United States. So we've announced a preseason game in Canada as first step and coming off the pandemic now. And then I hope to get to like an EMEA games and Africa is very interesting and certainly Asia. So this year we had, I think it was 23 players from 13 different countries. That was our highest. And so we're kind of chipping away at globalizing our own players as well as then taking our US players and making them more global household names. But it's not easy because the women's game isn't followed as much. But for instance, 3x3 basketball. So 3 on 3 is a number one most popular urban sport globally in both men and women. So we can kind of capitalize off of that and bring our game outside the US. Well, Kathy speaking of international playing overseas. I want to turn to an issue that I know is very front of mind for you. And that of course is Brittany Griner. The seven time all started detained in Russia since February. I guess first is what can you tell us about her condition and how she's doing? Well, first of all, wrongfully detained, important to use that word, wrongfully detained in Russia. And Brittany is amazing. She wrote me a letter recently. She can only handwrite letters that go through the government. I'm sure there are two lawyers that gets to me. And we've been writing her periodically throughout the year. And this is just an unimaginable situation. I'm sure mentally it's very, very taxing. The longer she's there, she's got an appeal coming up on October 25th, which we're pretty sure we know that the legal process there isn't not going to yield anything favorable to Brittany. So we've been talking with the State Department, the special presidential envoy for hostage affairs and everybody in the administration. And they're all Brittany all the time. They're trying to find every different way to get her home safely first and as soon as possible seconds. So her 32nd birthday is tomorrow. And so we'll be making sure she knows we're remembering her as part of a social campaign around we are BG and bringing Brittany home safely. So it's geopolitically complex. So you never, when you take these jobs, you never know how complex it'll be in situations. And this one's certainly one of the more complex situations I've dealt with. Well, speaking of that, when President Biden recently saying that he would only meet with Vladimir Putin at the upcoming G20 meetings, if quote, he came to me at the G20 and said, I want to talk about the release of Griner, I'd meet with him. I guess what's your reaction to that and whether or not the president should be more forceful in pressing this issue? Yeah, I think from our discussions with the administration, they're trying everything they can do to get a deal done. Obviously the legal process we knew was not going to yield a favorable answer to Brittany when it should have, but that's why she's deemed wrongfully detained by the State Department and the administration. And I think the government has been doing everything they can, but there's not a willing party on the other side. And the Russians need to step up, get a deal done for both Brittany and Paul Whalen, who's another wrongfully detained American there. So again, our hope is first number one, get her home safely and as quickly as possible. But as I mentioned, if you think of diplomatically, geopolitically, even if you had a neutral party step in, there's no easy answer here. And I think the administration is full court press to use a basketball analogy to try to get Brittany home. And I think you need the other side to come forward and with a reasonable deal. And, Kathy, while we have you, I also want to get your thoughts on a massive story that really walked not only this sports world, but also had ripple effects through every single industry. And that was what we just heard about the National Women's Soccer League, that year long investigation, finding systemic abuse of players as commissioner of the WMBA. And what steps are you taking?",https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=z4hExsMyQNo,77,2022-10-17 19:51:48
3471," And that was what we just heard about the National Women's Soccer League, that year-long investigation finding systemic abuse of players as commissioner of the WMBA. What steps are you taking to protect your players? Yeah, this is really, really important. It's really important not to have a misstep in this area. It's unacceptable. It's disappointing. I know they've had leadership changes over the years. And as a commissioner of the WMBA, we want to be leading with a player first agenda, respect in the workplace, all of that making sure that our policies, which have been in effect for years, are solid. And that players feel comfortable coming forward when there's an uncomfortable situation, whether it's with a coach and owner or whatever. So it's important to create a culture where players, well, it's great to have a hotline just in the corporate world where I worked for 33 over three decades. It was great to have an anonymous hotline, but if nobody's using it, then it's like, okay, they don't feel comfortable because the culture's not there. So culture always important in the workplace. And sports is an interesting place because people don't think of culture in the workplace in sports, but it's just like, you know, you and I working in the corporate world. You mentioned your three decades experience in the corporate world. Your CEO most recently, of Du Bois, how do you think that prepared you for the job you have today as commissioner of WMBA? Because two very, very different roles. If you look at them, I guess, from a 55-year-old. Yes, I always say you went from 100,000 person workforce to 144 players, so it sounds very different, but sports is big business, big business about relationships. So I was so blessed to have the career I had at Deloitte that prepared me for things like collective bargaining four days into the job when I came in building relationships with players and the whole ecosystem and the stakeholder group like 12 different owners, 30 MBA owners who also own a share of the WMBA. And then lastly, really George Floyd, Jacob Blake, a league of 80 percent women of color and dealing with a workforce, you know, call it that was really rattled and rocked. And I learned a lot by listening to the players and trying to put myself in their shoes. And that's all stuff when you're leading a big company like Deloitte Comeinhandee when you're leading something like the WMBA. Kathy Engelberg, great to have you. Thanks so much for taking the time to join us today. Thanks so much, Donna. Straight ahead. It's a new era in Hollywood. And I'm sure that this address, Fran Drescher, is here to explain the big changes coming to the box office.",https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=z4hExsMyQNo,78,2022-10-17 19:55:54

3473," less important even if they are for whatever reason, more of a minority opinion. And with regards to Scarlett Johansson, I was shortly thereafter negotiating a movie deal. And we handled the negotiations completely different in the event that the movie would go straight to streaming. And they kept responding the theater release because of COVID. And ultimately, they decided to just go straight to streaming on Amazon. And so, you know, I recently got a nice big chunky check by you. And you know, I want to pick up on that point because, you know, streaming has really appended the industry. And how are you talking about those contracts? Like you were saying, redoing all those contracts to account for streaming? Yeah, you know, we just have a very successful negotiation with Netflix. And then the AMPTP wanted to work on a fragment of the theatrical negotiations that we're about to go into with them in 2023. I'm organizing my negotiating committee right now for all of the other aspects of that negotiation. We began discussing the Netflix negotiation. The union was talking about, for me, what sounded like incremental alterations to an existing contract. And I saw a convergence of opportunities that would probably not come along for a very long time that needed to be leveraged with a great deal of strengths and conviction right now, or forever, be chasing after a different kind of a contract that's always just outside of our grasp. We really used our legislation that we had in the state of California during the negotiations. We had a lot of high profile people meeting with our California representatives who were instrumental in pushing forward the particular bill called the law act, let actors work. And I myself went on one of the hottest days out to Glendale to meet as well. And we were very lucky that they heard us. They understood that we were the undead dogs in this equation. They felt the truth of the matter is that when an entire industry changes and the rules of the game change on behalf of the employer, changes are going to have to trickle down to the employee as well. You can't have it both ways. I want to pick up on that point too because you know, we know about all the big players in Hollywood, right? Like we were just talking about scholar Joe Hanson. They're already making millions, but the reality is that most of your members, they're not a list. They don't get the big pagEx from Disney, they're part-time, they're stand-ins. Can you give us some perspective? Well, and also, yes, of course. It's all about the journeyman actor, all of these negotiations because people like Tom Hanks, you know, they're not really impacted by this stuff. They make their own deals. And even people like Skorla, Joe Hanson are given allowances to do other jobs if they want her. You'll see a lot of very famous actors that appear on multiple shows. And they're given that allowance because they're promotable and they get an audience and the producers give them that privilege. So it's always kind of the journeyman actor, the middle class that always-",https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=z4hExsMyQNo,80,2022-10-17 20:04:08
3474," and the producers give them that privilege. So it's always kind of the journeyman actor, the middle class that always is getting squeezed. And that's really why unions exist to protect and defend their rights because employers understand that they desperately want to work. We need to always honor and respect them with a very fair and equitable arrangement. The nanny, film reboot, yes or no, you winner you out. It's in the talking stage, I would definitely be in. And we'll see what happens. There's a Broadway musical in the pipeline. And so it's the gift that keeps on giving. And for that, I'm very grateful we have an artist for the nanny book at Cancer Shmansa for all the fans. A hundred percent of the proceeds goes to Cancer Shmansa. And we have new fans now from HBO Max that are children, Twin Centines who weren't even alive when we were shooting it. That's amazing. Definitely a new generation enjoying that show. Fran Drescher, thank you so much for being here. My pleasure, be well. All right, now a check of House Talks ended the day here on this Monday afternoon, Dow is up 1.86%. That is good for, let me get the grand total here. That is good for 550 points, S&P 500 up a little bit more about 2.5%. Nasdaq up nearly 3.5%. And you can see just barely clawing back those losses that we had from Friday, but still up 25 basis points or 1 quarter of 1% over that time period. Now, here's our sector action for today. Retail stocks, especially those discretionary ones, really getting a boost today. That is up that sector up 4% in the S&P 500 followed by real estate tech and communication services. A lot of those mega caps present in these sectors here plus real estate to the downside. Staples still above 1%, although it is the least favorable sector today followed by energy, health care, utilities, industrials, and then materials. And I do want to get a check on our meme stocks because as a sentiment indicator, we are seeing a lot of risk, not a version, kind of the opposite here today. But as we've seen over the prior few weeks, in fact, much of the year, it's been risk on one day or two days and then risk off the next. So Tuesday going to be very critical this week and we got a bunch of earnings tomorrow from Goldman Sachs in the morning to Netflix in the afternoon. All right, we want to get a check on the EV market. Tesla, that is up 7% today. Coming off some pretty heavy declines. Here's a one year look. Now you can see making new lows for the year, taking out those May, June, July lows very recently. And we can see coming off of $219, we're going to see if anything comes of this. But a giant pennant formation there in Tesla over several years. So we've seen these before and we'll probably see them again before I go. I do want to get a check of the travel sector today. We're seeing some big outsized gains from Airbnb that it's up 6.5% today. Expedia of over 5%. So some of the travel booking names doing well. Now the airlines, they're doing well. United is up over 1.5% American up about half a percent. And it looks like Hilton. That stock is up about 3%. Guys, we're going to be right back. Up ahead, the Hollywood blockbuster is alive and well. We'll speak with legendary film producer, Jerry Brookheimer, about the wild success of Top Gun Maverick and the next big thing to hit the box office.

3475," music Jerry Brockheimer is one of the most successful film and television producers of all time. A consummate risk taker, Brockheimer has redefined the Hollywood blockbuster and television entertainment. From Beverly Hills Cop to Pirates of the Caribbean, his films have grossed an estimated 15 billion at the box office. And after more than four decades on top, Brockheimer is still smashing records. His latest blockbuster Top Gun Maverick is his biggest movie yet. It's also Tom Cruise's highest-grossing movie ever. Brockheimer's productions for the small screen are no less impressive. His scripted and reality shows have been among the most popular on television for decades. Jerry, thank you so much for joining us. Thanks, Ali. Thanks for having me. It's a pleasure. Yes, so first of all, I want to start with Top Gun Maverick. Really? I wonder why we would start with that. I never think it would be such a smash. I always hope for the best, expect the worst. So it worked out really well for all of us. Why do you think it was so big? It really created a moment when I think people needed it the most. And people hadn't been theaters in a long time, too. No, it's a big entertaining movie with great cast, great people behind the camera, Joe Kazinsky, Tom Cruise is a force. Chris McCory, who worked with us as a producer and a writer and other rest of our writers. It was just a great experience across the board. Tom is the hardest working person you'll ever meet. He cares. He loves to be on a set, first of all. He cares about every single moment, about every single performance, not only his, he's all over everything. And he's a much better producer than I'll ever be. Really? And your relationship with Tom goes back a really long time, Q. He was like 20 years old when we first started with him. I remember hearing a story about how he was actually one of the only people in the original top gun who could deliver lines from the cockpit. Well, that's how he learned to make Top Gun fabric a lot better because he decided that we have to train all the actors for three or four months prior to filming to get him used to the G-forces. So we started him in a prop plane, very easy, then an aerobatic prop and we put him in a jet. And finally in the F-18. So they were accustomed to taking seven A-J's, which when you see the movie, you see the look on their faces, that's all they're not acting. But the hardest thing for these actors, including Tom, you only see a third of their face. So all their acting comes from their eyes. So it's fascinating, they got such great performances and it was so difficult for all of them because we'd shoot them for, they'd stay up for about two hours. We couldn't see what they were doing. They'd come down, we'd look at the footage and then we had to send them right back up again if it didn't work. And they had to turn the camera on themselves. They had to know where the sun was because they had to match other aerial stuff that we did. So it was really an exhilarating and scary proposition and they were beat up. They tell you, dealing with those two forces.",https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=z4hExsMyQNo,82,2022-10-17 20:13:38
3476," What were the sun was because they had to match other aerial stuff that we did. So it was really an exhilarating and scary proposition and they were beat up. Let me tell you, dealing with those due forces, it's really, really difficult. Well, and kind of to that end, you know, those in a theater really plays particularly well, right? Like the intimacy of those shots, right? Are you really see their eyes? Do you think that's part of why people were so excited to see it in theaters? Absolutely. I think the fact that we did it for real obviously, the explosions and other things we couldn't do for real. But what's really the reason that people have gone back multiple times is the emotion. It's about the emotion and following these characters and watching Tom's arc through the movie. When I was starting, so I very lonely at the end of the movie, he finds a family that he can be with. So that is the emotional core. And then you have Iceman and their Val Kilmer. And Tom said, I'm not doing this movie unless Val is in it. So one of the most moving scenes in the movie was that logistically complicated and a logistically complicated shoot? Logistics weren't hard just to get the performances. And what journalists and everybody don't really understand is how good Tom's performance is and Val's performance. But Tom through the whole movie is understated performance. It's just absolutely brilliant. And the fact that we had the best technicians in the business from the cinematographers, the production designers, the editor. I mean Eddie Hamilton who edited the movie, he had 814 hours of aerial footage to go through. He had 26 hours of just carrier footage. And all he cared about was finding the very best shot. And all the footage, you just imagine when those days come in, how much time he had to put into editing the movie. But again, it comes down to writing, performances, and the emotion. It's all about the emotion. A lot of people can shoot great action, but if you don't have the emotion, you don't have a great movie. You are somebody who has made movies people love for decades. You've stayed on top for so long. What is the secret to understanding an audience? I don't understand them at all. I really don't. I just know what I like and make movies that I want to go see. Some day that will change, but fortunately it hasn't. And in terms of sequels, have you and Tom talked about Top Gun 3? No. No, not yet. No, not a word. And as you're thinking about the movie theater model, did Top Gun Maverick prove that it's alive and well or was it an exception? No, it's alive and well. I just got to make movies that embrace an audience. And unfortunately the pandemic we weren't making a lot of movies that really could play in theaters. Streaming has its place, theaters have its place. I always use the analogy. You have a kitchen, right? But you like to go out to eat. So it's not always you want to stay home and watch something on television. It's a group experience. It's exhilarating when you go to opening weekend and people are cheering and applauding for the right type of movie. And that's what happened with Top Gun. I went all weekend, the first weekend, and stood behind the seats at the Chinese theater and watching the movie at IMAX and watch how exhilarated the fans were at watching that movie. And when you talk to people, most people haven't just seen it once. They've seen it twice or three times. One person wrote us and he wrote us and he's seen it a hundred times. So it's that kind of an experience you want to give to audiences every time you make a movie. Obviously we can't do it. But every once in a while we get really lucky. And we had the right people involved at the right time for the right audience. And the fact that we held it for two years was the best thing we could ever do. And the audience was ready to come out. I think this is the first movie where an older audience felt safe going into theaters. A lot of people saw the movie said this is the first time we've been in a theater in two years. So it got them out because the people who saw it and back in 86, 87 wanted to go back and see what we did. But you know what? They had their arms crossed. That was such a good movie. I know they're going to screw it up. So we had to overcome that first. So I think when you first hear that gong and you see those jets taking off, they relaxed a little bit. This movie made a killing without China, without Russia. Does that prove that there could be a future for Hollywood without China and Russia? Well, we'd love to have them. Unfortunately, the world politics, we can't get there right now. I hope we've had all changed. Look, we'd love the whole world to see our movies. We make it for the whole world. The fact that Top Gun Maverick has made more...",https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=z4hExsMyQNo,83,2022-10-17 20:17:37
3477," There right now, I hope we've got all changed. Look, we love the whole world to see our movies. We make it for the whole world. The fact that Top Gun Maverick has made more foreign than domestic, you can just see how there's a worldwide audience for what Hollywood does. And even on a very American subject with American flyers, they love the movie because it was a great experience. It was something that you felt great when you walked out. It took you away from your problems for two hours, and that's exactly why I make entertainment. Do you feel audiences evolved over time? And as you think about your audience now today, is that different than it was 20 years ago? They just want to be entertained. That's all. That's all. Get them in the seat, entertain them, make them feel something. It doesn't always have to make them feel good, but give them a completion at the end. Well, and give them a motion. Always a motion. It's always about a motion. The reason bad boys with such a big success was the biggest picture of what 21 are 20, because it was an emotional story. After working on Beverly Hills Cop 4 right now with Netflix, is there a difference between producing for a studio or a streamer? It's all for an audience. And that's what we key on. We want to make the audience enjoy what we do. And there's an audience at home, and there's an audience that leaves home and goes to the theater. But top gun is a movie. You really have to go see it in a theater. I mean, it's done phenomenal and streaming so far. It's been just great. I think it's the number two of all time already. And it's something that when you'll watch it, you want to see it again, because it felt so good. And for you, sequels are where it's at right now. A lot would say you have Beverly Hills Cop 4. We haven't talked about top gun 3 yet. Bad boys 4 is reportedly in the works. For you, are there any other sequels you're thinking about right now? Well, we hope to do another pirates. Really? Yes. That would be awesome. Kind of to that end, you are a risk taker. Pirates wasn't obvious initially, right? Do you feel what's your relationship to risk taking? And do you feel like Hollywood to stop taking risks? Well, that's the financial people. I love making movies that I think that I want to go see. And hopefully an audience will agree with me. And it certainly happened. But pirates was another movie you can talk about that people had their arms crossed when they walked into it. First of all, it's about a theme park ride. Two other movies about theme parks ride just recently failed. So us coming out there, they say, oh, we're looking for this one from Inter-Sood Arrow's at. But when you get a great performance from Johnny Depp, and it was just took people by surprise because of the humor and the wonderful character that Johnny created. The soundtrack to Pirates, right, is became completely iconic, right? Actually, a lot of the soundtracks of your movies have become completely iconic. Do you think about soundtrack a lot as you're working on a project? It's important, it really is. To get something that works for the movie and is also something that creatively is unique and different. And the way to Gaga's song, we have all the different ones that we put in our movies and working with Hans Zimmer and Lauren Balfe and a lot of the other composers that we've worked with, Harold Faltemire. They're all great artists. Look, I think our company, what our secret sauce is, is we know talent. We understand talent, and we seek out new talent. And we look at it from a wholly different perspective. We see things differently. That's why our movies are a little different. Talk about that different perspective a little bit. I wish I could tell you. I'd sell it and give it to somebody else and go to Hawaii and not even worry about it. But it's something that the way we work so hard at everything we do, we find these new directors, we're doing a picture right now for Disney Plus with Daisy Ridley called Young Woman The Sea. It's a fantastic story about a swimmer back in 1926. But the story is that a fairy went out in the early, I think, 1919 or 1920, 3200 women and children were killed drowned. So the mother, this German immigrant mother, said my two girls are going to learn how to swim. The father was totally against. It goes uncouth for women to swim. And the one daughter took to the water. She was amazing. She went to the Olympics. She didn't win. But she decided to swim the English Channel. She tried to swim at once. She was poisoned because the coach tried it 21 times.",https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=z4hExsMyQNo,84,2022-10-17 20:22:04
3478," Amazing, she went to the Olympics, she didn't win, but she decided to swim the English Channel. She tried to swim at once, she was poisoned because the coach had tried it 21 times and failed, it was embarrassing, a woman could beat him. And then she swam it again and not only did she swim the English Channel, first woman to do it, she beat the male's record by two hours. She had the biggest parade down fifth to have in her her and athlete ever, including today. So when you see the footage, we have the real footage in the in the film that you won't believe how spectacular it is. When you looked at that story, how did you know it was something you wanted to do? I like to tell stories about people that were forgotten in time and made a difference. We did it with remembered the Titans, and Gloria Rowe and Black Hawk Down. So this is another movie that fits into that category. The same thing happened with the first top gun. There was a TV series that was on there that failed about aviators and the conventional wisdom was that no movie about flying could ever be a success. Same thing with pirate movies, so many pirate movies that failed. But you look at it a different way. And top gun, we looked at it a different way. We gave you the real experience. We tried to on the first one we didn't succeed, but the story was so good that you got away with being on a gimbal a lot. Where in this one, they're flying, they're up there, those actors are really in those planes. So CSI Vegas season two just kicked off. You are as big on television as you are in the movies. What's the future of TV look like for you to approach TV any differently? Yeah, it's about entertaining audiences. That's it. It's about getting people to enjoy what you do. And I like to do shows that give you an inside look into a Roger Nebri be a part of. CSI is part of that. We have a new show called Fire Country, which is the highest rated new show. It just came out two weeks ago. And the ratings actually went up in the second weekend. So it's a new show. And again, it's giving you an inside look into what firefighters do. And CSI gives you a good look at what CSI's do. And Top Gun gave me a great look at what Aviators do. But it's I guess it's what we call process. I love giving people process. I have to ask, is there an area that you've been curious about that you haven't explored yet on film? I think an all-out comedy would be fun to do. We haven't done one of those yet, but maybe someday. I do want to talk a little bit about your part ownership of the Seattle Kraken. Tell me a little bit how you approach that, how you knew you wanted to own an NHL team. And what do you, it means to be a good owner of a sports team? Higher good people. That's what a good owner does. And we have a fantastic group of people running the team. And David Bonderman who, if I ask, who is a big lead investor on it, he's just a great gentleman and really supports what the management wants to do with the team. And surround yourself with good people. You're never going to fail. That's the secret to Jerry Brockheimer. You've been on top for so long in an industry that's famously fickle. How have you done it? Hard work. It's it. It's a Sunday. I'm here with you. I'm Saturday. And I'm here with you. I even let him strack a time. I wasn't London yesterday. I just got off a plane at midnight last night. And here I am doing an interview. So, and then I'm jumping out of plane to go see a Kraken game tonight. But do what you love. That's it. I love what I do. I love going to movies. I love sports. I love hockey. I love being involved with great people and being supportive and trying to do as best we can do. Again, entertainer. Listen, hockey is no different than making movies. It's entertainment. And how did you know when you were good at producing movies? I think I started when I was a little kid. I was like 10 years old, 11 years old. I put together a hockey team. I put together a baseball team. So, I was always good at organizing things. And I didn't have winners, but what was fun doing it. Do anyone out there who admires your career? Do you have any advice you give? The harder you work to look at, here you get. But what it is is you have to find something that you love doing A and B that you're good at. A lot of things I love to be a professional hockey player. I'm just no good. Or a lot of things I'd like to do, but I'm not good at it. Find something you love doing that you're good at and pursue that. Rather than dream about being something that you might not be good at. Thank you so much. Thank you.

3479," In the 2022 Yahoo Finance All Market Summit, up next, we're joined by one of the biggest names in media. Paramount Global CEO Bob Beckish. Paramount CEO Bob Beckish leads one of the world's top media and entertainment companies with a powerful collection of brands from CBS, Showtime, Nickelodeon, MTV, BET, and Comedy Central. And not to mention one of the most storied Hollywood studios, Paramount. The media and entertainment industry is going through a complete rewrite with quote-unquote new normals triggered by COVID-19 and shifting consumer demands. Bob Beckish joins us now to discuss that and so much more. Bob, thank you so much for being here. Great to be here. Alright, I want to start first with streaming and Paramount Plus. You've seen this roller coaster focus on profitability, the subscriber slowdowns, but Paramount Plus, they've been killing it, 43.3 million total subscribers. In your view, what is Paramount Plus done right and what do you think it still needs to work on to be in that top, top of the streaming wars? Yeah, so we're thrilled with the performance Paramount Plus and when we launched the product a year and a half ago and it was a rebranded version of CBS All Access that we built on expanded, people said, you're too late to the party, you're too small and we looked at it and we said, well, wait a minute, we think there's an opportunity in the marketplace for a broad service and we think that really leverages our unique portfolio of assets. So we came to be news, sports and a mountain of entertainment and we put really the way to the whole company behind that. And since then, through a strong content, through marketing which leverages our platforms, through a really a tightly integrated distribution strategy, we went on to become much bigger than anyone thought. And in fact, if you look at 2022, we've led the industry in the US in subscriber additions every month this year, except February. And in February, one of our competitors had the Super Bowl and the Olympics and okay, we were number two that month. But other than that, we've been number one. So we're growing very quickly and we're extremely happy and we see a great road ahead for this service. And you confirmed earlier reports that there are talks to potentially combo paramount with show.",https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=z4hExsMyQNo,86,2022-10-17 20:30:22
3480," We're extremely happy and we see a great road ahead for this service. And you confirmed earlier reports that there are talks to potentially combo Paramount with Showtime. Have those talks advanced in any way, especially with the departure of David Nevens? So we're focused on developing a compelling consumer proposition and by extension of that, a compelling distributor proposition. And when we launched Paramount Plus at the core, we said our advantage is broad. So and when you look at that, every month we prove that right. The combination of news and sports, having the NFL back is awesome, having UEFA is awesome, mixing that with Paramount films, which by the way, we've had six number one films. So let me talk to you about that. Adding the fall, it's a slate with CBS, which we won five of seven days last week and we have the top one, two and three new show. And then of course adding a robust library and ongoing production from our cable networks. It really is a compelling combination. With these of these Showtime, we use Showtime in a number of ways. Internationally, it's integrated into Paramount Plus. We felt that was the right way. We didn't have a standalone Showtime if you will, linear service. So the brand wasn't quite as developed. We thought that's compelling proposition. In the US, you can buy Showtime separately, OTT versus Paramount Plus. It obviously has a linear service. It has a well-developed brand. And we're happy with how it's doing on a standalone basis. A while ago, we introduced a price bundle, which was you can have Showtime and Paramount Plus together at Modest Discount. And we're pleased with that. Last month, we introduced an app with Paramount Plus with Showtime inside as an option. So instead of a price bundle, you now have one app and you get the benefit of the Showtime content should you choose. We've been very happy with the take rate there. And I can tell you, I use that version of the Paramount Plus app and it is yet again, another proof of broader is better. As seeing those Showtime, whether it's the originals or some of the movies in the carousels mixed in with the other Paramount Plus stuff really works. So again, what are we focused on now? We're focused on how do we make a more compelling consumer proposition and how does that aid in getting distributors even more behind our product. So we look at it optionality. And I don't know exactly where it's going to go, but I can tell you our product will continue to get stronger. It will continue to evolve and that will bring down churn and it will continue to grow the sub base. Are you using those bundled offerings that you were just talking about as a sort of test to see what a combination service could bring in the market? Well, absolutely. We're getting more data every day on Paramount Plus on the standalone, what works under the covers, how does sports content interact with films, etc. We're seeing how the bundle performs on a price basis. We can look at variability in pricing. So yeah, we learn more about streaming every day and that informs our going forward plan. You mentioned pricing. I want to pick up on that. Pricing has gone up for a lot of these streaming competitors. We got the news recently that the Netflix ad here that's going to be $6.99 in the US. Where's that sweet spot for you when we think about pricing relative to competitors, but also wanting to make sure that you're not leading to increased churn? Yeah, sure. So a couple points on pricing. One is streaming represents an extraordinary value in general for the consumer. Point two is within that Paramount Plus is not the price leader. We are very much a value offering. We tuck in under, say Netflix, under HBO Max, etc. Point three is in general, and you've already seen the start to happen, streaming pricing is going to go up. One of our competitors just announced a 30% price increase. Netflix has raised price multiple times. So the price umbrella on streaming will go up and we'll tuck in under that and we will raise price as well. Can't tell exactly when that'll happen, but directly it's going to happen for sure. So do you say you're watching competitors pretty closely when it comes to their pricing? Does that factor into your decisions? We look at a lot of things. We look at the performance of our product, with our consumers, we look what competitors are doing, the obviously look at what's going on outside of streaming. All that gets factored into our decision making on our course of action for streaming and the business at large. And when we think about content, you were mentioning sports content, obviously Paramount Plus has a ton of kids content, but there still seems to be a need for this buildable franchise type of content across the sector. So what do you think will be key for your content strategy moving forward? Well, you just hit on something, the word franchise. One of the things.",https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=z4hExsMyQNo,87,2022-10-17 20:34:57
3481," franchise type of content across the sector. So what do you think will be key for your content strategy moving forward? Well, you just hit on something, the word franchise. One of the things that Paramount Global brings to consumers is a deep collection of franchises. And it's certainly core to our strategy in general and with respect to streaming to leverage that. Look at our Paramount film slate. There are more and more tilted towards franchises. Why? Because they have built in fan bases and you can involve the storylines. Same thing in linear television, franchises. Look at CBS, this season FBI night crushed it, multiple FBI's. NCIS crushes it, multiple NCIS's. So franchise is our key in the kid space, Paw Patrol. We did our first Paw Patrol movie last year, killed it. We're doing another one next year. SpongeBob, we've done derivative product from that, camp, coral, etc. And then of course Yellowstone, the biggest show on television, we brought the world 1883 last year, we're bringing it 1923 this year. And actually we're doing some more stuff with Taylor Sheridan, who's the writer of it, including Tulsi King with Sylvester Sloan. Franchises work and we have an incredible collection of franchises in our company. So yeah, they're part of our streaming play for sure. And besides streaming, you guys have also heavily invested in some unique partnerships. The Walmart Plus being one that immediately comes to my mind. So what's the benefit of a partnership with Walmart? And what other types of partnerships are you actively exploring? So we've been in bed business with Walmart for a long time. You know, we sell consumer products with them. We distribute home entertainment with them. You know, Doug went mill on the CEO well. And there was a point, I guess it was last year, where they started thinking about the evolution of Walmart Plus and having a video service. And we were naturally interested in expanding that partnership. And it really is a partnership. We're not investing in Walmart Plus per se, but we are the video offering in it. So if you're a Walmart Plus customer consumer and you decide to opt into a video service, you get Paramount Plus. And we think it's a great model. It's early days. It launched in September. But we're already through what we thought would be our year end forecast number. And that it is a tremendously powerful retail. They have 140, 150 million people going through their stores in the US every week. And then they got about a million for employees. All of them can opt into Paramount Plus. So we're thrilled with the partnership and it's off to a great start. And let's talk box office. You mentioned your successful film, Slate several times in this environment. How do you determine which film can go direct to the theater or which film you might want to go direct to streaming on Paramount Plus? Well, we had a different point of view on films and streaming, going back to COVID and going back to Paramount Plus. When COVID hit, a lot of people said you should put all your films on streaming or at least day in day on streaming. We said no. We believe in the theatrical window. And we believe in it both to give the audience the chance to have that big screen experience and participate in those economics. And then we can move to streaming. So we adopted what's known as a theatrical and 45 day fast followed streaming strategy. That's our default strategy. And because it was in COVID, that resulted in us holding certain films. As a result, Top Gun Maverick, we moved that date five times. Because we said this is a big screen movie and it should be in the theaters. And I'm glad we did, because that turned out to be a good call. I think the theatrical with 45 day fast follow, which by the way, on Top Gun, we're going a little bit longer than that by the nature of the film. 20 weeks later, it's still in theaters today and it was the only film in history. We number one on Memorial Day and number one on Labor Day. So at having a longer theatrical run makes sense. But in general, we like that strategy. I think that's the sweet spot of ROI, particularly with respect to films. And that is very much our going forward strategy with Paramount. So with Top Gun, you know, you guys demonstrated your ability to pivot. I want to talk about the Wall Street sentiment of it all. There seems to be a lot of doom and gloom right now. You're a bit more optimistic. But when we take a look at Paramount Stock price, it's down more than 40% year to date. You have some downgrades on the street. How do you convince analysts and investors that these macro economic headwinds, the decline of cable television, the uncertainties surrounding streaming margins, are not concerning to your fundamentals? Look, I don't think there's a lot of people walking around that's happy with the state of the markets. I mean, that's...",https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=z4hExsMyQNo,88,2022-10-17 20:39:24
3482," and the uncertainties surrounding streaming margins are not concerning to your fundamentals. Look, I don't think there's a lot of people walking around that's happy with the state of the markets. I mean, they're up today, but in general, it's been a rough half year with respect to equity valuations, and certainly our company stock. Worth noting on a relative basis, relative to some other media companies, we've actually done better, i.e. less worse. But nonetheless, there are concerns on the street, there's concerns relative to topics. My view is you have to decide what you believe in and play through. As I said, in theatrical, people said, release it direct to streaming. We said, no, we want to do theatrical and then streaming. When we did Pluto in 20, we closed in early 19, we showed up and talked about it, people said, what's that? That's a joke. By the way, it had 12 million M.A.Us and 70 million revenue. Three years later, it had 70 million M.A.Us and over a billion dollars in revenue. And now everybody's like, whoa, this fast category is really cool. But if you listen to the street, and you know, let's know there's you would never have done it. So you have to decide what you believe. The two concerns in the street right now are advertising and streaming profitability. Advertising is a great business, and we have a fundamentally strong position in it. Our combination of linear reach, particularly with the broadcast network, plus the number one fast service in the country, in Pluto TV, gives us a great reach expression for advertisers. Add to that. It's all wrapped around great creative content that people love to be associated with. NFL, survivor, FBI, Paw Patrol, what have you. Add to that. Advanced ad capabilities. And an ability to do all that business on a turnkey basis. It's a fundamentally compelling proposition. And we will demonstrate it again. Second question people are worried about is streaming profitability. We've always had a plan to build a robust streaming business, but a profitable streaming business. Our business is only a year and a half old, takes a little while. We always said peak investment year is 2023. It still is. But we are building a business that we see as over time having TV media like margins. And we are tracking according to our plan. So are there concerns on the street that have negatively impacted valuations? Yes. Do we have to play through and deliver and continue to have the momentum we're showing? Yes. And ultimately, that represents a great value opportunity for people. All right, well, you heard it here. Thank you so much, Bob, for covering all those topics with us, Bob Backage, a Paramount CEO. Thank you. Coming up, investing in a high interest rate environment, billionaire private equity CEO Robert Smith joins us next. Coming up, source of security and bank analysis is today's opening.

3483," music music It is one of the biggest enterprise software conglomerates in the world and it's in private hands. Vista Equity Partners has more than $94 billion in assets under management with a current portfolio of 85 companies and it's still growing. Recently striking a deal to buy cybersecurity firm know before for $4.6 billion. Joining us now is the founder, Chairman and CEO of Vista Equity Partners, Robert Smith. Thank you so much for being here. It's great to see you. Yeah, you too in person. So obviously you have a big reach of your portfolio companies, all of those companies that I mentioned. So you have a lot of insight into corporate spending on technology right now because they are business to business largely. What are you seeing right now? What are you hearing from your companies, from your clients and does it feel like from where you sit that we are on the cusp of a recession? Yeah, great, great set of questions. I think importantly, you know, enterprise software still is viewed as the most productive tool introduced in the business economy last 50 years like it will be for the next 50. So, you know, in an environment where there's wage inflation, a lack of developer talent, wages related to cyber attacks, companies are actually increasing in many cases their spending and enterprise software. Now overall, again, we're about $24 billion in revenues across our entire platform which, you know, think about as maybe four fifth largest enterprise software company in the world. And we have over I think 350 million users of our software. When we're looking at what the spending dynamics have been over the last year, over 25% kind of bookings growth, we're seeing kind of 20 to 25 now. So we're seeing some slow down in certain sectors and frankly, acceleration in others. Things like low code, no code, environments, things for productivity, you know, things for anything around, you know, cyber security to protect the enterprise. Those are sorts of dynamics that we're seeing. So am I seeing a broad slow down across our platform? No. Are we seeing some pockets where we actually see it? Yes. Typically, those will be in any of the B to B to see, any of those consumer oriented businesses you'll see a little more slow down. You're not seeing people buying as much in the future as they used to, which you saw in some of the Apple and some of their numbers, et cetera. Where some of the companies that we focus on really, you know, this mission critical, you know, a business critical enterprise software continues to be in demand and robust demand for the most part. Is there a point you see in the future? Is there a point typically in these kinds of cycles where you do start to see that pullback? I mean, to be fair, when we were in the financial crisis in that recession, the enterprise software industry was not as developed as it is now. So I'm not sure we have a perfect analog. But what are you expecting to see? Great, great analysis. So if you look at 2014, 2018 coming out of that, you know, great financial crisis, you actually, there's about 10, 12 percent of the companies were in what we call a native cloud environment. Today it's closer to 35 percent. As a result of that, these companies grow faster. The productivity tools that they're delivering can be delivered more effectively, more efficiently. And so the utilization rates of them has actually been enhanced. The other thing that's actually quite interesting is the productivity dynamic. As you know, in the U.S. today, we've actually decided to effectively close our borders. And I like to say, you know, the most scarce commodity on the planet, planet isn't oil or lithium or cobalt. It's actually software programmers. There's seven and a half billion people on the planet. It's only 29 million of us who write code for a living. And these are the people who are actually providing and building these productivity tools that have to continue to, you know, enable and digitize not only companies, but entire economies and countries, you know, in education and cybersecurity. Those are the areas that we're actually seeing that increase demand. Now, all that said, I still think that you're going to see the downturn.",https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=z4hExsMyQNo,90,2022-10-17 20:47:56
3484," countries, you know, in education and cybersecurity. Those are the areas that we're actually seeing that increase demand. Now, all that said, I still think that you're gonna see the downturn in some of the consumer, you know, interest rates go up. People are buying fewer and fewer phones and cars and no sooner consumer devices, probably making decisions between do I fill my gas tank with fuel or do I buy another consumable advice. But in the business segments, you know, businesses have to continue to think about how do I can do more with less and software is one of the ways that they're gonna continue to embrace it. So, is it gonna be slow down in certain segments? I will argue in Europe in particular, I think we're gonna see a more advanced slowdown in many other economies. We're not seeing as much in the US as we sit here today. Are your portfolio companies doing any kind of preemptive batting down the hatches, so to speak, any kind of cutting and spending or hiring freezes, et cetera? Yeah, not at this point. I mean, there's a few that actually, you know, who have a little more consumer, like I call a little more consumer facing orientation who have to think about, okay, you know, are we overbuilding in our sales capacity or development capacity? But for the most part, the company is we bi, typically, you know, have a massive ROI. I think I told you, we talked about this before. Our average company, the products they sell to their customers is a 640% return on investment, right? So, if you think about that, almost anything else a corporation can do doesn't come anywhere near the kind of ROI. If you're doing any sort of, you know, six-sigma or a chis-in or, you know, energy efficiency dynamics in your company, their order is a magnitude below, and your multiples below that 640%. So, corporations are continuing to advance and they're spending now. And our companies, in cases we're thinking, you know, we may not be, they may not expand as much. Sure, you've got to think about, you know, the higher fewer people. But for the most part, the vast majority of our companies are still, you know, meeting their annual operating plan, which includes, you know, hiring. Our average company increases its organic employee growth by about 20% from time when we buy it to the time in which we go to a monetization. So, that really hasn't changed at this point. I want to turn to sort of your acquisition strategy. I mentioned no before. That's a leverage buyout. Right. So, was the Citrix deal, which was earlier this year for $16.5 billion, big deal that you did with Elliot. The lenders behind the Citrix deal were portedly then when they turned around and sold the debt, so it had discounted. I guess we've seen some big changes in the funding environment. So, how was the funding environment changed? Sure. And was it tough to get the no before deal financed as a result of those changes? Sure. I mean, you've got two markets in essence that we think about. There is a syndicated debt market, and we call it a private debt market. And the syndicated debt market that Citrix was part of, I think there were 30 banks involved. So, you know, the exposure of in the end, one of them was actually, you know, modest relatively speaking. But, you know, it was a fully underwritten deal, fully priced from our perspective, and they go through distribution. Most of them ended up keeping it on their balance sheets, because they know the work that we do in the value creation dynamics that will actually bring those bond bonds back to par. And, you know, in essence, they'll be, you know, get tightly up at the end of the day. If you think about the private market, that private market has emerged over the last six, seven years as being quite robust. But it went from, you know, 10 or so lenders to now about 30 or 40 in that space. And so, you may have to go to a few more, but we still see the ability to get deals like no before done, Avallara done in these private markets, as opposed to relying on syndicated debt markets. So, that's a dynamic that we're seeing in a marketplace. And what about on the other side? You mentioned exits. Great. Are any of your investors getting a little antsy here? Because it's tough to have exits right now, right? We were talking before we came here on set about the so-called class of 2021, the companies that came public last year, by and large have not done so well. It's a tough environment. Right. It is. And, you know, part of what we do is we focus on a couple of things we do really well. A, valuation going in. So, you know, we maintain a very strict price discipline in the way we invest. And just to give you some, some, some round numbers. You know, we focus on what we call growth-adjusted revenue multiple. 2014, 2018, growth-adjusted revenue multiple in the market place is about 0.43. When we went through this massive capital expansion in 2020, where, you know, I call it every central government on the planet, decided to really flood the market with liquidity to make sure that their economies didn't go into a recession during the beginning of the pandemic. I call it created, you know, a lot of capital and a lot of ambition, right? A lot of funds put a lot of capital to work above what I call that normal-",https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=z4hExsMyQNo,91,2022-10-17 20:52:34
3485," It didn't go into a recession during the beginning of the pandemic. Call it a creative, you know, a lot of capital and a lot of ambition, right? A lot of funds put a lot of capital to work above what I call that normalized level. We were very disciplined and actually didn't have any that we did in above that level. We're still able to deploy mass amounts of capital over $18 billion invested in that period of time. Now, all that said, we were still in a down economy that we're seeing today. We've just now completed, we announced yesterday a company called Apption that we sold. In that sort of an environment, if you build high quality companies, we have the ability in that point, at that point to actually sell these companies in these down markets. So in the last 12 months, you know, everything from media ocean to data to ICEMS. I mean, these are businesses, I think we've done a great job in building the capacity of those companies to do really well. And of course, Apption is one we just recently announced. And of course, the sale of paying, which we completed, which I think closes the next week and a half or so. So you guys have still been busy. I'm curious which advice to retail investors would be when it comes to tech stocks, right? You obviously see some good valuations still out there. Do you think that retail investors should be looking at tech stocks, right? Well, I like to say, you know, not all tech stocks, of course, are created equal. You know, enterprise software, you know, if you look at the earnings of a lot of the enterprise software companies, they actually are holding up pretty well. Now, there's stocks continue to get hammered for a couple of, you know, call it, you know, technical reasons. And then there's a lot of part of which is they get pulled down by the consumer and the internet stocks. And you have, you know, people who are, you know, institutional investors, crossover investors who are creating public books. And those public books, they had, you know, consumer internet and enterprise. And if the consumer and internet books are down 50, 60%, and they, you know, levered that book up, they've got to meet those margin calls. Well, how do you do that? You sell them to strength. So you're selling it into the enterprise businesses that have the flow, have the capacity, et cetera. You know, our market is really interesting one because we're still, you know, 70%, or sorry, 97% private companies. But in these markets for us, as you've seen us, you know, anytime we see downturns of the market, that's when we look at old companies. We really would like to buy and now have become what I'll call more affordable for the type of underwriting that we do. Where we can bring our value creation metrics to it. Let's switch gears a little bit. I want to talk about more House. Yeah, sure. We talked about 2019 when you paid off the student debt of the graduating classroom. Right, yeah, sure. And then you ended up starting the student freedom initiative, which helps to continue those sorts of efforts. Yep. But I'm curious to take a step back. Obviously, the Biden administration has done some student debt relief. Do you think we need a bigger overhaul of the student debt system in the US? I do. I think we need to rethink what it is that we want in our economy. We want productive students. We want them to be able to increase their quality and standard of life, and relative to their parents. Everyone wants to see that level of improvement. And look, not all kids need to go to college in order to create a very productive standard of living. So I think we have to be thoughtful about that. I think the universities have to be, think about being responsible delivers of high value education that can be used in work environments or entrepreneurial settings as part of what their relationship is with the customer there being the student. The student freedom initiative, which we set up as basically a fund, that, in essence, these students, they borrow money from so they can hopefully offset what I call the acute pain of parent plus loans, which I saw was pretty acute to the students in more house. But when they pay it back, they actually pay it back into the fund that gets re-lent to the next generation of students. We focus on STEM students, STEM students, or HPCUs, and MSIs, or minority serving institutions. Because we have to activate more of our citizenry here in America to be part of this digital revolution. So, we have probably the highest product possibility of participating in this digital revolution. So we want to ensure that we educate as many as we can and provide them with the opportunities to, on another side of that, of course, is internships and full-time jobs to participate in our economy. Again, that's scarcity of developers, that's scarcity of technical talent. We need to address that since we pretty much closed our borders at this point in time to immigration, which was one of the fueling dynamics in America to fuel our productivity. So we've got to turn to our internal resources, being our citizenry, to get them to enable them to participate in the economy much more effectively. We're, unfortunately, running short on time, so I have one more question.",https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=z4hExsMyQNo,92,2022-10-17 20:56:43

We're unfortunately running short on time so I have one more question I want to ask you and it sort of speaks to the last thing Initially we were talking about you're frequently referred to as the richest black man in America right and I'm just Does that feel like a heavy mantle to wear right and and what do you want your legacy to be with that sort of big moniker? Yeah, that's a really interesting question you know I I think about it in the context of how I grew up you know I grew up in a family Where my mother and my father were very responsible citizens in the community and that meant you know providing fabric of opportunity They were both school teachers, but they also were civically enabled you know my father started you know a North City Park Civic Association was the chairman of the local YMCA and you know my mother and he worked on in developing head start Programs and so they were very vested in the education in a segregated neighborhood of the kids and giving them opportunities to improve their quality of education Quality of nutrition quality of care that I think really made a big difference in for me and my family So I think about it through that lens and you know they had certain limited resources very limited resources I have a few more resources so I'm delighted to you know bring organizational capacity capital and Wherewithal to you know initiatives that I think going to improve the standards of of people on this planet and in people in the communities that I come from What's that thanks so much for being here.

Since I started using YouTube for bulletin intelligence, I actually thought this was gonna be a short video, I'm not coming through and this is really annoying. Yeah. It seems I'm gonna continue with the institutions. We're gonna first holy and theirs as well as books, frankly. I have multiple institutes of Portland, Ambassador William Taylor is an American diplomat, government official and former military officer. He was US ambassador to Ukraine from 2006 to 2009 under President Bush and Obama and acting ambassador under President Trump. During the hour of spring he oversaw US support to Egypt, Tunisia, Libya and Syria. Taylor also served in various key diplomatic roles in Iraq and Afghanistan and led US assistance to the former Soviet Union and Eastern Europe. With that long and respected career, few American officials have more experience, or a greater understanding of Ukraine and the threat Vladimir Putin and Russia now pose to the world. Welcome, Ambassador. The Russian president is calling up reserves. He is conducting these referenda in parts of Ukraine. He says he's annexing parts of Ukraine. He's reminding us that he's got nuclear weapons. His problem, of course, for Shell, is that he's losing on the battlefield. His soldiers are dropping their weapons in the northern part of Ukraine where they're fighting. They are abandoning their tanks. They are running away from the oncoming Ukrainian military, the soldiers. And so President Putin has a real problem on the battlefield. So he's trying to change it up so far, unsuccessfully. His attempt to recruit more soldiers is failing. His attempt to placate the people on his right in Russian politics is failing. He sees the people in Russia fleeing the country. So President Putin has a real problem, Shell, in all of these attempts to regain the momentum. He's failing in that. And you mentioned an interesting word, which is desperation, which can push people into a lot of different directions. So as we talk red lines, the nuclear threat. How seriously is Putin considering a nuclear strike against Ukraine? And what would he be weighing in really making that choice? So let me just...",https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=z4hExsMyQNo,94,2022-10-17 21:05:12
3488," lines, the nuclear threat. How seriously is Putin considering a nuclear strike against Ukraine? And what would he be weighing in really making that choice? So, let me just say that I think the chances of the Russians using nuclear weapons is small, is very low. That said, when you have the president, the dictator, of a big nation that has nuclear weapons saying that he might use them in Ukraine, you have to take it seriously. And of course, the West does take it seriously. There's no higher priority for our intelligence agencies than to be sure that they have a careful watch over any indications in Russia that there's any preparation or any steps toward the use of nuclear weapons. So far, none. So far, there's no indication that they are taking these steps. We have to watch, we have to be careful. And we have to send the message to President Putin and the Russian military and the Russian people that there will be devastating consequences, catastrophic consequences if they made a bad mistake, a bad decision and used nuclear weapons in Ukraine. It would cost them dearly for all kinds of ways, which to be clear, our government has made clear to the Russians. So that's an important part of deterrence. We don't want to see these weapons used. The Chinese and the Indians don't want to see these weapons used. The Russian people don't want to see these weapons used, weapons used. And so that's the message it has to get through to President Putin. I think he must be hearing that. So then you talk about what he might be hearing, then what sort of conversations are likely happening within the Kremlin? You mentioned the oligarchs and the role that they play. What do you think is actually happening? Who's actually having Putin's here at the moment? You know, I don't think the oligarchs have his ear on military things. The oligarchs are probably telling President Putin that they're having great difficulty. Most of the big oligarchs that have anything to do with this war are sanctioned. They can't travel. Their assets are frozen. Their families can't travel. Their children can't go to school in England or in Great Britain or in the United States or wherever they think. So the oligarchs are under sanctions and they're probably expressing concern, expressing the fact that they're not happy about this. However, they're probably not the key voices in Mr. Putin's ear when he's thinking about his problems that I talked about earlier on the battlefield in Ukraine. Those voices are probably well informed. That is his interior, his intelligence services, his military, his defense officials. They're telling him probably what he wants to hear. So he may not be getting the best advice from them. He's a powerful man. They don't want to tell him things that he's not going to be happy about. So it's not entirely clear, Mr. Rosalind, in answer to your question, what he is actually hearing? What he can be sure of is that he's losing on the battlefield. And we know he understands that because he's calling up reserves. He knows his military is not doing well enough to stop the Ukrainians. Indeed, the Ukrainians are pushing his military back out of their country. The Ukrainians are pushing the Russians back out of Ukraine. And so President Putin has to call up reserved. In order to do that, he has to be talking to his military and his recruitment services. So that message is clearly getting through. And in terms of red line for NATO, what is the tipping point that perhaps have them escalate as they're seeing this escalation now with the drones, especially killing so many civilians at the moment? So it's very, very clear to NATO what would happen. If the Russians were to attack any NATO member, there's no doubt in the NATO members' mind. There's no doubt in the Russian mind, and President Putin's mind, that if the Russians were to again make this bad decision, this blunder, to attack a NATO member, that would...",https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=z4hExsMyQNo,95,2022-10-17 21:09:22
3489," They, if the Russians were to again make this bad decision, this blunder to attack a NATO member, that would ensure their defeat. That would ensure, that would be like committing suicide. I don't think the Russians are totally irrational. I don't think they're suicidal. So I think again, the chances of the Russians attacking NATO members is low. Can't discount it, have to be ready. NATO is clearly ready. NATO is building up its capabilities on its eastern front. NATO is providing weapons to the Ukrainians because that's the first line of defense. The Ukrainians are fighting the first line of defense. They are defending the rest of NATO, the rest of Europe, from the Russians. And so that's why the United States, as a leading NATO member, that's why other NATO nations are providing the weapons to Ukraine to defend Ukraine so that the Russians can't go further. Can't go into Europe. Now let's talk sanctions another way that the West is trying to squeeze Russia. Now we know that you have also pushed hard for these sanctions as well, but by all accounts, yes, it's affecting the economy, but it's not deterring Putin at the moment. What if anything would dampen his resolve at this point? What would dampen his resolve your right is not going to be sanctions. What sanctions are going to do is what you mentioned earlier, squeezing the economy, sanctions make it more difficult for the Russian economy to continue to support this war. So that's the purpose of sanctions to this point. Make it hard for the Russians to be able to replace all these weapons, all these missiles, all these cruise missiles, and guided missiles and airstrikes, all of those things cost money and all of those things need to be replaced. And the sanctions make it harder to replace. However, you're exactly right. They have not deterred President Putin from this attack. You ask what's going to deter him, what's going to change his mind, losing, continuing to lose on the battlefield. And in order for him to continue to lose on the battlefield, we need to continue to provide more and heavier and stronger and longer range weapons to the Russia, and so to the Ukraine so they can push the Russians back out. Now, in terms of assistance, I know you mentioned China, but you also saw OPEC-plus deciding to cut production of oil, which, in turn, benefits Russia, which benefits from that. But what are decisions like this, whether it's on energy or perhaps these purchases from China and India? What does that do, not just to the effectiveness of sanctions, but really the dynamics with the rest of the world? So you're right to ask about the dynamics of the rest of the world. One place where those dynamics play out is in the UN. Now, we know that in the Security Council, UN Security Council, the Russians have a veto, and they used it. So they can stop action there, but they can't stop action in the general assembly, in the United Nations General Assembly, where there have been a series of votes to indicate this dynamic that you're asking about, the dynamic in the rest of the world about where nations stand. The Russians have lost every one of those votes. The most recent one, which I'll, is was last week, and 143 nations voted to condemn Russia. 143. There were five nations that supported Russia. Four nations plus Russia that supported the Russian attack on your great. So 143 to five. Now, there were so many abstentions, some 38 nations abstained, but it's very interesting. The Chinese did not support the Russians. The Chinese did not vote with the Russians. The Chinese abstained. The Indians did not vote with the Russians. The Indians abstained. So the Russians couldn't even get these nations, and they've got this partnership with the Chinese, and they can't even get the Chinese to vote with them in the UN, and the Indians buy a lot of weapons from the Russians. So they want to try to stay on the good side of the Russians, and they didn't support the Russians in the UN. Mastings そっす句話達 Move",https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=z4hExsMyQNo,96,2022-10-17 21:13:53
3490," by a lot of weapons from the Russians. So they want to try to stay on the good side of the Russians, and they didn't support the Russians in the UN. Maybe they realize that the Russian weapons aren't so good after all. Maybe that's one of the reasons that the Indians, but when you look at where the international community is, in terms of UN votes or in other things, you see that people are not even Russia, even the Belarusians. So President Putin is trying to lean on the President of Belarus, President Lukashenko, to support him, to support Putin in this battle, in this fight. And President Lukashenko really doesn't want to do it because the Belarusian people don't support the war against Ukraine. They're supporting Ukraine against Russia. So even this close ally is hesitant to support Putin. This is all to say that the dynamics, the international dynamics, are against the Russians and support the Ukrainians. And, Roselle, if there is, if there were, going back to our earlier conversation about nuclear use, if the Russians were to decide to use nuclear weapons, they would lose all support, all support. There would be even more of a pariah than they are right now. So when you look at what is going to happen in terms of any sort of pathway to peace, and what the world looks like at the end of this war, and the relationships between Russia and the rest of the world, how do you see any sort of path to peace going from here? The path to peace, that's the right question. The path of peace runs through Russian defeat on the battlefield. The Russians have to recognize that they are losing on the battlefield when they try to fight the Ukrainians. The Ukrainians are pushing the Russians back out of their country. When the Ukrainians have pushed the Russians back out of their country, back beyond where the Russians were on February 23rd of this year, with just before they started the invasion, when they're back toward the international boundaries, that the Ukrainians want to reestablish, then President Putin probably looks for a way out and probably tries to come negotiate something. That's the way out. Eventually negotiations when the Russians have been pushed way back into Russia way back out of Ukraine, and then President Putin tries to salvage something from this horrible decision, this blunder. That's likely to be the path to peace. Well, we'll see if that's a decision that Putin will take lightly. Obviously, a lot of it stayed here, a lot of death, and a lot of people wondering what's going to happen next. We do appreciate you breaking down these dynamics for us and bastard William Taylor.

3514," I'd maybe seven years if you're lucky. So the chances that we're going to see a huge burst of activity there is really not in the cards. We do have the holiday season coming up. Microsoft just announced a handful of new products. We should see new products coming from some of its OEM partners. So we'll just have to wait and see what the results come from them. But this really does kind of just speak to the larger issues that we're seeing in the market as well as, as I said, that's low down. Yes. Most definitely. And we'll see if all of this starts showing up in the jobs of work numbers, for example, particularly for tech hiring. Thanks, Dan. Appreciate it. Coming up, which you probably had to say about California's minimum wage fight speaking about worker dynamic sizes got the details next. Yeah, California Governor Gavin Newsom has proposed raising the minimum wage in the state to over $20 per hour. Some businesses have come out and protested the proposal, arguing that the higher cost would cause them to increase prices for customers. The CEO of Chipotle, Brian Nichol spoke to Brian Sasi about this issue yesterday as well as our Brook to Balma. And Sasi, that's where we're finding to take today. A lot of bees in there. Well done there. There are a lot of Brian's yesterday. Well done Julie. Yes, this really focuses on the Fast Recovery Act signed by Newsom. I believe it was on Labor Day to establish a standards for the stakes, $550,000 fast food workers. Now if this goes into fact, you could see the minimum wage in the state for fast food workers. Eventually reach $22 an hour. Now Chipotle has 15% of its restaurants in California. It's one of their biggest and most important markets. I asked CEO Brian Nichol about this and what that wage at $22 an hour would mean to the company. We'll probably have to raise prices. And you know, it's unfortunate because it also impacts the economic model that could impact.",https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1iVTbuGfqnQ,1,2022-10-18 13:58:09
3515," $1.00 an hour would mean to the company. We'll probably have to raise prices. And it's unfortunate because it also impacts the economic model that could impact how many restaurants we even open in the future in a state like California, which is a real shame because our brand is loved in California, our employees love working at Chipotle in California, and I know the customers love getting our food. So hopefully the legislation doesn't get in the way of great economics that results in great opportunities for employees and customers. But if it does, we'll deal with it accordingly, but it'd be a real shame. And I think Brian really is plugged into all things California outside of Chipotle. He recently, I believe, was over a year ago, actually moved their headquarters to Newport Beach. So he's plugged in there. He spent a lot of time working in fast food throughout his career, of course, at young brands, but also very specifically in that California market. But here's my take. At least as it comes to our, as it pertains to Chipotle stock for right now, it's still going to be driven by their sales growth trends. And by all accounts, they continue to be best in class stacked up to its peers. That's why you see Chipotle stock having done so well over the past two plus years undernickel. But again, this is a longer term. Well, it could be a major profit headwind to a Chipotle if this does reach $22 an hour. Because to his point, they will probably have to raise prices pretty significantly. How much do people in California get paid now? $15 an hour is the minimum wage. At Chipotle? He said they pay over $15 an hour at Chipotle in California. Yeah, correct. Got it. OK, so I mean, for the sales growth side of that equation, too, it's how they're continuing to engage with the digital customer. But in California, specifically, that customer would then have to pay even more and then have more frequent visits on top of whatever wages that Chipotle would be able to move. I guess we're looking at what a $15 burrito in California. We know that your salad bowls are a lot more. Burrito's already $15. But that's by the same token. What do they think people can live on? People cannot live on $15. Full stop. You can't live on $15. $26,000 a year. I think that's what it comes out to. You can't live on that. It's stressful to not engage on. It's shameful how low minimum wages in this country. Yeah. Oh, you look at McDonald's. I mean, Chipotle is not alone here. I mean, McDonald's is one of the worst culprits. Sure, you see signs up in your local neighborhood. They're offering $15 an hour. But most locations are still paying the federal minimum wage, which is just, it's absolutely mind bogging. Which is crazy that it's actually the businesses that have had to actually take the precautionary or a preemptive step to say, yeah, well, we're our minimum wage. And of course, that causes competition among some of the largest ones that actually can pay. But again, it's them doing this because the government hasn't done it so far. We'll continue to track that. Great breakdown is always guys coming up. We're going to speak with Black Rocks. Your creator on what's the latest inflation data means for the Fed? That's next.aste.",https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1iVTbuGfqnQ,2,2022-10-18 14:02:30

3517," debate now about whether it's going to be sustained, whether this is another head fake. What do you think? So I don't think you can count on the market, continue to have, by the way, it's nice being here on a green day. We don't get any of those these days. But I think it's hard to count on sustained this being sustained. You've got to Fed the still tightening financial conditions. You've got inflation that's still running too hot, and they've got to keep moving. I think that the markets are priced in about as far as the Fed is going to go, but you don't know the answer to that yet. Until we get more data, you've got, you know, we just came off a strong CPI report. We came off a strong payroll report. You know, now all eyes turn to the employment costs index, PCE data. And you know, we need to see it start to trend down for the Fed to come off this. And then it's hard to take a lot of risk until that happens. Has it been encouraging to you though, Rick, that we've seen the market rally in response to earnings that aren't necessarily great Goldman Bank of America. They were okay. You know, they weren't as bad as feared, but even go back to last week. You saw some hot reads on inflation. The market bounced on that number, those numbers as well. Those, to me, seem like positives. They definitely do. And by the way, the bank earnings are pretty good. I mean, when you break it down, those are pretty good. You also had a big relief off of this dynamic that was happening in the UK. I mean, this unwind of the leverage in the pension system was incredibly dislocating. The impact it was having on rates in the UK and then infecting the US and Europe. That was a big deal. Listen, I think you've got the equity market has some pretty sizable short positions in it today. And I think people underestimate how much the market has gotten repositioned around equities. And you're seeing some pretty big put option trading, very big and positions. And short interest, that's pretty sizable. And so the technicals in the equity market are pretty darn good today. So you get these bounces. And my sense is you'll keep getting them. But, you know, can you count on us to stay in rally? I think it's still early to think that. I want to pick up on the point about the UK for just a second. There was more news out this morning. The financial time said they were going to delay their quantitative tightening. Then the bank of England says, no, we're not necessarily going to delay it. But I've been sort of struggling to some extent to understand the interplay between what's going on in the UK and here. So can you sort of lay that out for us and why it is so important what's happening? 100%. So you've got you've got a dynamic in the UK, which is extraordinary in that you had what appeared to be at the time in aggressive fiscal easing at the same time you were seeing central bank tightening. That is not nobody in the in histories ever seen that work out. So that was creating this volatility in the markets. But then you have a dynamic that you had this leverage on one. So you have these pension funds had to sell huge amounts of assets, including long-term interest rates, interest rate products generally. And so what happens is the development of market interest rates, markets tend to work together. And so that was putting pressure on the markets here. And then just the general dislocation, you know, London is the second epicenter of finance. And as you're getting this extraordinary volatility there, and it was permeating all the markets generally. So by the way, you know, when the central banks raised rates as much in tight liquidity, you see the leverage, you know, I would say every day, but periodically you see, wow, I didn't realize that risk was on. I didn't realize this leverage is on. And we're going to keep getting reminders of that for the coming weeks and months. I say, I hope that, you know, the Fed is going to reach a point where they could pause at these elevated rates, whether that's 4.5, 4.5, 4.5, 4.5, you know, once they pause, then you could start to get comfortable. And I just want to take some more risks in my portfolio. But I'd like to see some better data to allow us to think that. Well, you know, upon something that you just mentioned a moment ago, where are you seeing the largest volume of kind of outsized short positions right now? I mean, the overall market, I mean, the size, I was looking at the size of put options trading for a week straight, you're talking about about a trillion dollars worth of of notional puts. So by the way, put that number in perspective, the high yield markets, the US high yield markets are trillion and a quarter, a trillion a day, a put options are trading. Now, they're, they're, that's full notional size. So they obviously trade on a delta basis lower than that. But that's, that is big. And then I look at exposures across a lot of the what is faster money, hedge fund type, and that's really low in terms of exposure. And I think money managers have brought down their exposure pretty significantly. So, you know, that is significant. And that's where I think you've got a market that once it jumps, you get some short covering that comes in. Or so people, people worry that they're going to miss it. I guess I don't think.",https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1iVTbuGfqnQ,4,2022-10-18 14:10:57
3518," You know, that is significant and that's where I think you've got a market that once it jumps you get some short covering that comes in Or so people people worry that they're going to miss it. I guess I I don't think they're going to miss it But it's not to say you know you go through periods where you have real bear markets you get these spiked rallies You mentioned a minute ago That in periods like this we start to see where the leverages in the system where the risk is in the system Where do you have your eyes on that we might see more signs of that? So you know, there's something really different than 15 20 years ago when you had the big subprime crisis and you had leverage in the financial system corporates households You actually don't have that today the banks are in good shape from leverage perspective corporates are households are in good shape Relatively what they've been in history You know the one place you got to keep your eye on is the real estate market commercial real estate residential real estate You know, that's where you have financing not just leverage But you've got to roll over your financing and so the way commercial real estate projects work obviously resi Is you've got to roll over your financing and that that's that's where you can get some tricky things and you by the way You've seen it you know, we've been buying triple a Commercial mortgages and getting close to six and a half and you know with this one piece we bought cost of seven percent triple a You know, so you think about subordinated done underneath that so when that happens you start to think about gosh If I get my triple I ask that that's sort of yield. Why would I take much risk otherwise? Well the other the other difference between now and then though is that you have a lot more private credit companies You that are not the banks are they a source of risk at all in this environment? I would say generally not because their liabilities they're usually locked up money Usually they've got that money for a longer period of time So I don't generally don't think that they are significant risk to unwind You know, there are structures that take place in the market that are You know in and around you know some the C low markets or otherwise that you got to keep your eye on but I would say generally the private financing generally Is pretty well termed out in terms of in terms of where that capital has been raised so I don't think that's a stress point today But like I say guaranteed whenever you get this sort of shock to the system Something's gonna pop up that you didn't expect and you know similar to what happened in UK. I mean who would have thought the UK? You know an issue in the pension system and that's but that is a Lust sort of what happens in these situations. Let's say on financial stability a competitor puts out a survey this morning Lots of charts in there is noting worsening risks to financial stability now weighing on equities But you don't see it you don't see that this is not great recession stuff. We're seeing right now in the markets It's great recession in terms of in terms of the economy slowing or it is I mean not we don't see the same things in housing. I mean it's not a situation. We just see stop prices going down right I so Listen, I mean it's it's been historic in 50 years probably longer than that you've never seen rates and risk Co-down at the same time and that is I mean that is an Illustration of the fastest tightening we've ever seen by the central banks in history By the way, not just not just the US but the emerging markets the ECB The Bank of England. So that is just what happens on the backside of it and you're and it's just not clear How much the economy is going to slow on the backside of it what we are seeing that I think is encouraging is you're starting to see the Goods part of the economy come down a bit and that that is healthy You're seeing that inflation. You're seeing that in Jenshier demand for goods What you're not seeing yet is a service sector service actors in great shape education leisure health care solid both in terms of inflation as well as demand so you've got an economy that's it That's actually in pretty good shape. I think people underestimate while the economy is going to slow the good sector is going to slow You see in that embodied income out of prices home builders, etc But the service economy you know use economies two thirds consumption is two thirds service It's hard to bring that down. That's exactly what I wanted to ask you about with regard to where we sit right now within this shift Because what we've heard so far from the banks that have reported in from the airlines that reported we spoke with Delta CEO And they're talking about this shift in goods to services really really benefiting the experience Economy as well. Is that something that if you look out into early 2023 even further into midway Through 2023 that that remains that demand remains strong and solid enough As consumers are still looking across their own balance sheets where we've seen that go from",https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1iVTbuGfqnQ,5,2022-10-18 14:15:12
3519, In 2023 that remains strong and solid enough as consumers are still looking across their own balance sheets where we've seen that go from as the banks would describe it as strong to now just healthy if you will. I mean listen there is you know when you lift fuel costs and food costs as much as they have it definitely has an effect on consumption generally. But gosh if you side you know will a service sector continue to hold up you still got to look at where wage levels are relative to anything we've ever seen in history you look at where you know the amount of savings that's built up my senses the service economy will continue to continue to do well. By the way it's an aging demographic the demand for health care services is not is not going anywhere other than up from here. So I still think you've got a solid service economy you know people lament where the economy has slowed to but keep in mind we had double digit nominal GDP last year we're slowing from that and you're still going to have nominal GDP this year. It's going to post an impressive number that could be closer to five so still pretty good are we slowing is a good sector slowing yes but by the way it's very different in commodity or antideconomies it's very different in parts of China today although we think next year will be better the emerging markets are tougher but by the way we go to Europe and this is what's creating a lot of the fall you know in Europe when you when you lift fuel costs as much as you have historic and then you look at the UK you look at mortgage rates spiking higher you know consumer 70 percent of the consumption basket gets now eaten up by just their utility bill and their mortgage so you think about how difficult that paradigm presents itself but US relative to the rest of the world is in reasonable shape. Let's leave it there on that hopeful note good to see when person their black rocks chief investment officer of global fixed income recreater we'll talk to you soon. Thanks for stopping our way.

The labor battle across the world continues today roughly 150 Apple employees in Australia began to strike after negotiations over pay and working conditions installed. The three stores involved in negotiations are demanding a minimum hourly wage of $31.00. That's in line with what US employees receive. The account for currency translation. This comes as Apple stores all throughout the United States continue to express interest in unionizing. Another step back for Boeing 737 MAX jets as the Federal Aviation Administration has requested the company review the safety paperwork for the jet. According to the Wall Street Journal, the FAA is unable to review the company's submissions through to missing and incomplete information. Boeing now runs the risk of not being certified by the December deadline as they continue to await regulatory approval for caring passengers. Boeing has said safety remains the driving factor in its effort to meet all regulatory requirements in certifying the 737 MAX-7. And US Air Taxi startup Jobi has applied to Japan's transport ministry for aircraft certification as it prepares to launch its urban transportation services. Jobi is backed by Japanese automaker Toyota. It's already received certification from the US Federal Aviation Administration, allowing it to begin commercial air taxi operations with conventional aircraft. Our brand Tazzy, yesterday asked LinkedIn, co-founder and Jobi investor Reid Hoffman to give his thoughts on that company. I'm looking forward to being able to ride in one. We're still in a place where it's only test pilots, but they're super quiet and they're super safe. So the goal is to create an uber for the skies. Yes, exactly. It's still early days.

American security experts expect Russian hackers to attack voting systems and stir up trouble in the final days before the midterm elections on November 8th. Y'all find it seem calm. This Rick Newman is here for more Rick. Interesting story you're working here. Yeah, and my point is that Vladimir Putin, the president of Russia, he is already interfering in the U.S. election, and it's not in the familiar ways as much that we saw in 2016 and 2020 with this information on social media. It's through inflation. What is the biggest issue for voters right now? It is the economy in its inflation. Now, in the beginning of the year, shortly after Russian invaded Ukraine, Biden, President Biden used this phrase, the Putin price hike to explain away rising oil and gasoline prices. And that wasn't really the case at the time. But we have now have a different kind of inflation. It is not oil and gasoline prices anymore. I'm going to isolate two things here. It's food and it's natural gas. People do not see the price of natural gas the way they see the price of gasoline. But we've got soaring natural gas prices all around the world. That is because of the Russian war in Ukraine, in the energy war that goes along with that. That is raising prices here, not by as much as it is in Europe, but they are going up. We're going to feel that. That passes through to food prices because natural gas produces electricity. You need electricity to process food. There are other factors pushing up food prices that go back to the Russian war in Ukraine and sanctioned.",https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1iVTbuGfqnQ,7,2022-10-18 14:23:39
3521," Natural gas produces electricity, you need electricity to process food. There are other factors pushing up food prices that go back to the Russian war in Ukraine and sanctions related to that. So all of this, these are all major factors that are keeping inflation high in the United States, still 8.2 percent. And this is President Biden's principal problem right now. And so for the oil reserves that are slated to be released, how does that kind of play and factor into the Biden administration's strategy at least at this point? So let's talk about oil for a second. So oil prices right now, last I looked US oil, $8, around $84 a barrel. That is lower than the price before Russia invaded Ukraine on February 24th. So oil markets have normalized. Gas prices have not come down all the way to where they were before February 24th, but they're getting pretty close. And that market has stabilized. And President Biden did release oil from the strategic reserve. That's a small part of it. The biggest reason the oil market has stabilized is we have a global slowdown, especially in China. So demand for oil has just come down in a way we should be happy about that. The inflation story has since shifted. And it's over to these other things. I mean, food inflation latest numbers are 13 percent year over year. That is a big ask for a lot of people, food is 12 percent of the typical households budget, gasoline only 3 percent. So it's harder to absorb food inflation. And that food inflation looks pretty persistent at this point. It's going to be hard to get that down. So bring it back around to politics for us for a second, because the proxy for President Biden's polling, for example, and tied in with the midterms as well, has been the gasoline price. Because it's that one sticker price. It's easy to see food while everybody feels it. You don't have that one sort of thing that's symbolic of it. So how is this going to play as gasoline comes down and food continues to go up? So you're right. So there has been a fairly direct correlation between gas prices and President Biden's approval rating. So gas prices go up. Biden's approval goes down and vice versa. So that was all improving for Biden. The Democrats had momentum as gas prices were coming down sharply. But food inflation started to go up. And I think most people don't look at the CPI numbers in a spreadsheet the way I do every time the numbers come out. But people know when stuff gets more expensive. And they know that their paycheck is not going up by the same amount as expenses. And there's going to be another shot coming. People are just starting to see this in utility bills this summer because natural gas, which is the main way we generate electricity. That is going, that is higher than it was this time last year. And that is going to mean higher heating and electricity prices over the summer. So people know they know something's wrong and they're right about that. So the midterm elections are a referendum on the president and his party. And normally the president's party does lose seats in Congress and does look like that's what's going to happen here. Yeah, I'll finance his own Rick Newman. Thanks for tracking this source. Appreciate it. Guys coming up target. Coming up great from Jeff Fries, we're going to speak with the analyst behind the call.

3522," All right. All right. Right We're watching shares of TGT, Target or Tarsie. Today, after the company got an upgrade to buy from Hold from Jeffrey Sainte, headwinds for the retailer are mostly near-term problems. Jeffrey's Senior Research Analyst, Cory Tarlo, joins us now. Cory, help us break this down. The thesis around this being a near-term issue for Target, we walk in there right now. There's so much inventory that has flooded the store ahead of the holiday season. How are they going to be able to work through that? Sure. There are three key pillars to our upgrade today. The first one is inventory, as you mentioned. The second one is margins and the third one is valuation. I'll start with inventory because that seems to be the most topical subject today. Then inventory, our proprietary work, illustrates that the headwinds, the target and other retailers face, might not be as bad as what people think. Why do I say this? We've done some really differentiated work on this topic. We looked at inventory cycles over the last two decades. What did we find out that when analyzing inventory growth and sales growth and profit growth throughout the last two decades, when inventory growth peaks, you tend to see a trough or a bottoming in sales and growth profit growth, about five quarters after inventory growth peaks. What are we seeing right now? Most of the retail coverage that I focus on is continuing to go like this. But for Target in the last quarter, we saw an inflection where we saw a peaking in inventory growth. What does that mean? You're going to see a bottoming in sales and growth profit growth and inflection in the stock. After talking with the company, Target only has a couple hundred million dollars of excess warm weather appell in inventory. You see this in our note today. We published pictures of this in our store checks and this is already in the guide that's already been reduced. Earningers of visions are now down. I believe close to 40% in the last nine months. The balance of the inventory should improve meaningfully from here and skew much more towards consumables, which is still 45% of Target's business. That helps to add a substantial layer of defensibility for this business. What are, frankly, as the CEO called it yesterday, unusual economic times, and he even cited that he's seeing some healthy spending trends despite the atypical environment in which we're in. I'm glad you mentioned Brian Crenel, because he made those comments here on Yahoo Finance at an all market summit. And I really enjoy talking to him. But Corey, take a listen to this because I asked Brian about the inventory challenges they are having. Here's what he told us. You know, back in June, we made a pretty bold and dis...",https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1iVTbuGfqnQ,9,2022-10-18 14:32:38
3523," Corey, take a listen to this because I asked Brian about the inventory challenges they are having. Here's what he told us. You know, back in June, we made a pretty bold and decisive decision. We said, all right, inventory is the built up. Consumer shopping habits have changed. They moved into different categories and we said we're going to get out in front of this. So for Target, we put in that inventory problem behind us. And now we can focus on great execution, the lighting, our guests, getting ready for the big holiday season. So we were pretty decisive and said, we're not going to just let this roll into the next quarter. We'll deal with it up front. And now we're excited that we're ready to play for the holiday season. So Corey, it's not just Target. I hear what you're saying on Target. It sounds like just my vibe talking to Brian that they are working through this inventory. Maybe an issue that is going in the rear view mirror for them. But what about the broader industry? I mean, Walmart exited that second quarter with a lot of other inventory. Department stores, high levels of inventory. I mean, how big a problem is this going to be for the retail universe at large this holiday season? It's likely going to be pretty significant in categories that are more discretionary in nature. And that's part of the reason that we are a little bit hesitant on certain discretionary retailers. But Target, frankly, is one where we see a lot of opportunity. And why? Well, let's take a look at the margin. For example, in that clip that you just showed, Brian Cornell talked about how they had cleared a lot of inventory in the second quarter. The business drove close to a 1% EBIT margin in the second quarter, which is rather uncharacteristic for a business that drives typically an EBIT margin over the last decade, close to 7%. So clearly the last quarter was an aberration. And a lot of these self-inflicted or COVID-induced wounds are likely to lead to probably a subdued margin this year from an EBIT perspective. So probably around 4% to 5%. But as we look to next year, we think that a 6% or more margin would probably be reasonable. And I don't think that the street is quite get focused on that, particularly given the near-term hurdles that exist as a result of elevated inventory in the environment that you point out. And holiday, but on holiday, what I would say is that we've heard from several retailers now that consumers are, while they're being more intentional, are still spending on holiday. So I was at a conference a few weeks ago, the CEO of Walmart, US, had cited a strong tailgate season, a strong back-to-school season. And then just a few weeks ago, the CEO of Costco had even, or CFO, excuse me, had mentioned that he seemed sort of strong momentum in Christmas and Halloween inventory that has already hit the stores. So I think that that does, despite the elevated inventory environment that we're in, owed quite well for the holiday season ahead. Hey, Corey, it wasn't just a target that you are looking at here. You upgraded target, but you still like Walmart also. And so it sounds like you don't think there's going to be a zero-sum situation here. Do you think Walmart is also going to be okay on the inventory front and also sounds like you think they'll benefit from people maybe trading down and trying to save money a little bit? Absolutely. So part of the reason that we do like Walmart is that it's a value leader and it benefits from a trade down. But beyond that, we took this a step further. And we said, okay, if it's going to benefit from a trade down, how much do we see it benefiting over the next 12 to 24 months? And the reality is that we think that when we went through a really highly differentiated and unique analysis that we think Walmart can drive over 100 basis points to its same store sales as a result of trade down in grocery. And that could drive upside to consensus comp numbers, not only this year, but next year too. And our estimates are above consensus this year and next year by over 3%. There's upside devaluation. This business is trading at 19 times to your forward earnings versus historical average of 22 times. So it's trading at a three-turn discounted historical average. And that range is typically about 17 to 27 times. So it's actually trading even toward the lower end of that range, which means that there's plenty of upside from not only a number's perspective, but evaluation's perspective as well. Corey, thanks for joining us. Good to talk to you. Corey Tarlow is Jeffrey Senior Research Analyst. Talking to us about the retailers today. Appreciate it. Thanks so much. Have a great day. How up",https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1iVTbuGfqnQ,10,2022-10-18 14:36:58
3524," The retailers today appreciate it. Thanks so much. Have a great day. You too. All right, let's talk about some other move-ers that we're watching. Today, one of them is Colgate-Pomala of CBC reporting that Dan Loeb's third point has built a stake in the company. And we should mention, we're not, Yagyu Finance did reach out to third point for comment. We've not yet heard back at this point. The shares are trading higher by 3.4%. And the reporting over there talks about that maybe there should be a break-up of Colgate, or at least it's been offered some of the businesses. The pet nutrition, Hills Pet Nutrition, is one of their divisions there. You're looking at me skeptically. I can see you processing. Processing. I dig this potential call by Dan Loeb. Why are they selling pet nutrition next to my toothpaste in the same way? Why does it have to be together? Does that make any sense anymore? Do you use the same ingredients in toothpaste as you do in making pet products? I'm guessing no. But don't they keep the operation separate in how they're producing those products, too? So hopefully there's not the usual fact. The ingredients that are going into your toothpaste versus the pet food. But we know that you would be willing to try. As you said, comment. I just wanted to get you a comment. All right. Done deal. So it's time to say these good things. All right, switching gears from pet food to cars. We're also watching shares of Tesla after city. Reiterated, it's celebrating on the EV maker, saying the update in Q3 has not completely addressed macro concerns. This calls a little bit all over the map, because the analyst here at Tei, McCally, we often cite his work, celebrating, but he's saying the stock could rise coming out of this quarter if Tesla reports any upside related to EPS or auto delivery. So kind of talking out of both sides here. Yeah. I mean, even if we think about what Tesla has put out thus far and how they're going to continue to run into in China, especially a region where there is more of the appetite from the consumer to actually go towards some of the homegrown brands. And I think that's something not just across automobiles and vehicles. It's actually something that we've seen already referenced from a company in Nike as well, an analyst that cover some of the ATHLEASURE space. Of course, largely different purchase, but still the consumer sentiment, or at least that propensity, that still remains. And so with that type of trend that we're seeing right now, what does that spell out for? Not just the Tesla Shanghai production, but also where they see future demand continuing to come into. Yeah. After the close of trading tomorrow, analysts looking for a bucko too, in terms of earnings per share, we're going to be paying attention to the outlook, of course, as well, and see, we tend to get some pretty big swings in Tesla shares after the numbers. So we'll be watching that closely. Absolutely. Also watching closely here today shares of Carvana. They are moving on the day up by about 2% around that off to after Wedbush downgraded the stock to neutral from outperform and slash their price target from $50 to $15 here. Now in the use car landscape, of course, there is this massive shift of, and the inventory concerns particularly, because even at the prices that use cars had skyrocketed up to, it's a larger question of where consumers are starting to push back on some of those prices, and where Carvana, CarMax, where they'll actually be able to move some of that inventory off the lots that they've paid so much to be able to bring on as well. That $50 price target, that's not gonna come way down. From a consumer standpoint, I bought two cars off Carvana. I think the consumer experience is very, very impressive. But of course, you have to separate the consumer experience from the financials, and I understand this downgrad makes a lot of sense. We've seen used car prices start to roll over, consumer spending under pressure here a little bit, so I get it. Yeah, that's sense. All right, Roblox shares have been on fire to kick off this week, but is it time to go long and strong?

3525," again.. Shares of Roblox are still seeing a lot of interest on Yahoo Finance. After the gaming company got a boost yesterday from its September metrics report showing daily active users grew 23% year-over-year. Cowen, senior analyst Doug Croix joins us now to discuss Doug. Good to see you here. Is that move over done in your view? Yeah, it was a bit aggressive. The September numbers were fine. We now know that their bookings for Q3 are going to come in slightly ahead of cell-site consensus and basically align where our numbers were. But which is good. They've now returned to your year-over-year growth after a few quarters where that wasn't the case. They had tough comps. I think there were two things going on yesterday. One is that there had been chatter we've been hearing that mobile gaming spending overall might have slowed down in September. That certainly didn't seem to be the case in their numbers, so that may have surprised people a bit. Also, I don't think it was widely understood that the KPIs were actually going to be reported yesterday. People who were short the stock may not have realized that data was coming out on the Monday morning and got caught a little bit by surprise. That's why you saw the kind of the size of the move. Interesting here. So, particularly what you mentioned around the spending in Roblox that strikes me because there are all of these different experiences that are trying to move into that Roblox metaverse, if you will. Does that kind of spell out that even despite at Chipotle or Walmart saying that they want to be in the Roblox metaverse, that as of right now, that's not necessarily going to do enough to woo the consumer to have them spend more money in a reality that is purely virtual, not being able to get some of that return on those dollars? Yeah, well, their spending is still very heavily driven by children age, let's say, eight to 12. They've been trying to age up their population. They have had some success in that, but it's still largely a youth driven experience. And I don't know that kids are really that excited about going to a virtual Chipotle there or a virtual Walmart, they'd rather play games. Their ability to age up their platform is still very much in question. And that's a big part of our longer-term skepticism on the current share valuation. Well, and that kind of brings me to the next. I have kids who are in the demo for Roblox. I mean, isn't that sort of the problem here is how we're framing it, right? You call it metaverse, and there's all these implications. It's a video game company. Is it, I mean, isn't it just a video game company, right? It's a bit different, right? I mean, you think about video game company like, let's say electronic arts, right? They make games. They make FIFA. They make Madden.",https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1iVTbuGfqnQ,12,2022-10-18 14:45:39
3526," Right. It's, it's a bit different, right? I mean, you think about video game company like, let's say electronic artists, right? They make games. They make FIFA. They make Madden. They make Battlefield. Roblox doesn't actually make games, right? They own a platform. So in that sense, it's a little bit more like Facebook or, or, or snap or something like that. And their platform is host to instead of videos, it's host to interactive entertainment experiences. If they were able to get really high quality gaming content, right? For adults, then they could probably bring adults to the platform. The trick is, how do you get that content, right? Here, you know, if you're competing for kids' attention, you know, you're competing with one set of interactive entertainment, maybe Minecraft. But if you're competing with it for adults' attention, you're competing with Call of Duty and Grand Theft Auto and FIFA and some of the other games I just mentioned, that's a very, very high bar for a platform where, you know, the content by large is being created by amateurs. So it sounds like Roblox needs entertainment to somehow come to and beyond gaming, entertainment to come into the Roblox metaverse, if you will, to attract an older demographic that perhaps more has the propensity to spend or at least the dollars to expend within that metaverse, maybe a Disney in all of the entertainment and the titles and the content that that could look like within a metaverse. Yeah, and if there's one thesis that underlies sort of my entire approach to covering stocks, it's that content is game. And if you want to be a great platform, you're going to need great content. I think right now they have, you know, some great content for kids, but not for adults. And ultimately solving that problem is probably going to be very difficult. That is why my kids are on it and I am not. Cowling Senior Headler Doug Gray, thanks so much, appreciate it. Thank you. Well, coming up, Walmart is stepping into the content creator space. We have the details on that. Good luck. I will beンj Walmart. Making a play for the Gen Z crowd with a new platform called Walmart Creative, a creator, influencers that can now let followers shop what they wear, talk and promote directly through their profiles or pages.

3527," from called Walmart Creator. A creator, influencers can now let followers shop what they wear, talk and promote directly through their profiles or pages. Y'all can find this is Brooke DiPalma here with the details. And hey Brooke, it seems like Walmart's a little bit late to this, right? This is something other shopping sites have tried to. And I'm just still trying to wrap my head around like Walmart being a fashion leader here. So tell us about this program. Well, Julie, you might be surprised that a lot of influencers are currently sharing Walmart Creative, one of the most popular fashion brands, including Scoop, Guilty as Charge. I actually own one of their sweaters. But this new Walmart Creator platform is actually currently a beta version. It's going to launch fully in 2023 now, curators or creators, rather. Can sign up for the platform, share these product links onto their social media pages like Instagram, Facebook, TikTok, of course, potentially be real here, or a group of their choice. And the platform will also curate recommendations based upon these creators' interests. And they'll then be able to track how these recommendations do, how they perform, how their followers click the links and then buy the products from Walmart. And of course, when they're, that's when the creators will earn commission. But they can also apply to be part of their upcoming brand campaigns out of Walmart. And now some of the influencers that they're getting on board here to start include Devon on Dak. He has 3.8 million followers on TikTok. He's a fashion influencer. And also a more older crowd here. Cooking with Darrell is a dad that rose to fame during the pandemic for his quick family style recipes. He has 2.7 million followers. But Julie, the catchier, they're really looking to let everyone monetize not just influencers that you think of who have millions and millions of followers. Brooke, break this down further for me for an old person such as myself. So if I go on to the platform, I see Joey the Body Builder. And I'm like, wow, that person has an amazing physique. I want to buy a 40 pound tub of weight protein. Does it extend to food or is this just a peril? Well, according to cooking with Darrell, he just posted a video on TikTok. And he seems like he's going to be posting different products. Of course, Brian, this is currently in a beta version. So I think Walmart really experimenting here. What people will be interested. It seems like it's going to be a whole fray of different offerings. One thing to know here is that Walmart is saying that there's no cap on just how much money creators can earn here. Walmart, spokesperson confirming an assignment. That we don't share commission percentages for our creative partners. But also here, one of their biggest competitors, Amazon. Of course, doing that, you can buy anything that Amazon influencers program creators recommend from that protein powder or iron potentially. But one thing to note is that according to Amazon, these influencers can earn 2%, 10% up to 20% for their recommendation that 20% being for Amazon games. So there is a fixed commission income for Amazon there. Of course, Amazon came in earlier to the game here back in 2017. They also recently launched Amazon Live. They also recently launched that in India as well. We also saw others like like to know it, get into the space, will work style those, some of their early comers. But lots of opportunity to grow. This is expected to reach $145.2 billion by 2028. But to answer your question, Brian, for the entire influencer space, they're really recommending all different products. So I think Walmart really looking to get a slice of that here as well. All right, time for me to start serving more loops on the ground. Here on the weekends. I can do better than my goosebumps t-shirts. Coming up, everyone. Thanks so much, Brooke. Appreciate it. Coming up, meta is being forced to sell. Giffy, giffy, giffy, giffy.

3528," Music Let's go. Improved. It is time for Cretortime, two stories today. One minute each, we start with this, Meta Platforms is unwinding its 2020 purchase of the animated image platform, Giffy. After British regulators blocked the deal on concerns that Meta could deny or limit competitors' access to Giffy's Gifts or Giffy's Gifts, whichever way you're pronouncing it at all. I say Giffy and I say Gifts. I've never posted a Giffy on Facebook. Have you guys? On Facebook? No. Mostly on Twitter. Or are we even on Facebook? On Slack. They took the Gifts away from Slack. Yes. That would be a profound decrease in my well-being at work. That's true. We have great ones in our lives during Christmas. I don't know. I didn't know it ran that deep. So if Meta did take it over and then blocked it from Slack or charged too much in Slack, I'd just stop using them. I'm thankful that the British authorities have done this if that would be the outcome. This was a really early pandemic deal. I remember what, March of 2020, we had heard some of the deal making really start to bubble up. And this really kicked off. Where tech companies would look at these opportunities, go after some of these smaller, privately held companies and just seeing kind of good valuations that they could ultimately be able to capitalize on. All right. We didn't have a chance to discuss this one yesterday. Yay. Kanye. That is, as he's purchasing the controversial social media platform, Parlor. It has a reputation for being favored by right-wing extremists. Yay, in a release by Parlor, said, conservatives have to make sure they have the right to freely express themselves. Of course, Kanye over the weekend was expressing quite a bit of anti-semitism. And that's something that's on that platform. So I don't even know what to say about this. I mean, a lot of different businesses are cutting their ties with him. And he's allowing himself more closely with extremism, it seems. No pun here. And the next sure drop is really Adidas severed ties with him. Right. They're reviewing that relationship, right? But it would be a big blow, of course, to Adidas. Big blow to him financially. I'm surprised that it has taken Adidas this long to step up and do something. I think in what we've seen from Yay and the activity and what has clearly been extremely shortsighted, Tarnas says reputation from what hasn't been Tarnas to this point, he's going to quickly discover that freedom of expression is not the same as extremism. That takes place and emanates and continues to boil over on platforms like Parlor. Yeah. Well, I don't know if you will get that message. We'll see what happens. All right.

3530," Still trading above that. Actually, it's now right below that 4% level. All this is earnings continue to roll on. We've already heard from several of the major banks. Goldman Sachs, the latest reported quarterly results coming out with the beat. But how do these big banks compare to one another in the latest quarter? Let's bring in Yahoo! Finances Alexander Seminova here with me at the desk. We got all the big banks out of the way. In general, a pretty positive outlook. I don't know if you should say positive outlook, but a beat. The expectations were fairly low. Yeah, absolutely. Kiko, I have to start out by saying it's really been a mixed bag for financials as they've been reporting their results. On one hand, the banking industry is still doing just fine compared to what analysts are expecting to see from some other sectors that are set to report in the coming weeks. It's really just the year over year comparisons that have been really tough after an incredibly lucrative 2021. And they're still meeting analyst expectations for the most part. But on the other hand, we are seeing bank profits taking a huge hit driven primarily by two things. Lower deal-making activity that is really putting a dent in investment, banking revenues. And them setting a sign funds for potential loan losses, which is also weighing on their profits as they expect the possibility of an economic recession. But there are a few, of course, that have held up better than others. Goldman Sachs yet again was a standout today beating on all fronts coming in far better than Wall Street had expected. Profit was down 43%, but that was partially offset by an 11% jump in trading activity led by fixed income trading specifically. So again, the expectations were low and this was very much a better than feared situation with the big banks. Bank of America also posted a drop in profits year over year. However, it did see an earnings per share beat compared to what Wall Street was expecting, also benefiting from better than expected trading revenues. So those are the winners as you put it, the biggest loser? Well, one more winner. We have JP Morgan actually saw a drop in quarterly net income. But Openheimer analysts said it was a blowout quarter saying that blowout would be an understatement because analysts were really preparing for the worst when it came to this. But then you look at city group profit fell 25% revenue. However, rose 6% again at beat Wall Street estimates. Morgan Stanley was the only bank that really disappointed Wall Street missing expectations and reporting profit that fell 29%. So that was one of the banks that saw much more challenging quarter compared to its peers. Okay, Alexander Seminovo with a roundup for us. Thanks so much for that. Joining us now for a deeper dive on the financial sector. Let's bring in Devin Ryan at JMP Securities Director of Financial Technology Research. Devin, good to talk to you today. We're going to get to the restructuring on Goldman in just a bit. But let's talk about the roundup of the banks. As Alexandra just highlighted, we did see a big drop in profits when you look at the year on your comparison. A lot of these banks beat expectations, but it certainly didn't really vote well when you look at the outlook here. You think about the concerns in terms of loan defaults, loan loss reserves, increasing as well. I mean, what did you take away from these results in terms of the economic picture to come? Well, I think it's just it's a complicated environment, right? The macro backdrop has been complicated all year. And you know, even as we're about ready to exit 2022, there's still a lot of uncertain. So we haven't really made a lot of progress on that front. So banks kind of being one proxy for the outlook of the economy. You know, it's obviously a wine dispersion of expectations. That being said, what we're actually seeing the results is is pretty encouraging, at least as of now, you know, really no credit issues higher interest rates are driving a guy and tire for net interest income for the most part. And then as you guys talked about investment banking is very weak off of what was by far record 2021 on the other side, you know, trading is helping offset that. So it's just showing that these are business models that are pretty resilient. The bar was low into earnings, but the macro outlook is still uncertain. And so that's why, you know, we think we've been arguing we're kind of in this range bound trading where we got a little bit oversold. And so that's a little bit too negative. Now you're seeing a bounce off of that. But until there's more certainty and stability. It's going to be hard to have really sustained recovery in the stock.",https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1iVTbuGfqnQ,17,2022-10-18 15:07:18
3531," people were a little bit too negative. Now you're seeing a balance off of that. But until there's more certainty and stability, it's going to be hard to have really sustained recovery in the stocks. Let's talk about the other big announcement getting a lot of attention here. Goldman Sachs essentially confirming these reports that came out of multiple media outlets, including the Wall Street Journal, that they are, in fact, restructuring here, going from four divisions to three. There's a number of things to highlight, the consumer business, when wealth management merging with asset management, also investment and banking and trading now being placed under one unit. What do you think this says about where the bank is headed? Someone argue, well, there was this big focus back in 2020 about the consumer side of things. Is there a pivot that's happening? Yeah, I think this is more of a reorganization around the edges. This isn't some major shift in strategy or major pivot. On the consumer side, I think listening to the market, and there's a lot of press out there that is not a profitable business today, it's growing at a pretty strong pace. Your consumer revenues are up 95% year-to-year, but it's a business that I think is still, you're spending a lot of money to expand. And so I think they're pulling back a little bit on that growth investment. Think they're getting a little bit more specific around how they acquire customers and you want to do it in a more profitable way. So those are where some of the changes are, the reorganization of the business units to me is more just getting a little bit more organized around how they report, how management is structured. Don't really see a major strategic shift there, but ultimately, maybe that drives a little bit more efficiency in the business model. But ultimately, Goldman is the same business. They've gained a lot of market share on the institutional side. And we don't think they're pulling back dramatically on consumer. I think they just want to be a little bit more tailored and be able to focus on profitability there. Yeah, I mean, it's not a dramatic scaling back, as you say, on the consumer side of things. Having said that, it's taken a while for that to be a big driver. Do you anticipate that that will ultimately take hold? Or are we just sort of talking about through the traditional revenue drivers remaining in place for the bank? Yeah, so I mean, Goldman's a little bit of victim of their own success. They've had so much success on the institutional side. And those revenues have grown more than, I think most people predicted a few years ago that you'll look at the growth in consumer and say, well, it's still relative in material. They're generating over $2 billion in consumer revenue. So it's not a small business if you took it out and put it on a standalone versus any other digital bank or new consumer startup. So we do think if something is going to take hold, you'll Goldman's not managing the business for the next credit cycle or the next two years. They're managing for the next 20 years or even 100 years. And so when we think about getting into an entirely new business line that is a huge, addressable market, it's going to take time. And they're just listening, I think, to market feedback and pushback that, hey, you need to get this business into a better profitability picture before you continue to add new links to it. And so that's really what this is. But we're still pretty constructive on what consumer can be in the long term and think they'll continue to feed growth there and just be a little bit more tactical around how they do that. Specifically on Goldman Sachs, you've got a price target of $470 a share and outperform rating there. How do you think it stacks up against some of the other banks that have reported in the anticipation of some kind of economic downturn? Yeah, Goldman historically has always gained market share coming out of economic downturn. So in that very moment of market stress, it could be challenging for them as it is for everyone. But they are so good on risk management. And when others essentially get out over their skis and take too much risk, Goldman Sachs is able to really gain market share, take clients. And that's what we think would happen again to the extent the economy does roll over. So again, you're not cheering on a downturn, but ultimately, Goldman Sachs is going to be better positioned in our opinion. And so when you're buying the stock just over book value, book value is $300 to $8 for them right now. That's a pretty good risk or worn long term for investors to compete patient. They're generating returns on equity in north to 10%, even in this really difficult environment. That relationship has always helped invest.",https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1iVTbuGfqnQ,18,2022-10-18 15:11:42
3532," for investors to be patient. They're generating returns on equity north of 10%, even in this really difficult environment. That relationship has always helped investors in our opinion make money when that R O E and book value are correlated like that. So we think this is a pretty good entry point for investors that have a little bit of patience and a little bit of a long-term orientation. Devon Ryan, JMP, Securities Director of Financial Technology Research. Good to have you on today. Appreciate the time. Well, let's take a look at shares of Salesforce. Seeing a big pop on reports that activist investor Starboard value has taken a stake in the company. When you see that stock, up about four and a half percent, founder Jeff Smith telling CNBC his fund has taken a significant position the software maker, although he didn't specify the amount. Smith added that the company is not generating meaningful, operating leverage relative to its peers. And that subpar mix of growth and profitability has contributed to a significant discount in valuation. Shares of Salesforce, by the way, down more than 40% so far this year. Coming up, a flash of luxury, Rolls Royce, unveils its first electric vehicle. We're gonna speak with a group's CEO. You certainly don't wanna miss that. Also ahead, reports suggest the Biden administration looking to dip into the strategic petroleum reserve. Yet again, are the moves justified. We'll discuss on the other side. Well, turning now to oil markets. The White House is reportedly weighing additional sales from its strategic petroleum reserve to help tamp down fuel prices before the midterms. Let's bring in Yahoo Finance, his Jared Blick, right who's tracking the very latest for us. And Jared, I'm looking at oil prices under significant pressure today. WTI and Brent could both down. But of course we did get kind of a preview of this on the back of the OPEC plus decision. The White House statement did in fact come out.",https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1iVTbuGfqnQ,19,2022-10-18 15:15:52
3533," And oil prices under significant pressure today, WTI and Brent could both down. But of course, we did get kind of a preview of this on the back of the OPEC plus decision. The White House statement did in fact come out and say, look, we're going to tap into the reserves again because we expect the prices to go up. Yeah, so that was a controversial decision. OPEC plus increasing, excuse me, decreasing its production facilities by two million barrels per day, very much unexpected. A lot of people thought that was just a blatant shot off the bow toward the U.S. But take a look at crude oil. We see it's down three and a half percent today. You take a look at a year-to-day chart. You can see still see a bit elevated, but it has been in a steady downtrend since the middle of the year. Now, the strategic petroleum reserve of the U.S., let me put it to your chart so I can show you. It was standing at about 630 million barrels. That was as of mid last year, so we can just draw a line up. Then we started tapping it and then we got down to about, let's say, 400 million and change here. Now, what happened obviously since we up, the SPR was being tapped. We did see a tremendous rise in prices, not only in crude oil, but also our Bob Gasoline futures. But guess what was happening in the meantime? We had the Russia Ukraine conflict, which nobody really anticipated. We also had a massive repricing of risk with respect to the Federal Reserve. After that became apparent, we finally saw prices peak about mid-year here and start to come down. You take a look at our Bob Gasoline futures, which closely tracked the price of gasoline at the pump. Very similar story. So the SPR, when it was tapped mid last year, didn't have an immediate effect, but we did talk with Ed Morse over at cities, head of commodities there. He said the administration gets high marks for controlling the price of gasoline, actually the supplies online. But in terms of price controls, not so much. And here's what he had to say. The history of trying to put a price cap on is not very good. And it's kind of ironic that they're doing this at a time when the producers look at them and say, hey, they're putting on a price cap. We're trying to put a floor under prices. They don't like that. Why should we like them putting a price cap on Russia when they could do the same thing to us if this kind of thing works? So it has mixed grades, I think. And imperfect mechanism, Akiko. So that's how we see it. Okay. Something to watch, especially when you consider the reserves are so low. Yes. Already that they'll have to refill it pretty quickly. And by a third already. Yeah. Number to watch there. Thanks so much for that, Jared. Who rules Royce is unveiling this spectre, the luxury car makers, first fully electric vehicle, the two door sedan marks of BMW subsidiary, rules, Royce's appeal to upmarket EV buyers. Joining us now is Torsten Mueller, Otvos, rules Royce CEO, also with us is Prada Supermanian, of course Yahoo Finance car reporter. We should point out the segment presented to you by BMW, which owns rules Royce. Great to have you on today. Certainly a big day. You're taking the wraps off of the big EV here. Question to you here. We have seen this market get increasingly crowded, but you are competing in the ultra luxury space. What's the demand for EVs look like there? I mean, so far I can tell you, first of all, good morning. It's great. And this is a historic day here. We are launching, first of all, the very first electric Ross Royce. We are the very first loans rightly so, as you said a minute ago, to be in that ultra luxury segment, the very first offering an electric car. And for that reason, we are very much looking forward to it. And so far, order entry is already really great and very pleasing. And it's not only the United States, but it's all over the world. And I think we are working on electrifying the brand already for quite a while. We are experimenting with it since 10 years and quizzed our clients worldwide on what their requirements would be. So I foresee a very good future also in the ultra high luxury segment. And for us, along with you say that electric propulsion fits perfect to the brand. It's quiet, silent, very talky, delivers worthability. And also interesting story goes back to what one of our founding fathers said in 1900, Charles Roles made a prophecy and said, the perfect propulsion for cars is electric. Once charging is fixed. And I think now we are here fulfilling his prophecy. Hey, Toros and Price.",https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1iVTbuGfqnQ,20,2022-10-18 15:20:17
3534," Pollution for cars is electric. Once charging is fixed. And I think now we are here fulfilling his prophecy. Hey, Toros and Prasya, good to see you again. I had a question about sort of the engineering challenge is making a Rolls Royce into an EV. I know you say that it's a Rolls Royce first and an EV second. What kind of challenge did you guys face having to make this sort of appeal to your audience? Good point, Pras. I think, as I said already, we started looking into it over 10 years ago when we launched that experimental phantom, a 102 ex. And we put quite a lot of clients worldwide behind the wheel. And one finding was, fits perfect to the brand, but charging time and also range needs to be fully sufficient. So for that reason, that took us a while because one thing was also clear, don't compromise the Rolls Royce experience. And all that in combination challenged our engineers, as you can imagine, because it was clear, it needed to be magic carpet ride, it was clear, that it needed to carry sufficient range. And we are offering now 520 kilometers, we are in a 20 miles range. And I think that is very sufficient and definitely on what our clients expect in that segment to happen. And for that reason, I think we got here, but the challenge was on our hands and we are not yet completely finished. The car is still in the testing worldwide and the testing ends end of June next year. And then first deliveries will be done by end of next year when first clients, also in the United States market, take delivery of their specter. Hey, Torson, so you guys are, like you mentioned, the cars are going to come out end of next year. Have you guys faced any issues with part shortages, components shortages, things like that that you need to kind of kind of put into place before these cars are delivered? I mean, we are working here closely together, also with the BMW group in terms of, let's say, some technical and laundry components. We have invited quite a lot of clients already over here to Goodwood to see specter and they were all highly fascinated by what they have seen. Many of them placed already orders and deposits. So for that reason, I think that's good. We also see the car now more often in the markets. We will bring it also to the United States before so that clients can see it real in front of them. So I think we're going to shorten that, or we're going to make waiting fun for specter. That's for sure. Torson, I wonder where you think we are in this transition to EVs? And I'm not just talking about the ultra luxury space when you look at where market share is globally. It's just over 10% in terms of where EV stand in the broader auto market. Here in the US, it's just up 5%. Are we at a tipping point, or is it going to take a little more, whether that is higher oil prices, or higher gas prices, or a little more accessibility in the cars to get to full acceleration in this transition, which a lot of governments hope will be 100% EVs? Yeah, I mean, first of all, we are not really in the car business. Sounds funny now. We're in the luxury goods business. Nobody needs us to come from A to B. All our clients have multiple cars in their garage. So I think this is here different. It is that you are seen for the very first time, completely emission-free in a luxury rolls-roise. And I think that's a statement. A statement quite a lot of our clients would like to make. For that reason, I definitely foresee not only specter being excesses in the market, but also our forthcoming strategy to say by the end of 2030, the entire brand Rolls-Royce motor car is fully electrified. So all new Rolls-Royces in the next years to come are fully electrified. Hey, Toros. That's clear. And... Yeah. Sorry about that. Hey, Toros. In the last time we spoke, at the end of the summer, we talked about how there was insatiable demand for luxury cars. You mentioned the specter being at the highest in a luxury EVs. Does that still exist now? Are we still seeing any kind of hesitation as a global market uncertainty sort of builds up here? No, not at all. I remember I talked that evening at Pebble Beach, obviously. So no...",https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1iVTbuGfqnQ,21,2022-10-18 15:24:36
3535," Builds up here? No, not at all. Pros and I remember I will talk that evening at Pebble Beach, obviously. So, no, not at all. I think we still have a very strong order intake worldwide. I think there is no reluctancy currently to invest and to indulge luxury. I think the entire luxury market, not only the car market, but also fashion, whatever runs pretty well, currently worldwide. And I think that it's also due to the fact that there was quite some money accumulated in the Corona times. And for that reason, there is a new kind of understanding. You better live now and don't postpone it to later. So people are prepared to still spend money, which is great. And I think that puts us here into work. We are employing here at Goodwood over 2000 people and they profit from the fact that the luxury business is allowing me to say booming. Okay. I know the process is waiting to take a test drive in that car, right? Yeah. Always looking for a test drive. We've got to make that happen. Terce and Mueller, Otposts, it's always good to have you on this show. Really appreciate your time and our thanks to Pros Supermanian as well. Well, coming up, warnings over COVID variant starting to grow louder as we approach the winter. Anthony Fauci says they are in his words, that the white house is a little bit of a trouble. And the white house COVID is our urges boosters will break it all down on the other side. And then we gathered up the hospital through theرك to stop a lot more. Johnson and Johnson topped estimates and its latest quarter, but it could still see job cuts as it battles in Flation. We are watching shares there pretty much unchanged trading pretty flat right now. Let's bring in Yahoo finances, Anjali Kamlani, who's breaking down the numbers for us today. Anjali. That's right, Akiko. As you mentioned, beating on earnings and expectations and to that point of the job cuts really pointing out the fact that...",https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1iVTbuGfqnQ,22,2022-10-18 15:29:05
3536," numbers for us today, Ashley. That's right, Akiko. As you mentioned, beating on earnings and expectations and to that point of the job cuts really pointing out the fact that even a company as large as Johnson and Johnson not immune to the impacts of inflationary impacts there, we saw specifically growth in some segments, though specifically the pharmaceutical sector of business. And that was on its cancer drug, Darsala. That one specifically, you know, an interesting one as a company we know is in that focus of blood cancer, so that multiple myeloma drug. We also saw a little bit of an increase in medical devices. Now that's a segment that's been under pressure in previous quarters as a result of reduced hospital visits. You've seen how the hospital sector has been impacted and so that has impacted Johnson and Johnson as well. And so what we've seen is a change in that this quarter possibly looking to slowly bring that back depending on how hospital visits turn out. Also want to point out that the company, you know, those job cuts, that announcement really coming as the company is quote, right sizing as it splits into two that new can-view brand that's going to house all the consumer products we know well like Tylenol, Band-Data and the like. That is set to spin out officially late next year and that's still on track according to everything we heard on today's earnings call. So looking at the total business as you mentioned, training flat but still growing slowly as Johnson, Johnson tends to do. So that's where things stand right now for the company. And Angelie, meanwhile, you know, we're in October. We have certainly heard from plenty of health officials within the Biden administration warning about these new COVID variants that they expect to really tick up going into the winter. What do we know about how different this is and just how much immunity we're likely to have with the current boosters on the market? So what they're expecting is that we will have some protection from these boosters. Now when it comes to individuals who are highly vulnerable like immunocompromised folks, we're looking at the monoclotal antibodies and the reduced efficacy of that and the sort of limited protection we have in terms of treatments, which is why the administration has been so bullish on pushing for these vaccines and the need for majority of Americans to get vaccinated. We heard from White House COVID-19 response team coordinator Dr. Shish Jai yesterday talking about just that and what sort of the tools are as the administration has continued to say we have in the book, Solicin. Right now we do have widespread availability of these brand new by-vailant vaccines that are free, widely available, pretty much everybody is eligible for it. We have treatments. We have lots of testing capability in that context. Yes, I mean, obviously we're looking at the flu, we're looking at and worried about we might see with COVID or RSV, but I don't think we're going to need to do anything that resembles what we had to do in previous winter. I really do think we're in a very, very different place. So as you can hear, I asked specifically about moving back to stronger mitigation measures like indoor masking and it seems like the administration is still convinced that we don't necessarily need to do that as long as we get boosters and are, you know, staying pretty cautious and vigilant. So that's where things stand right now. Okay, a reminder for everybody to schedule that booster ahead of the winter. Thanks so much for that, Anjali. Well, coming up messaging change, Chinese President Xi Jinping calls for a high quality growth in a signal policy, in a signal policy could be shifting away from strict economic targets. This is GDP data remains absent. We're going to discuss China's National Congress on the other side.",https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1iVTbuGfqnQ,23,2022-10-18 15:33:08
3537," Bye! Well, China has ruling communist party has gathered for its most important political event, arguably for decades. President Xi Jinping is sitting poised to secure an unprecedented third term. While amid a fractured geopolitical landscape deteriorating relations with the US and slower growth at home, Xi uses Sunday speech to the party congress to emphasize the importance of in his words high quality growth and the reality of a struggling economy is certainly amplified by the failure to release GDP data as scheduled. Joining us now is Christopher Markowitz, he's senior professor of Chinese management at the University of Cambridge. He's also the author of Mao and Markowitz, professor good to talk to you today. We've come to expect these party congresses to pretty much be about messaging, not about a new shift in policy or an introduction of a new strategy here, but I thought it was interesting the Sunday speech that we got from President Xi felt a little more downbeat. He used the word struggle multiple times and what was considered a pretty short speech also seemed to brace the Chinese people for economic conflict. What was your takeaway and what we have heard from him so far? Yeah, no, I totally concur and agree with you. I do think that hit all the sort of common messaging that people were thinking it was going to hit, but clearly with the economy down, with COVID controls likely to continue, China's economy is not going to be going up anytime soon. And so what's the expectation of me? Do we get any more clarity on any kind of shift here? He certainly seemed to double down on the zero COVID policy. Didn't talk too much about what we're seeing in the real estate sector in terms of the debt growing, you know, defaults, concerns about defaults, piling up there, in terms of the economic picture as the world's second largest economy, what do we come to expect based on what we've heard from the President? Yeah, I mean, I think that China's years of 8% growth are behind it. And I think I mean, part of that is the zero COVID has really slowed things down. You mentioned in your opening this high quality growth idea, which certainly I support in many ways, because it's about, you know, listening.",https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1iVTbuGfqnQ,24,2022-10-18 15:37:40
3538," COVID has really slowed things down. You mentioned in your opening this high quality growth idea, which certainly I support in many ways because it's about lessening China's tremendous income inequality. Unfortunately, a lot of times, many of those policies end up resulting in robbing from the rich to give to the poor, instead of having a more systematic way of rebalancing income inequality. So I think it's more of the same as compared to the last two years. We certainly didn't hear the Chinese leader single out the US, but he did talk about sort of a divided world, which was kind of a nudge at what we've been seeing in terms of US policy going into the party congress. Of course, we had the Biden administration release these really harsh measures, especially against the semiconductor industry, which seems to signal more of a division globally, especially around technology. I wonder how you're looking at that, and the implications not just in China, but in the US. Yeah, I mean, I think you're exactly right. I mean, the Chipsville Biden's executive action around it. I think we're particularly executive action. I think went further than many observers thought that they would. And I think this is going to result in a new era of technological splitting. I mean, the US and China are connected in so many ways, economic ways. But if people with US passports can't be working in Chinese semiconductor firms, I mean, that creates a rift that is really hard to get over. On the issue of Taiwan, we did hear she talk about peaceful reunification still being the goal, but sort of also alluding to the fact that he shouldn't hesitate to use force if necessary. Where does that tension stand right now? And did we glean anything new from how the Chinese leaders thinking about this right now? I mean, clearly, I think he put stronger stakes in the sand than I would have expected around the Taiwan issue if things were just going to stabilize. I just saw Anthony Blinken recently had a statement in a speech that he feels that forceful reunification may occur in the near term. So I think that, observers, knowledgeable observers are really very worried about the trajectory of China's approach to Taiwan. Finally, I see you've got your book, Malon Markets, right behind you there. But this is an interesting comparison that you're making. I mean, we have heard the comparisons going into this party Congress that essentially by him cementing this third term, it does make him the most powerful Chinese leader since Mao Zedong. In terms of economic policy, what are the parallels that you see? I think one parallel is this interest in putting sort of the party in ideology above economic relations. The past 30 years under Deng Xiaoping and Jiang Zemin, Hu Jintao, this was not necessarily the case. So I think really the sort of party at the center ideology first, I think also the idea of really having this top down campaign logic is a big deal. So Mao had campaigns throughout his time as China's leader. And you look at semiconductors, you look at anti-corruption, you look at COVID. I mean, these are all very much about, let's have a top down campaign. So I think those are the two key parallels that I think help us understand she and his governance. So really quickly, does this mean that this isn't about Chinese ambitions to be the world's largest economy anymore? That has that kind of been put on hold? I don't think the ambitions in this have been put on hold. I mean, I do think that some of the policies are counter that. But another sort of famous statement of Mao was sort of standing up to the West and resuming China's place in the world. And I don't think that she has put that idea behind him at all.

Well, coming up, holding studies at US with Haynes, its position in global tax competitive and its ranking.",https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1iVTbuGfqnQ,25,2022-10-18 15:41:50
3539," and author of now and market. It's appreciate your time today. Great, thanks for having me on. Well, coming up, holding steady, the US retains its position in global tax competitive and its rankings. But the inflation reduction act mean big changes ahead for going to dive deep into that report on the other side.Beifall for our 2019 A new report from the Tax Foundation finds that tax competitiveness in the U.S. remains steady among the world's top economies ahead of big changes for 2023. For more on the report is Daniel Bunn. He's executive vice president at the Tax Foundation. Daniel, get to talk to you today. Walk me through for those who aren't as familiar with this report that you put out every year. How you sort of determine what is competitive and where the U.S. ranks right now in relation to its peers. Well, thank you for having me. This report is designed to help policymakers see where their tax system is strong on things like pro-growth measures or policies that avoid distortions and complexities. In measures the tax systems of the 38 OECD countries and the U.S. ranks 22nd on the index this year, as you mentioned, the same place as it held last year. The index puts France at the bottom and Estonia at the top. Estonia has had that place every year that we've published the index and this is its ninth year. So let's make that comparison between a place like Estonia and the U.S. where does the U.S. really get hurt and to your point or to the point that we made in this introduction coming to you, how is this likely to shift as a result of the provisions that have been included in the Inflation Reduction Act? So the Inflation Reduction Act introduced a tax on stock buybacks. It introduced a alternative minimum tax based on financial statement and income. It introduced a different wave of...",https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1iVTbuGfqnQ,26,2022-10-18 15:46:28
3540," based on financial statement and income, and introduced a different way of calculating a lot of different tax credits. And a lot of these things just add complexity to the system. And if things stay as they are in current law, including some provisions that are expiring based on the Tax Cuts and Jobs Act from 2017, the rank will likely be slipping for the US next year unless other OECV countries make them even worse than the US. Yeah, how big of a decline I was talking about. Right now, based on what other countries are looking at, it's a shift in two places. So I would say a shift from 22nd to 24th. We've also been following very closely what's been playing out over in the UK. You could call it the big reversal. Obviously the tax cut policies that were initially proposed by UK Prime Minister Liz Truss now in full reversal as a result of her former finance minister getting cut, you've got Jeremy Hunt now in place as well. I wonder how you look at this in the context of how competitive the UK can be. Number one, the policies that are now being proposed by the new finance minister, but also just how quickly things have been reversed, you know, sort of the policy swings that we have seen in a very short amount of time. One of the things that really matters for tax policy is stability. And what we've seen in the UK is the opposite of that over the last several years. And what we've seen in the last few weeks is enough U terms that we're kind of spinning in circles. I think what this means for UK competitiveness where the UK ranks right now is 26th on the index. And it looks like unless policies are to improve and it's not really clear where the government's going to go over the long term here, then that rank will be slipping as well, potentially into the 30s on the index. A lot of the policies that they introduced recently, you know, they might have improved the rank somewhat, but I think the pro growth measures that the government kind of could have done were left on the table. Tax Foundation Executive Vice President Daniel Bunn good to talk to you tonight. Thank you. It is now time for our chart of the day. And today we are looking at a whole lot of cash. Take a look at this chart from the latest B of A Global Fund Manager survey, which shows that fund managers have taken their cash positions to the highest level in 21 years. The survey found the average cash level was 6.3% in October. That's up from 6.1%. The prior month and will above the long term average of 4.8%. All this of course coming on the back of the volatility we've seen in the equity space. Well, let's turn our attention to the uptick and union activity across the country, starting with Amazon and a fourth union election for the company this year. Yeah, who finances Alexis Keenan here to break it all down for us in Alexis. We're looking at the vote in Albany. Close to Albany. Close to Albany, what are we expecting that number to come down? It's underway right now. It started at 10 a.m. Eastern Times. It's expected to take about three, four hours. And so we should have some numbers by this afternoon, but like you said, it would be the fourth time workers for Amazon in their facilities have voted yes or no on union. So let's look at the numbers. This particular facility in Castleton, New York, it has about 400 workers. That's just an estimate though. Those that say they want a union, they say that they want it because the management is prioritizing profits over people. That's a bit of a vague statement there. But these workers make approximately $17 an hour after pay hike that was at $16 an hour. So if we look at the numbers, that brings the total number of union votes for Amazon 2, 4, the vote underway today, plus that first yes vote, that's pending certification, that was that big, stand, and island facility that has 8,300 workers. They voted yes back in March. Also no votes from two different facilities. A second one in Staten Island came down in May, as well as a no vote in Bessamer, Alabama in March. So the company kind of getting a 50, 50 result there. Also looking at today's Starbucks, Starbucks is holding held a couple different votes yesterday. One was in Seattle, another one was in Portland, Maine. Those workers are going to decide whether to join Starbucks workers united in that case. And we've seen this get a little contentious. I mean, it's not just Starbucks, but just the very latest for these tensions to flare up within the stores. And what's going on there? Tensions are very high with Starbucks, and that is evidence.",https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1iVTbuGfqnQ,27,2022-10-18 15:50:44
3541," Starbucks, but just the very latest, for these tensions to flare up within the stores. And what's going on there? Tensions are very high with Starbucks, and that is evidenced by a lawsuit that was filed yesterday by eight Starbucks workers. They are located in Anderson, South Carolina. This is a unionized store already. And we have some video of the incident that gave rise to this lawsuit. And what the lawsuit is saying, the employees are saying that the manager of the store, as well as Starbucks, appeared to have coordinated to a ledge that they were preventing the manager from exiting the store. The workers said that they confronted their manager asking for a pay raise, asking for also some of the equipment in the store to be addressed. Now we've spoken with Starbucks this morning. They say they are aware of this complaint. They are still reviewing it. However, they do note that the manager came and filed this complaint on her own. That this was not the company's action to go ahead and file what was a police report. So once these employees that you just saw in that video had asked for a pay raise and these other things that they were looking for, the manager then went to the police there locally and said that she was prevented from exiting the store, which amounts to, in some cases, a kidnapping. And also said that the employees assaulted her. Now a lot of work to still be done, but a police report that was given to a local reporter said that that wasn't the case. That after having reviewed that video that they found that it was a peaceful incident that they did let the manager go back and forth at will. So more to be learned there, but the employees in this case were suspended. And I had asked Starbucks whether they were suspended with or without pay. They're still working on giving me answers on that, but the manager in this case also suspended, though, with pay. It's getting kind of ugly. It's getting very ugly for Starbucks. The company is fighting these union efforts across the country and just tensions are very high. And look, Starbucks, it's a little bit easier some experts in union organizations say for Starbucks workers to organize because you're going store by store where there are fewer employees in each location versus an Amazon in that case. Thousands of workers. Thousands have to coordinate to even get a petition in line for a vote to happen. Yeah, a lot of companies watching both of those was very closely. Thanks so much for that. Well, coming up fresh offerings, Apple gets ready for the holiday season with new versions of its iPad Pro and an updated version of the Apple TV 4K. Dan Halley is always across all the details for us on the other side.",https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1iVTbuGfqnQ,28,2022-10-18 15:54:51
3542," Sit on the skyline, Well, a quick update to bring to you on that story. We're going to be talking about Amazon warehouse workers looking to unionize near Albany, New York. We've now learned that employees there have overwhelmingly rejected that unionization effort. The final vote count coming in, 206 votes in favor of the union, 406 votes that were opposed to it. And we should point out these results still need to be certified by the National Labor Relations Board. But another setback for the Amazon Labor Union there. Well, Apple's announcing new versions of its iPad Pros and an updated Apple TV 4K this morning. The launch giving shoppers new items to add to their wish list ahead of the all important holiday season. Let's bring in Yahoo Finance's tech editor, Dan Halley, with the very latest. And I was just saying, I feel like we just got a new iPad Pro. But what do we know about the details of this latest? Yeah, that's right, Kiko. There's a 2 new iPads and a new Apple TV 4K. Let me just run down real quick starting with the most expensive. That's the iPad Pro. There's the 11 inch and the 12.9 inch. The 11 inch starts at 7.99 while the 12.9 inch starts at 10.99. The big difference here is that these now get Apple's M2 chip. That's the in house chip that they have running in some of their laptops and desktops at this point. The second generation of iPads to get an M chip. The first iPads to get the M2 chip. Apple says that it's up to 50% faster, 15% faster than the M1. And 35% faster on graphics. There's also a new feature for the Apple pencil called hover over where the actual iPad will detect the Apple pencil 12 millimeters above the display. So you can actually see where you're going to be placing your marking. And that should be good for sketching as well as writing. They also introduced their stage manager feature. That's part of the updated iPad OS 16. It improves overall multitasking and then you're also going to be able to connect up to a 6K display and use that as an external monitor for your iPad. So that's for the pros. And then on the regular iPad, this is the base level iPad. This gets a price jump to 449. It gets an A14 Bionic chip right now. The iPhone has the A16 Bionic. So this is just a few generations behind that as far as capabilities. There's a bigger display, completely new design. It's 10.9 inches versus the 10.2 inches. There's no longer a home button. So what you're going to be able to do to use Touch ID is press the power button. It uses USB-C instead of lightning. So that's a big change in something that we'll start to see potentially for the iPads. And then we have the Apple TV 4K. That gets an A15 chip and starts at 129. More things to put on the wishlist. I had a holiday season. Dan Halley's always thanks so much for that. Let's do a final check of the markets before we let you go. The rally that we talked about, losing a bit of steam, but the Dow still ups almost 200 points there. The S&P 500, up about 21 and the Nasdaq, up 49. That does it for me in this hour. We've got much more to come here and Yahoo Finance live. Keep it right here.",https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1iVTbuGfqnQ,29,2022-10-18 15:59:24
3543," Stop keeping stop lady?............................................................................................... and they are making a huge difference in their driving............ center, talk to us about what this means to GM history and also what it means for the future of the company.",https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1iVTbuGfqnQ,30,2022-10-18 16:04:40
3544," This year we have a lot of models in the heart of the market, the largest segments in the market. We're here in GM's Design Center. Talk to us about what this means to GM history and also what it means for the future of the company. Well this is literally the building and the room where we review new vehicles and look at them from a design perspective, clay models or we have a lot of technology in this room from a virtual perspective as well. So this is where it happens this is where decisions are made and it's a vital part of the design process because no matter how much technology you have on a vehicle it has to start with being beautiful. Beautiful and I'm so excited about the new designs we have coming out. I want to ask you about the economy and you have obviously a unique perspective because you can talk to your dealers and they can talk to you about consumer demand. Where is the economy right now based on where you sit and what do you see going forward? Well you know we are starting to see some you know changes from a use car pricing perspective and you know we're watching and we're seeing you know right now it's very hard to know exactly what's happening in the market because you know we have been supply constrained for so long so we know there's pent up demand but also there's challenges in the logistics and moving vehicles once they're built. You know even we we still are dealing with semiconductor shortages but then when we get to that point getting vehicles moved to get to the dealers has been challenging as well so it's it's really an interesting time we're watching almost on a daily basis to see what's happening. We still see you know strong demand for many of our products especially our full size trucks that are mid-size crossovers but again we're watching all the signs I mean you know I think we're listening to what everyone else is saying around the globe and so we're preparing next year for a year that will you know look more like we have a little it will actually be more demand but a little less than man than what we would think because you know we're we're going to be conservative make sure we set our cost structure up that way so then if things turn out better we're well positioned but most importantly because we have so many important EV launches next year as well as crews growth we want to make sure that we can fund our future regardless of where the economy is you know downturn recession all those words that are being used we're we want to be prepared regardless of the environment and you're not seeing higher rates impact and consumer demand we haven't so far but again it's a very unique situation because we've been supply constrained for so long and so that's what we're watching because we know a vehicle is a very important purchase that people make and you know that they may make different decisions depending on how they feel about their own personal economic situation and you mentioned the chip shortage and supply chains a couple times now and how is that being mitigated is it improving and then what about some other supply chain issues might have with batteries and the inputs that go in there sure well you know from an overall supply chain we do see the semiconductor supply improving quarter by quarter but we still see more volatility than than we're used to I think one of the reasons for that is the supply chain has been stretched so thin so we're looking for improvement as we go forward but you know it's still there and it's still an issue as I said logistics is a you know getting the vehicles moved is a is another challenge but then when you look at you know other like supplying for EVs you know one of the things that's going to be key to unlocking more hummers more lyrics and all of our vehicles is the battery plants and we're actually running the battery plan in Ohio now and as that is able to ramp up more more cells will provide our ability to provide more electric vehicles I would also say GM we actually have signed agreements for the production that we need between now in 2025 to get to our million units in 2025 in the United States and more than that in in China so we're on track to do that and we have that supply chain secured you just mentioned China I want to follow up there you've had such success in that country with Buick there are a lot of new EVs there what is the future of that marketplace look for you well we're still we still think there's tremendous opportunity there you know as you mentioned the Buick brand is very strong as is Cadillac and we also have Chevrolet there but we also have a joint venture ship with Luling that allows us to sell not only the Bao Zhu brand but",https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1iVTbuGfqnQ,31,2022-10-18 16:08:04
3545," very strong as is Cadillac and we also have Chevrolet there. But we also have a joint venture ship with Luling that allows us to sell not only the Baozun brand but some other vehicles like the Hongguan Mini EV has been one of the highest selling vehicles this year from a Chinese perspective for EV. So we think there's opportunity. We're definitely seeing the landscape change. We're seeing more competition from domestic suppliers but we think especially in luxury and with you with the strength of those brands we think is going to remain strong. I want to drill down on a couple domestic brands, Equinox for instance which sounds like a car for everybody right with a price point. It's an EV coming out in a year or so. Talk to us about that one. That comes out in the second part of next year. And what's so important about the Chevrolet Equinox EV is that it's in the biggest segment globally, the biggest segment from a North America perspective as well and it's about affordability. So if you're around $30,000 you really get into the sweet spot of the market. And we've been really excited because we revealed the vehicle and people, there's been such a strong positive response to the vehicle and when people get in and actually get to drive it and see how great driving an EV is and then they see the technology on that vehicle. It's got a 17.7 inch screen, it has safety features and safety technology. People are going to realize they're getting a great vehicle and able to move into EVs with confidence. On the high end the Solistic. Yes. Am I saying that right? Yes. It's sort of a customized Cadillac right. Talk to us about that one. Well so it's a bespoke Cadillac. It really, if you look at what Cadillac means for so many people, people still use the term Cadillac for standard of the world and we really believe with all the work we've done, not only in our internal combustion with the Escalade V and the Blackwing series and the attention to design, as we move to our all-electric future with Cadillac, Solistic is really is going to be the pinnacle from that perspective. It will be hand-built on this site and the customers that will be able to customize the vehicle from interior to exterior. We're really excited the response for people that we've really revealed the vehicle to has been very, very positive. This really is one of the final steps in regaining that standard of the world for Cadillac and the response has been tremendous across all of our Cadillac products. Mary GM Stock has lagged a bit over the past year. I'm wondering what you would say to shareholders, why should they buy the stock hold the stock on the stock going forward? I think there's been so much attention earlier this year was how many EVs are used settling today and we were in a difficult situation because we did the right thing for the consumer and for safety and when we found there was a manufacturing defect in the bolt cell, we stopped producing so we could do the replacement cells for our customers. Because we've moved through the year we were able to start building the bolt again and we've actually had two record months in a row of sales of the bolt EV and EV. So I think that impacted the early view but what I would say to shareholders is take a little bit longer view because this isn't a one-year race. We are at the very early stages of driving EV adoption and when you look at the vehicles that we have coming out next year with the Silverado EV, the Equinox and the Blazer, again those are big segments of the US industry and to have really credible products in that I think is going to allow us to grow and that's why we're confident that we're going to hit our ability to produce a million units and see strong demand for our vehicles by the time we're at 2025.",https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1iVTbuGfqnQ,32,2022-10-18 16:12:24
3546," you you you So right? Cloud migrations were super critical during the pandemic even for resilience. And now, Cloud, if you're not on the cost frontier of the cloud, then you're falling behind on productivity. If you're not on the efficiency frontier of cloud-native applications, you're falling behind on productivity. If you're not able to use the hybrid work infrastructure to bring everybody to be able to sort of participate, collaborate inside the organization, you're falling behind. So this idea that everybody now needs to really show the results of productivity, do more with less, whether it's the operating expenses and the leverage there, or even your capital efficiency. So that's what, in some sense, is, I would say, with all the macroeconomic headwinds, which I think all of us face, none of us are immune, the tailwind, at least we as a company have, is our ability to deliver these solutions. Software is ultimately the biggest deflationary force businesses can use to tame all of the forces that are there for our own inflation. Well, that's something that I kind of want to touch on as well. Is Microsoft itself having to make adjustments? And then what kind of opportunities do you see in the current economic climate? Yeah, the opportunity I see is for us to be able to take that entire stack, whether it's cloud infrastructure or the cloud-native databases, and application development, or something like power platform, right? I mean, that's a great example of how you can involve everyone inside your workforce to help with automation and drive productivity up. And of course, everything that we're doing with Microsoft 365 and Teams, in helping customers just really deal with what does productivity and collaboration look like in a hybrid work environment? So we are definitely seeing tailwind there, we are seeing share gains there, we feel very, very optimistic about our own ability to deliver value to customers and do well in the marketplace. But I think at the end of the day, even by the way, that also applies to Microsoft, we are applying it ourselves inside, right? How can we be more efficient in whether it's in our people operations or in our R&D or whether it's in our finance and our supply chain? So I think you will see us use in some sense, take our own solutions and deploy them as efficiently as possible to drive productivity and leverage in operating expense and capital efficiency. Capital efficiency is another one, one of the things that I'm seeing a lot of businesses.",https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1iVTbuGfqnQ,33,2022-10-18 16:16:19
3547," employ them as efficiently as possible to drive productivity and leverage in operating expense and capital efficiency. Capital efficiency is another one, one of the things that I'm seeing a lot of businesses. I mean, to take the energy crisis that we have in particularly more stick, acute in Europe right now. Multiple things, right? If you move to the cloud by definition, you have the most efficient use of the scarce energy resource. Second, let's take a manufacturing plant. If you create a digital twin of a manufacturing plant, one of the benefits is, you can make it more power efficient, right? Because you can do the simulation to do the power draw that's most efficient. In fact, you can reduce waste as well. So overall, things of that nature, I think, are going to drive up productivity. I want to talk about kind of the idea that we're moving towards a hybrid work environment. I know that's something that Microsoft has talked about. You mentioned it earlier. You know, what are you seeing there as far as customers moving to a hybrid work environment? Are they continuing to do so? And will that stick around? Yeah, in fact, we just released some data, you know, called the Work Trends Index, which is sort of survey data. That's got good cross-section of customers, geographies, industries. And there are three points down, I would say, that sort of stand out, right? The first one is what we call the productivity paranoia. Basically, 85% plus workers or the members of the workforce think that they're being productive. 85% plus percent of the managers think that there's more to be desired on productivity. So there's that paradox. And I think the best way to bridge that paradox is not to have more dogma, but more data. Things like Viva Pulse can help everyone get to the same data. And more importantly, something like Viva Goals, an OKR system can help everyone align, right? So instead of this being some kind of an argument, let the data really help us move forward. The second one is people come for other people, right? People don't come to work or any place because of policy. They come because of the connection they want to have with other people. So that me, I say that we all have to learn new soft skills as even leaders to facilitate those moments where people can come. And of course, even tools like Viva Connections and so on can help. And then the last thing is just because you had an offer and you recruited somebody doesn't mean you don't need to re-recruit. And so this is where again, everything about what you as a leader can do to re-recruit employees, help them with even their own career progress, right? One of the things that we are seeing is, you know, skilling. I want to be able to come in. I want to be able to make progress in my profession. And so anything that we can do to help show that we are re-recrooting them and then energizing them, I think is all going to be very, very helpful. And so a lot of what we have done in particular with Microsoft 365 Teams and a new product suite called Viva are all focused on that. But at the end of the day, these are tools. What is required is a little more enlightened management and leadership and skills that all of us have to learn. You You You",https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1iVTbuGfqnQ,34,2022-10-18 16:20:52
3548," you I'm I'm I'm I'm I'm I'm I'm I'm I'm I'm I'm I'm I'm I'm I'm I'm I'm I'm I'm I'm I'm I'm I'm I'm I'm I'm I'm I'm I'm I'm I'm I'm I'm I'm I'm I'm I'm I'm I'm I'm I'm I'm set. We have a clear set of goals. In fact, compensation even at the highest level, including mine, are triggered by us hitting these goals. So overall, I feel that we have the right process, but a lot of progress that needs to be made. And one of the things that we're also focused on is not just about bringing people in. It's also about the inclusion, right? The culture of inclusion is an everyday exercise, right? It doesn't matter what happened yesterday, but what is the lived experience of every individual, right? Aggregate data sometimes, you know, it doesn't really represent the lived experience for any individual. And so that's continuous process. You can never claim anything. All you can at least do is to have a culture that allows every leader, every manager and every employee to have both the confidence as well as the introspection capabilities to say, let's just push and make sure the diversity and inclusion are key priorities for us. And I just wanted to ask one last question. As far as Microsoft and the cloud, it's clearly one of the leaders in the industry. How is that kind of helping with all of these various objectives, whether it's ensuring employees feel like they're wanted, eliminating that productivity paranoia, and then helping to help companies deal with the current economic climate? Yeah, I mean to me, you know.",https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1iVTbuGfqnQ,35,2022-10-18 16:25:19
3549," eliminating that productivity paranoia and then helping to help companies deal with the current economic climate. Yeah, I mean to me, you know, the idea that digital technology is got transformative capabilities, I think are very clear. Everybody recognizes the digital, even in this macroeconomic headwind, no one's sort of looking at their IT budget or digital budget is the first place to go to cut because they realize that coming out of this constrained economic environment, they'll be stronger if they use technology to drive productivity. So very specifically to your point, people are looking to say, are my on the right cost curve? That's where something like cloud infrastructure is massive, right? Because of Afroly, you only pay for what you consume. I mean, they cannot be about more capital efficient way to do run things than the cloud economics. The other way is if you're not building cloud native applications, I mean, just to put it in perspective, right? If you are just doing application development like you did even three years ago, four years ago, and I'm not using some of the things like the container technology or some of the stuff like our Cosmos DB, it's like 100x different in terms of efficiency. Or using tools like teams and we were to drive hybrid work because Afroly, that's a reality be all phase. So I think in each layer of this technology, you want to make sure that you are on the right cost curve and you're using the best tools to drive productivity and your ability to do more with less. So that's what's exciting for us. We know that this is a great time, but frankly, to be having all of these conversations with customers and also making sure and that we're delivering for them. All right, Microsoft CEO Satinadella, thank you for joining us. Absolutely, we can anticipate a period of economic softness here. And I do think the definition of recession sort of ebbs and flows, but let's just say for the record, a period of economic softening is what we anticipate for 2023. But I think that you mentioned valuation, and that's really, really important because if you think about this particular bear market, it kind of is in two phases. The first phase is very much evaluation driven experience. And interestingly, you even mentioned like the NASDAQ and then the S&P. The NASDAQ is the growthiest index. The S&P is also a pretty growthy index and they're very sensitive to changes and interest rates. We know the market is a discounting mechanism and when you have a higher discount rate, you have a lower present value. So the growthiest NASDAQ.",https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1iVTbuGfqnQ,36,2022-10-18 16:29:35
3550," And they're very sensitive to changes and interest rates. We know the market is a discounting mechanism. And when you have a higher discount rate, you have a lower present value. So the growthiest NASDAQ was hit the hardest. The S&P's been hit pretty hard too. And valuation contraction has been more than 100% of the market downturn this year. Earnings have been up. So all of what we've seen this year has been a contraction and valuations. That's phase one. The second phase is related to your question about a recession. And that is what's going to happen to the E of the price to earnings, the earnings. And we think earnings are probably going to be soft in 2023. We have an estimate far below what Wall Street analysts have right now. We think they're just a little bit too optimistic on the go-forward view given the fact that we are entering a soft period. And Katie, what is your estimate on earnings? And why do you think Wall Street is a little bit too optimistic at this point? So I mean, we've seen corporations, the US large corporations, be incredibly resilient and the face of an incredible amount of headwinds. We've had higher rates, we've had pandemics, we've had problems in getting workers back to work. Despite that fact, we have had pretty good earnings. And I think everyone was sort of waiting with baited breath for the shoot to drop in the second quarter. And it didn't. We had a good second quarter. Estimates have come down to the third quarter, but the third quarter might shape up to be pretty decent too. So I think Wall Street analysts are just building off those kinds of estimates, but for us, with the softer growth outlook in 2023 and the fact that the S&P 500 has about 40% of their revenues tied to overseas growth. We just think those headwinds are pretty strong and we come in sort of around $228 for S&P earnings for next year. And you mentioned that statistic there, 40% of revenue coming from overseas. That of course brings up the strong dollar, the risk of the challenge that that poses for companies here. How are you assessing that risk and I guess how long do you see that risk lasting here? Because it doesn't seem like anything is going to take some of that strength out of the dollar anytime soon. Well, you're right to bring up the dollar as they say our currency, your problem. And it has been a significant problem for US corporations overseas. And also for the translation of non-US investments back to US dollar terms for our investors and for our clients, you know, develop markets. XUS have outperformed the US on local currency terms, but when you translate it back to the dollar, it's been a huge headwind. So what could stop the dollar? Well, what propelled the dollar has been a very aggressive Fed coming out first and very aggressively with this rate hike path that has been extremely front-end loaded to face inflationary pressures. We think we're closer to the end of the policy tightening. We'll probably see the last rate hike in early 2023. And we also see inflation coming off the boil. Those two things should help to stabilize the dollar. So we don't anticipate we're going to see the kind of strength that has created these headwinds in 2023. You mentioned inflation coming off the boil to put it in your terms. Do you think we have seen inflation peak? So inflation has so many dimensions and many of them, particularly the ones that were really pressured because of COVID, have been abating. Supply chain constraints have come off. We see prices coming down and use cars. I mean, we're all talking about use cars these days. It's a pretty important price barometer. So we see inventories that prices down and some of the things that have been really impacted by COVID. So generally speaking, we do see inflation coming down. We saw an empire state manufacturing survey this morning that had some interesting insight on prices coming down where we are still concerned though is in wages. And also, frankly, in owners equivalent rent, these two pieces of inflation are sticky. Owners equivalent rent, we can all see that prices have stabilized and have come down. But it takes a while to get that through the inflation pipeline. So we're not going to see the benefits of that until well into 2023. And wages have stabilized, but at a high level. So we do see lots of inflation elements coming down. And we are watching really closely what happens to wages because that's going to really dictate what happens to CPI and Core CPI and Core PCE in 2023. Yeah, the last jobs print that we got in inflation or excuse me, wages were moving to the upside. Unemployment rate actually went down. So even though we did see a little bit of cooling in that headline number, those.",https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1iVTbuGfqnQ,37,2022-10-18 16:34:15
3551," We got inflation or excuse me, wages were moving to the upside. Unemployment rate actually went down. So even though we did see a little bit of cooling in that headline number, those two factors were really something that a hawkish Fed obviously would keep a very close eye on. What's your assessment just of the jobs market and how substantially we need to see maybe some of that growth begin to cool in order to get inflation under control? You're absolutely right. It's economics 101. We have more demand for labor than we have supply and it's really shocking actually to look at the numbers. When you look at the Joltz data at over 10 million job openings and then you look at the number of unemployed people in the US that are on 7 and a half million, there's just a mismatch. So yes, the ultimate soft landing would be slowing demand enough that the brunt of that is felt on the opening side. So companies just freeze hiring versus actually increasing unemployment. That's a pretty tough needle to thread. It's, yeah, certainly is a very tough needle to thread. Kady, I want to go back to what you said earlier when you were just talking about, you gathered some data I know on the cost of panicking, pulling out, pulling your money out of the market in a volatile time like this. What can you tell us about that and why it's so important to stay invested through on certain times? It's so important always, but more important during volatile times, if you missed just the best 10 days out of the last 10 years. So you're talking 2,500 days. Your return went down by 40%. If you missed 20 of the best days, it went down by 2,3. So there's a really high cost of missing out. And as I said before, we tend to see very strong days of the market during bear markets. And the really tough time for investors. And again, it goes back to market time. It's always difficult, but it's really difficult during these times of high volatility and bear markets. The reason is the best days and the worst days tend to clump together. So you're never going to get it right because you're going to have a terrible day, followed by a great day. So the best advice, the best guidance for investors, especially during times like this, is stay the course, stick with your strategy. Make sure that your equity risk, that your risk assets are aligned to your longer term goal. So you don't have to worry about short-term volatility, but you really need to stick to your strategy or your risk missing out. You know, back in June, we made a pretty bold and decisive decision. We said, all right, inventory is built up. Consumer shopping habits have changed. They moved into different categories. And we said, we're going to get out in front of this. So for Target, we put that inventory problem behind us. And now we can focus on great execution, delighting our guests, getting ready for the big holiday season. So we were pretty decisive and said, we're not going to just let this roll into the next quarter. We'll deal with it up front. And now we're excited.",https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1iVTbuGfqnQ,38,2022-10-18 16:38:27
3552," getting ready for the big holiday season. So we were pretty decisive and said, we're not going to just let this roll into the next quarter. We'll deal with it upfront. And now we're excited that we're ready to play for the holiday season. I've followed your entire time as CEO as Target. You've made a bunch of bold decisions. You exited Canada. First thing you did, I remember writing on that story as soon as it out. You 2017 investor conference. We're investing billions of dollars. Markets didn't like it. Now you're clearing out inventory. How hard is it to make these decisions as a leader? Well, if I think about each one of those decisions, there was probably a very similar model that we followed. So all right, what's the right thing for the target brand? What's the right thing for the target guest? What's the right thing for our team? And when we think about it through that lens, it's always the right thing for our shareholder long term. So whether it was leaving Canada and putting all of our focus on the US business or making that decision back in 2017, when others were closing stores, we said, we're going to double down on stores and put stores at the center of our strategy. We took the same approach as Summer and said, all right, across all of retail, inventory is a reason. We're going to get out in front of this and make sure that we have the right assortment. We deliver great value. We protect that guest experience in our stores. And we also did the right thing for our team. Thank you mentioned. This is your ninth holiday season as CEO of Target. How do you think this season will shape up compared to those other eight or nine? Well, Brian, you know we spend a lot of time talking to consumers, talking to our guests. And the one thing we've heard throughout this year is they want to enjoy and celebrate seasonal moments. So the guests this hold us, they're excited about Halloween. Still a few days away. They're looking forward to Thanksgiving and celebrating with family and friends. And they are looking forward to the Christmas holidays. So we know the consumer in America, the guest at shops target, they are excited about seasonal holidays. And we're going to be ready to make sure we delight them. Recession? Anything, any indications you see? Store traffic, what they're buying, anything that would suggest this could be a gloomy holiday season. Well, everyone's talking about recession. And you know, sitting here today, there's different points of view. You talk to bank CEOs, some gloom and doom. Others are saying really healthy consumer. What we've seen all year long is really healthy traffic. And a guest that's shopping in our stores and shopping online so that strength and traffic has been driving our business. We've delivered solid comps throughout this year. We expect that to continue over the balance of the holiday season. All right, that is good to hear. So back to my shopping list here, if you can, you can just indulge in. Let's do it. 42 count of tide pods online, $13. Now, I'm a dumb millennial. I don't keep track of things that I buy in terms of price. But to me, that seems like a lot. Our shoppers to your stores trading down. That seems like a lot of money for basic essential. Yeah. So, Brent, you know core to our proposition is making sure we deliver great value and affordability every time you shop. So, we measure pricing really carefully versus our competition. And we want to make sure we're priced right daily. We deliver great value and affordability. So, on those items that you're looking at, we've got to make sure we have the right price every time you shop. And the guests expect that from Target. How is private label business doing in the S&R? It's been burning up. So, we now have a $30 billion own brand business. $30 billion. And it's performed incredibly well throughout the pandemic and continues to grow. So whether you're shopping, good and gather, or getting something for yourself, you know, good fellow that you can wear on set, or shopping any of our great brands, we now have $11 billion own brands in our portfolio. So that business just continues to perform. We'll perform over the holiday season. Huge, Brian. So yesterday, I was actually in Bayshore Target. All right. Well, every weekend, Bayshore Target, shout out, Bayshore Target. 15 registers open. Two of them were self checkout, but 15 registers total. 11 and more closed. Is that the worker shortage? Brian, we've been staffed throughout the pandemic. We have 400,000 team members across the country. And going back to 2017, you remember we made a big commitment back then to invest in our team. We said in 2017, we were going to get to a starting minimum wage of $15. Now, sitting here today, we made another big investment just a few months ago to say, all right, depending on the market, we're going to start at either 50.",https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1iVTbuGfqnQ,39,2022-10-18 16:42:59
3553," minimum wage of $15. Now, sitting here today, we made another big investment just a few months ago to say, all right, depending on the market, we're going to start at either 15, but it could be as much as $24 an hour to make sure that we have the team in place. We're going to hire another 100,000 seasonal team members for this holiday season. So because of our investment in wages, in benefits, in training, you know that we launched a debt-free educational assistance program last year. We had over 70,000 team members raise their hands and say, I want to take advantage of that. So those investments have allowed us to retain and attract great talent. And we'll continue to make sure our team is our most valuable asset. 100,000 workers, that's a lot. Are you confident you can get that number? We are. We're off to a great start. Interesting. So you spent some time in the grocery industry. Of course, Target is big in selling groceries. And I know you watched a competition. What do you think about this Coralger and Albranson's merger? Does this change the game for the grocery industry and doesn't make you change how you think about your grocery offerings? Well, we'll watch it carefully. Obviously, it's a new announcement. It's going to take some time to close. But we're going to continue to focus on our food and beverage business. I mean, we've seen really strong growth and market share gains for over 20 consecutive quarters. So the strength of that business has really connected with the guests during the pandemic and has come out of the pandemic. It's really a strong driver of growth. So we're all in on the food and beverage business. We'll continue to invest. We've had a couple of great own brands there. We've been good and gathered as a $2 billion brand for us now in food and beverage. The guest has really responded all to a brand called Favorite Day. So we feel really good about food and beverage driving traffic and complementing our multi-category portfolio. I think I've seen wine at a Target too. These are big departments. They are. They're really important. And it's important for our guests. So we always listen to the guest. And they've told us food and beverage is an important category for them. It drives traffic. But I also know when they're there. They're shopping beauty. They're shopping in a peril. They're getting something for their home. So it compliments our business really nicely. Beauty's been an important category for years now. And all to just compliments our beauty offering. And it was one of the things that our guest told us. We said, all right, what brand would you like to see here? On the top of their list, they said, we love Starbucks. We love the fact you've got Disney stores. They'll take away my Apple stores. But they love the fact that we've added ultra beauty. So those partnerships, whether it's CVS and pharmacy and Starbucks in almost every store, more Apple shops, more Disney shops, and now Ulta, it just compliments the great offering we have of national brands and home brands. You just signed on for another. I think the press release said.",https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1iVTbuGfqnQ,40,2022-10-18 16:47:01
3554," Apple shops, more Disney shops, and now Ulta, it just compliments the great offering we have of national brands and home brands. You just signed on for another, I think the press release said about three years. So let's just say three years. What is the next three years in Brian Cornell's look like, life look like in terms of charm and sea of tiredness? Yeah. I think it's going to be another chapter of growth for our company and continuing to invest in remodeling stores and building new stores and great locations like Bayshore, developing our own brands, accelerating our national brand partnerships, and making sure that we continue to invest in our team. And there's lots of things I'm proud of. In fact, that we added $30 billion of growth since the start of the pandemic is something that our team feels really good about. What I feel to me, most, what really fires me up, is the investments that we've made in our team. And seeing the diversity in our organization, seeing the growth opportunities, seeing our culture come to life. When I talk about culture, we always talk about a culture of care and growth and winning together. That's something that I'm going to continue to focus on for years to come. Brian, I've only known you to be a fired up guy. You're fired up right now talking about the target's business in its future. Where does that come from on a personal level? Well, you know, for me, this is an amazing brand. And I've got to tell you, Brian, I wake up every day feeling the responsibility of leading the target brand. Those 400,000 team members that work for us, those families that depend on us across the country. So I wake up with a huge sense of responsibility. And the pride I have in the team in that brand and the role we play in America is something that gets me up each and every day feeling great about the role that I sit in today. Growing up, did you see yourself as a CEO? Yeah. Well, Brian, I think you know my story. And I grew up right down the road here in Queens as a poor kid who kind of has worked for everything I've had. And I never even imagined I'd be sitting in a chair like this. But I embraced the moment and I just feel proud to work for a great company. I very much, I was just having a moment there. I very much identify with that, Brian, that much is for sure. How do you, how have you balanced it all? This has been a very challenging three years for executives, not just CEOs, CFOs, CEOs. How do you balance this time? And how do you just stay grounded? Yeah. Well, I'll go back to. I work with a great leadership team, the best leadership team I've ever been part of. I have an amazing wife who's been married to me for 40 years now. A great family that supports me. And as you know, I take care of myself. I make sure that I get to the gym every day and call me out of that. Yes, I shouted that out. Full disclosure, when Brian, that news hit the really hit the wires that you were staying for three years. I said, look, Brian's a fit guy. He can stay on for another 15 years. How do you, how do you think about succession? At some point, you will not be the CEO of Target. You know, shareholders, I'm sure, won't like it. But is that one of your most important jobs right now outside of planning for holidays? Yeah. I think for any CEO, succession has to be something you focus on every day. Not just for my role, but for my leadership team and the officers and those key roles throughout the company. So we spend a tremendous amount of time. I have a fabulous HR partner, Melissa Kramer. And we spend time every week talking about talent. Last week, I was traveling. I was in Washington, DC. I had a group of 28 black target officers that were with us in DC. We visited stores together. We spent time with outside speakers. And I'm always investing in talent and making sure I get to know the team. I spent time with them. We traveled together. But as a CEO of a company like ours, $106 billion growth company, you've kind of constantly be focusing on talent development. And thinking about who are the future leaders that are going to guide this company whenever that day comes. And I'm not here fair enough. Let's just before we let you go, we're running short on time here. Let's just go back to the economy real quick because we are up against the holiday shopping season. So you see nowhere session. You think consumers will spend this season like they spent last season? I think it's just a very unusual time from an economic standpoint. And we're coming out of a pandemic. There were lots of stimulus checks that have been written, lots of child care support. We're starting to see a consumer get back to normal life. They want to travel again. They're out in restaurants. So.",https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1iVTbuGfqnQ,41,2022-10-18 16:51:28
3555," Effects that have been written, lots of child care support. We're starting to see a consumer get back to normal life. They want to travel again, they're out in restaurants. So sitting here today, we're on one side. We've got inflation that's at a 40-year high, but unemployment, incredibly low. And I think those two things are balancing out right now. So we continue to see a healthy guest shopping in our stores and shopping online. We'll see how they react throughout the holiday season. But when we talk to them, they continue to say they want to celebrate the holidays. And we know they're out on the streets of New York. They're in restaurants. They're in our stores. So right now, we're seeing a stable environment. Do you worry about, and I'm sure in the green we heard, Hilton CEO, Chris Nacetta just talked to us about what the Fed may do to the economy. Do you fear the Fed and what they're doing? Well, we've got to watch it carefully. But in our business, Brian, we've got to be agile. We've got to prepare for any environment. It's part of the strength of our multi-category portfolio. We sell food and beverage products and household essentials. We have all your beauty needs. We have toys for kids and apparel and home items. So we'll balance our portfolio to make sure we're meeting the needs of the consumer no matter what the environment looks like. Everyone's talking about the last CPI report. The Fed is a global economy, and it's a large number. So you understand, from the Fed standpoint, they have to tackle inflation. They have a blunt instrument. They have a blunt instrument, which is interest rate policy at this point. They're trying to increase rates. They're trying to increase rates to slow demand down, just take demand out of the economy. They really cannot affect the supply side of the equation. The problem that we have, or the issue that people are debating now, is the Fed started raising rates earlier this year. We've gone through quite a few interest rate rises already, and the economy has not slowed down from an inflationary standpoint. That said, we all know that this monetary policy takes time to feed itself through the economy. Unfortunately, it hits consumers almost immediately. So if you've got an adjustable rate mortgage, it adjusts the next day. If you've got credit card debt that adjusts it adjusts the next day. But the real policy affects on slowing down demand, that takes months, and almost a year to a year and a half, to feed through the economy. So there's this discussion going on, has the Fed done enough in interest rates to slow down the economy. And we don't know because the effects are still being felt of the first rate increases. Or they not done enough because...",https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1iVTbuGfqnQ,42,2022-10-18 16:55:44
3556," They had done enough in interest rates to slow down the economy, and we don't know because the effects are still being felt of the first rate increases, or they not done enough because we continue to see inflation move higher and higher. So I think the Fed isn't a very difficult position. They were late to the game. They started raising rates late, which means they're now playing catch-up. I think we all believe that they will raise rates two more times this year at the two more meetings. Probably at least 75 basis points in the November meeting. And probably another 50 to 75 basis points at the end of the year. So we will have gone from basically zero Fed fund rates in the United States to well over 4% rates in the course of a year. That's a fairly dramatic move. And we need to understand what impacts that's going to have longer term to the economy. And what impacts do you think it could potentially have longer term? And are we going to be able to do this without going into a recession? Well, the question is what are the impacts? And as I said, the Fed can try and affect demand, the demand side of the equation. They can make borrowing money more expensive. They can make homes more expensive. They can try and slow consumers down because things are harder to buy because they don't want to finance them. They can't affect the supply side of the equation. And right now when you look at the data and you look at what's going on in the inflationary front, a lot of the inflation comes from commodities and commodity inputs. So by raising interest rates, we don't create more oil. We don't create more food. So we're trying to create a balance of oil. We're trying to create a balance of food. We're trying to create a balance of workers back into the labor force. I think one of the big underlying components of inflation is wage price inflation. We keep seeing 5% plus wage inflation. Wages filter through everything we do. As the economy has shifted during COVID to where we're buying lots of goods because we really couldn't leave our houses. So we're buying things. We're having them sent to our houses and we were consuming goods. We're now back into a more normalized economic cycle. In a normalized economic cycle, we as Americans, we're good consumers of services. We like to go out. We like to be entertained. We like to travel. We like to go to events. The service economy is all labor. When you go out to a service event, you're really buying mostly labor. So when you go to a concert or you go to a restaurant or you go to a bar, you're buying some inputs, some commodities, but you're buying an awful lot of labor. That labor cost has not come down. And it's another area where the Fed is trying to get some response. They're trying to get businesses to not grow as fast. They're trying to get people to businesses to not hire as many people. But we saw even in the last month's unemployment report, we saw 3.5% unemployment. We still see non-farm payrolls growing. So the interest rate impact has not fed through to the business cycle yet. We're going to have to see job destruction if we're really going to see inflation be curtailed. And I think that's hard because we've gone through a lot of fundamental changes in this country. Prior to COVID, we were all talking about the aging American workforce. Guess what? We're still an aging American workforce. We didn't stop aging during COVID. Unfortunately, during COVID, we lost about 2 million people from the labor force. Either through long COVID or unfortunately they passed away, which is a horrible event. But we've got to recognize we've lost people from the labor force. And then we had a bunch of people sort of late in their work cycle who decided to leave the labor force. So we've now have a smaller labor force population in the United States. So businesses to attract workers into the labor force are having to pay more to get workers into the cycle, which is inflationary. Wages go up. They pass those increased wages onto the consumers. And we're in this inflationary cycle. So the feds are going to continue to keep raising rates to try and break this cycle. They won't know they have broken it till long after it's broken. So what does this mean then for the equity markets? Because here we stand today, the S&P off more than 20% in your to date. And Nasdaq down more than 30% in your to date. When you try to gauge that downside risk here for equities, what does that look like? So again, the famous ad is don't fight the fed. It's been true for this cycle. It was true for last cycle. When we had a zero interest rate policy, you'll you wanted to own risky assets. When you've got the fed increasing interest.",https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1iVTbuGfqnQ,43,2022-10-18 17:00:15
3557," Fed. Yeah. You know, it's been true for this cycle. It was true for last cycle when we had a zero interest rate policy. You'll, you wanted to own risky assets. When you've got the Fed increasing interest rates and the alternative, you know, the risk-free rate, the rate of return it now, sort of 4% for short duration treasury bills. You know, that's an attractive rate of return for short-term treasury bills. And really what's what's happening more than anything is the equity market is trying to figure out what are the future earnings of a company. So remember the value of a stock is the the present value of future earnings. So if a company has higher input cost and it has higher labor costs and hopefully if the Fed is successful, lowered demand for their goods or services, what is the forward earnings of a company look like? Then I could put a multiple on that. And right now the market is trying to determine what forward earnings are going to look like and what multiple that should trade at. And as long as the Fed is continuously raising rates, trying to slow down the economy, trying to make things more expensive, trying to make labor more expensive, the market is going to continue to try and find a clearing price for that. We again, it's it's like everything else in this world. We won't know we've met that clearing price till long after the bottom is here. We may have met it already. A lot of people think we have not got to that clearing price. But you know, the market right now is trying to figure out what future earnings look like and what multiple we should put on that. In this episode of influencers, Gregory Zuckerman, author of a shot to save the world. I think we're too close to this miraculous development of these vaccines to appreciate it normally of it. I really do think it's modern science is greatest achievement. I believe that this pandemic is going to end, but this virus is not going away. It's going to end that. It's going to kind of melt into the background, but we're always going to have things dropping up. I write the same story all over it. Over and over. I write about overlooked, underappreciated individuals, achieving something that the experts told them they couldn't do. Hello, everyone, and welcome to influencers. I'm Andy Surtwer. And welcome to our guests, Gregory Zuckerman, award-winning journalist, special writer at the Wall Street Journal, an author of the new book, A Shot to Save the World, the Inside Story of the Life or Death Race for a COVID-19 vaccine. Greg, nice to see you. Great to see you, Andy. So congratulations on the book. A lot to talk about. You've noted that you wanted to focus on the triumphs of the triumphs, I guess you should say, of the development of the vaccine. And one thing you talked about was a lucky break that occurred with regard to MRNA research, which occurred a couple years before the pandemic, which probably allowed for the rapid development of the vaccine. What would the world look like if the pandemic had arrived five years earlier? Do you think we'd still be waiting for a vaccine? It's a great question. So I think we're too close to this miraculous development of these vaccines to appreciate the enormity of it. I really do think it's modern science's greatest achievement. And to your point, the technology was not ready a few years ago. So we need to be grateful that the pandemic, that this virus emerged at a time when the scientists I write about in my book thought they had an approach that would work. They weren't sure we're talking the end of 2019 very early part of 2020. And they turned around and they created these really effective protective vaccines. But again, a few years earlier, I don't think we would have been nearly as lucky. But there's a few different types of science that have been applied to the different vaccines. You want to just go through them and sort of lay person's term, which I know is your specialty. Sure. So MRNA, we are familiar with that with that approach, that vaccine approach, because that created the Moderna as well as the Pfizer vaccines. MRNA is short for messenger RNA, which is just a molecule we have inside of us. It transports instructions from the DNA to the part of the cell where proteins are created that we live on, and it depends on every day. And it was always this sort of dream of scientists.",https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1iVTbuGfqnQ,44,2022-10-18 17:04:26
3558," of us, it transports instructions from the DNA to the part of the cell where proteins are created that we live on, it depends on every day, and it was always the sort of dream of scientists to create mRNA in the lab. Well, if it's so important in the body, maybe we could create a synthetic version, just like there's, you know, sugar, natural sugar, and synthetic version of sugar. So the idea was, well, if we could create mRNA in the lab, we could tell our bodies to create any protein. And that was the idea. That's the just of the mRNA approach. We is a vaccine. It sends a message and a message obviously in this case is an instruction for the body, the immune system to create the protein, the protein in this case is despite protein. So like any other vaccine, it's an education for the body. And the other approach I write about the adenovirus approach that led to the J and J, as well as the AstraZeneca vaccines. That's a really interesting one. Two, that one also took years in making and I write about how that began really with HIV, effort to solve HIV. We haven't figured that one out yet, but they shifted these scientists and said, okay, we can't do HIV, but we're going to get a vaccine for COVID. Yeah, Dan Baroque, one of the scientists working on that later endeavor I spoke to has been, and you're right, I've been working on that for a very long time, but switching back to mRNA, you do focus a lot on Moderna, which could have been one of the biggest losers in the race for the vaccine and being a big winner. How much credit should the Moderna CEO get here? It sounds like, you know, his background as a salesman was sort of key in bringing this all together. Yeah, he's a fascinating character. For years, people whispered about him. They suspected he was exaggerating more donors, ability to create either vaccines or drugs. There wasn't much proof. They were very secretive kind of firm. He was very hard on his employees. You could read about it in a book. People were collapsing in the office, outside the office at home, hitting their heads, being rushed to the emergency rooms, he was firing people left and right. Very difficult. And yet, inspirational too, in hard driving. And he had a vision. His vision was that mRNA was going to save lives. And he felt he needed to push his people hard. He's a little bit of a Steve Jobs kind of character in that regard. And he said, guys, one day we're going to be the ones to step up in a crisis. And he was right. And maybe it takes some money like that. And like you said, he's a great salesman. And he raised billions and billions for Moderna over the years without any proof of concept. And people were jealous. There were a lot of envy in the industry. But turns out that that money was what was fed to people made a lot of money investing in Moderna. Yeah. And I heard, you know, whispers in Boston in that biotech community about him for a while, just what you're sort of saying, Greg. And even while they were sort of getting up to speed, that, you know, I mean, maybe Charlotton is too strong a word, but there were serious doubters. Do you think those people, you know, are sort of eating crow right now? So Andy, in my book, I, people compared him to Elizabeth Holmes. They said, just like Sarah knows, there's nothing there to this company, Moderna. And, you know, you can understand it to some extent. They didn't have any proof. They'd spent years working on drugs. And now right in the book, they gave up on making mRNA work for drug. They had to pivot to vaccines because it wasn't working with drugs. And vaccines is not a really popular area for a lot of pharmaceutical companies. So are they eating crow? Yes. But, you know, there is some reason why they were skeptical all those years. But in the end, they were wrong. Right. Operation works. Where do you come out on that? I mean, this was a Trump administration program. Controversial. There are some, let's just say colorful people steering it. But was it effective, Greg? So like most every other topic in society today, it's sort of black and white against you. Either Operation Warp Speed saves everything and we have to give Donald Trump all the credit or it was useless. I come down somewhere in the middle, meaning that Operation Warp Speed was very helpful. There were a lot, there's a lot of money that it was given to these companies. Resources to, I'm a little parks that were necessary from all over the country that were brought to the necessary spots on bioperape, should warp speed employees. But you also have to remember that warp speed made it early bet on a different vaccine, the AstraZeneca vaccine. It did not give money to my journal early on when it was desperate for money. And Moderna has recently as made.",https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1iVTbuGfqnQ,45,2022-10-18 17:08:56
3559," made an early bet on a different vaccine, the AstraZeneca vaccine. It did not give money to my return early on. When it was desperate for money, and Moderna, as recently as May 2020, was running out of money and couldn't get money from the government, could get money from private industry, from public, from foundations, from Merck, they went to Merck, and they were almost unable to create these vaccines. Were you one more reason to be grateful for what happened? So Operation Warper Speed was very helpful in the end, Moderna did get a lot of money from Operation War Speed, others did too. But you don't want to save all due to Warp Speed and the success of these remarkable vaccines. There is the perspective case where the government's going to suggest that everyone gets every person in America gets a booster. So, Moderna is going to be a good one. And I think that is coming. And also, down the road, I believe that this pandemic is going to end, but this virus is not going away. It's going to be endemic. It's going to melt into the background, but we're always going to have things cropping up. Areas that aren't vaccinating, we're going to have issues. It's going to morph, and we've got more strains. I'm not saying this to people for people to be too concerned. I do think Pfizer, Moderna, and the other companies can adjust their vaccines. So, you'll go in, and there'll be second and third generation vaccines. You'll go into a doctor's office and get a COVID vaccine, but it'll be in all-in-one, maybe with a flu vaccine. Maybe they'll throw something else in there too. So, I don't want people to be too discouraged, but the vaccine research is that a right about. They're trying to stay ahead of this thing. Yeah, I mean, is that a losing battle? Is it going to be like the flu? Are we going to continue to need new vaccines all the time? I mean, this seems like it's not going to just...",https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1iVTbuGfqnQ,46,2022-10-18 17:13:20
3560," Is it going to be like the flu? Are we going to continue to need new vaccines all the time? I mean, this seems like it's not going to just end as you suggest. Yeah, it won't. Right. It won't. But I wouldn't call it a losing battle. I think we'll stay ahead of it. And these vaccines are so much more effective than the flu vaccine. So if you've got protection of 7 to 80% and it's even high of our hospitalization and death, it will allow us to return to some to a normal say, really. In society. You hear that other countries vaccines are not as effective, you know, like the Chinese vaccine. I don't know where the Russian vaccine stands. I heard there was one in Cuba that was not not effective at all. Like, why is that? Well, they use different approaches. So I write in the book a little bit of the Russian approach is a variation on the one that you mentioned with Dan Baruch and the J&J one. It's not quite as good. And frankly, we just don't have as much data that's reliable. It doesn't help that Putin himself didn't take the vaccine from months and months. He wouldn't take it. So, listen, if that was the only vaccine in the world either the Russian one or the Chinese one, I think we would all embrace it and take. And it's largely effective, but just not as effective. MRNA as revolutionary as it is, it just is so much better than these other vaccines. How come Merck and Santa Fe and other companies that are known as leaders in this space were not at the fore? That's a great question. And frankly, when I started researching this book, I kind of expected the vaccine giants to be the ones to save us. I mean, Merck is the one that created the MMR vaccine that we're all familiar with. The Mums, Meezels, or Bella, they're a vaccine giant. So as Santa Fe is you say, GSK, and yet they started to drag their feet. I write about some internal rift within Merck about whether to pursue a vaccine for COVID-19 or not. GSK and Santa Fe teamed up, but their approach isn't quite very yet. I would argue that vaccines until this past year are not a really sexy area for big pharmaceutical companies. You get one every few years or once a year, once a lifetime maybe, so much you can charge for a vaccine. And as a result, I think the big pharmaceutical companies had mixed feelings about chasing after a vaccine for COVID-19. MR. There's no money there. GSK there is, as we're seeing now this past year, but at the time it wasn't clear. And listen, you put all this work into it. They've done this. Merck has chased vaccines in the past for things like Zeke and such that have dissipated, gone away and they wasted tons of money, resources, et cetera, opportunity cost was it was high. So if you're going to chase after a vaccine and when you don't even know if there's going to be a need for it by the time you develop it, it's a risky business proposition. Right. Moderna just recently announced an agreement with Gaby, which the vaccine alliance to ship more vaccine doses to areas around the world that are still behind in 2022. Is this too little too late? MR. I think it's popular to criticize Moderna. You see how much money they're making. There are always these suspicions about them. I think the back of people's minds, they remember that, that those questions and they're eager to criticize Moderna. I'm not here necessarily to defend them, but I do have to note that they didn't have a part unlike Beontek, which works with Pfizer, but you're to confine a part, they're to turn them down. So they had to do it all themselves and they've been taxed. They've been going to the limit. I know the people internally, they believe that they wish they had been able to produce more, but their vaccine supplies were scooped up by the West. They paid the most and they got there early. And now they're trying to help elsewhere. Is it too little to lay? I would say it's slow and happening, but I also understand what's going on internally with a Moderna. It's just destroyed physically, psychologically, it's been a really difficult year, even though they've made a lot of money. By the way, you just saw a little mystery in my brain, Greg. Beyond tech, that's how you pronounce it? You know, there are different ways of pronouncing it, even internally to pronounce it differently. Yes, that's why I pronounce it beyond tech, you can't go wrong that way. It's like Tesla and Tesla. We ask the people there how to pronounce it, they said either. Really, that's funny. I didn't know that. So what about mRNA research? What do you think the next breakthrough is going to come from there and how will this change the development of future vaccines? So there's a lot of excitement now about what mRNA can do besides COVID-19. Ugr Sahin and Beyond tech have been working on cancer vaccines for many years.",https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1iVTbuGfqnQ,47,2022-10-18 17:17:40
3561," teen, um, Uger Sahin and Beyond Tech have been working on cancer vaccines for many years. They're very excited to take the billions they're making right now and shift and focus on other pathogens, ailments, um, oh, and so it's Moderna. So we're talking about everything from Lupus and MS, turning off the immune system just like we've been able to turn on the immune system perhaps for autoimmune kind of issues. Um, malaria, some people are going after, um, Dan Brook, as you mentioned, AIDS, um, so some of these same vaccine, um, specialists, uh, revolutionary, pioneering, um, researchers that I write about in my book are shifting to all kinds of new challenges. Now, I want to caution just a little bit because until his past year, MRNA has proved pretty disappointing when it comes to drugs and there are some vaccines coming up and believe for things like, um, RSV and CMV, some viruses that are very lethal and harmful for some people. But I want to have a little bit of caution in terms of revolutionizing the world. But I'm excited about the future. Um, I want to ask you about vaccine hesitancy as someone who intricately knows how these vaccines can be. What do you make of these continued conspiracy theories around them and how much are they hurting, uh, efforts to get everyone vaccinated? So, Andy, I speak to a lot of vaccine hesitant audiences and, um, I enjoy doing so. There's always, um, a split. There are some people who are reasonable and cautious, um, and for good reasons, they're, they're wary. Um, I get it. Um, these vaccines were developed in 330 days from the time the sequence was revealed until they were authorized and historically that's just remarkable. I mean, um, the average vaccine took 10 years until last year and the fastest was four years. So here we are coming in three hundred and three days. So I understand the, the weariness and MRNA has never been proved effective. Um, that said, one of the reasons I wrote my book is to show that it was years of research. It wasn't done quickly. They didn't cut corners in any way. Um, what we've been able to do, and partly thanks to warp speed was we were doing things simultaneously. We were developing, testing and manufacturing the vaccine. That's never been done before. Why would he spend billions of dollars to manufacture vaccine? It's not even authorized or approved yet. No one ever did it historically. So those are the kind of reasons why I think some people were hesitant. And I think they should be reassured by the fact that the work corners caught. And this process, this research, these vaccine approaches took years. And that's partly why I wrote the book. Now in terms of conspiracy people, conspiracists, you're not going to make much headway there sadly.",https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1iVTbuGfqnQ,48,2022-10-18 17:21:50
3562," you you you you you you you've been skeptical understanding break of the you've been skeptical of the so-called lab leak theory when it comes to Wuhan and China and the origins of covid-19 the idea that it came from the Wuhan lab but the pandemic's origin has been really difficult to pin down definitively how much have you focused on that question in your reporting and you think we'll ever have a clear answer there so I am skeptical of the lab leak I'm a even more skeptical that China created this vaccine and my reporting is based on talking to top of the doctors structural colleges etc. around the world and the view is that it's a little bit like HIV HIV for years they were suspicion about that as well people accused use CIA, you have government, you have US Army, KGB of creating this virus because there was no natural host, there was no evidence of the animal that had the original virus, and then they found one. It's a year, it's about a decade or so. And likewise, we haven't found the host here, but I think it will be identified. It takes a little bit of time. Those people who say it was created by China, and then they said, well, it won't spread in China, it will only make it spread elsewhere. That seems preposterous. The lab leak is a possibility. I'd say it's a 10% possibility. But if you just remember that animals were encroaching on wild kingdom all the time, cutting down trees, their viruses are jumping all the time from animals we start with SARS, we start with the earlier coronaviruses, MERS, others. So to expect this one to be unusual and surprising and to be a bit leaked, it's possible, but unlikely. I'm an Occamus Razor kind of guy. Right, is the wet market, does that come into play you think, or is that kind of a blind alley? No, I think there's a good possibility that it's spread there. I'm not sure, they're originally there necessarily, but historically that's how the first one spread to the first SARS in China in a wet market is a good chance that that's how it's spread. Right. Right. And in recent weeks, when we talked about the pill a little bit, I just one last follow question on that. And so is that a big breakthrough or not? I think it is. I think it's going to be kind of a one to punch. That's really going to help us get out of this pandemic as long as people continue to get vaccinated. But we've got this backup of pills that are quite effective. I think modern science is going to be fixing this thing and addressing this thing and helping us out of this pandemic. Yeah. What do you make of Tony Fauci? I mean, is he this American hero or, you know, listen, your book journalist or like, ah, it's not all that. Or is he all that great? What do you think? I think Tony Fauci is a hero. His whole life is dedicated to public health. It's a remarkable and quite frankly, just depressing idea that we as a people are part of our country have turned on those who look out for us. Is he perfect? No. He advised us early on not to wear masks. He could have been more wrong about that. The real kinds of mistakes he and other scientists have made. But for Tony Fauci and his colleagues at NIH others, they could have quit years ago and made a fortune in private industry. And they didn't. Why? They don't look out for health and they're trying to.",https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1iVTbuGfqnQ,49,2022-10-18 17:26:29
3563," There's that could have quit years ago and made a fortune in private industry. And they didn't, why? Because they look out for our health and they're trying to give us good advice and guidance. And he's also pushing the research and he behind the scenes made a lot of contributions in terms of these vaccine approaches that are right about in my book. So we owe him and his colleagues a great deal of gratitude. They're not perfect whatsoever to make the stakes left and right, but who doesn't? Yeah, I think you're so right making that point that of course you could have become the top scientist of the giant pharma company, the anonymous and very wealthy living in a nice suburb and all that. But he just said, then we would criticize him for the revolving door and how dare you go private industry after public, yeah, they get it criticized either way. Yeah, after everything has happened over the past 18 months, do you think we're better equipped now, better prepared for the next pandemic? Well, I think so given that mRNA has been proven and we figure out how to manufacture it efficiently, distribute it, took us a little while, but we've learned a lot of lessons in terms of trials as well. So mRNA now we can depend on. So the next big pathogen, lethal virus that emerges, I think we can adjust and create vaccines quite quickly. Other lessons I don't think we've learned to mean as a nation, we don't look out for each other like we should where a group of individualists and that's helped us arrive at these vaccines. And only in America could we, these vaccines have been created. Granted, there's one from Germany, but even the German CEO I've talked to who said, without American investors venture capitalist people rolling the dice on their approach years ago when they went public, when they were raising money, these vaccines could not have been created. So there's a lot to be proud of as an American. There's also a lot to be discouraged about, about how we get advice from our brother-in-law or some video that we saw on YouTube as opposed to our own internist. It's pretty discouraging both for me, but also for the creators, the pioneers that I talked to for my book, when they see that all their hard work has led to this split and some people were resistant and pointing fingers at them for their efforts, it's quite discouraging. And at times left that we have left, Chair Greg, want to ask you a little bit about you and the process and writing books. How did you decide to do this particular book? So I was deep in my basement office in New Jersey, locked down like everybody else, and kind of discouraged about the world. And I thought it could be a fun project to trace and speak to the researchers, the scientists, the pioneering kind of remarkable innovators that are behind his vaccines. I didn't know at the time that they'd be proven effective, but I kind of made a bet that they would and I tracked them along the way. So in some ways it was a healthy distraction for me, gave me encouragement and my book is about what went right, as opposed to what went wrong. I wanted it to be an upbeat book that gives us hope about the future because these vaccine specialists, they're turned, they're focused on other pathogens and other illnesses and viruses, and we're going to need them again sadly, I think in the years ahead. And finally, Greg, so this is one of several books you've written. Is there a common thread or how do you choose what to write about? I mean, it's such a big commitment. You know, I read the last one that you did about a Jim Simon's was great. But you know, you're kind of the rolling the dice yourself in the sense that like you're picking some of your committing to it and you hope that it resonates, right? Yeah, so Andy, one can criticize me because, and I only realized this after I started to pass in my manuscript, I write the same story all over again, over and over. I write about overlooked, underappreciated individual and over looked underappreciated individuals, achieving something that the experts told them they couldn't do. And I write about that over and over again, unlike the heroes. I just happen to, that resonates with me. I find that fascinating. Why is it that conventional wisdom is so wrong so often? All my books and my first book was about the financial crisis and the individuals who anticipated it shouldn't have been these guys. And then I write about the energy revolution. It should not have been these frackers in Oklahoma who turned this country around. It should have been Chevron and BP. And like you said, my last book, The Man of South of the Market, is about a bunch of scientists who don't even care so much about capitalism and business, who have the greatest investment for them in history. And this time it's a group of companies and approaches that were overlooked. M-R-N-A, and these companies, Pfizer, notwithstanding, beyond tech is the key person, key company. Yeah.",https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1iVTbuGfqnQ,50,2022-10-18 17:30:41
3564," It's a group of companies and in approaches that were overlooked, mRNA and these companies, Pfizer, notwithstanding, beyond tech is the key person, the key company behind the vaccine, Moderna and the others I write about. So I'm taken with that theme. I think come, it's one that you can learn a lot from and hopefully readers enjoy it as well. Well, as one reader, I certainly have, Greg. And so keep on doing it. I didn't realize that, I didn't notice that theme throughout. So now I will be noticing that. And if and when you do another one. Yeah, I didn't notice myself until I passed it in. But yeah, I love like that theme, a little bit of a David and Goliath, but I think there were lessons that can be learned about overcoming obstacles and criticism even and skepticism from the so-called experts. Greg Zuckerman, author of the new book, A Shot to Save the World, The Inside Story of the Life or Death Race or a COVID-19 vaccine. Thanks so much for joining us. Oh, great to be here. You've been watching influencers. I'm Andy Cerwer. We'll see you next time. Mm Welcome back to Y'all Finance. I'm Brian Sasi here with Julie Hyman and Brad Smith. I'm just taking their cue this morning from a less bad than expected earnings report over at Goldman Sachs. Similar to the market reaction to Bank of America's numbers on Monday. Right now, we're seeing all three major indices nicely in the green. Here's what we have for you on tap over the next hour. Bear Market Bounce, our friend Rick Reader from BlackRock is here with his latest analysis on all things markets and hitting the bulls eye. Day after target CEO Brian Cornel struck an upbeat tone on the holidays in a Yahoo Finance exclusive. One analyst is upgrading his rating on the stock. We have that analyst joining us very shortly. And into the metaverse, Roblox's ticker page continues to be electric on the Yahoo Finance platform. Talk to an analyst to see if the interest has staying power. Bad over to you. My favorite wedding song to dance to and get on the dance floor with the electric slide. All right. Well, we're seeing a little bit of a positive movement here. Continue to hold early in trade on the day that adjuncts an industrial average DJI or DJI. You're seeing that up by about 1.8%. Nasdaq in Posit still holding that's up by about 2% right now. 209 points to the upside there. S&P 500 you're also seeing that hold at about 1.9%. So much of the positive activity that you're seeing around the world here also continuing to protrude into today's market activity. And over the past two days here early in the trading week or at least for the first two days, you're seeing that hold for the S&P 500 over the two day period up by about 4.6%. Also, want to take a look at some of the trending tickers here on the day that we've been tracking as well because.",https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1iVTbuGfqnQ,51,2022-10-18 17:35:42
3565," You're seeing that hold for the S&P 500 over the two day period up by about 4.6%. Also want to take a look at some of the trending tickers here on the day that we've been tracking as well, because there is a major tie up at least in the pharmaceutical space, excuse me, where you've got AVO pharmaceuticals that's actually being acquired by LG Chem. You've got shares of AVO moving higher by 40% here on the day in reaction to that. Some details of the deal, we do know that it's going to be acquired in equity value of about $566 million on a fully diluted basis, and it represents a 43% premium to AVOs closing share price as of October 17th. So that move being priced here in today and early in trade, still holding on to some healthy gains this morning. Yeah, even though we're down off the high. So really interesting here you guys, we are continuing this sort of debate here with stocks rallying about whether this is a bounce, right? Whether it's sort of a bear market bounce, whether it's going to be something more fundamental, we talked to Simeon Hyman earlier, who said that there are some fundamental reasons here to be optimistic. One slide that Whitman has been September CPI report, of course, which suggests that the Fed is going to have to keep going to get inflation levels where they want them to be. The Fed continuing its data-driven approach. And so there's a lot of questions about whether they're behind the curve. Joining us now to discuss all of this BlackRock's global fixed income CIO, Rick Reader. Hey, Rick. How are you? Nice to see you, a person. Sure, have me. So we have this sort of bounce that we're seeing in the market here, and this debate now about whether it's going to be sustained, whether this is another head fake. What do you think? So I don't think you can count on the market, continue to have, by the way, it's nice being here on a green deck. We don't get any of those these days. But I think it's hard to count on sustained this being sustained. You've got a Fed that's still tightening financial conditions. You've got inflation that's still running too hot, and they've got to keep moving. I think that the markets are priced in about as far as the Fed is going to go, but you don't know the answer to that yet. And until we get more data, we just came off a strong CPI report. We came off a strong payroll report. Now all eyes turn to the employment cost index, PCE data. And we need to see it start to trend down for the Fed to come off this, and then it's hard to take a lot of risk until that happens. Has it been encouraging to you, though, Rick, that we've seen the market rally in response to earnings that aren't necessarily great Goldman Bank of America? They were okay. They weren't as bad as feared, but even go back to last week, you saw some hot reads on inflation. The market bounced on those numbers as well. Those to me seem like positives. They definitely do. And by the way, the bank earnings are pretty good. I mean, when you break it down, those are pretty good. You also had a big relief off of this dynamic that was happening in the UK. I mean, this unwind of the leverage in the pension system was incredibly dislocating. The impact it was having on rates in the UK, and then infecting the US and Europe. That was a big deal. Listen, I think you've got the equity market has some pretty sizable short positions in it today. And I think people underestimate how much the market has gotten repositioned around equities. And you're seeing some pretty big put option trading, very big and positions. And short interest, that's pretty sizable. And so the technicals in the equity market are pretty darn good today. So you get these bounces. And my sense is you'll keep getting them, but can you count on a sustained rally? I think it's still early to think that. I want to pick up on the point about the UK for just a second. There was more news out this morning. The financial times said they were going to delay their quantitative tightening. Then the bank of England says, no, we're not necessarily going to delay it. But I've been sort of struggling to some extent to understand the interplay between what's going on in the UK and here. So can you sort of lay that out for us and why it is so important what's happening? 100%. So you've got dynamic in the UK, which is extraordinary, in that you had what appeared to be at the time aggressive fiscal easing. At the same time, you were seeing central bank tightening. That is not nobody in history has ever seen that work out. So that was creating this volatility in the markets. But then you have a dynamic that you had this leverage on one. So you have these pension funds had to sell huge amounts of assets, including long-term interest rates, interest rate products generally. And so what happens is the development market interest rates, markets tend to work together. And so that was putting pressure on the markets here. And then just the general dislocation, one.",https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1iVTbuGfqnQ,52,2022-10-18 17:39:27
3566," And so what happens is the development market and interest rates, markets tend to work together. And so that was putting pressure on the markets here. And then just the general dislocation, London is the second epicenter of finance and as you're getting this extraordinary volatility there, and it was permeating all the markets generally. So by the way, when the central banks raised rates as much in tight liquidity, you see the leverage, you know, I would say every day, but periodically you see, wow, I didn't realize that risk was on. I didn't realize this leverage is on. And we're going to keep getting reminders of that for the coming weeks and months. I say, I hope that the Fed is going to reach a point where they could pause at these elevated rates, whether it's 4 1 1 2 1 3 1 2 4 4 5. You know, once they pause, then you could start to get comfortable. And I'm going to take some more risks in my portfolio. But I'd like to see some better data to allow us to think that. Well, you know, on something that you just mentioned a moment ago, where are you seeing the largest volume of kind of outsized short positions right now? I mean, the overall market, I mean, the size, I was looking at the size of put options trading for a week straight, you're talking about about a trillion dollars worth of of notional puts. So by the way, put that number in perspective, the high yield markets, the US high yield markets are trillion and a quarter, a trillion a day. Put options are trading. Now, they're, that's full notional size. So they're obviously trade on a delta basis lower than that. But that is big. And then I look at exposures across a lot of the, what is faster money, hedge fund type. And that's really low in terms of exposure. And I think money managers have brought down their exposure pretty significantly. So, you know, that is significant. And that's where I think you've got a market that once it jumps, you get some short covering that comes in. Or so people worry that they're going to miss it. I guess I, I don't think they're going to miss it. But it's not to say, you know, you go through periods where you have real bear markets, you get these spiked rallies. You mentioned a minute ago that in periods like this, we start to see where the leverage is in the system, where the risk is in the system. Where do you have your eyes on that we might see more signs of that? So, you know, there's something really different than 15, 20 years ago when you had the big subprime crisis. And you had leverage in the financial system, corporates, households. You actually don't have that today. The banks are in good shape from a leverage perspective. Corporates are households are in good shape, in a real world where they've been in history. You know, the one place you got to keep your eye on is the real estate market. So commercial real estate, residential real estate. You know, that's where you have financing. Not just leverage, but you've got to roll over your financing. And so the way commercial real estate projects work, obviously, Rezi is you've got to roll over your financing. And that's where you can get some tricky things. And by the way, you've seen it, you know, we've been buying triple A commercial mortgages and getting close to six and a half. And you know, with this one piece, we bought a close to seven percent triple A. You know, so you think about subordinated, done underneath that. So when that happens, you start to think about cash. If I can buy triple A assets, that's sort of yield. Why would I take much risk otherwise? Well, the other difference between now and then, though, is that you have a lot more private credit companies that are not the banks. Are they a source of risk at all in this environment? I would say generally not because their liabilities, they're usually locked up money. Usually they've got not money for a longer period of time. So I generally don't think that they are significant risk to unwind. You know, there are structures that take place in the market that are, you know, in and around, you know, some of the C-Low markets or otherwise that you got to keep your eye on. But I would say generally, the private financing generally is pretty well termed out in terms of where that capital has been raised. So I don't think that's a stress point today. But like I say, guaranteed, whenever you get this sort of shock to the system, something's going to pop up that you didn't expect. And you know, similar to what happened in the UK. I mean, who would have thought the UK, you'd have an issue in the pension system? And that's, but that is a luscious of what happens in these situations. Let's say on financial stability, a competitor puts out a survey this morning, lots of charts in there is noting worsening risks to financial stability, now weighing on equities. But you don't see that. This is not great recession stuff we're seeing right now in the markets. It's great recession in terms of the economy slowing or it's... I mean, we don't see the same things in housing. I mean, there's not a same situation. We just see stock prices going down. Right. I so... Listen, I mean, it's been historic in 50 years, probably longer than that. You've never seen rates...",https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1iVTbuGfqnQ,53,2022-10-18 17:43:51
3567," In the same situation, we just see stop prices going down. Right. I so, listen, it's been historic in 50 years, probably longer than that. You've never seen rates and risk go down at the same time. And that is, I mean, that is an illustration of the fastest tightening we've ever seen by the central banks in history. By the way, not just the US, but the emerging markets, the ECB, the Bank of England. So that is just what happens on the backside of it. And it's just not clear how much the economy is going to slow on the backside of it. What we are seeing that I think is encouraging is you're starting to see the goods part of the economy come down a bit. And that is healthy. You're seeing that inflation. You're seeing that in sheer demand for goods. What you're not seeing yet is a service sector. The service sector is in great shape. Education, leisure, healthcare, solid, both in terms of inflation as well as demand. So you've got an economy that's actually in pretty good shape. I think people underestimate while the economy is going to slow, the goods sector is going to slow. You're seeing that embodied in commodity prices, home builders, et cetera. But the service economy, the US economy is two thirds, consumption is two thirds service. It's hard to bring that down. That's exactly what I wanted to ask you about with regard to where we sit right now within this shift because what we've heard so far from the banks that have reported, from the airlines that have reported, we spoke with Delta CEO. And they're talking about this shift in goods to services really benefiting the experience economy as well. Is that something that if you look out into early 2023, even further into midway through 2023, that remains that demand remains strong and solid enough as consumers are still looking across their own balance sheets where we've seen that go from as the banks would describe it as strong to now just healthy, if you will. I mean, listen, there is, when you lift fuel costs and food costs as much as they have, it definitely has an effect on consumption generally. But gosh, if you side, will a service sector continue to hold up? You still got, you look at where wage levels are relative to anything we've ever seen in history. You look at where the amount of savings that's built up, my sense is the service economy will continue to do well. By the way, it's an aging demographic. The demand for healthcare services is not going anywhere other than up from here. So I still think you've got a solid service economy. People lament where the economy has slowed to. But keep in mind, we had double digit nominal GDP last year. We're slowing from that. And you're still going to have nominal GDP this year. That's going to post an impressive number that could be closer to five. So still pretty good. Are we slowing? Is a good sector slowing? Yes. But by the way, it's very different in commodity or anti-accompanies. It's very different in parts of China today, although we think next year will be better. Emerging markets are tougher. But by the way, we go to Europe, and this is what's creating a lot of the fall. In Europe, when you lift fuel costs as much as you have historic, and then you look at the UK, you look at mortgage rates, swiping higher. Consumers 70% of the consumption basket gets now eaten up by just their utility bill and their mortgage. So you think about how difficult that paradigm presents itself. But US relative to the rest of the world is in reasonable shape. Let's leave it there on that hopeful note. Good to see you in person. They are BlackRock's chief investment officer of global fixed income, Rick Reader. We'll talk to you soon. Thanks for coming. Thank you guys. Before we head to break, let's toss up Snap onto the screen ahead of its earnings report on Thursday. Since the company's layoff announcement in late August, the stock has outperformed the broader market by about 5%. But the outperformance looks overdone. Contents Deutsche Bank analyst Benjamin Black says Black quote, we think near and medium term upside remains limited due to the impact macroeconomic uncertainties could have on ad spent, not only given the experimental nature of Snap's ad platform, companies exposure to volatile categories such as crypto and apparel and potentially dilutive engagement shifts.

Another step back for Boeing 737 MAX JET as the Federal Aviation Administration has requested the company review the safety paper work for the JET. According to the Wall Street Journal the FAA is unable to review the company's submissions through the missing and incomplete information. Boeing now runs the risk of not being certified by the December deadline as they continue to await regulatory approval for carrying passengers. Boeing has said safety remains the driving factor in its effort to meet all regulatory requirements in certifying the 737 MAX 7. And US Air Taxi startup Joby has applied to Japan's transport ministry for aircraft certification as it prepares to launch its urban transportation services. Joby is backed by Japanese automaker Toyota. It's already received certification from the US Federal Aviation Administration allowing it to begin commercial air taxi operations with conventional aircraft. Our brand Tazzy, yesterday asked LinkedIn co-founder and Joby investor Reed Hoffman to give his thoughts on that company. I'm looking forward to being able to ride in one. We're still in a place where it's only test pilots but they're super quiet and they're super safe. So the goal is there to create an uber for the skies? Yes, exactly. It's still early days.

And most importantly, I learned from Oscar Munoz they're not helicopters. All right. Hard turn here. American security experts expect Russian hackers to attack voting systems and stir up trouble in the final days before the midterm elections on November 8th. Y'all find it seem calm. This Rick Newman is here for more Rick. Interesting story you're working here. Yeah. And my point is that Vladimir Putin, the president of Russia, he is already interfering in the US election and it's not in the familiar ways as much that we saw in 2016 and 2020 with this information on social media. It's through inflation. What is the biggest issue for voters right now? It is the economy in its inflation. Now in the beginning of the year, shortly after Russian invaded Ukraine, Biden, President Biden used this phrase, the Putin price hike to explain away rising oil and gasoline prices. And that wasn't really the case at the time. But we now have a different kind of inflation. It is not oil and gasoline prices anymore. I'm going to isolate two things here. It's food and it's natural gas. People do not see the price of natural gas the way they see the price of gasoline. But we've got soaring natural gas prices all around the world. That is because of the Russian war in Ukraine and the energy war that goes along with that. That is raising prices here, not by as much as it is in Europe, but they are going up. We're going to feel that. That passes through to food prices because natural gas produces electricity. You need electricity to process food. There are other factors pushing up food prices that go back to the Russian war in Ukraine and sanctions related to that. So all of this, these are all major factors that are keeping inflation high in the United States, still 8.2 percent. And this is President Biden's principal problem right now. And so for the oil reserves that are slated to be released, how does that kind of play and factor into the Biden administration's strategy at least at this point? So let's talk about oil for a second. So oil prices right now, last I looked, US oil, $8, around $84 a barrel. That is lower than the price before Russia invaded Ukraine on February 24th. So oil markets have normalized. Gas prices have not come down all the way to where they were before February 24th, but they're getting pretty close. And that market has stabilized. And President Biden did release oil from the strategic reserve. That's a small part of it. The biggest reason the oil market has stabilized is we have a global slowdown, especially in China. And so oil has just come down in a way we should be happy about that. The inflation story has since shifted. And it's over to these other things. I mean, food inflation, latest numbers are 13 percent year over year. That is a big ask for a lot of people. Food is 12 percent of the typical households budget, gasoline, only 3 percent. So it's harder to absorb food inflation. And that food inflation looks pretty persistent at this point. It's going to be hard to get that down. So bring it back around to politics for a second, because the proxy for President Biden's polling, for example, and Tiden with the midterms as well, has been the gasoline price. Because it's that one sticker price. It's easy to see food while everybody feels it. You don't have that one sort of thing that's symbolic of it. So how is this going to play as gasoline comes down and food continues to be up? So you're right. So there has been a fairly direct correlation between gas prices and President Biden's approval rating. So gas prices go up. Biden's approval goes down and vice versa. So that was all improving for Biden. The Democrats had momentum as gas prices were coming down sharply. But food inflation started to go up. And I think most people don't look at the CPI numbers in a spreadsheet, the way I do, every time the numbers come out. But people know when stuff gets more expensive. And they know that their paycheck is not going up by the same amount as expenses. And there's going to be another shot coming. People are just starting to see this. And utility bills this summer because natural gas, which is the main way we generate electricity, that is higher than it was this time last year. And that is going to mean higher heating and electricity prices over the summer. So people know they know something's wrong and they're right about that. So the midterm elections are a reference.",https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1iVTbuGfqnQ,56,2022-10-18 17:56:33

So, you know, the midterm elections are a referendum on the president and his party and normally the president's party does lose seats in Congress and does look like that's what's going to happen here. Yeah, I'll finance his own Rick Newman. Thanks for tracking this source. Appreciate it. You guys coming up target, getting an upgrade from Jeff Freeze. We're going to speak with the analyst behind the call. Next. We'll watch you shares of TGT, Target or Tarje. Today after the company got an upgrade to buy from hold from Jeff Freeze saying headwinds for the retailer are mostly near-term problems. Every senior research analyst Corey Loew joins us now. There's so much inventory that has flooded the store ahead of the holiday season. How are they going to be able to work through that? Sure. So there are three key pillars to our upgrade today. The first one is inventory as you mentioned. Second one is margins and the third one is valuation. I'll start with inventory because that seems to be the most topical subject today. On inventory, our proprietary work illustrates that the headwinds, the target and other retailers face might not be as bad as what people think. And why do I say this? Well, we've done some really differentiated work on this topic. So we looked at inventory cycles over the last two decades. And what did we find out that when analyzing inventory growth and sales growth and profit growth throughout the last two decades, when inventory growth peaks, you tend to see a trough or a bottoming in sales and growth profit growth about five quarters after inventory growth.",https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1iVTbuGfqnQ,57,2022-10-18 18:00:42
3571," of peaks. You tend to see a trough or a bottoming in sales and growth growth profit growth about five quarters after inventory growth peaks. And what are we seeing right now? Well, most of the retail coverage that I focus on is continuing to go like this. But for target in the last quarter, we saw an inflection, right? Where we saw a peaking in inventory growth. So what does that mean? At some point between now and five quarters from now, you're going to see a bottoming in sales and growth profit growth and inflection in the stock. And after talking with the company, target only has a couple hundred million dollars of excess warm weather appell in inventory. And you see this in our note today, we publish pictures of this in our store checks. And this is already in the guide that's already been reduced. Earningers of visions are now down. I believe close to 40% in the last nine months. And the balance of the inventory should improve meaningfully from here and skew much more towards consumables, which is still 45% of target's business. So that helps to add a substantial layer of defensibility for this business. And what are frankly, as the CEO called it yesterday, unusual economic times. And he even cited that he's seeing some healthy spending trends despite the atypical environment in which we're in. I'm glad you mentioned Brian Cranel because he made those comments here on Yowl Finance at an all market summit. And I really enjoy talking to him. But Corey, take a listen to this, because I asked Brian about the inventory challenges they are having. Here's what he told us. You know, back in June, we made a pretty bold and decisive decision. We said, all right, inventory is the built up. Consumer shopping habits have changed. They moved into different categories. And we said we're going to get out in front of this. So for target, we put in that inventory problem behind us. And now we can focus on great execution, delighting our guests, getting ready for the big holiday season. So we were pretty decisive and said, we're not going to just let this roll into the next quarter. We'll deal with it upfront. And now we're excited that we're ready to play for the holiday season. So Corey, it's not just target. I hear what you're saying on target. And it sounds like just my vibe talking to Brian that they are working through this inventory. Maybe an issue that is going in the rear view mirror for them. But what about the broader industry? I mean, Walmart exited that second quarter with a lot of other inventory. Department stores high levels of inventory. I mean, how big a problem is this going to be for the retail universe at large this holiday season? It's likely going to be pretty significant in categories that are more discretionary in nature. And that's part of the reason that we are a little bit hesitant on certain discretionary retailers. But target, frankly, is one where we see a lot of opportunity. And why? Well, let's take a look at the margin. For example, in that clip that you just showed, Brian Cornell talked about how they had cleared a lot of inventory in the second quarter. The business drove close to a 1% EBIT margin in the second quarter, which is rather uncharacteristic for a business that drives typically an EBIT margin over the last decade, close to 7%. So clearly, the last quarter was an aberration. And a lot of these self-inflicted or COVID-induced wounds are likely to lead to probably a subdued margin this year from an EBIT perspective. So probably around 4% to 5%. But as we looked to next year, we think that a 6% or more margin would probably be reasonable. And I don't think that the street is quite get focused on that, particularly given the near-term hurdles that exist as a result of elevated inventory in the environment that you point out in holiday. But on holiday, what I would say is that we've heard from several retailers now that consumers are, while they're being more intentional, are still spending on holiday. So I was at a conference a few weeks ago. The CEO of Walmart, U.S., had cited a strong tailgate season, a strong back-to-school season. And then just a few weeks ago, the CEO of Costco had even, or CFO, excuse me, had mentioned that he seemed sort of strong momentum in Christmas and Halloween inventory that has already hit the stores. So I think that that does, despite the elevated inventory environment that we're in, owed quite well for the holiday season ahead. Hey, Corey, it wasn't just a target that you are looking at here. You upgrade.",https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1iVTbuGfqnQ,58,2022-10-18 18:05:14
3572," Despite the elevated inventory environment that we're in, both quite well for the holiday season ahead. Hey, Corey, it wasn't just a target that you are looking at here. You upgraded target, but you still like Walmart also. And so it sounds like you don't think there's going to be a zero sum situation here. Do you think Walmart is also going to be okay on the inventory front? And also, it sounds like you think they'll benefit from the, from people maybe trading down and trying to save money a little bit? Absolutely. So part of the reason that we do like Walmart is that it's a value leader and it benefits from a trade down. But beyond that, we took this a step further and we said, okay, if it's going to benefit from a trade down, how much do we see it benefiting over the next 12 to 24 months? And the reality is that we think that when we went through a really highly differentiated and unique analysis that we think Walmart can drive over 100 basis points to its same store sales as a result of trade down in grocery and that could drive upside to consensus comp numbers. Not only this year, but next year too. And our estimates are above consensus this year and next year by over 3%. There's upside devaluation. This business is trading at 19 times to your forward earnings versus historical average of 22 times. So it's trading at a three turn discounted historical average. And that range is typically about 17 to 27 times. So it's actually trading even toward the lower end of that range, which means that there's plenty of upside from not only a numbers perspective, but evaluations perspective as well. Corey, thanks for joining us. Good to talk to you. Corey Tarlos, Jeffrey Senior Research Analyst, talking to us about the retailers today. Appreciate it. Thanks so much. Have a great day. You too. All right, let's talk about some other movers that we're watching today. One of them is Colgate-Pamala of CBC reporting that Dan Loeb's third point has built a stake in the company. And we should mention we're not, Yagyu Finance did reach out to third point for comment. We've not yet heard back at this point. The shares are trading higher by 3.4%. And the reporting over there talks about that maybe there should be a break up of Colgate, or at least it's been off of some of the businesses. The pet nutrition, Hills Pet Nutrition is one of their divisions there. You're looking at me skeptically. I can see you processing. Processing. I dig this potential call by Dan Loeb. Why are they selling pet nutrition next to my toothpaste in the same way? Why does it have to be together? Does that make any sense anymore? Do you use the same ingredients in toothpaste as you do in making pet products? I'm guessing no. But don't they keep the operation separate in how they're producing those products too? So hopefully there's not the usual ingredients that are going into your toothpaste versus the pet food. But we know that you would be willing to try. I just wanted to get you to come up. All right, done deal. So does he got to say these good things? All right, switching gears from pet food to cars. We're also watching shares of Tesla after City. Reiterated, it's celebrating on the EV Maker, saying the update in Q3 has not completely addressed macro concerns. This calls a little bit all over the map because the analyst here at Tei, McAlley, we often said his work, celebrating, but he's saying the stock could rise coming out of this quarter if Tesla reports any upside related to EPS or auto delivery. So kind of talking out of both sides here. Yeah, I mean, even if we think about what Tesla has put out thus far and how they're going to continue to run into in China, especially a region where there is more of the appetite from the consumer to actually go towards some of the homegrown brands. And I think that's something not just across automobiles and vehicles. It's actually something that we've seen already referenced from our company in Nike as well. An analyst that cover some of the athlete's space, of course, largely different purchase, but still the consumer sentiment or at least that propensity that still remains. And so with that type of trend that we're seeing right now, what does that spell out for? Not just the Tesla Shanghai production, but also where they see future demand continuing to come into. Yeah, and Tesla reports after the close of trading tomorrow, analysts looking for a bucko too in terms of earnings per share. We're going to be paying attention to the outlook, of course, as well, and see, you know, we tend to get some pretty big swings in Tesla shares after the numbers. So we'll be watching that closely. Absolutely. Also watching closely here today shares of Carvana, they are moving on the day up by about 2% will round that off to after WEDBUSH downgraded the stock to neutral from outperform and slash their price target from $50.",https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1iVTbuGfqnQ,59,2022-10-18 18:09:39
3573," Moving on the day up by about 2% will round that off to after WEDBUSH downgraded the stock to neutral from outperform and slash their price target from $50 to $15 here. Now in the use car landscape, of course there is this massive shift of and the inventory concerns particularly because even at the prices that use cars had skyrocketed up to, it's a larger question of where consumers are starting to push back on some of those prices and where Carvana, CarMax, where they'll actually be able to move some of that inventory off the lots that they've paid so much to be able to bring on as well. That $50 price target, wow, that stock has come way down. From a consumer standpoint, I bought two cars off Carvana. I think the consumer experience is very, very impressive. But of course, you have to separate the consumer experience from the financials and I understand this downgrad makes a lot of sense. We've seen used car prices start to roll over, consumer spending under pressure here a little bit, so I get it. Yeah, makes sense. All right, Roblox shares have been on fire to kick off this week, but is it time to go long and strong? Okay, Cowan's Leonan list on the Metaverse plays, play Stops by Max. Bulls join Team Battle just the right moment l.... l.. l............ Shares of Roblox are still seeing a lot of interest on Yahoo Finance. After the gaming company got a boost yesterday from a September metrics report showing daily active users grew 23% year-over-year. Cowen, senior analyst Doug Croix joins us now to discuss. Doug, good to see you here. Is that move overdone in your view? Yeah, it was a bit aggressive. The September numbers were fine. We now know that their bookings for Q3 are going to come in slightly ahead of cell-side consensus and basically align for our numbers were, which is good. They've now returned to your growth after a few quarters where that wasn't the case. They had tough comps. I think there were two things going on yesterday. One is that there had been chatter we've been hearing that mobile gaming spending overall might have slowed down in September. That certainly didn't seem to be the case in their numbers, so that may have surprised people a bit. Also, I don't think it was widely understood that the KPIs were actually going to be reported yesterday. So, people who were short the stock may not have realized that data was coming out on the Monday morning and got caught on by surprise.",https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1iVTbuGfqnQ,60,2022-10-18 18:13:50

Yeah, and if there's one thesis that underlies sort of my entire approach to covering stocks, it's that content is game. And if you want to be a great platform, you're going to need great content. I think right now they have some great content for kids, but not for adults. And ultimately solving that problem is probably going to be very difficult. That is why my kids are on it, and I am not. Cowling Senior Headless Doug Gray, thanks so much, appreciate it. Thank you. Well, coming up, Walmart is stepping into the content creator space. We have the details on that. Walmart. Walmart, making a play for the Gen Z crowd with a new platform called Walmart Creator, a creator. Influencers can now let followers shop what they wear, talk and promote directly through their profiles or pages. I can find this is Berk De Palma here with the details. And hey, Brooke, it seems like Walmart's a little bit late to this, right? This is something other shopping sites have tried to. I'm just still trying to wrap my head around like Walmart being a fashion leader here. So tell us about this program. Julie, you might be surprised that a lot of influencers are currently sharing Walmart creative, one of the most popular fashion brands, including Scoop, Guilty as Charge. I actually own one of their sweaters, but this new Walmart creator platform is actually currently a beta version. It's going to launch fully in 2023 now, curators or creators rather can sign up for the platform, share these product links onto their social media pages like Instagram, Facebook, TikTok, of course, potentially be real here or a group of their choice. Now the platform will also create recommendations based upon these creators' interests. And they'll then be able to track how these recommendations do, how they perform, how their followers click the links and then buy the products from Walmart. And of course, from there, that's when the creators will earn commission, but they can also apply to be part of their upcoming brand campaigns out of Walmart. Now some of the influencers that they're getting on board here to start include Devon on Dak. He has a three P However,",https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1iVTbuGfqnQ,61,2022-10-18 18:21:17
3575," But they can also apply to be part of their upcoming brand campaigns out Walmart. Now some of the influencers that they're getting on board here to start include Devon on Dak. He has 3.8 million followers on Tik Tokies, a fashion influencer and also a more older crowd here. Cooking with Darrell is a dad that rose to fame during the pandemic for his quick family style recipes. He has 2.7 million followers. But Julie the catch here, they're really looking to let everyone monetize not just influencers that you think of who have millions and millions of followers. Break this down further for me for an old person such as myself. So if I go on to the platform, I see Joey the body builder. I'm like, wow, that person has an amazing physique. I want to buy a 40 pound tub of weight protein. Does it extend to food or is this just a peril? Well according to cooking with Darrell, he just posted a video on Tik Tok and he seems like he's going to be posting different products. Of course, Brian, this is currently in a beta version. So I think Walmart really experimenting here, what people will be interested. It seems like it's going to be a whole foray of different offerings. One thing to note here is that Walmart is saying that there's no cap on just how much money creators can earn here. Walmart, spokesperson confirming an achievement that we don't share commission percentages for our creative partners. But also here, one of their biggest competitors, Amazon, of course, doing that. You can buy anything that Amazon influencers program creators recommend from that protein powder or you know, iron, potentially. But one thing to note is that according to Amazon, these influencers can earn 2%, 10% up to 20% for their recommendation that 20% being for Amazon games. So there is a fixed commission income for Amazon there. Of course, Amazon came in earlier to the game here back in 2017. They also recently launched Amazon live. They also recently launched that in India as well. They also saw others like like to know it, get into the space, will work style those as some of their early comers. But lots of opportunity to grow. This is expected to reach $1.45 billion by 2028. But to answer your question, Brian, for the entire influencer space, they're really recommending all different products. So I think Walmart really looking to get a slice of that here as well. All right. Time for me to start serving more loops on the ground. I'm going to do better than my goose bumps t-shirts.

3576," electronic Good as time for credit for time. Two stories today. One minute each we start with this meta platforms is unwinding its 2020 purchase of the animated image platform Giffy after British regulators blocked the deal on concerns that meta could deny or limit competitors access to Giffy's Gifts or Giffy's Gifts whichever way you're pronouncing it at home. I say Giffy and I say Gifts. I'm never posted a Giffy on Facebook. Have you guys on Facebook? No. Mostly on Twitter. Are we even on? On Slack. If they took the Gifts away from Slack. Yes. That would be a profound decrease in my well-being at work. That's true. We have great ones in our live during Christmas. I don't ran that deep. If meta did take it over and then blocked it from Slack or charged too much in Slack, I'd just stop using them. I'm thankful that the British authorities have done this if that would be the outcome. This was a really early pandemic deal. I remember what March of 2020 we had heard some of the deal making really start to bubble up and this really kicked off. Where tech companies would look at these opportunities, go after some of these smaller, privately held companies and just seeing kind of good valuations that they could ultimately be able to capitalize on. All right. We didn't have a chance to discuss this one yesterday. Yay. Kanye. That is, says he's purchasing the controversial social media platform Parlor. It has a reputation for being favored by right-wing extremists. Yay, in a release by Parlor said, conservatives have to make sure they have the right to freely express themselves. Of course, Kanye over the weekend was expressing quite a bit of anti-semitism and that's something that's on that platform. So I don't even know what to say about this. I mean, a lot of different businesses are cutting their ties with him. And he's aligning himself more closely with extremism, it seems. No pun here. And the next sure drop is really Adidas severed ties with him. Right. They're reviewing that relationship, right? But it would be a big blow, of course, to Adidas. Big blow to him financially. I'm surprised that it has taken Adidas this long to step up and do something. I think in what we've seen from Yay and the activity and what has clearly been extremely shortsighted, Tarnas says reputation from what hasn't been Tarnas to this point, he's going to quickly discover that freedom of expression is not the same as extremism. That takes place and emanates and continues to boil over on platforms like Parlor. Yeah. Well, I don't know if you will get that message. We'll see what happens. All right, we've got stocks that are still remaining in rally territory today and coming up, Akiko Pajita and Prosti remaining are going to rev up the EV discussion with the CEO of Roll Royce.

Kiko, I have to start out by saying it's really been a mixed bag for financials as they've been reporting their results. On one hand, the banking industry is still doing just fine compared to what analysts are expecting to see from some other sectors that are set to report in the coming weeks. It's really just the year over year comparisons that have been really tough after an incredibly lucrative 2021. And they're still meeting analyst expectations for the most part. But on the other hand, we are seeing big profits taking a huge hit, driven primarily by two things, lower deal-making activity that is really putting a dent in investment, banking revenues, and them setting a sign funds for potential loan losses, which is also weighing on their profits as they expect to the possibility of an economic recession.",https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1iVTbuGfqnQ,64,2022-10-18 18:34:51
3578," and them setting a sign funds for potential loan losses, which is also weighing on their profits as they expect to the possibility of an economic recession. But there are a few, of course, that have held up better than others. Goldman Sachs yet again was a standout today, beating on all fronts, coming in far better than Wall Street had expected. Profit was down 43%, but that was partially offset by an 11% jump in trading activity, led by fixed income trading specifically. So again, the expectations were low and this was very much a better than feared situation with the big banks. Bank of America also posted a drop in profits year over year. However, it did see an earnings per share beat compared to what Wall Street was expecting, also benefiting from better than expected trading revenues. So those are kind of the winners as you put it. The biggest loser. Well, one more winner we have, JP Morgan actually saw a drop in quarterly net income, but openheimer analyst said it was a blowout quarter saying that blowout would be an understatement because analysts were really preparing for the worst when it came to this. But then you look at city group profit fell 25%. Revenue however rose 6% again at beat Wall Street estimates. Morgan Stanley was the only bank that really disappointed Wall Street, missing expectations and reporting profit that fell 29%. So that was one of the banks that saw much more challenging quarter compared to its peers. Okay, Alexander Seminovo with a roundup for us. Thanks so much for that. Joining us now for a deeper dive on the financial sector. Let's bring in Devin Ryan at JMP Securities Director of Financial Technology Research. Devin, good to talk to you today. We're going to get to the restructuring on Goldman in just a bit. But let's talk about the roundup of the banks. As Alexander just highlighted, we did see a big drop in profits when you look at the year on your comparison. A lot of these banks beat expectations, but it certainly didn't really vote well when you look at the outlook here. You think about the concerns in terms of loan defaults, loan loss reserves increasing as well. I mean, what did you take away from these results in terms of the economic picture to come? Sure, well, I think it's just it's a complicated environment, right? The macro backdrop has been complicated all year. And even as we're about ready to exit 2022, there's still a lot of uncertainty. So we haven't really made a lot of progress on that front. So banks kind of being one proxy for the outlook of the economy. There's obviously a wind dispersion of expectations. That being said, what we're actually seeing as a result is pretty encouraging, at least as of now, really no credit issues, higher interest rates are driving a guy in tire for net interest income for the most part. And then as you guys talked about, investment banking is very weak off of what was by far record 2021. On the other side, trading is helping offset that. So it's just showing that these are business models that are pretty resilient. The bar was low into earnings, but the macro outlook is still uncertain. And so that's why we think we've been arguing we're kind of in this range bound trading where we got a little bit oversold. People were a little bit too negative. Now you're seeing a balance off of that, but until there's more certainty and stability, it's going to be hard to have really sustained recovery in the stocks. Let's talk about the other big announcement, getting a lot of attention here. Goldman Sachs essentially confirming these reports that came out of multiple media outlets, including the Wall Street Journal that they are in fact restructuring here, going from four divisions to three. There's a number of things to highlight, the consumer business and wealth management merging with asset management, also investment banking and trading now being placed under one unit. What do you think this says about where the bank is headed? Someone argue, well, there was this big focus back in 2020 about the consumer side of things. Is there a pivot that's happening? Yeah, I think this is more of a reorganization around the edges. This isn't some major shift in strategy or major pivot. On the consumer side, they're listening to the market. There's a lot of press out there that it's not a profitable business today. It's growing at a pretty strong pace. Your consumer revenues are up 95% year-to-year, but it's a business that I think is still spending a lot of money to expand. I think they're pulling back a little bit on that growth investment. Things are getting a little bit more specific.",https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1iVTbuGfqnQ,65,2022-10-18 18:38:35
3579, is still you're spending a lot of money to to expand. And so I think they're pulling back a little bit on that growth investment since they're getting a little bit more you know a little bit more specific around how they acquire customers and you want to do it in a more profitable way. So those are where some of the changes are you know the reorganization of the business units to me is more just you know getting a little bit more organized around how they report how a management structure don't really see a major strategic shift there but ultimately you know maybe that drives a little bit more efficiency in the business model but ultimately you know Goldman is it's the same business they've gained a lot of market share on the institutional side and we don't think they're pulling back dramatically on consumer I think they just want to be a little more tailored and be able to more focus on profitability there. Yeah I mean it's not not a dramatic scaling back as you say on the consumer side of things having said that it's taken a while for that to be a big driver do you anticipate that that will ultimately take hold or are we just sort of talking about through the traditional revenue drivers remaining in place for the bank. Yeah so I mean Goldman's a little bit of victim of their own success they've had so much success on the institutional side and those revenues have grown more than I think most people predicted a few years ago that you look at the growth in consumer and say well it's still relatively immaterial they're generating over two billion dollars in consumer revenue so it's not a small business if you took it out and put it on a standalone versus any other digital bank or or you know new consumer startup so we do think if something is going to take hold you know Goldman's not managing the business for you know the next credit cycle or the next you two years they're managing for the next 20 years or even 100 years and so when we think about you know getting into an entirely new business line that is a huge addressable market it's going to take time and you know they're they're just listening I think to market feedback and pushback that hey you need to get this business into a better profitability picture before you continue to add new lines to it and so that's really kind of what this is but we're still pretty constructive on what consumer can be in the long term and think they'll continue to feed growth there just be a little bit more tactical around how they do that specifically on Goldman Sachs you've got a price target of $470 a share and outperform rating there how do you think it stacks up against some of the other banks that have reported in the anticipation of some kind of economic downturn yeah Goldman historically has always gained market share coming out of economic downturn so in that very moment of market stress you know it could be challenging for them as it is for everyone but they are so good on risk management and when others essentially get out over their skis and take too much risk Goldman Sachs is able to really gain market share take clients and and that's what we think what happened again to the extent the economy does roll over so again you're not cheering on a downturn but ultimately Goldman Sachs is going to be better positioned in our opinion and so when you're buying the stock at just over book value book value is $300 to $8 for them right now that's a pretty good risk reward long term for investors to be patient they're generating returns on equity north of 10% even in this really difficult environment that relationship has always helped investors in our opinion make money when that ROE and book value are correlated like that so we think this is a pretty good entry point for investors that have a little bit of patience and a little bit of a long term but orientation Devon Ryan JMP Securities Director of Financial Technology Research good to have you on today appreciate the time well take a look at chairs of Salesforce seeing a big pop on reports that activist investor starboard value is taking a stake in the company and you see that stock up about 4.5% founder Jeff Smith telling CNBC his fund is taking a significant position in the software maker although he didn't specify the amount now Smith added that the company is not generating meaningful operating leverage relative to its peers and that subpar mix of growth and profitability has contributed to a significant discount in valuation shares of Salesforce by the way down more than 40% so far this year coming up a flash of luxury rolls Royce unveils its first electric vehicle we're gonna speak with a group CEO you certainly don't want to miss that also ahead reports suggest the Biden administration is looking to dip,https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1iVTbuGfqnQ,66,2022-10-18 18:42:51
3580," Three Rolls Royce unveils its first electric vehicle. We're going to speak with a group CEO. You certainly don't want to miss that. Also ahead, reports suggest the Biden administration is looking to dip into the strategic petroleum reserve yet again. Are the moves justified? We'll discuss on the other side. We'll turn it on to oil markets. The White House is reportedly weighing additional sales from its strategic petroleum reserve to help tamp down fuel prices before the midterms. Let's bring in Yahoo Finance, this Jared Blick, who's tracking the very latest for us. Jared, I'm looking at oil prices under significant pressure today. We're going to tap into the reserves again because we expect the prices to go up. That was a controversial decision. OPEC plus increasing, it's a production facility by 2 million barrels per day. Very much unexpected. A lot of people thought that was just a blatant shot off the bow toward the U.S. But take a look at crude oil, we see it's down 3.5% today. Take a look at a year-to-day chart. You can still see a bit elevated, but it has been in a steady downtrend since the middle of the year. Now the strategic petroleum reserve of the U.S., let me put it to your chart so I can show you. It was standing at about 630 million barrels. That was as of mid last year, so we can just draw a line up. Then we started tapping it and then we got down to about, let's say, 400 million and change here. What happened, obviously, since the SPR was being tapped, we did see a tremendous rise in prices not only in crude oil, but also our Bob Gasoline futures. But guess what was happening in the meantime? We had the Russia Ukraine conflict, which nobody really anticipated. We also had a massive repricing of risk with respect to the Federal Reserve. And after that became apparent, we've...",https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1iVTbuGfqnQ,67,2022-10-18 18:47:08
3581," We had the Russia Ukraine conflict, which nobody really anticipated. We also had a massive repricing of risk with respect to the Federal Reserve. And after that became apparent, we finally saw prices peak about mid-year here and start to come down. You take a look at our Bob Gasoline futures, which closely tracked the price of gasoline at the pump. Very similar story. So the SPR, when it was tapped mid-last year, didn't have an immediate effect, but we did talk with Ed Morse over at cities, head of commodities there. And he said the administration gets high marks for controlling the price of gasoline, actually the supplies online. But in terms of price controls, not so much. And here's what he had to say. The history of trying to put a price cap on is not very good. And it's kind of ironic that they're doing this at a time when the producers look at them and say, hey, they're putting on a price cap. We're trying to put a floor under prices. They don't like that. Why should we like them putting a price cap on Russia when they could do the same thing to us if this kind of thing works? So it has mixed grades, I think. And imperfect mechanism of Kiko, so that's how we see it. Okay. Something to watch, especially when you consider the reserves are so low. Yes. Already that they'll have to refill it pretty quickly. And buy a third already. Yeah. Number to watch there. Thanks so much for that, Jared. Well, Rolls Royce is unveiling this spectre, the luxury car makers. The first fully electric vehicle, the two door sedan marks a BMW subsidiary Rolls Royces appeal to upmarket EV buyers. Joining us now is Torsten Mueller, Otfos, Rolls Royce CEO, also with us is Prada Supermanian. Of course, Yahoo Finance car reporter. We should point out the segment presented to you by BMW, which owns Rolls Royce. Great to have you on today. Certainly a big day. You're taking the wraps off of the big EV here. Question to you here. We have seen this market get increasingly crowded, but you are competing in the ultra luxury space. What's the demand for EVs look like there? I mean, so far I can tell you, first of all, good morning. It's great. And this is a historic day here. We are launching first of all the very first electric Rolls Royce. We are the very first loans rightly so, as you said a minute ago, to be in that ultra luxury segment the very first offering an electric car. And for that reason, we are very much looking forward to it. And so far, order entry is already really great and very pleasing. And it's not only the United States, but it's all over the world. And I think we are working on electrifying the brand already for quite a while. We are experimenting with it since 10 years. And quiz our clients worldwide on what their requirements would be. So I foresee a very good future also in the ultra high luxury segment. And for us, allow me to say that electric propulsion fits perfect to the brand. It's quiet, silent, very talky, delivers worthability. And also interesting story goes back to what one of our founding fathers said in 1900, Charles Rolls made a prophecy and said, the perfect propulsion for cars is electric. Once charging is fixed. And I think now we are here fulfilling his prophecy. Hey, Torres St. Prysor, good to see you again. I had a question about sort of the engineering challenge is making a Rolls Royce into an EV. I know you say that it's a Rolls Royce first and an EV second. What kind of challenge did you guys face having to make this sort of a peel to your audience? Good point, pros. I think as I said already, we started looking into it over 10 years ago, when we launched that experimental Phantom 102 X. And we put quite a lot of clients worldwide behind the wheel. And one finding was fits perfect to the brand, but charging time and also range needs to be fully sufficient. So for that reason, that took us a while because one thing was also clear, don't compromise the Rolls Royce experience. And all that in combination challenged our engineers, as you can imagine, because it was clear, it needed to be magic carpet ride. It was clear that it needed to carry sufficient range. And we are offering now 520 kilometers, we are in a 20 miles range. And I think that is very sufficient and definitely on what our clients expect in that segment to happen. And for that reason, I think we got here.",https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1iVTbuGfqnQ,68,2022-10-18 18:51:39
3582," Myles range and I think that is very sufficient and definitely on what our clients expect in that segment to happen. And for that reason, I think we got here, but the challenge was on our hands and we are not yet completely finished. The car is still in the testing worldwide and the testing ends end of June next year. And then first deliveries will be done by end of next year when first clients also in the United States market take delivery of their specter. Hey Torchins, so you guys are like you mentioned the cars when they come out end of next year. Have you guys faced any issues with part shortages, components, or just things like that, which you need to kind of kind of put in the place before this cars are delivered? I mean, we are working here closely together also with the BMW group in terms of let's say some technical laundry components we have invited quite a lot of clients already over here to Goodwood to see specter and they were all highly fascinated by what they have seen. Many of them placed already orders and deposits. So for that reason, I think that's good. We also see the car now more often in the markets. We will bring it also to the United States before so that clients can see it real in front of them. So I think we're going to shorten that or we're going to make waiting fund for specter. That's for sure. Torchins, I wonder where you think we are in this transition to EVs and I'm not just talking about the ultra luxury space when you look at where market share is globally. It's just over 10% in terms of where EV stand in the broader auto market here in the US is just at 5%. Are we at a tipping point or is it going to take a little more whether that is higher oil prices or higher gas prices or a little more accessibility in the cars to get to full acceleration in this transition, which a lot of governments hope will be 100% EVs. Now, I mean, first of all, we are not really in the car business. Sounds funny now. We are in the luxury goods business. Nobody needs us to come from A to B. All our clients have multiple cars in their garage. So I think this is here different. It is that you are seen for the very first time completely emission free in a luxury rolls, Royce. And I think that's a statement statement quite a lot of our clients would like to make for that reason. I definitely foresee not only specter being excess in the market, but also our force going strategy to say by the end of 2030. The entire brand rose rose motor cars is fully electrified. So all new rose voices in the next years to come are fully electrified. Hey, Torson. That's clear. And. Sorry about that. Hey, Torson. In the last time we spoke at the end of the summer, we talked about how there was insatiable demand for luxury cars. You mentioned the specter being at the highest in the luxury EVs. Does that still exist now? Are we still seeing any kind of hesitation as a global market uncertainty sort of builds up here? No, not at all. Pros and I remember our talk that evening at Pebble Beach, obviously. So no, not at all. I think we still have a very strong order intake worldwide. I think there is no reluctancy currently to invest and to indulge luxury. I think the entire luxury market, not only the car market, but also fashion, whatever runs pretty well currently worldwide. And I think that it's also due to the fact that there was quite some money accumulated in the Corona times. And for that reason, there is a new kind of understanding you better live now and don't postpone it to later. So people are prepared to still spend money, which is great. And I think that puts us here into work. We are employing here at Goodwood over 2000 people and they profit from the fact that the luxury business is allowing me to say booming. Okay. I know process waiting to take a test drive in that car, right? Yeah, always looking for a test drive. We got to make that happen. Terce and Mueller, odd post. It's always good to have you on this show. Really appreciate your time and our thanks to Pros supermanian as well.

That's right, Akiko. As you mentioned, beating on earnings and expectations and to that point of the job cuts really pointing out the fact that even a company as large as Johnson and Johnson not immune to the impacts of inflationary impacts there, we saw specifically growth in some segments, though specifically the pharmaceutical sector of business. And that was on its cancer drug, Darza La. That one specifically, you know, an interesting one as the company we know.",https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1iVTbuGfqnQ,70,2022-10-18 19:00:34
3584," you you you Steven today. We're really looking at across the board, industrial utilities, materials leading today's gains here, but still technology and health care holding on to some of those gains. I mentioned some of the outperformance that we're seeing today because of earnings. Let's take a look at some of these bank names. Goldman was out with the results before the bell this morning. They're up nearly 2%. We're really looking at gains across some of the largest banks here. JP Morgan nearly 2% Bank of America up 3% today. We're going to see some of the earnings here. We're looking at some of the earnings here. We're looking at some of the airlines with delta up just over 2% united. We'll be getting earnings from them after the bell this afternoon that stock up another 2% today and American leading the way there up just about 3%. Dave. Despite the warning starting now. Stay and strong aren't they very resilient? Let's get up speed now on the housing market where the carnage continues there. The latest homebuilder sentiment has been falling for the 10th straight month. It's now half of what it was just 6 months ago. The national association of homebuilders single family index falling 8 points to 38. That's the lowest level in more than a decade with the notable exception of those early days in the pandemic. Freddie Mac has the average Morgan rate on a 30 year fix. It's 6.92 and no doubt folks headed well above 7% in months ahead said NAHB chairman Jerry Comter quote seeing significantly weakening demand particularly for first time home buyers adding the situation is unsustainable. Regionally sentiment fell the steepest in the west where it's just 34. Also today mortgage bankers association with new numbers showing new home mortgage applications decrease more than 13% in September. More bad news. Richelle. Indeed, sharp declines they will. Let's now also get you up to speed on Netflix. We're seeing the stock under pressure here down about 1.8%.",https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1iVTbuGfqnQ,71,2022-10-18 19:04:27
3585," In September, more bad news. But, indeed, sharp declines there will now also get you up to speed on Netflix. We're seeing the stock under pressure here down about 1.8%, they're going to be reporting earnings after the bell today. They're expecting adjusted earnings per share of $2.22 on revenue of $7.85 billion. Also keeping an eye on that subscriber growth, which used to be the key metric that Netflix was judged by before, of course, the streaming sector got so crowded. That's expected to top 1 million. Netflix is still bullish, though, after they add tear announcement, which advertises a flock to. But we'll see if subscribers feel the same and investors as well in the following quarter when that shows up. Just under an hour to go until the closing bell, you're looking at gains across the board, Dallas and P&Nazdak, moving to the upside. Let's bring in Kathy Jones, a Charles Schwab, a chief fixed income strategist. Kathy, it's great to see you here. So on the equity side of things, we're looking at gains bond markets at least a 10-year, pretty much holding steady today right around 4%. What do you make of activity that we're seeing today and really what we've seen play out over the last several trading days? Yeah, I think the bond market, and to some extent probably the stock market kind of caught between this dynamic of worries about recession, but the idea that perhaps some of the worst is over. And so we've got still the prospect of fed tightening, which could slow the economy even more down the road. But we've seen some resilience in terms of consumer spending, and that has left us in this kind of volatile trading range. But I think as we get closer to the next Fed meeting, there'll be those renewed concerns about higher interest rates and what impact that has next into 2023 on the economy and on profit margins and just in general the outlook. Are the equity markets, Kathy, continuing to ponder when that pause comes and should at least stop? Yeah, well they were all pondering, right? So even talking about it's not so much a pivot, meaning a reversal or even a pause, but really with the pace that we've been concerned about. So the Fed has really ratcheted up rates so fast in this cycle on a rate of change basis, it's the fastest rate cycle we've had in modern history. And you know it takes 12 months, maybe sometimes 18 months for those rate hikes in that tightening to work its way through to the economy. So we're really just starting to see the impact. We think that means the Fed will slow down at some stage of the game. Probably 75 basis points at the November meeting, maybe 50 after that and then maybe starting to level off. And I think though the market is really caught in this kind of game of trying to figure out when that moment comes when there's a shift in Fed policy. And at this stage of the game it doesn't look like it's in the near term. So Kathy, how is that informing your investment strategy? If you have a short term horizon versus a longer one, as you were mentioning some of these 12 to 18 months that we might see this play out in the economy. Well we think that from the fixed income side, investors should be really looking at the opportunities that are there in fixed income. You know, we came into the year expecting rates to rise and we're short on the duration and now we think you should start extending, maybe gradually. But the fact is you can build a high quality portfolio right now with treasuries, investment grade, corporate bonds, municipal bonds with very attractive yields. We haven't seen in many, many years, 5, 6 percent yields. And that's pretty attractive, I think, for a base of a portfolio. And that is kind of the way investors should think about it over the long run, that over the short run, you start compounding 4 or 5 percent or 6 percent over 5 or 6 years. That's a pretty attractive proposition compared to potential volatility might see elsewhere at a portfolio. Kathy, we spoke to Gary Cohn yesterday, joined us for Yahoo Finance's All Market Summit and I asked him what he thought, what he thinks needs to happen in order for the Fed to get inflation under control. I want to play a quick bite with what he had to say. That labor cost has not come down and it's another area where the Fed is trying to get some response. They're trying to get businesses to not grow as fast. They're trying to get people, businesses to not hire as many people. We saw it even in the last month.",https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1iVTbuGfqnQ,72,2022-10-18 19:09:04
3586," They're trying to get businesses to not grow as fast. They're trying to get people, not to, this is not higher as many people. But we saw even in the last month's unemployment report, we saw a 3.5% unemployment. We still see non-farm payrolls growing. So the interest rate impact is not fed through to the business cycle yet. We're gonna have to see job destruction if we're really gonna see inflation be curtailed. Kathy, that job destruction, I wanna ask you about that. I know we just got your predictions in terms of what fed policy is going to be. But if we see even further weakening then maybe the fed is expecting to see in the jobs market, what does that mean then from a market's perspective? Yeah, and I would agree that what the Fed is waiting to see is the pace of wage growth slowed down. So it's running around 5% year over year right now. I think the comfort level for the Fed is 2 to 3%, which means we probably do need higher unemployment to reach that goal and slower job growth. But this is a very, very strange dynamic too. We saw 1.6 million people out of the labor force because of COVID and long COVID. And we just don't have the participation rate up. So I'm not sure that wages will fall as quickly as the Fed would like to see. And if that's the case and they keep raising rates hoping to see wages decline and see unemployment rise, well that's just going to squeeze the economy even more. And that's not likely to be good for risk assets. Kathy, you mentioned the lag and all the data that the Fed is using. Is there something you'd prefer an alternative gauge? And when do you think we'll actually see inflation cooling off? Well, we should see over the next couple of months the year over year pace of inflation come down because just looking at the rate of change versus last year that should come down. And we started to see softness, as you just mentioned in the housing market, that's going to feed through to lower rent down the road. But that takes a long time to work its way through. So and we've seen commodity prices come off. Despite all the predictions, OPEC plus, et cetera, energy prices have really not accelerated. They've been falling over the last couple of months. So all that suggests to me that we will start to see some of the inflation figures come down. But the wage component may be a lagging indicator this time. So that's really kind of the combination of things. If the Fed doesn't call me and ask my opinion, but I think they should slow down the pace, right, where we are. And take the cumulative impact of the tightening to date, the rate hikes and quantitative tightening, and let it cool off a minute, let it feed through, and see where we are. Otherwise, we could just have a damaging recession that doesn't really do anybody any good. And Kathy, for some of the stickier parts of inflation, like housing as well, how does that complicate the pitch and when you're really trying to navigate, how inflation is actually fairing right now? Yeah, it's really an interesting mix this time around because we've seen wholesale prices come down. We've seen producer prices. The rate of change come down. We've seen softness in certainly some of the other areas. But it complicates it because the Fed is no longer looking at their forecast because the forecast was wrong before. Now they're looking at current inflation data and that will lag the economy. So we're almost sort of manufacturing a recession or a downturn in order to get that inflation down. And the risk is it's more damaging than it needs to be to get inflation down. Well, Fed's certainly saying they'd rather do too much than too little. We have to see what that cost ends up being Kathy Jones. Thank you so much for joining us this afternoon. All right, well, we're just getting started here on Yahoo Finance Live.

3587," Milton Ny oczywiście Apple shares erasing gains on a report it's cutting production on the iPhone 14 Plus. Yahoo! It's tech editor Dan Howley here with those details. Hey Dan, what are we learning? Yeah, this is a report from the information talking about Apple cutting the production numbers for the iPhone 14 Plus. There was previous reports from Bloomberg that they were going to cut as many as 6 million units in the second half from the iPhone 14 family. So this could be that or it could be something additionally. I think really the big thing to look at here though is that it's not from the iPhone 14 Pro line and that's really what Apple was pushing consumers towards. They put all the new features, most of the new features into the iPhone 14 Pro line and so the kind of expectation is that average selling price for the iPhone will rise as a result of that. When you look at something like the iPhone 14 Plus and its price versus the 999 for the iPhone 14 Pro consumers may simply be saying look why would I spend money on the plus when I can get the pro with the better features for a slight increase in price. It's not fully certain if this is because of a broader slowdown in iPhone sales or it's just because consumers are looking for that pro device instead. And then sticking with the gadgets we know the Apple unveiled a new iPad today. What are the details on that and of course the price. Yeah, so they have two new iPads. They have the iPad Pro and then they have the basic iPad. The iPad Pro is going to start at 799. It's available October 26 and the big deal about this is that it's the first iPad to come with the M2 chip. That's Apple's in-house processor that they built previously. iPads were running on the M1. And so this is expected to provide a 15% speed increase over the M1 iPad and a 35% increase in graphics.",https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1iVTbuGfqnQ,74,2022-10-18 19:18:28
3588, M1 and so this is expected to provide a 15% speed increase over the M1 iPad and a 35% increase in graphics processing performance. There's also a new feature for the Apple pencil that if you hold the pencil or the stylus 12 millimeters above the screen you'll get a little notification showing where you're going to start writing or drawing so that could be helpful for people who sketch or take frequent notes. This is also going to come with iPad OS 16 so you'll get the ability to do things like multitask better on this and then there's also the ability to output to a 6K monitor. So really looking for multitasking on the iPad Pro there then there's the base iPad which also got some upgrades mostly to its price. It's 449 now. It was below that prior and it's now coming with the A14 Bionic chip. That's the chip that was not in the iPhone 13 but in the iPhone 12 the iPhone 13 had the A15 and now we're on the A16 for the iPhone 14. There's also a bigger display on it. It's got a new 10.9 inch display versus the 10.2 inch screen that was previously on there. That also means that the fingerprint sensor the home button is now gone. The fingerprint sensor will be built into the power button on the side so it's more of an edge-to-edge style display and it also gets USB-C instead of a lightning cable. That iPad is going to cost you 449 and then of course Apple just announced their new Apple TV 4K. That starts at 129 and it has an A15 chip in it. All right good stuff Dan Hally looking forward to that. Thank you. Shana? Amazon securing a victory in the latest a union vote. Ali Garfinkle is following in that story and has the details for us. Hally. Hi Shana great to see you so this was a decisive loss for the Amazon labor union. 206 votes for the union. 406 votes against the union and this is kind of coming in a moment where we've actually really seen some momentum gathering around organizing in Amazon. We saw a series of walkouts last week and a Southern California warehouse is recently petitioned for an election with the NLRB looking to be represented by the Amazon labor union. I spoke to a couple experts what they're saying is that right now they're expecting the Amazon labor union to turn its attention to SoCal and kind of move on from this loss in here in New York. All right Ali Garfinkle great stuff thanks so much for staying on that story for us. One more reason to steer clear of the mall on Black Friday. Amazon announcing it will add a streaming game on Prime Video the day after Thanksgiving starting next season. The teams will be announced in May with the NFL schedule release. Prime Video paying more than a billion dollars per season for Thursday night streaming rights in a deal that runs through 2033. Amazon's VP of Prime Video Sports Marie Donahue saying quote the fact that there were no NFL games on that day. We thought we could treat it like a Super Bowl. You can see Amazon shares there on your screen. This is interesting. It was kind of inevitable once those two linked up. The thoughts were that it would happen this season but there is World Cup this year. There's a lot of college football games this year. Just one more weekend that it takes total control of our calendar. Are you excited about this for Shell? I don't I mean it's at three o'clock so I guess I could like stumble out of bed and watch it out of my sort of food cover. It's interesting because she was saying Marie Donahue was saying that these discussions about Black Friday actually began when the original contract was being negotiated but obviously as you see these incredible results it's picked up steam. It's made people more interested in it. I would tune in on what should I mean we're all sort of sitting around anyway. Why not? Yeah and I just think it's so smart. It's going to be interesting to see what they do from an advertisement perspective right more eyeballs on prime people are going to be ready to shop if they're able to integrate that somehow make it easier for people to be shopping and watching the game at the same time that's going to be a home run for them. I think right now they're wishing they did it this year just given the expectations for Black Friday sales are not exactly expected to meet what we saw last year so it would have been a good opportunity if they could have gotten it on the schedule this year but I think it's very very smart for them. It's going to be interesting to see how they're able to marry the two the game and the shopping experience. I get the sense they're not going to do that just yet from listening to Marie Donahue talk. I expected to see some barcodes up on the screen in which we could shop but realizing it as I listen to her talk their audience was not me it was not you.,https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1iVTbuGfqnQ,75,2022-10-18 19:22:06
3589," listening to Marie Donnelly talk. I expected to see some bar codes up on the screen in which we could shop. But realizing as I listen to her talk, their audience was not me, it was not you. It was not the people that are gonna watch this game. Their audience is solely the NFL commissioner Roger Gidell and the 32 owners who just want to feel comfortable that streaming is no different than NBC, CBS, or ESPN, that the stream will stay out, that it looks good, that it sounds good. Make them comfortable. These are very conservative owners that want to see the future on streaming but don't want to see integrated fantasy stats or shopping or gambling. Just one day. Yeah. It is inevitable I agree with you, but we're not quite there. Well, we will see. I do think it's a very, very smart move though from Amazon. I agree with that. All right, coming up next as the US prepares for its next move following OPEC, a plus oil cuts. Our next guest explains how President Biden something keep a cap on oil prices. Stay tuned. Oil prices retreating today as the Biden administration reportedly plans to release 10 to 15 million barrels of oil from the strategic petroleum reserve. We're joining us now is Dan Dicker, the energy word founder, good to have you back on the show. So as we're seeing here, we see WTI down about 3% today, Brent down about 1.8%. What do you make of where the oil markets are right now and the sort of factors that are weighing the heaviest on them? Well, Richelle, the fundamental picture for oil couldn't be more bullish. And we could stay with you for a long time and tell you all the bullish factors that are in the market with Russia particularly and their troubles with Ukraine. But in the last three months, the Biden administration, along with the Federal Reserve, has done a lot to dampen.",https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1iVTbuGfqnQ,76,2022-10-18 19:26:52
3590," troubles with Ukraine. But in the last three months, the Biden administration, along with the Federal Reserve, has done a lot to dampen the prices of oil and gas lean, the Biden administration by using these SPR releases, and the Federal Reserve, obviously, with their rate hikes, which have dampened oil risk assets, and along with bringing the dollar a lot stronger, have basically said to traders, look, the United States wants gas prices to be low through the midterms, and they're going to take major steps to do that. And that has scared most traders out of their lawns. And we've seen lawns in the oil market disappearing since late July. And that continues despite the OPEC cut of 2 million barrels a day, it made for a very, very short-lived rally in the oil market. Very short-lived. And I love the words right. Joe Biden is the greatest oil trader that ever lived. Why then was it such a short-lived rally? And why are we seeing prices right back down? Is it the strategic petroleum reserve release? Again, it's been all of these factors that have been going into it. It's entirely my entire career in oil, where I have posited for decades now, that financial inputs into markets like oil can have a more significant effect than even the fundamentals can for at least a short period of time. And this is how powerful these financial sort of tricks are in the oil markets. We've seen oil prices moderate more than 40 percent from a high of over $120 under 80 before that OPEC announcement. And at least until these midterms are out of the way, the signals are to traders don't get long, get out of the way, and let the United States and the central banks, not just the Federal Reserve, but the European central banks, jawbone with financial instruments, these oil prices lower. In the end, it won't make a difference because there's a huge supply problem and oil prices will rebound to the upside and very strongly. But for a long time, you can make these inputs into the oil market and keep gas prices low. And we've seen they've been very, very successful. So, how long do you expect OPEC and OPEC plus to really stay the course? A lot of people were surprised about the production cuts. Obviously, we're seeing what's happening with Ukraine and Russia. A lot of people are saying, look, it seems as if OPEC and OPEC plus taking Russia's side, those sort of geopolitical dynamics, what does that mean for the longer outlook for oil prices? Yeah, and I think that this is, you know, you can see the frustration on the part of OPEC and the oil producers in the mid-ease to rely on oil revenues for everything. And they see a fundamental picture that should allow them to get $110, $120, $130 a barrel, but are getting only $80 a barrel. And that is frustrating and they know why it's happening and they're trying to fight back to gain control of their market space. But for right now, the Federal Reserve and Joe Biden do have control of this oil market, which is why I kind of made a joke about Joe Biden being the greatest oil trader I've ever seen. He released oil about 250 million barrels and basically sold it into the marketplace at $110, $115. And now he's looking to buy it back for $80. Now, that's a heck of a trade on 250 million barrels. That's about $10 billion in profit. He's going to make the United States. That's a pretty good trade. He's become a pretty good oil trader. There was a relevant joke. So the mid-terms are less than three weeks away. Are we going to see $100 barrel by the end of the year? I don't know if it's by the end of the year, of course, because the recession talk is so massive. And therefore, it does, you know, put a damper on risk assets. But we will see sometime in 23, my prediction, new highs above $120 a barrel. The fundamental picture on oil is as bullish as I've seen in the 40 years I've been following it. And in the end, fundamentals will out. You know, we will see those prices rise. Now, a lot of people are wondering, does this necessarily mean we're going to see some more relief at the pump ahead of the midterms? You know, that's one of the main reasons we're seeing this release from the SPF. Do you think that's going to be the case? Yeah, you're going to see prices. I mean...",https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1iVTbuGfqnQ,77,2022-10-18 19:30:46
3591," more relief at the pump ahead of the midterms. We know that that's one of the main reasons we're seeing this release from the SPF. Do you think that's going to be the case? Yeah, you're going to see prices. I mean, we've seen them basically moderate. A lot of people were screaming with their pants on fire when OPEC made that announcement for a two million barrel drop. The gas prices would immediately shoot back to $5. But, you know, we kind of knew that it was going to stay. It was an unsustainable rally. And so, you know, you're seeing what, $363.70 a gallon, I don't think you're going to see $4 in any, in any shape or form before the midterms. And if it does get close to that, a Biden will make another release of the SPR and chase more traders out of the market and drop prices. Because that is the prime directive right now for the Democrats to make sure that gas prices aren't what's, what mess up for them are possible success in the midterm elections. Sure, huge ramifications for the Democratic Party. Do you expect OPEC plus to have a counter move? That was the counter move, the two million barrels. And in fact, now that they've made that counter move, they will wait until after the midterms and see if the markets will start to respond to fundamentals. And if they don't respond to fundamentals, that won't be the last cut that they announce. And they will continue to cut prices until they feel they're going to get, you know, the fundamental price that they think they deserve, which is triple digits and above. That was my question. So post midterms, you could see a further cut from OPEC, yes? They will, they will continue to cut until they see what they believe to be a fair fundamental price for oil, which is what they're not getting right now. Wow, so this battle, not over yet. Dan Dicker, the energy we're good to see, a man, good information. Thank you. All right, just a few weeks removed from comparisons to Lehman Brothers, Credit Suisse is reportedly working with some big banks on a potential capital increase. I'll find out to Zalix Andrews, someone over here with those details. Alex, good to see you. What are we learning? Good to see you. Well, Dave, more drama in the endless saga that is Credit Suisse Europe's beleaguered investment bank, which we've seen a lot of headlines in recent weeks amid concerns around its financial health. Now Credit Suisse is looking for someone to come to the rescue. The bank is reportedly in talks with Morgan Stanley and RBC about helping raise capital for potential restructuring plans and to improve its balance sheets that's according to a report from Bloomberg. I did reach out to Credit Suisse. I didn't immediately get any confirmation or comment on this. Executives are apparently scoping out every area of the business for any extra capital that they can get. This also includes reported discussions about parting ways with some of their businesses, including parts of the investment banking business and the US asset management arm. So as Credit Suisse is looking for ways to kind of improve its balance sheet and restore investor confidence, it's also now seeking third parties for help. Credit Suisse has obviously been grappling with a lot of issues in recent years around its financing, dealing with scandal after scandal, and losing a lot of faith from investors. A source has told Bloomberg that the bank would seek out at least $2 billion to cover those potential restructuring costs and operating losses as it works to do this. This is also quite a change for Credit Suisse, which typically looks to its wealthy Middle Eastern investors for help in situations like this. It did apparently reach out to the Qatar Investment Authority also for a potential capital injection here. We're gonna get more news on this on October 27th when Credit Suisse is set to announce restructuring plans. Interesting article in the Times this morning. How Switzerland's oldest bank became a meme star? That's what it is. This is certainly a great one. Interesting headline, yeah, a little bit. Alexander Seminova, good stuff. Thank you. All right, another day, another exit from Peloton. We'll tell you who's leaving the company now after the bridge. So",https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1iVTbuGfqnQ,78,2022-10-18 19:35:26
3592,"prüj All right everyone, time now for triple play. The three stocks that we're watching in the final 30 minutes of trading. We've got Lockheed Martin, Peloton and Hasbro in deck. Now might be a Lockheed Martin to get LMT, the world's largest defence contractor, really enjoying gains today after a strong Q3 showing. The stock as you can see they're up just about almost 9% there. Earnings of $6.71 per share on revenue of 16.6 billion were in line with expectations, profit speed estimates and net income coming at $1.78 billion. Aerospace and their space businesses really leading the way there. Now when a statement CEO James Takley said Lockheed Martin delivered a solid quarter, highlighted by strength in free cash flow, orders and operating margins that positions us well to achieve our four year commitments. Now we're seeing this patient really paying off for investors. Lockheed also announcing a $14 billion share by-back authorization and they expect to execute a $4 billion accelerated sharey purchase programme in Q4. Now that's an interesting timing because it's before that new tax on by-backs kicks in in January. Now while Lockheed also has a $140 billion backlog of future orders, growth isn't expected to really accelerate until 2024 as some of their investments in hypersonic missiles and other futuristic innovations really need a bit more time to pay off. Yeah, Michelle, when you take a look at the jump today, it's the biggest intraday game that we've actually seen in just about two years. So putting today's gains into perspective here. One of the leaders in the SMB also want to point out an interesting part of this report is that Lockheed actually plans to drop its traditional fall guidance and I bring this up because they are believing supply chain issues for the reason that they're doing this and this has really been used as a guide here in terms of industry-wide. What we could expect here going forward. So when Lockheed does drop that guidance in 2024, it'll be interesting to see what that means for the industry and just in terms of their metrics and what they use to gauge demand going forward. All right. Well, my pick today is Peloton. Two big stories for the stock. Another executive is leading and the company is also extending. It's refund window for its tread plus. So starting with the refund existing users will now have another year until November 2023 to get their money back for.",https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1iVTbuGfqnQ,79,2022-10-18 19:39:29
3593," also extending its refund to window for its tread plus. So starting with the refund existing users will now have another year until November 2023 to get their money back for their tread mills and news coming as a company is still working on a fix for that treadmill. The US Consumer Product Safety Commission writing in a statement that Peloton is still working on that rear guard to address the hazard of the back at the back of the treadmill plus no repair has been approved yet. We also have more changes coming to the top for Peloton on the second part of this story today. Chief People Officer Sherry Eton is leaving the company her departure. It's just the latest in a series of C-suite Resonation changes that we have seen play out in Peloton and Dave Eton are talking another day, another headline coming from Peloton. Yeah, I mean they're competing with Elon Musk in terms of just sipping from the rear of the news. But the treadmill itself, when you look at it, you can see the injuries happening. It's raised off the ground. There's a considerable gap between the belt and the floor. You look, juggernaut 330 incidents, 87 injuries, surprising it took this long. But I got a question because we're all together. Biggest impact of the retail partnerships. Amazon, Dix or Hilton Hotels. What do you got? I think it's going to be Hilton Hotels. I do as well. It's hard. I would say that at least Hilton and Dix give you a chance to try the product. But Amazon in terms of pricing competition, but they had the big deals for prime day. You had a lot of people buying it there. So if perhaps the price is right, because when you look at the price of the treadmill, they're rowing machine, that's a little too much for people. But if you can get the pricing right and get that good introduction, I think they get more people on board. I agree with Hilton's. I think people need to try it. They need to see that they like it. They won't try it at Dix. They can't try it at Amazon, but we will discuss because they'll be in the news tomorrow. My play is Hasbro reporting sales dropped 15% in the third quarter as we head for the holidays. The Eocris Cox saying during the earnings call that the company is seeing, quote, average consumer becoming increasingly price sensitive as the year has progressed. Hasbro reported net income of 129 million. That's down from 253 million one year earlier. Hasbro like many in the sector had inflated inventory and as a result leaned heavily into promotions, cutting profits. They are optimistic though about an unprecedented lineup of entertainment and Q4 that of course starts with Wakanda forever, which will be released on November 11th. What are shares doing there down about 3% on the day and down 35% year to day? This just jumped out of me, Rochelle, because look, almost every earnings we've seen hasn't shown the calamitous predictions of recession. This is the first one to show at least a bit of a weakening consumer in the holiday season. Not a disaster, but at least a hint of what might be coming. It's interesting because when you bring up the idea of inventory, it's different if you're selling something like towels, but things like toys, they're trendy, they're seasonal. People don't want lost-years toys that are just now coming in when you have things like Wakanda forever coming up. They want the newest, the latest. That might be a more unique headwind if you're someone who's in toy sales. This is a company that has struggled year to date off 36%. I thought it was interesting though looking at the analyst commentary after we got these results. MKM was out and they actually took a positive spin. Obviously, for this current quarter, the results weren't too strong, but they were reassured just in terms of the fact that Hasbro reaffirmed their guidance. That was enough for them to at least not be bearish on the stock for now, but you mentioned that 36% drop for shares. The fact that it's been under tremendous amount of pressure going into holiday season, if they don't see, they're not too bullish, it could be a couple of rough quarters ahead. That's a big Q4. Alright, well coming up next holiday season is here holiday shopping season, not even Halloween yet. We've got a closer look at new data on what consumers are expecting from retailers this year.",https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1iVTbuGfqnQ,80,2022-10-18 19:43:53
3594," Nice, I found it, let's do it. The holidays will be here before we know it and shoppers are already getting a head start out from the junior market. We've got a new survey out from ICSC found that 3 quarters are planning to buy gifts far in advance capitalizing on the trend of early season deals. Here for more on that. We want to bring in Tom McGee. He's a CEO of ICSC. Tom, it's great to see you again. Let's start with this survey because you were tracking how much people are looking to spend when they are planning to spend it. And on what? Let's start with that when part 75% are looking to shop early. Does that mean that we're already in the middle of the Solidarity Shopping season? Yeah, it does. Well, first of all, good afternoon. It's good to be with you again. Also, and yes, we're got you. No, we got you. How you got me? OK, OK. First of all, good afternoon. And it does mean we're in the middle of the holiday season. Holiday season starts earlier. That trend really began a pre-pandemic, but has accelerated now post-pandemic in an inflationary environment with a price-conscious consumer looking for deals and being very selective and their shopping habits. They kind of make sense that people would start shopping earlier. We do expect it to be a solid holiday season. We're cautiously optimistic that despite the uncertainty and concerns around inflation, which are real, that consumers will shop this season where our expectation is for 6.7% retail sales growth, and almost 10% growth in people going out dining over the holiday season. Well, almost 10% increase on dining. We talked about that early shopping. Amazon Prime at their October day, target, and Walmart both had competing events is Black Friday dead. It's an iconic day, for sure. But I think that Black Friday's importance in the holiday shopping season isn't what it once was. With a longer holiday season, Black Friday is one of many important days during the holiday shopping season. And Tom, when it comes to promotional activity, we've heard from a number of CEOs on recent earnings calls, anyone from Target to Nordstrom, that they're planning heavy discounts. I guess from your perspective, how does this year's promotional activity...",https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1iVTbuGfqnQ,81,2022-10-18 19:48:15
3595," a number of CEOs on recent earnings calls, anyone from Target to Nordstrom that they're planning heavy discounts. I guess from your perspective, how does this year's promotional activity compare to what we've seen in the past? You know, I would expect there to be more promotional activity this year than what we saw last year. You know, the environment's different than what we were experiencing last year. There was certainly a lot of enthusiasm and pent-up demand as we got back into live shopping and a lot of our holiday traditions. We still have a lot of enthusiasm but certainly more concern around pricing. And so I think one way that retailers will differentiate themselves is a focus upon promotions and being selective and how they price things. You know, this is a price conscious consumer right now. They're continue to spend and we continue to see retail sales growth. But certainly the level of consumer confidence and concern around pricing and inflation is at a very high level. Top for years we've heard about the death of brick and mortar stores and then some surprising numbers this year retail vacancies 6.1% lowest since 2015. More stores open and closed in 21. First time in 27 years is there a shift away from online shopping or how do you explain this trend? Yeah, retail real estate. If you would have closed your eyes going into the pandemic a lot of people would have assumed that this was going to be devised at retail real estate and the opposite is really happened. It's been a rebirth and a renaissance four times in many store openings and closings this year. And really it's a combination of factors. Certainly the convergence between online and physical is upon and real. Stores are being utilized in a whole host of ways for traditional shopping but also for fulfillment. Whether that's shipping from stores or consumers coming and doing click and collect and curbside pickup. And having retailers have really understood the importance of having a physical store to build their brand and their relationship with consumers. Online acquisition costs are significant and online only retail is not very profitable. And certainly a focus and profitability is also helping the physical retail space. So there's a whole confluence of things that have come together. But the store is here to stay and it's prominent in retail is back where it belongs. Tell me, now you just said the store is here to stay but I want to ask you about this online trend in the journal today they were talking about the big bet that brands are making on live stream shopping. When you take a look at the success at least that we've seen in this space in China compared to what we've seen here in the US, I guess do you think we could have a similar type of success here in the US and how critical do you see this being for the future of brands? Well, I think the whole use of media and technology and shopping is continued to evolve and mature over really the last 20 plus years. So I do think there's a role for live streaming and there's a role for a whole host of media and shopping. So I think ultimately it will just enhance and adjust the shopping experience. But I don't think what we've seen over the course of the last 20 years is that really these things come together and consumers find the right balance. I don't think live stream shopping is going to, in some way diminish online or physical retail. I just think it'll be part of a compliment of things that are at a tool chest or retailer will provide. Very interesting retail season ahead IS. ICS, CCEO, Tom McGee, good to see you sir, thank you. I had more drama in the Elizabeth Holmes case. We'll tell you the details and what comes next after the break.",https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1iVTbuGfqnQ,82,2022-10-18 19:52:24
3596,"icians and How to Apply Convected Silicon Valley entrepreneur Elizabeth Holmes is now waiting for a judge to decide if she'll get a new trial. Holmes and her lawyers went to court yesterday to argue she deserves a redo after a jury in January found her guilty of using her blood testing company Theranos to defraud investors. The finances Alexis Keenan joins us with the details now. So what do we need to know here? What is the likelihood she'll be successful? So probably slim. That's what former prosecutors tell me, but the purpose of this hearing yesterday was to question Theranos's former laboratory director who was a key witness for the prosecution. His name is Adam Rosendorf, Dr. Adam Rosendorf. And he made a last minute visit after the trial to the homes that, to the home that Holmes shares with our partner Billy Evans. And according to Holmes and Evans, he had expressed that he tried to testify truthfully at the trial, but that the government made it sound worse than things really were at Theranos. But he got up on the stand yesterday. He was questioned under oath at which time he stood by his trial testimony. And that's really the key because if you stand by your trial testimony, what the judge is interested in is whether you testify truthfully. And if you did, that really declines Elizabeth Holmes' chances for getting a new trial. So things not looking very good for Holmes there. So this is probably, and I'll just say probably with a little caveat there, the last time we'll see Holmes in court before she is either maybe granted a new trial, which the judge will decide sometime after October 24 on that matter or her sentencing, which is scheduled for November 18th. Also though, and I'll throw a wild card in with this case, there's always one. Holmes, there were rumors that she may be pregnant with her second child. Certainly that could change things for the trajectory of the case because if she's pregnant and she has to go ahead and deliver a baby, that could impact when she would potentially go to prison. So I think we can expect to see some additional motions here if that is the case. The reporters that were in the courtroom said she appeared visibly pregnant. So we can expect that maybe that will delay things even further. Wild card indeed. You think this case is done with a new ring.",https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1iVTbuGfqnQ,83,2022-10-18 19:57:26

Thank you as always, Alexis Keenan there for us. All right, well coming up, we're counting down to the closing bell, Wall Street. Stick with us here on Yahoo Finance line. Two minutes to go in the treating day, we're still looking at gains down on S&P, both up just about 1% and almost happened today as well. Now let's take a look inside the market sector action today. Everything has been in the green. I believe the entire day or at least most of it industrials in the lead that's up 2% followed by materials.

So some positivity in the market today will see how short lived or long lived that might end up being or break down the market action with our guests. Now let's bring in Christian to do cap trust director of investments and Francis Newton Stacey, optimal capital director of strategy. Welcome to you both. So Christian, what do you make of the current market that we're in at the moment in terms of what they're digesting knowing that the Fed isn't going to change course anytime soon? Well, I think we had a bit of a panic about a week we can have to go when we saw the news at a UK with their pension system problems. But when it was reassured that we did not have the same systemic kinds of risk in the US, we recovered a lot of that. But I don't think that the market is clear in the way until we know where the Fed's going. And frankly, a lot of market participants are starting to think maybe the Fed is going to be a little too fast here and should slow down. Francis, what has rally the markets the last two days? Just the fact that it was oversold, just the fact that you know, bonds and the NASDAQ have lost over 30% this year and people are starting to think it's cheap. And I think there's a contingency of traders that thinks that the Fed is not going to make it with their hawkish sentiments. And particularly due to the liquidity crisis in the UK, you know, we could easily have that over here as well as we reduce the money supply at a record rate. And so I think traders are starting to think, well, the Fed may have to pivot even if it doesn't want to to protect the system. And they have proven to do so in the third quarter of 19 when they had a spike in the overnight, you know, overnight rates in the market because of tax payments and they did so during COVID. So that's what I think some of those pivot traders are starting to get a little trigger happy again, thinking the Fed's not going to make it even though we have two more 75 basis point hike priced into the Fed Fed funds futures. Some friends, what does that mean for downside risk? Because here we are today with the S&P back above 3700. It looks like you might think that we have some downward moves here ahead. What does that potentially look like? Well, you know, we could have a rally, for instance, if the Fed decides that they're not going to make it through those two hikes or if they change their sentiment whatsoever, we could see a rally in risk assets. But the thing is is that the twos and the pens are inverted by 80 basis points and that's, you know, pretty extreme going back to the 80s and the swaps market and, you know, the corporate on, you know, the corporate overtreesuries, you know, the option of adjusted market there is those spreads are, you know, widening slowly. And so the credit risk is starting to get priced in. We've got 61% of people living paycheck to paycheck in America. The credit card usage is going up every time we, you know, raise rates that that service is getting very onerous. And so, you know, in the background, we're pricing in a hard landing, which is a credit event. And so the question, obviously, this is all happening while we're getting into the thick of earnings season. What are you expecting in terms of Ford guidance, given some of these pressures? Well, we've seen a few of them already. Some of the food companies have shared that they've passed on prices very successfully. I think we all know that the volume of the economy is starting to slow down, but we're not seeing it in pricing data. And that's, you know, these companies are conduit for inflation. And their pricing power is being demonstrated here. And I don't think that they're going to give that up at minimum, they'll slow down their price increases or keep them.",https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1iVTbuGfqnQ,85,2022-10-18 20:05:27
3599," And their pricing power is being demonstrated here. And I don't think that they're going to give that up. At minimum, they'll slow down their price increases or keep them flat while at the same time working on costs. So I would expect that you're going to see some layoff announcements in Q3 or at least implied in some of the guidance for margins. And that'll hold stocks up. That'll hold earnings expectations up pretty well for next year. And then on the flip side of what's happening in the market, you've got really cheap valuations. So if those earnings can show that they are durable, I think investors will welcome that with some higher prices. Christian, you say you're seeing inflation coming down. And what data? Oh, just the real-time commodity numbers. We've seen, well, food is continued to stay high. Even the Zillow home indices show that there's roll over in actual prices transacting. But you're not going to see that in the inflation data that the Fed tracks, because that is just lagging. Friends, what do you make of the strong dollar? Obviously, a headwind year, we've heard it a number of times from corporations over the last week, we can have. We heard it during second quarter earnings. How big of a risk? Could you see this being at least over the coming quarters? Well, obviously, it's putting a lot of pressure on emerging markets. The thing is that the strong dollar is not going to remain at the Fed pivot thread. I'm watching $1,250 as a line of support or resistance coming down or going up. And that's the thing. So I'm watching the dollar, the 10 year, and I'm watching gold, and I'm watching the corporate spread, and I'm watching this inversion, and I'm watching the swap to see when one of these things indicates that there's something else occurring with traders, because actually the Fed can control the discount rate, but they only really give an estimate for the Fed funds rate, and then that's actually priced in by traders. They've had to remain quite hawkish in their narrative so that traders don't try to anticipate a pivot as they didn't July, and then once again, in September, and undo those tighter financial conditions. And as far as inflation goes, most of those components, even though the prices have dropped precipitously, for oil and gas, you've seen that come down. That has a one to two month lag, and a CPI reading, food has between a four and a eight month lag and a CPI reading. The thing that's going to keep CPI sticky for quite a while is owners equivalent rent. Owners equivalent rent makes up about a third of the CPI, and because housing has become so unaffordable, with mortgage rates hitting the seven handle, those rents are going to remain quite high, and then it takes 18 months for that third of CPI to come down on a lag effect. And so that keeps the narrative for the Fed very strong and the limit yet, and so that keeps those narratives in place because they're so lagging, so the Fed can remain hawkish until something breaks, so that they actually then know where the liquidity threshold is for the amount of debt, because we put a lot of new fiscal and monetary money into the system. We're trying to take that money out of the system, but you can't remove the debt from the system. Thank you, Christian. With those narratives in mind there, you're saying that stock valuations are getting really attractive, but what is cheap and actually good in looking attractive to you right now, out of what's out there? Well, I think you've seen a better out performance in cyclical stocks recently, and a lot of cyclicals are trading at sub 10 times earnings, even on lower expected earnings in 2023. I think the analysts have done a decent job at forecasting where earnings are going to trend in places like home builders and steel companies, chemical companies. And if you can get a sub 10 PE on a lower 2023 estimate, you've probably got a pretty good entry point. And I would say one thing about rates here, so everybody's talking about these lagging effects, including your other guest here, higher rates have a lagging effect too. These are going to have to hit the economy over time. We can only hope that the Fed realizes that soon enough that the higher rates are already having a big impact. All right, Christian, the view, and Francis Newton, Stacey, thank you both, much appreciated. All right, some big earnings, news now just coming in, Netflix shares jumping after hours up more than 11% on a terrific report. Jared Blickery here with the numbers. Hey, man, hey there. Let's start with the headline number here. Streaming paid net changes. So was estimating 1 million guess what?",https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1iVTbuGfqnQ,86,2022-10-18 20:09:56
3600," Now just coming in, Netflix shares jumping after hours up more than 11% on a terrific report. Jared Blickery here with the numbers. Hey man. Hey there. Let's start with the headline number here. Streaming paid net changes. Oh, it was estimating 1 million. Guess what? They came in at 2.4, 1 million for the third quarter. Stream paid memberships at total comes to 223.09 million, up 4.5% year over year. Revenue also beating expectations that came in at 7.93 billion versus estimates of 7.85 billion small beat there. Operating margin, 19.3% versus the estimate of 15.9%. So really a lot more efficient there than people than the street thought at least. EPS earnings per share coming at $3.10 for the quarter versus estimates of $2.12. So huge beat there. Lots of concern over not only their expenses, but also their subscribers. Free cash flow. Here's another one ending the quarter at 472 million versus estimates of 1.8 for 184.2 million. So more than double the expected amount. Also coming from a negative number, we'll recall that from the last quarter. Now for the current quarter, that is a fourth fiscal quarter. They're seeing streaming paid net change of 4.5 million. The estimate was for 3.9 million. So better on that front. Seeing revenue of 7.78 billion. That's a little bit lower than estimates of 7.98 billion. EPS, that is expected to be 36 cents. Quite a bit lower than the estimate of $1.20. And paid memberships at total coming to 227.59 million expected versus estimates of 225.7 million. Also seeing operating margin of 4.2%. Now starting with the fourth quarter, 22 letter, in January of next year. So that's coming in at the end of January. We're going to provide, this is a company, is going to continue to provide guidance for revenue, operating income, operating margin, net income, EPS, and fully diluted shares outstanding for the following quarter. But no guidance for paid memberships. So I think that's an interesting point that's going to get some questions on the call here, guys. Jared Blyckery with the Netflix earnings report. Thank you, my friend. Good to see you. It is an impressive report. Beat on the top, beat on the bottom, and a crush on sub-adding $2.4 million after the first ever back-to-back quarters in which Netflix lost subscribers. There ain't much to not like in this report, especially as we get to the biggest question, which is how does this add to your impact the stock and help the shares we now know it's seven bucks a month? What jumps out to you, Shana? There isn't much not to like in this report. The one thing I would point out is that Netflix actually coming in a bit light in terms of their fourth quarter revenue guidance. They're expecting $7.78 billion. The estimate out there from the street was for $7.98 billion. So that is a miss there, but you're right, Dave. Investors looking beyond that shareholder's really focusing on that subscriber growth number. I think we were all expecting a pretty wheat quarter here from Netflix. We didn't really expect us to really, the company to really return to strong growth when it comes to subscribers until the current quarter here when they are launching that add supported tier. So 2.41 million new subs during the quarter, Richelle, very, very strong report here from Netflix. I also wanted to point out that the company did say will not provide pay subscriber forecasts starting in the fourth quarter, so any more information. On that, I think is something that people will want to hear. Of course, it makes you question just in terms of why they're doing that. I think we can all point to the fact that we are seeing slowing growth, but that is an important tidbit to point out in this report. And you mentioned that slowing revenue growth. And they said that it was the result of competition, account sharing, and other factors that they hopefully then now will be addressing by adding this add tier as well as that people can pay less, perhaps share passwords. But I mean, this was, I mean, rocketing, 2.4 million subscribers after we saw all that fuss over, for the first time when they had their subscriber losses and they were like, well, we're not going to be basing in on that anymore because of the competition. I wonder if they're re-changing their tier now that they've got this bumper addition here. So I mean, this beat on the top on the bottom really surprising. And it just goes to show Netflix not out of the woods yet. Obviously, a lot of competition in this space still, but Netflix still has a lot of fight, still investing in some of the big budget productions as well. So a lot to like in this report. Yeah, again, the new add supported tier will debut in November 699 a month. That, of course, is going to be a key focus on the earnings call that will get underway soon.",https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1iVTbuGfqnQ,87,2022-10-18 20:14:20
3601," A lot to like in this report. Yeah, again, the new ad supported here will debut in November 699 a month. That, of course, is going to be a key focus on the earnings call that will get underway soon. And we, of course, will have more on Netflix here coming up. But I want to switch gears here and look at United because this stock moving to the upside following its earnings and beat here. You look at that. Chairs up just around 4% revenue coming at a 12.9 billion. That was better than what the street was looking for. Adjusted EPS 281. The S&M on the street was 229. So beat there on both the top and bottom lines. Third quarter available seat miles coming at 67.7 billion. S&M out there for 66.9 billion. A couple of comments from United COVID recovery turned to overcome recessionary pressure. That's a bullish sign here for the company as there was some fear that people would begin to pull back in spending because of the slowing economy. They also expect fourth quarter adjusted operating margin to exceed 2019 level. So that beat on the top and bottom line, the bullish commentary there. Dave, from executives in this release, really adding to the momentum that we're seeing after hours now, the stock up nearly 6%. On top of what we saw from Delta Airlines just about a week ago, and I hate to be the bearer of bad news. But if you are the Fed chair and you're seeing these numbers, this is another inflationary story. This is not the news the Fed wants to see. This is not the news you want to see if you expect the Fed to pause. Not one bit, you know why? Because airfares are up 8% month over month. And a staggering 43% year over year and yet they're not seeing demand destruction. Rochelle, that's great news for United and for their shareholders. That is bad news in terms of the Fed story in this country. I mean, it really is. And we've been talking for a while about when we're going to start seeing this demand destruction. The prices are not going down. This is still not deterring people. We were saying, oh, perhaps this is sort of the post-COVID buildup. We're now heading into the holiday season, even when you look ahead to the next quarter, demand still not slowing down. So I don't know what it's going to take for consumers to pull back on that spending. We're seeing them pull back in other areas, but not on this. And you have to factor in, obviously, they're paying these inflated prices. So obviously, it's going to be boosting airlines' profits. But the consumer not letting go. Not at all. It's the case that we need massive job losses in order to bring inflation down to even 4% let alone the Fed's target of two. But certainly a solid report from Netflix and from United. Straight ahead, Netflix shares, skyrocketing after that big earnings beat will get an analyst take right after the break.",https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1iVTbuGfqnQ,88,2022-10-18 20:18:35
3602," GitHub. Let's go. Ned Flick shares soaring. Look at that up 14% after hours following its quarterly earnings beat here to break it down further in Santos. Rao, Manhattan Venture Partners, head of research. Santos, I'm old enough to remember when we graded films, two thumbs up, Cisco and Abort. But let's just go. No one knows what that is because Shana is too young. Those were shale. One to ten based on your expectations. What do you grade this Netflix earnings report? I would say A+. From where it was coming from, I think it's back to growth. It's doing everything from a position of strength now. Because the big concern was, are they rushing into this act to your model from a position of weakness? Is their whole business model not working? I think this shows that everything's working. They're just layering on another layer of revenue source. So I think this is a good quarter across the board, good in terms of revenue growth, I mean, subscriber growth. And even the numbers, the top line, bottom line, everything seems to be on track doing well. I think Netflix is back in the saddle, so to speak. So Sandosh, as we dig down into what Netflix has done differently over this past quarter to really get these sorts of results, what do you attribute that to? Well, I think one thing is Netflix was never out. I think what happened was there was this pre-pandemic, this pandemic pull forward, and it was adjusting to all that. So I think there was a lot of moving parts. And it had to adjust to this post-pandemic world. And then it's the new competitive landscape. I think it's got all its strategy together at this point. It's executing. They had good content slate this quarter. They have good coming up also. So I think that's the beauty of Netflix. They have good content, good stickiness. The churn is low. It was pretty high for some time. But I think last quarter, but I think that's kind of moderating. It's coming down to reasonable levels. And that's the thing. It's just keep on producing good content. And keep the stickiness going. And be aware that competition is nipping away at your heels. So you just need to keep on keeping on. And that's what Netflix is doing very well. Sanders, one thing sticking out to me in this report. Netflix is not going to provide guidance, a propane membership as of next quarter, the fourth quarter letter, just from an analyst perspective. What's your reaction to this? And of course, do you think that this is just because of the slowing growth that we have simply seen from Netflix over the most recent quarters? No, I think that makes it a little difficult. But I think right now, there are some unknowns. We don't know how many people will get the tier ad tier. We don't know. There's going to be a lot of movement within their subscriber base. We don't know where the chips are going to fall. We think it's just going to be incrementally positive adding on this ad tier. So it's going to be a good backstop for people who want to leave the platform. They can just come back to a lower tier. So they can just concast us, kind of entice them to stay on with a lower price point. So there are a lot of good advantages to having the ad tier in their whole revenue mix. Revenue mix. So I think that's the thing. It's overall, I would say it's on the right track. Do you expect there be, I don't know the number. Do you have an expectation on people trading down their subscription to the ad tier from say, you know, the 20 bucks a month that a lot of people do pay? And what do we know about the password sharing that they're tweaking and.",https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1iVTbuGfqnQ,89,2022-10-18 20:22:43
3603," on their subscription to the ad tier from say, you know, the 20 bucks a month that a lot of people do pay. And what do we know about the password sharing that they're tweaking in Latin America, how significant a revenue generator do you expect it to be? Yeah, I think it's going to be definitely net additive down the road. We still don't know how well it's going to be. They're still trying out in various markets. Overall, I think with at least 15 to 20% of their pace of the 100 million non paying the password sharing base will come on immediately by next like 15 up to 15 million new subscribers will come on next by next year and more later on. So that's the big unknown. I think if they're playing around, they need to do different things, tweak different, it's a lot of competition, competition to get it all right. So, but overall there are options, they're creating options. And we'll wait and see. I think at this point, my estimate is about 7 million next year, by next year we'll have 7 million in the North American base and then overall about 15 million overall in the ad tier market. That's what I'm talking about. So I had tiered layer. I think that's what. So it's a lot of numbers, 15 million here, 20 million there. We don't know yet. There's no precise number because we still haven't seen the full rollout yet, but net net, it will be additive. We'll let's wait and see what the uptake rate is. Hopefully it'll be very good because the content should be good and will be good. I'm sure and they need to be good rather. So and they'll do it. Next Netflix executes properly very well. And they know what the downfall is. There is competition, they need to execute, they need the good content. They invest 17 to 18 billion content. So I think they'll get it right. And Sam, I want to ask you about the international markets because they're saying excluding the foreign exchange impact that revenue grew 13% Euro via an average revenue per membership grew 8%. Talk about the impact of the foreign exchange, the foreign exchange impact. And also what lies ahead in terms of international growth for Netflix? Well, international growth is a key aspect of its whole growth story. They need that based on growth. I mean, North America is pretty much saturated. So it's now about taking market share from other people, other bases are adding on from the linear TV people. But overall, international is where the growth is. And the effects impact is going to be huge. And if there is a slight miss on the 4Q number, it's probably because of the effects impact and a few other things. So I think probably they want to be conservative in terms of projecting their 4Q estimates. But 4Q guidance. But overall, I think for a strong dollar is a big negative. It weighs on their numbers. And it will weigh on. But that's where the growth is. That's where the next leg up is in international markets. And they continue to do it. They have the market share outside the US. St. Teresa Ernie's call is going to get underway here pretty soon. A lot of the focus is going to be on that ad here that you have already mentioned. What else are you looking to hear from executives this afternoon? Yeah, I want to see how their expense management, cost management is going. That's what they said. They're going to focus on the free cash flow. We'll be here about that. And basically, the whole focus is going to be on the ad here. What their projections are, how they think it'll roll out, and what they expect, and also the passport sharing. So there's more color on those two aspects. And other than that, let's see if they can just throw some more light on the slate, content slate coming up. And what their plan is for 2023. And if this momentum will continue, how confident they are about the future. I think that's the tone we want to hear. And I think we'll see that. They can certainly be confident today based on what we've seen with the share price. A big thank you to St. Joshua Alfa joining us this afternoon. Thank you. All right, coming up. Office occupancy rates across the US are hitting their highest levels since the start of the pandemic. We'll tell you how full they are after the break.",https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1iVTbuGfqnQ,90,2022-10-18 20:27:06
3604," Good jobyah! Let's talk RTO. Now offices in the U.S. cities are getting busier lately. According to new data from Castle Systems offices here in New York City, hit nearly 48% occupancy last week, marking a post-pandemic hide. That's up nearly four whole points from just two weeks prior. Castle's 10 city average saw a similar uptick as well, reaching 49% for the nationwide average that to a post-pandemic peak. But it also bears the question, what level will we ever get back to? It does not appear, well, let's just dismiss with the notion that we're ever going to get to 100% of pre-pandemic numbers. Those days are gone, say goodbye employers. But Rochelle, how high do you think we get in 75% of the ceiling? I'm not quite sure if we even get there. I mean, a lot of employees are still figuring out how to get the employees back in. Even though you have the office space you're seeing some of these commercial rents starting to come down a little bit, still not encouraging people to come in though. We know that some of the numbers are a little bit skewed though in the data because you have cities like Austin, Texas where they have offices that are two thirds full. So that's perhaps, when you think of the averages, it's maybe not as rosy as it appears. But I mean, I think they might be lucky if they even get to 75% occupancy as early as really. Yeah, 75% is a huge jump from where we are today. You have to think that we might, that we would pretty much be back at this point just in terms of the people who do plan to return to work. The companies that do plan to make it mandatory. Of course, we have heard more and more announcements come out over the last couple of months. I don't know how much more head, headway we are going to make from here. We're still below 50%. I think we're going to get above that 50% number. I'm not so sure that we're going to actually push above 60%. When you take a look though, Dave, and I wanted to point this out to you. I know you take the Metro North. I do. I know North trains hit 74% of their 2019 average, which is interesting to me.",https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1iVTbuGfqnQ,91,2022-10-18 20:31:41
3605," I wanted to point this out to you. I know you take the Metro North. I do. Metro North trains hit 74% of their 2019 average, which is interesting to me. So the Metro North, it looks like a lot of people from your neck of the woods are the ones that are coming back into the office, 74%. That jump dot to me was much higher than what I was anticipating to see given these office occupancy numbers. Funny to have you say that, because that was the first number that jumped down to me. I live in an entirely commuter town. All of them commute to New York City. Well, how is that number so high if New York City is nearly 30 points below it? Yeah. And that is a discrepancy that I cannot account for, but also based on that, interesting that reveals Wednesday is the most full day, then Tuesday and then Monday. But easily Wednesday is the winner in terms of the Metro North train commute. But ultimately as we move forward, if we have a recession, and then employers have a bit more power with Shell, maybe that is the thing that ticks that number up. Sure to that, I don't see it can ever even get near 60% again. It's true. If we can get labor force participation back up, you're getting more people back into the offices, not because of a hybrid situation, but because of a recession, because of the actual monetary need for it, perhaps you could see a shift in there. But even then, some people still would rather work from home or have some sort of remote options. They'd rather, but the power dynamic would shift. Exactly. You wouldn't really have the upper hand anymore when it comes to the employee. All right, we'll have to leave it there. But coming up a new study reveals that more women in leadership and leaving their companies at the highest rate in years. The authors of that study tell us why next. A new survey out highlighting and alarming trend in the workforce, women leaders are leaving their jobs at the highest rate on record. And it could have serious implications.",https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1iVTbuGfqnQ,92,2022-10-18 20:36:09
3606," A new survey out highlighting and alarming trend in the workforce. Women leaders are leaving their jobs at the highest rate on record and it could have serious implications for companies joining us now are the co-authors of this report of women in the workplace. We want to bring in Rachel Thomas, CEO of Lean End and we have Lurian A.E. McKenzie, senior partner. Rachel, let me start with you just in terms of the fact that women are leaving the workforce, especially women in leadership positions. What do you attribute this to? So you're absolutely right. We're in the midst of a big break up. Women are leaving their companies at the highest rate we've seen and at a higher rate than men leaders and we want to be clear women leaders are just as embarrassed as men, but they're looking for more opportunity and they're placing a higher premium on the culture of work. They want more flexibility. They want to work for companies that are deeply committed to diversity, equity, inclusion and employee wellbeing and to give you a sense of the scale of the problem. For every woman director who's getting promoted, two women directors are leaving their company. That's one up and two out. So the matches to companies is they need to figure out how to hold onto those precious women leaders. So Lurian, what do they need to do? What are some of these women in leadership roles? What are they asking for that they're not getting from the companies that they're leaving? That's a great question. So what we're seeing is we're seeing an enormous number of headwinds for women and we're also seeing a change in stance in terms of what women are thinking about. So in terms of the headwinds, imagine you go to work. 40% of the women we surveyed said that they had other people take credit for their ideas on a regular basis. There are two times more likely than men to be mistaken for someone more junior. And there are just a really long list of these slights and cuts day to day that take away their experience. And what boils down to is companies are sending women signals that they're not going to advance because of these experiences, but also because the extra work that they do, the performance that they give, it's not always reflected in their performance reviews. And so that's what's happening on the headwind side. On the other side of that, women are saying, wait a second, I'm ambitious, positively ambitious, I'm talented. I actually might go try somewhere else. And what's critical is they're not breaking up with work. They're just breaking up the companies that they're at. Rachel, I mean, this is the largest study on the state of women in corporate America. What are you hoping that people take away for these findings? What are you hoping they're actually going to do? Well, so for the last eight years, we've been reporting that there's a broken wrong at the first step up to manager. So every 100 men promote the demander last year, only 87 women were in 82 women of color. So that's one pipeline problem. Now we have this new pipeline problem that women are leaving their companies at the highest rate ever. So we want this to be a wake up call to corporate America because we know that women leaders are precious. But not only underrepresented, they're more likely to be investing in lifting up employees, good people management. They're more likely to be fostering inclusion on their team. And they're more likely to be showing up as allies. And we also know business results are better when there's more women and more diverse leadership. So it's about the numbers, but it's also holding on to the women who are driving the change in organizations that we need to see right now. We're into this study also broke it down by company specific roles. I noticed a massive deep underrepresentation of women in technical roles from companies in this sector that are doing it right that are able to attract women into these jobs. Any idea what they're doing? Yeah, so a couple things. So in 2018, we saw that technical roles women only had 18% share of those jobs. And today we see that number has gone down to 16%. And you may be asking why is that so important? Well, one of the things is when we look at economic growth, when we look at job growth, technical roles, either in engineering, data science, all of these types of roles, that's where job growth is in America. And we see such a small participation of women. And you can't just say it's an education pipeline problem. It actually is also the responsibility of companies to recruit more, to invest in the career development, in the training, and also the ability to advance. And so this is a really big mess. A huge mess here. And Rachel, this troubling study coming at a time when we're seeing the economy slow down, all the reversessions seem to be rising almost on a daily basis. What do you think that this will potentially do just in turn?",https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1iVTbuGfqnQ,93,2022-10-18 20:40:14
3607," Troubling study coming at a time when we're seeing the economy slow down, all the reversations seem to be rising almost on a daily basis. What do you think that this will potentially do just in terms of further complicating that gender gap? Yeah, it's interesting. Certainly the recession will likely have an impact on the dynamics we're seeing, but I actually think we've seen a sheet shift. Employees saw what companies were able to do as a result of the pandemic. They invested in flexibility in a way that we'd never seen. They invested in employee wellbeing at levels that were unheard of before. And I think employees and particularly women employees have said, we're not going back to the past. We want to lean into the future of work. And so what that'll look like over the next six to 12 months, during what might be a recession, I don't know, but I think that sea change is permanent. And I think we're seeing employees expect something different out of organizations going forward in particularly those women leaders and those rising women leaders, those young women. Rachel Thomas, Lauren, thanks so much for taking the time to join us. Well, women also more likely to take on more student debt. So let's break some of this down because it's smooth sailing so far on the government's student debt relief website. Now, if you're among the eight million who applied for student debt relief during this beta test period, the Department of Education says you will be processed and you don't need to reapply. Now, it's a very straightforward form on the student a.gov website. You put in your name, date of birth, your social security. And of course, your contact information, but you'll also need to confirm your eligibility. You have to be an individual that made less than 125,000 in 2020 and 2021, or a family's making less than 250,000. Now, this, what you're qualified for, up to 20,000 to federal Pell Grant recipients, and up to 10,000 for non-Pell grant recipients. Unfortunately, though, loans from private lenders are not included. Now, some key dates to be aware of. The Education Department recommends getting your application in before November 15th to get forgiveness, because approval takes about four to six weeks. So you want to get those in before the loan payments that were paused in order to help borrowers during the worst of the pandemic. Those are going to resume on January 1st. Now, the application is going to be open through December 31st of 2023. Now, this is going to impact more than 40 million borrowers, but of course, there's plenty of pushback. So you might want to get your filing in early. You have the Congressional Budget Office saying this executive order will cost about $400 billion. You also have Republican legal challenges already mounting, saying that it's going to impact state tax revenues. So definitely get that in early and make sure to check your eligibility. All right, we're coming up. Despite high inflation, rent is the beginning to feel relief in certain U.S. markets. Find out which ones after the break.",https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1iVTbuGfqnQ,94,2022-10-18 20:44:30
3608," Up The current inflation picture may not fully reflect what's going on in the U.S. rental market. Yahoo! Fanat's just here. Romero joins us now to explain how inflation lags behind current rental data. Big story in this country right now. Yes. Yeah. So the key component of CPI consumer price index is shelter. And that is an indicator that is lagging behind many of the private sector data points out there, such as Zillow co-star. That's just a name of few. And that's what economists have been saying. But the way one economist put it is that the shelter numbers that we got last week really reflect what happened last summer in 2021. So the reason why there is this lag is because CPI captures rents. So, landlords can't raise rents to their existing tenants at the same level that they're raising rents to new tenants. They would have to wait for that existing tenant to renew the lease in order for that bump to occur. So that's why there is that lag. But again, many economists have said that rent prices are actually now peaking. So we can expect about three months of month to month CPI increases before we would actually see a clear slowdown. And that's why so many are saying take it easy, let the medicine take hold, maybe pause for a moment beyond a 275 point hike that are probably coming. Danny, thank you. Good information. Rochelle? All right. Well, staying on the topic, the cost of rent rose 0.8% in September and is up over 7% year over year, but there are some signs the market may be cooling off. Now, who finds it's contributing very gibbons joins us with the details. Vera, what do we need to know? Well, yes, I mean, the overall inflation rate was a little uncomfortable for a lot of us because it's still well above the feds 2% target rate and rents are a big part of that rent and food continue to go up. But the thing with real estate, as your last person just pointed out, is that it is local. So while we are seeing rent growth continue to rise in some of those peripheral markets outside of the core cities, like Cambridge, Massachusetts, Freeman, California, Tempia, Arizona, to name three, we are seeing an overall leveling off or plateauing, if you will, in rents in many of the other markets throughout the country. And this is providing welcome relief for renters who have seen sky high rises almost month over month. Vera, how significant is rent when it comes to the inflation number we're seeing and therefore, how warp to sense, are we getting of how lagging this data is as we just learned from Danny Romero? You point out, you make a good point because it is pretty significant when you take a look at the inflation rate, you see rents and food, big parts of the inflation data. It shows it's at uncomfortably high levels. But the good news is that in the major cities that saw the biggest run up in rent prices, we are seeing a leveling off or plateauing. I was speaking to the CEO of Zumber and he said that in over half of the cities he actually follows, he is in fact seeing a plateauing of those rents, places like Nashville, Tennessee, a lot of the Florida markets, for example, they're coming down.",https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1iVTbuGfqnQ,95,2022-10-18 20:48:57
3609," is in fact saying a flat telling of those rents, places like Nashville, Tennessee, a lot of the Florida markets, for example, they're coming down, but it's important to point out that we're coming off with very high highs, we're coming off of very elevated levels. So any relief is going to feel modest compared to where we've actually been, particularly in year two of COVID, but some relief is good relief, and we will take any kind of relief because like I said in some markets, the growth has been substantial. We're talking double digit growth month over month over month. So yes, it's still a bit of a problem, but the good news is that the home sales market is cooling down, and as a result, the home rental market is in fact cooling down. And, Vivier, what about the more expensive places? And does this mean that they're still going to see a lot of turnover because you can't afford a house, you still have to read, you have to live somewhere. That's interesting. You point that out because yes, we are seeing a lot of, we have seen a lot of return over the past couple of years. I was speaking to a lot of landlords and they said, oh my god, the turner has been ridiculous. They get people in for ridiculous amount of money and then they're gone and they have to put a lot of money back in and then they jack the rent price up. So some of the landlords I interviewed for a piece of road for Yahoo Finance are saying, you know what? A leveling off or telling your rents is actually a good thing because we can get a qualified decent renter in who will take good care of the property and stay a long time. I was speaking to one ranger who said, her previous landlord, she couldn't even get them on the phone to fix a leaky faucet and went on for like four months and she's since moved into a different location, has a different landlord. And the landlord now is so anxious to get her to stay that she's even bringing over fresh fresh flowers. So it's just, it's just a show that things are in fact cooling off. I mean, the bidding wars we saw over the past couple of years, the competition just got completely crazy. So it'd be interesting to see sort of how the landlords respond to the cooling of the market. But as I say, well, landlord, I spoke to you said he's actually happy about it because he's started the turnover every year, every six months, people are moving out, it's going to put thousands of dollars in to fix it up and then rent into the higher price. Well, there you go, landlords, buy your tenants some flowers. Very good one. Thank you so much for joining us. Sure, let's take a look at what's trending in after hours. All right, Michelle, we've got a couple of big gainers here on the board. Netflix united into it. If surgical and JB Hunt all has to do with earnings. Let's kick it off with Netflix. The stock popping here after hours a very, very strong subscriber growth number. That's the reason that we're seeing a 13.5% jump in shares after hours, 2.4 million subscribers added during its most recent quarter. They added customers in every region here, surging past what Wall Street was looking for. That's a big reason why you're seeing that jump today. The company though did offer revenue guidance that came in just a bit light, but it doesn't look like that's holding too much weight at least for now. The company says it is on the path to reaccelerate growth as sequential decline in revenue was entirely due to the strong dollar. Taking a look at the past three months, Netflix, you can see has gotten some of its momentum back. We're shares of 26% on a year-to-date basis, though. We are still well in the red off just around 60%. Let's take a look at United, another company out with earnings here after the Bellers, seeing the stock up just around 7.5%. Beating up both the top and bottom lines revenue of 12.9 billion adjusted EPS of 2.81. The company saying that COVID recovery trend to overcome some of those recessionary pressures, very similar to what we heard from Delta and Delta gave that up be guidance here for the holiday quarter. Take a look at the past three months, you can see United still in the red, though off just around 5%. Taking a look at intuitive surgical, another mover here to the upside up just over 8%. Beating on both the top and bottom line revenue for the third quarter coming in above 11% up 11% from a year ago at 1.56 billion EPS at $1.19. That was better than what the street was looking for. The company did say, though, that profit did decline from a year ago because of rising expenses. It doesn't look like the street is too worried about that at least for now or the past three months. The stock off just around 6% on a year-to-date basis. We're off just around 46%. All right, let's round it out here with JB Hunt, the transportation services company taking a look at these numbers here. $2.4 $2.57 on EPS. That was better than what the street was looking for operating revenue.",https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1iVTbuGfqnQ,96,2022-10-18 20:53:12
3610," and the transportation services company taking look at these numbers here $2.2.57 on EPS and that was better than what the street was looking for. Operating revenue of 22% year over year 3.84 billion year to date the stock is still in the red though off just around 17% Dave. Great stuff is always. We want to thank you. My stock to watch for Wednesday is Tesla who reports earnings tomorrow after the close. The central question for investors is if the EV maker is seeing declining demand. Tesla has repeatedly raised prices in recent months but now faces high inflation rising energy bills in Europe at a weakening economy in China among their many macro challenges. Tesla's Q3 deliveries fell short of Wall Street estimates sending the stock down 8.6% and JP Morgan analysts Ryan Brinkman saying, well, Tesla continues to point to supply constraints as limiting deliveries the potential for demand destruction looms large. Tesla shares down 44% year to date tomorrow will be pivotal. Coming up, Krispy Kreme Donuts will be popping up at the menu at one fast food giant next week. And to find out who. All right, this is an exciting partnership in the food space. McDonald's is going to sell Krispy Kreme Donuts at nine store locations in Kentucky this month. Both companies up today, maybe something of that has to do with the news that we got now McDonald's saying the menu shake up could reveal how adding bakery items would impact its restaurant's customer is going to be able to get the original glazed chocolate ice with sprinkles. The raspberry filled donuts and that is not all the news coming up from McDonald's today. We're also back with their Halloween.",https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1iVTbuGfqnQ,97,2022-10-18 20:57:16
3611," get the original glaze chocolate ice with sprinkles. The raspberry filled donuts and that is not all the news coming out from McDonald's today. They're also back with their Halloween buckets. And we've got this McBoo bucket on set for you guys. A very exciting thing bringing it back right in time for the Halloween holiday and returning after six years. So they're doing all they can to try to add some excitement here to their menu, Michelle. I mean, I do love the idea of the Krispy Kreme partnership. And they say you can either get them as the three pack or part of a six pack. I need very little motivation as an impulse buyer to sort of like, oh yeah, let me grab that as well. So I will probably be it. When it eventually comes here right now, it's just limited to Louisville Kentucky. So lucky for you all sad for us. I think these boo buckets though are absolutely adorable. I think they should have put the meal inside the bucket. But Dave, you have theories about why that's not the best idea. McDonald's has got your back. They're putting it in a bag so it stays warm. You don't want those fries in a bucket and cooling off in the environment around it. That is smart. Plus, you don't want it stinking up your candy for the candy that's going to go in there in Halloween. Let me say this, McDonald's. If you don't put a breakfast sandwich on a Krispy Kreme donut, I am dearly disappointed in you. It's easy. Sausage, egg and cheese on two Krispy Kreme's. I don't know what we'll call it. That's a hard attack in the sandwich. Krispy Kreme. It's cool. That's called a trip to the dentist. That's too much. Dentist. Oh, come on. Krispy Kreme and everything else. Krispy Kreme, a sandwich with sausage, egg and cheese. You could thank me later, McDonald's. You can thank me later. But they also have adult happy meals. They do. And they've been a huge hit. The toys in them have been slion. They become collectibles. I don't know that the happy meal itself has been that popular, but the toys sure have. We're going to get a look at their earnings next week. I hate to be the wonky guy. But it'll be interesting because the lower income bracket will be interesting to see if there are cutbacks on that side of things. Despite all these promotions. Yeah, definitely will give us a good gauge just in terms of how hard inflation is hitting everyday Americans. I think this is really, really cute. This is the make-up. They all have a mcconkin and a mcgoblin. I like what they're doing here. I'll be sure to get mine. But we'll have to leave you there. That'll do it for today's Yahoo! Find out slides.

3615," new ad tier or next guess is this change could be a good thing for Netflix's global strategy. Let's bring in city managing director Jason Basine to talk more about this. Jason good to see you. So Netflix interesting here and as we were talking about at the top of the show, the company really changing the tone and entering a different phase of its life cycle with this focus more on profitability as a distinguishing characteristic from its competitors versus its growth. Do you think that's the right way now to think about Netflix? Yeah, I do. I mean, who doesn't like profits? You know, the issue for the stock right is they had a 10 year plus run where everyone just focused on net ads and no one really cared about profits or cash flow. And when the net ads stopped, they sort of had no natural constituency on the buy side. The growth investors left, the value managers looked at the stock that was cut by 70%, and they looked on the cash list statement and there was no cash there. So they weren't interested. And so they were sort of in no man's land. And I think this ad tier is important because it should bring back subscriber growth, but importantly is also going to come with it material profits and cash flow. How quickly do you believe that Netflix is going to be able to really advertise, who marketers to run these massive spend campaigns that it's anticipating on its platform? Oh, I don't think it's going to be difficult at all. You know, marketers talk about top of funnel and bottom of funnel, right? And top of funnel is where you're spending ad dollars just to get consideration. And then bottom of funnel is where the consumer is very close to making a purchase decision. Most marketers almost all need both. And their problem is that the classic top of funnel medium that people would use television, linear television is going away. And so, you know, I think marketers are hungry for a scale large player to place ad dollars and Netflix is obviously a large scale player. So it will be no difficult. It will not be difficult at all for Netflix to attract advertisers. Jason, how big do you think that ad business could be next year? Well, this is the interesting debate. The where the buy side is struggling, I think, is to understand the key metric is not the ad dollars per se, but the way the buy side talks about it is the ad revenue per user that buys the ad tier. And the way we frame that, we think they can do $10 of advertising revenue per ad tier sub in the United States. That's really important because they've only offered consumers a $3 discount. So that means, you know, the buy side is all nervous about what they call spend down risk. What if someone's taking the ad free version and they spend down to the cheaper ad tier, isn't Netflix going to be in the hole? And the answer is exactly the opposite. It's not a spend down risk. It's a spin up opportunity because Netflix will get $3 less in subscriptions and we think $10 more in advertising. So net $7 to the good. You know, Jason, I think about maybe three years ago, we were talking about the golden age of television or, I guess, television in quotes, right? Video. And now it feels like there's just so much content out there that the overall quality is not what it was. Does does that matter? I mean, Netflix still has some prestige stuff that it throws out there once in a while. But a lot of the stuff on there is pretty much lowest common denominator. I don't know. Maybe I'm editorializing too much. But how are you thinking about that issue and does that matter? You know, it's so interesting when we went back and looked at content spend versus the size of each of the streamers. It was amazing and that it took about $140 a content spend to get a net ad. And it didn't matter whose content you were talking about. Whether it was great content, mediocre content. So that, but so what does that tell you? We were just in sort of the land grab phase where consumers were just so hungry for anything that was, you know, available on demand and commercial free. You know, I think it's natural that we'll start to shift and consumers will become more discerning. I think the interesting thing we know from, let's say, the days of HBO is there's sort of two types of content. There's the sort of marquee content that causes the consumer to consider buying the app. And then there's like all the other stuff that keeps you engaged with the app, right? And I think it's fair to say that Netflix has a lot of the ladder and not enough of the former. And so, you know, having those sort of tinpole marquee things to get the buzz is going to be important, but the point is it doesn't have to encompass the vast majority.",https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OFbNeKtIJNY,1,2022-10-19 13:55:38
3616," enough of the former. So, you know, having those sort of tinpole marquee things to get the buzz is going to be important. But the point is it doesn't have to encompass the vast majority of their total cash outlays. You just need a few of those trickling out that sort of capture the zeitgeist of the consumer to keep the consumer excited about it. But most of what they're going to be watching is what you and I would call low quality stuff. Is it other streaming companies that Netflix needs to steal advertising dollars from or is it other digital advertising platforms or behemoths like an alphabet or like a meta platforms from your perspective? I don't think it's either of those. It's just it's taking dollars from linear television. You know, the the the those other firms that you talked about those big digital guys are all bottom of funnel, right? Marketers are going to I think migrate dollars away from linear television and push it towards all of these things. You know, you can see about platforms or S-Fot platforms with ads. Giving us plenty to watch of varying qualities. Jason Bezzane, thank you so much. Really great analysis on all of this. Jason Bezzane is with City. Thanks. Coming up, Saaz is going to take us inside the C-suite and share the top five things he has learned from hearing from all of these company leaders we talked to over the past week. Okay, so Mr. Earlier this week we held our all market summits. Yahoo, finance is big annual event where we talked to all the marquee folks in business finance and beyond and of course, we talked to some of those folks. Brian Sazzi, avid viewer, not just a participant in that day. And so he was listening very closely to folks like target CEO Brian Cornell and GM CEO Mary Barra and he has some lessons from those folks who take away from what they had to say. That conference was dope. So let's run through some of these takeaways. Again, I wrote more about this in the morning brief newsletter on our home page right now. First up target CEO Brian.",https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OFbNeKtIJNY,2,2022-10-19 13:59:41
3617," We take away from the dance. That conference was dope. So let's run through some of these takeaways. Again, I wrote more about this in the morning brief newsletter on our homepage right now. First up, Target, CEO Brian Cornell telling me that they may be on maybe beyond the worst of the inventory. Glent and Julie, that is indeed a good thing. Yeah. There we go. Next up, Chipotle. I think Brian, I think Brian Nichol telling us that price increases. You know what? They might be increasing prices or just moving forward. But still, you have that takeaway. You see Chipotle shares up really pretty well under Nichols leadership in part because they have increased price. But also, they still are not feeling the effect of higher minimum wages. It's something to watch out for, especially in California. We talked about this yesterday. And Brad, you know, very interesting and important and key ingredient Chipotle story. Ultimately. Yeah, the two bowls are going to get a little bit more expensive. Yes, indeed. All right. Next up, Hilton, you and I talked to the CEO of Hilton. That's Chris Nassetta. Travel. The travel rebound is looking pretty strong. So that was interesting and very much dovetails with what you talked to Delta CEO at the Bastion about and what I talked to Brian Moynihan, Bank of America CEO, as well. Consumer spending looks to be holding up. Paramount, our very own Alexandra Canal, sniffing out really or just, I think getting Bob back, I should see a Paramount to expand more on their plans for streaming. Streaming looks very strong. Something we heard about, of course, from Netflix last night, that stock is ripping higher. I'm not surprised based relative to what we heard from Paramount. And then bonus one here are two more. I should say General Motors, CEO Marabara telling our energy any so far. More electric vehicles are coming, not one, not two. But there's a barrage of EVs coming that are going to look to challenge Tesla in the months and years ahead. And lastly, a bonus one. I caught up with Goldman Sachs of CFO Dennis Coleman yesterday after their quarter, asked him if there's any workforce reductions coming up. He said no dramatic reductions. Now that is not saying no reductions, but they're going to have to make some fine tuning, given the declines, them and all of Wall Street has seen in deal activity this year. It's really hard to pick out a common theme. Because a lot of what you said sounded pretty positive. Then you get the likes of Jamie Diamond, you know, raising a lot of red flags about the economic growth and economists who we talked to, who were also cautious about the economy. So it's difficult to sort of synthesize all of this into a coherent narrative. Well, I did. In fact, there's my take. And I think that perfectly summarizes everything you just brought up. It is a weird time to be an investor. In many respects, receipt economic growth slowed out. We're seeing consumer price inflation still at a 40-year high. But again, you have a proctor and gamble coming out here beating on earnings, Goldman Sacks, beating on earnings, Bank of America beating on earnings. It's strange. We need like a wolf sound with that full screen. I guess. Something aggressive. You're, or you and, you know, the Michael Jackson thriller. There you go. There you go. All right, guys, coming up on the other side of this short break. Why are next guests expects an upcoming recession that hits the economy much harder than anticipated? It's coming up. It's coming up. It's coming up. It's coming up. It's coming up. It's coming up.",https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OFbNeKtIJNY,3,2022-10-19 14:04:10
3618," Hey Welcome back to Yowl Finance. I'm Brian Sasey alongside Julie Heiming and Brad Smith. Markets, well we're seeing some a little bit of red action on the screen despite a better than expected earnings you for from PNG. CEO John Mueller told me the consumer is staying resilient in the face of high inflation, but nonetheless right now we're seeing the markets in the red. Now here's what's on tap for you this hour. Here comes Tesla's earnings. Our senior auto correspondent, Presseuber Maiden, teased up Tesla's earnings for you as they are out after the close. The demand for faucets, Fortune Brand, CEO Nicholas Fink, stops by for an in-depth look into the building products maker amid the housing market slowdown. In over session that's a take from Bank of America, CEO Brian Moynihan and my chat with him just moments ago will have that interview coming up. Brad, over to you. All right, take a look at the major averages here as we've struck the top of the 10 AM hour, 30 minutes into trade and I want to give you a three-day look at what's kind of taken place here over the course of this week. Even despite today's little blip-a-dip blip, we are seeing us hold on to a three-day gain of about 2.8% here for the Dow Jones industrial average. The NASDAQ composite, you're seeing that hold on to gains of about 3.7% over that three-day period. But here today, right now, down by about 6.35% minutes into trade. Also the S&P 500, you're seeing that lower on the day. That's down by about half a percent. We ran through some of the sectors earlier, but I'd love to shift your attention over to retail as we're keeping an eye on some of those names, especially within that consumer discretionary construct or discussion here, and especially going into a holiday season where we're still going to be looking through Amazon, Walmart, and some of these sales that are set to commence that have already actually kicked off. Walmart actually announced this morning that they are not going to be open on Thanksgiving. That continues what we had seen over some recent years as well in 2020 and 2021. So keep a close eye on these retail names. Amazon down by about 1.7% Walmart down by about 2% of a percent target. Also lower on the day by about 6% of a percent. So that's a retail roundup if you will for right now. This is the top of the 10 a.m. hour. Julie? Oh, no, actually no. We've got a guest that's coming in. Although it may feel like we're already in one many economists, still don't think the US meets the formal definition of a recession based on broader measures such as income, spending, and job growth. The street is currently expecting a recession sometime in the first quarter of 2023, but our next guest says it will take a bit more time joining us now. You've got Jeffrey senior economist Thomas Simon's Thomas. Great to have you here with us today. Help us really run through what your expectations are and why and when, why in terms of the catalysts and then when in terms of timing you're expecting a recession to hit. Sure. So I think the main difference between our call and many of our competitors is just this sense that the economy is really approaching this period of time from a position of much greater strength than it typically does as it rolls into the recession. So you know, you pointed out just the chart before you had a couple of quarters of negative GDP growth, but Q3 is really shaping up to be quite a bit stronger. Thank you for, you know, I don't have any expectations that we're going to end up with.",https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OFbNeKtIJNY,4,2022-10-19 14:08:39
3619," the chart before you had a couple of quarters of negative GDP growth, but Q3 is really shaping up to be quite a bit stronger. In Q4, I don't have any expectations and we're going to end up with a negative number again. It's really into the second half of next year that we're going to start to see the cumulative effects of all the hikes start to really hit and plus the strength of the dollar as well. I don't think that we've really seen much evidence that that's actually taken a big bite out of economic activity just yet because the economy is just generally less interest rate sensitive that it normally is at this point in the business cycle. Lots of consumers and businesses already have a lot of locked in cheap borrowing that doesn't need to be refinanced anytime soon. You look at things like mortgage rates and these sorts of things that are spiking, but consumers don't have a lot of adjustable rate loans. So the same sort of dynamic is at play with businesses, with balance sheets are very, very strong. We haven't seen much margin compression just yet either. These sorts of things we expect are going to start to really take hold into the second half of 2023, especially as effect continues to raise interest rates here. Thomas, man, we have been on the drumbeat for this recession for what feel is like so long now. And now it sounds like according to you, we're going to be on it for a while longer before we actually get there. You in your latest note have this sort of scenario that you're painting of entering it later. And then I believe in the first quarter of 2024 seeing the worst of it with a drop in of 2.3 percent in growth here or in GDP, I should say. What is that going to feel like? How does that comport with what we are hearing generally painting a picture of a relatively mild recession? I mean, 2.3 percent is that a relatively mild recession? Now what it all happens in one quarter, it's not going to feel particularly great. One thing to keep in mind is that it's not going to feel like 2020 and it's not going to feel like 2009 either. Even though 2.4 percent are thereabouts for a quarterly decline is something that we are not used to and seems like a lot in the context of some pretty positive growth rates we've seen recently. It's not totally out of the question relative to how the economy used to behave before the financial crisis. So I mean, I think it's interesting that just in the past segment that we had before, we're talking about all these comments from CEOs about how the inventory cycle isn't as bad as they thought. You know, margins are still good. Pricing power is still pretty well retained. These sorts of things are what's going to push us a little bit further and is what again, is going to have to make the fed raise rates even a little bit higher and is going to cause us to fall farther and faster and slow down faster when we get into the second half of 2023 and into 2024 like you mentioned as well. So Thomas, you know, against this backdrop of a recession next year at some point of some magnitude, what happens to inflation? So inflation, we expect this going to gradually slow through this year, you know, the remainder of this year and into next year. We probably have peaked, I want to say, although I feel like we've been saying that inflation has peaked since March of this year, something like that. And then we continue to see this really sticky pressure in a lot of the core measures, you know, specifically housing seems to be pushing us recently. I do think that as we get into the second half of or into the first half of next year, excuse me, we will see a gradual decline and then more of acceleration of that decline as we get into the second half of next year as unemployment rises. It's really that's the key, is that the Fed needs to raise rates to lower demand, which is going to lower employment, raise the unemployment rate and get us to lower inflation eventually into next year. The question is how much does unemployment have to really rise, right? That's certainly an open point of debate at the Fed right now. We think that the unemployment rate probably has to get above 5% before we're going to get meaningful significant deceleration towards target for inflation because, you know, with inflation so high as it is now, it can decelerate a lot and still be uncomfortably above target for the Fed. 5% out. All right, Jeffrey, senior economist Thomas Simon, thank you so much. Really appreciate perspective here. And even big tech can't shake off the economic slowdown that we have been again looking ahead to for a long time. Yeah, who finds this tech editor Dan Halley is joining us now.",https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OFbNeKtIJNY,5,2022-10-19 14:12:53
3620," And even big tech can't shake off the economic slowdown that we have been again looking ahead to for a long time. Yeah, who finds this tech editor Dan Halley is joining us now. And obviously we've been paying a lot of attention to tech and sort of a retrenchment in tech. But you've got a sort of big picture look at what we're seeing. Yeah, so we're talking about the different variables that are going into kind of the tech industry right now and what we're seeing. You know, we usually look at tech obviously is kind of not necessarily not even close to you know recession proof, but they we have these stalwarts that you think can weather these storms pretty well. But we're starting to see cracks in this kind of facade. So Microsoft obviously announcing layoffs yesterday not saying how many exactly we had, but about a thousand is what the going number is. That follows their prior move to layoff about one percent of their workforce in July. So Microsoft despite being this huge cloud company that does incredibly well in that area. They had you know, a double digit growth in cloud in the prior quarter. They're still having to contend with these kinds of issues. We have meta and Intel to the worst performers right now. Metastock down 60% year to date. Intel down 49% year to date. We also have meta pushing people out the door not necessarily laying people off, but saying maybe you're not right for this position in so many words. We had Google they weren't necessarily laying people people off, but they closed their area 120 division, which does some research for different products. And so they shuttered those products and they had these people reapply for jobs. And then when you look at the consumer side of things, we have Apple yesterday basically not announcing, but the reports coming out that they're cutting production of their iPhone 14 plus. And that was prior to that we had heard that they were reducing some of the production for their iPhone 14 in general to about what the iPhone 13 levels were. This whole idea of big tech being this huge force, obviously the idea that them being immune to any kind of market factors is really, I mean that's not true at all. But we are starting to see kind of the pain really set in for these companies. And I talked to some people, they're saying that essentially this isn't going to get better until perhaps some point in 2023. At least for the tech industry could go into 2024 though. There's effects concerns that they've cited as well. Many of these tech businesses, if not all of them are certainly impacted by that. But then you mentioned the consumer side and if we can go deeper into that, you know what does that really spell out for this holiday season for some of the consumer technology that they're expecting to move through into households and into consumers hands? You know it's interesting because as obviously these a lot of products haven't companies haven't raised prices on consumer products just yet. At least here in the US overseas we've seen Apple raised prices. We saw Sony raised prices on their PlayStation 5. Obviously a big holiday gift, you know both of those. If you could find it. If you could find it. Now it's a little bit easier because not everybody's looking for them again. I do think that we're seeing this issue with not just the slowdown in the PC market which we've been talking about. That obviously impacts the likes of Microsoft, Intel, AMD, Nvidia. It's all these kind of knock on effects, the memory chip makers. But we're starting to perhaps see it on the smartphone inside of things. And that would then start to hit the likes of Apple, the likes of Samsung companies in those areas. So I do think that we're going to see fewer people spending on these big ticket items. I video games I think you're still going to do pretty well. We have a couple that are coming out that are big names. But you know I don't know if it's going to necessarily be this huge blow up that we saw during the pandemic where gaming was so big. But you know that should still continue to do well. But you know the PCs, the tablets. I don't necessarily know if people are going to be getting those. Just because they already bought them. And so you're going to a season where people are trying to save maybe. I don't know if those are going to do particularly well. There's only so much space you have in your place to store the next computer, Dan Allen me, man. I know, right? Dan Allen. Great analysis. Appreciate it.

Coming up, Mackenzie Scott is making a big donation to the Girl Scouts of America, Julie will break down today's top headlines next. You Let's get down to business now. Look at some of the other headlines that we are watching. One of them involves French cement maker Lafars. It's going to pay $778 million in penalties for conspiring to support the Islamic State and in Al Qaeda affiliate. In 2013 and 2014, the company made regular payments to the Islamic State to protect its cement plant in Syria from attack. That agreement evolved into a de facto revenue sharing scheme in which Lafars actively concealed payments by forging invoices. Although Lafars' Syrian subsidiary involved in the scheme is now defunct, the company's guilty plea marks the first time a company has been charged with providing material support and resources to a terrorist organization. The TSMC could expand its production capacity in Japan, according to the Wall Street Journal. That move helps Taiwan's semiconductor hedge its chip production against potential conflicts over Taiwan. While as an increasingly belligerent China continues to claim the self-governed island as part of its territory, a new Japanese plant would be in addition to one already established in Kyushu and would focus on chips used in automobiles and sensors.

It's the largest donation by a single person to that youth program. Scott, who divorced Amazon founder Jeff Bezos in 2019, had earlier pledged to give away about half of her fortune to charity. The Girl Scout says the funds will be used to expand STEM and career training in its programs. Soz? If Tesla earnings are out after the close today, yeah, finance senior auto correspondent Prasdub remaining has a previous surprise. I'm guessing Tesla is going to be by 10 cents. Stocks going higher, right? I mean, with the bulls, I'm a lot better. Yeah, you know, I think it's going to be all about the delivering, I'm sorry, the demand and production sort of outlook and story there. Big headline numbers here, we're looking at about 22.13 billion. We'll be its highest ever record, highest ever, quarterly record on adjusted EPS of $1.02 cents, gap net income of $3.2 billion, that would be near it all the time. So, you know, a big quarter for them in the books, but we're all watching that. Can they hit that 1.4 million 2022 annual production kind of delivery outlook? You have to make 500,000 vehicles in Q4, which is, you know, possible. But the question is, is there demand? You know, there's concern about demand slowing in China and things like that. But, you know, other things we're going to watch, for me personally, I'm going to kind of watch about these. And Tesla semi kind of outlook, are they going to be able to hit that delivery, December 1st delivery kind of with Pepsi and what's coming up for that in 2023? And then also what's happening to Cybertruck? Is that still on track for mid next year? Okay, and so it's all about where we're also going to hear capacity being brought online at some of the new factories, whether that's Austin or Berlin. What do we expect there and how many vehicles are they going to continue to produce at these factories? So, you know, last quarter, they said that free amount was about 450,000 vehicles a year. Shanghai, they say 850,000 vehicles a year, install capacity. So that's already 1.3. The rest, Austin, Giga, Berlin. You get a couple hundred thousand from each of those, they're still ramping up. So maybe you're at 1.5, 1.7 give or take. I think that's what the street is looking for. But they're going to have to hit about 2 million in 2023 to hit that 50% compound annual growth rate. There's a lot a long way to go, but in the question also, it's like, you know, how can they keep raising prices for their cars and then also in this kind of slowing global macro environment, are those, you know, sales going to come down potentially? Did we talk about mask being on the call yet? Did we talk about that? We didn't talk about that. He's going to be on the call. Yeah, he's going to be on the call, which he hasn't been on the call's recently. And you have to wonder, like, the whole Twitter thing is still going on, but he hasn't really gotten a lot of questions directly about that. So you wonder, are Tesla analysts going to ask about that? I don't know. It's scared. They're going to have to ask about the call. What's the hell it's going to say? They posted a couple of the institutional questions that they did on their like, they they pulled a survey monkey kind of thing and also their top retail investor questions. I didn't see any on the, what is Musk going to do with Twitter, etc. on there. Probably asked about stock sales, but I didn't see anything about his role in Twitter as of yet. I'm going to get that. Yeah. I feel that confused. We'll see how much of this time goes there. Ross, thanks so much, you know, you're going to be tracking this after the close very closely. Everyone coming up, President Biden has unfailed his plan to combat oil production cuts by OPEC Plus. We're going to share the details next. preservation community. So nice.",https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OFbNeKtIJNY,8,2022-10-19 14:26:14
3623," song ends President Biden has unveiled his plan to release 15 million barrels of oil from the U.S. strategic reserve in response to OPEC-plus production cuts. Yahoo, finances Rick Newman joins us now with the details. Hey Rick. All right. So Biden is now going to release more oil from the U.S. strategic reserve and other 15 million barrels. This is a continuation of a program that's been going on since May. And that was originally supposed to end in October. And it has now been extended into November. And then in December. And I wonder why that might be. Oh, it could only be the midterm elections. Biden obviously wants to look like he's doing something continually to get gasoline priced down. There's another important element of this though that's new. It's getting less attention, but it might be more important by the energy department is going to do something new and they're going to enter into contracts to buy oil from the private sector from the market at prices of around $70. And the reason that's important is that it is telling oil producers that there's going to be demand for oil even when the price falls below current levels. So the government is kind of establishing itself as a customer of last resort, if you will. And the thinking behind this is oil producers will say, oh, well, if oil prices fall, we will still be able to sell it to the government at prices where we can make a profit. And so that's a little bit of extra demand that producers know will be there in the future. And that might get them to produce more oil. We will find out this goes all the way into 2324 and probably even into 2025. So it's meant to have a long term effect on oil supplies. But that also continues the sort of thorny questions of climate change and the sort of push pull that the Biden administration has done with the oil industry, right? If they're, you know, saying on the one hand, everybody should be transitioning to renewables. On the other hand, we're going to be buying oil from you for a few years for $70. But I guess that also helps ease the transition for the oil companies. You're right, Julie. But I think one of the things that we should have clearly learned in 2022 is we need a better bridging strategy from fossil fuels to renewables because we don't have nearly enough renewables to replace fossil fuels right now. And because markets, energy markets are priced at the margins, you could have just a small shortfall of oil or natural gas or whatever it might be. And prices can double or go up by more than double. So, you know, Obama during the Obama administration, he had a phrase.",https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OFbNeKtIJNY,9,2022-10-19 14:30:03
3624," whatever it might be. And prices can double or go up by more than double. So, you know, Obama during the Obama administration, he had a phrase, you know, what's our approach to energy, all of the above. And I think Democrats got away from that and they pushed a little bit too hard on renewables without figuring out how to meet, you know, the demand for the fuel that we need today. And I don't think Biden's going to come out and say this, but I think what we're seeing from the Biden administration is kind of an all of the above energy strategy, which is acknowledge that we need these fossil fuels today. And we need to we need to assure these supplies for the next several years while at the same time pushing for renewables. Good analysis. Y'all find this is senior columnist Rick Newman. Good to see you. Hi guys. Coming up, we'll share my interview with Bank of America. See a Brian Lonehan on the back of there better than expected earnings report earlier this week. That's next. Welcome back. Bank of America. See a Brian Lonehan tells me spending remains strong among consumers and that a recession may not be imminent. Take a listen. Nice to be with you again. And my teammates produced a great quarter again. And I thank you for that. But I think if you're talking about what we saw at our customers in turn of the consumer spending for the third quarter of 2022, the consumers spent about 10% more than they did in the third quarter of 2021. So 2022, third quarter, 10% over through third quarter 2021. And frankly, for the first couple of weeks, I told we've seen that same 10% increase. Now, when you think about that spending, think about two things. One, it is still very strong at a relative basis. Even the transactions are up 6% outpaces inflation. Travel being a very growing part because coming from last year when you had the delta",https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OFbNeKtIJNY,10,2022-10-19 14:34:24
3625," the situation, travel being a very growing part because coming from last year when we had the Delta of COVID, you know, variant to this year, people are traveling. But on top of that, though, be mindful that early in the year is probably more like a 13, 14 percent to 12 percent to 10 percent. So it's being mitigated. So I think the feds, changes and rates, the concerns about it's going out there, people are slowing down a bit, but not slowing down consistent with a real slowdown economy yet. And that's the good news. Brian, that's interesting. You're calling out 10 percent growth through October. And I just talked to Proctor and Gamble CEO after their earnings. They're talking about a resilient consumer. Are you surprised by the resilience we're seeing in US consumers here? Well, we talked in our earnings materials about resilient consumer, frankly. And you think about that long three or two or three dimensions. First is the unemployment, obviously, is still very low. People working. And second is, do they have money in their bank accounts? In the bank accounts of our consumers, our 35 million core households at Bank of America. At the end of September was the same as it was at the end of August. And in fact, it's multiples, multiples, over where it was before the pandemic, especially for those consumers who are in the $100,000 under income bracket. That means that they haven't spent down the stimulus and stuff. And while I say multiples, I give you an example. I've never had about an average of $3,500 in account pre-pandemic, now has 13,000 in account. And it's not going down. So that's goodness. So one, they have money in accounts. Two, they're spending. Three, they are employed. Four, they have capacitive borrow. Our credit card borrowings are still about 12 percent below where they were pre-pandemic. Home equity line draws are down about 25, 30 percent still. Now mortgage finances slow down because rates went up. But the people have home equity lines in place or have capacitive borrow. The house values are still strong. So all that bodes well. Now inflation hurts consumers, especially consumers in modern income because inflation and goods and services, they spend a lot of their income on. But, you know, so we have to be careful about the overall position versus certain types of consumers. But generally, the American consumer is very resilient. Brian, a lot of your peers on the street over the past few weeks have come out and warned about a recession sometime over the next six months. Of course, that brings us into 2023. Where does Brian Monahan suit? Well, I don't make those projections. I have this talented research team, one of the best in the world, if not the best in the world, run by Candace Browning, Platt and the team. And they basically been consistent. They have this quarter, meaning the past quarter, third quarter, 22 growing. Then they have the fourth quarter, the first quarter, the second quarter, the third quarter, all in negative territories, around half percent, one to one and a half percent. So a slight shallow down, and we're trending and growing at the end of next year. They have pushed that projection for recession out a little bit into 23. But the core belief, it's a mild recession. It's coupled with unemployment. It gets up to, you know, four to half to five percent. A Fed funds rate, likewise around five percent. But inflation does get under control and we come out of that recession. That's the core projection. Now against that, though, the real facts are today, the consumers are spending commercial credits and grade shape, consumer credits and grade shape. Even though things like housing and stuff like that have flattened out because that's the way the Fed slows down the economy, the reality is a consumer store employed earning money. And so the Fed's toughest job and inflation is also the best thing about the U.S. economy, which is a strong consumer. So our team predicts a recession, a mild recession. They've had that projection, frankly, for six months ago, they had the same projection more or less. It just pushed out a little bit. But what we're not seeing is it come to four yet and that keeps moving it out because of that resiliency and the consumer. By all indications, Brian, the Federal Reserve is going to continue to move higher with rates over the course of its next few meetings. What does that mean for your net interest margins over the next couple quarters? Well, one of the things that people know about banking is a core way you make a half-hour money or more is through what they call a spread. I either difference between what we lend a customer money and what we pay on the deposits and the money customers give us where we can borrow in the market. And that margin had been compressed dramatically as rates fell. And so it expands back out, getting to a more normal level, which it usually is, and that has shown a rapid increase in net interest.",https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OFbNeKtIJNY,11,2022-10-19 14:39:00
3626," and compressed dramatically as rates fell. And so it expands back out, getting to more normal level, which it usually is, and that has shown a rapid increase in net extent, or NII improvement over last year. As you look for, we told our shareholders earlier this week that we'd expect another billion dollars plus increase from the third quarter to the fourth quarter. But that's driven by the great core deposit franchise we have. We have a lot of zero interest checking balances, which are transaction accounts, which money flows for all time. That will stay in zero interest no matter what the rate environment. Then the rest of our deposit rates move up, and the loan rates move up, and we'll get back to the two and a half percent spread that we have typically made in our balance sheet. It's been depressed for the last few years, and then was okay in a 17th time when the rates came up. It was depressed before that. So, you know, this is really the basic structure banking to get back to margin in those ranges as opposed to a depressed margin under two percent we've had for the last few quarters. Want to give your team a shout out here, Brian? Global markets business of 30% in the quarter. Strongest since the third quarter of 2010, but no trading lost days in the quarter. Despite all the market volatility we've seen, how does that happen? And do you think that can continue and just be sustained over the next few quarters? Well, it happens because we have a talent team and Jimmy DeMar that runs a business force has, you know, been a running major parts of business for a long time, took over the whole business last year and we went on Montag retired. And so, it's a great business. The team that works for Jimmy's very solid, but it also comes from a decade long focus on responsible growth. We're in a business to move and risk through the system. We're in a business of managing risk. We're in a business of helping customers achieve what they want, not taking big principal risk. And therefore, evil and market volatility a team did good job and we didn't lose money on a trading day. But by the way, if you look back across the last 10, 12 years, very rarely do we lose money. Maybe a couple of trading days of quarter when something really changes dramatically. But this year, what we saw is from last year to this year, the investments we've made in the last couple of years in the business in terms of talent, technology, even more capital, more balance sheet capacity, has shown up and our team has a consistent drive to it. And Jimmy and the team did a great job this quarter and we expect them to do more next quarter. And lots there to unpack from Bank of America CEO Brian Monhan. Mikey, take it away, was that Oxails in October, consumer spending in October, up 10%. So still running at double digits, despite what we're seeing with inflation and the economy's going down. They had a lot of new credit card accounts that they added on during the quarter as well. They got into this a little bit more on the earnings call, 1.3 million new credit card accounts. And you know I love talking about this shift right now that we're seeing and how consumers are spending because it's so important, especially as households are really looking through where their spending capacity is. That's why it was diving into retail earlier on because going into this holiday season, it's just going to be a huge question of how consumers are spending, where they are trying to figure out, okay, are we in a recession? Are we going into a recession? And what do I need to do now, preemptively to prepare for that too? Well, if unemployment is going to 5% at some time in late 2023, 2024, they still have some time to save, they'll spend a little bit less before that happens. I don't know. All right, coming up, housing market headwinds, we'll speak with the CEO of Fortune Brands and home security. That's next. Why don't we build a rest room?",https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OFbNeKtIJNY,12,2022-10-19 14:43:38
3627," MUSIC We're rising interest rates are causing new headwinds in the housing market. Our next guest though says any slowdown should be relatively short-lived. Fortune Brands home and security CEO Nicholas Fink is joining us now and Fortune Brands home to a lot of different brands that people use in their houses, mown faucets, for example, master lock is another one of your brands. So talk to us about what you're seeing in this current cycle. Well, you know, in the cycle right now you're at a point where, you know, we have seen a lot of home price appreciation. You are seeing obviously mortgage rates go up significantly and that does put pressure on the consumer and the affordability of housing, right? And so what did you expect to see and we've seen in prior points in the cycle? As you do see a slowdown in new construction, you may see a slowdown in home sales turnover. But ultimately, the market remains fundamentally underbuilt. There are huge demographic tailwinds in need for housing, particularly in our core US market. And there's this little thing called supply and demand, which will always come back into effect over time. And so the fundamentals of housing are very, stronger, very intact. There is a period of softness that we expect to see as consumers, buyers and sellers adjust to this affordability pricing in the market interest rates. And we've usually seen that take anywhere between one to three quarters and then the market digestives and people get back to get back to some home turnover. Ultimately, as I've said, housing is not a discretionary purchase. The timing of housing may be discretionary, but ultimately it's not a discretionary purchase that people come back to the marketplace. Nicholas, we were talking earlier on about a company called Genorac. And they warned this morning about higher inventory levels in the channel. Now you're a major player at home due point and lows. I mean, what are you seeing from these home improvement chains in terms of inventory given things have slowdown? Right. Well, they do an excellent job managing inventory, managing working capital. We work very closely with them. Now, one of the hallmarks of our business is in addition to really managing our brands and innovation really, really well. We do manage our channel and our service to the channel really well. So if you look back at how we've performed through the whole COVID period, you would have seen that we were able to serve at superior levels. We were able to gain market share as a consequence. And so we've been back in the market, I would say. Certain customers really well. And as a consequence, we've seen inventories right size over the period. And we talked about that previously. And so there's certainly dollar inventory.",https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OFbNeKtIJNY,13,2022-10-19 14:47:29
3628," consequence we've seen inventories right size over the period. And we talked about that previously. And so, you know, I, you know, the certainly dollar inventory is higher as pricing and inflation is the impact of the cost of inventory. But I think it a lot of our major customers that is kind of equalizing over time as service levels come back into line. I mean, at the end of the day, it's still going to come down to where we're seeing more of the DIY projects that perhaps move forward from this point. If people are getting into some of the user, not used, but existing homes out there on the market. And so as you're kind of tracking both the health of real estate more broadly as well as how that correlates to your business, what are your expectations going into next year where there's already been a slowdown in housing? Right. Well, you know, you come back to that fundamental right? The consumer over time is going to need housing. The US market's hugely underbuilt. And so over time, we're going to have to add more homes into the marketplace. So, you know, that's a fact. I think we'll see a slowdown in your construction. You saw some of that in today's data, although it put it in context. I mean, single family in your constructions now at 2019 levels and multi-family is still well about. That's on today's data, right? And so kind of returning to that pre-COVID levels. But you have a lot of consumers that are in homes with, you know, the majority of mortgages are below 4%. You know, those homes need renovation. And you know, even today we're seeing consumer interest. For example, we look at Google search data, you know, 25, 35% above pre-COVID levels. And so people are really interested in the home. They're really interested in that space. And so we expect that to carry through. Now, you know, you may again see a period of softness around some uncertainty. I think as we get into 2023, that's a fair expectation. We pride ourselves in being able to manage those and actually turn them into opportunity to gain more share, really, to like the consumers and meet the consumers where they are with our brains. But, you know, over the medium term to long term, we expect both from the art and our perspective as well as new construction consumers to come right back in and be supporting the tremendous equity that they have in their homes today. And Nicholas, when it comes to your business, how much is split between going directly into the retail channels to how much ends up in professional hands? And kind of how does that ever flow with the housing market? Yeah, I mean, we're still, you know, very heavily geared to work towards the old sell channel. So if you think about it's probably 23rd, 23rd, similarly for renovation and repair, we're 23rds new construction more, you know, one third or less or some international markets as well. Until that is very much the gearing of the poor falling. And, you know, there's a little bit of ebb and flow. I think depending on times, you know, where products sit, we inventories that, you know, you saw some of that during the pandemic. As the retailers opened up, people really went in there looking for product that inventory there able to service the channel. You know, but that's our broad exposure. But, you know, we really focus on meeting the consumers where they are. And, you know, one of the big drivers, I think, in the home market over the next period, is really going to be creating affordable homes for consumers in the US. And, you know, here the builders talk a lot about the work they're going to do to create affordable homes. You know, we geared up, we're following it to be at the heart of the market. And so whether it's a consumer that's moving up through the price points with some of our higher end brands and offerings or whether it's really at the heart of the market, you know, we've had the portfolio very, very good to meet them there. At good margins. And so we'll continue to do that and continue to leverage the brains and the innovation to be at that point. And I think that's going to play very strongly through, you know, both the retail as well as the wholesale channels. Nicholas, I recently got a new faucet and it's one of those touchless faucets. And once I installed it, I'm like, wow, why have I not been using this the past 10 years of my life? I'm glad I traded up to get it. I think it just works. It's good. You know, but what type of innovation? What's the next big product for a brand like a moment? Well, I'll tell you, I mean, as we, you know, as you may know, we're taking the company through a separation of some of our businesses now. One of our cabinets business that's, you know, really going to focus on being.",https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OFbNeKtIJNY,14,2022-10-19 14:51:56
3629," Well, I'll tell you, I mean, as you may know, we're taking the company through a separation of some of our businesses now, one of our cabinet's business that's really going to focus on being the best in that industry. But then the rest of the business and you're touching on sort of water management business is really going to be focused on super-charge categories. So things that are connected, water management, outdoor living, things that really, really drive consumer value. And that experience you have, I'm smiling because I hear that all the time. I mean, I've got this in and how did I live without it? I mean, we're actually taking that product line as an example to a completely connected ecosystem inside of the house. I mean, it's the touchless faucet that's going to be connected to where it already is. An AI system that understands water flowing in house can tell you if you've got a leak. And shut your main down. If you're going to have a catastrophic leak, we'll save just an absolute fortune for homeowners and insurers can protect you from freezes, can protect you from health threats by managing your water supply. And so that experience you're having is really one of the most exciting moments in our industry. It's really this convergence from historical kind of mechanical water management into these connected products that we have in the marketplace. Nicholas, I wish you would have told me that before. I would have not gotten this touchless. I want to know when there's leaks. I mean, that makes sense. That's a good product. That's a good product. We can help you out with that. No problem. Anything that's going to help Amazon packages from getting stolen? We do have some great security products in our monster-like portfolio. And again, becoming more and more connected and remote is kind of the big driver of that portfolio. So stay tuned. All right. We'll accept that for now. Nick Fink, who is the fortune brand's home in security CEO. We appreciate the time here with you today. Guys coming up. Inflation may now impact your tax bracket. On the other side. Slap on dub a. It's time for a cup of time. Three stories, one minute each. We start with this on the day. You might find yourself in a new tax bracket next year. The IRS says it's raising tax brackets and standard deductions by 7% for the 2020-23 tax season.

3630," Tax brackets and standard deductions by 7% for the 2023 tax season. The move is in response to high inflation giving taxpayers a chance to shield more of their earnings from income tax. All right. The IRS. Everybody's cold. Yeah. This is an automatic thing. Actually, remember they just did it for Social Security also. Now they are doing it for taxes also. And it doesn't just affect like the highest earners. It also affects things like a state taxes. So it's this automatic adjustment that happens that Congress put in place. And I don't think there's a lot of awareness about it because we haven't had as big an increase in inflation for a long time. So this is the biggest adjustment to this for a long time. You consumer spending boom in the spring next year. I kind of like that. I think that it's also an acknowledgement too for the IRS and looking at the tax brackets, especially as they know that they're needing to add on more to their workforce as well. I mean, the IRS right now is still so backlogged. And so this could. Oh, we're taxed. Oh, we're taxed. Sorry. Indeed. All right, taxes to rides. Lyft can help you find a parking spot now. The ride sharing app launched Lyft Parking, a partnership with Chicago-based spot hero. Feature lets you search, reserve, and pay for parking spaces in the app. So I already reserved the closest six spots to the mall in Black Friday. So sorry guys, but I'm really not sorry because this is great. I mean, there are lots of other apps that already do this. Real? Yes. I do. Yes. I can't. You can book most garages in New York City garages. You can't book spots on the street necessarily. So maybe there's not as much competition for that market, but I mean, this business already exists. I'm going to try to book the hot spots in front of restaurants. I mean, I drive nice cars. But it has to be a spot with a meter. You can't just go and park them all. Oh, okay. I thought, well, I'm missing. It's great. It's like a spot. It has to have a meter there that is hooked up to assist. Oh, then I cast my car cap here for the restaurant. Wait, where am I? There's a meter there you can. It's going to reserve a spot to the restaurant this weekend. I'm sorry. I apologize. Anyway, if you were lucky enough to have an adult happy meal from McDonald's, you may have a big payday in your future. The toys that came inside the meal are now selling on eBay for thousands, which one listed as high as $300,000 if you want to buy one yourself. Don't worry, there are plenty on the website still selling for 10 or 20 bucks. The whole set could run you up to $70. The fry smell, it comes with it for free. You ever notice that? Like the stuff in the happy meal retains that. You know how much of a big playday to see you were talking about this? Look at how it's $1000. That's a happy meal. Yeah. It's a happy meal. You know, shots of McDonald's look. They can't have these toys. They're just some buds. They're just some traffic. Also out with the Halloween pells, which I know are three to five team previewed, you know, plastic, pale, big innovation right there from McDonald's. Very excited about it. I'm an innovation. It's retro. They have them before. I know, I used to have one as a kid. I always wanted to use a pillowcase. My mom would not let me. I'd use this dumb hell, but there they are on the screen. The pells are awesome. You wanted to use it. The little kids wanted to use, all the cookers use pillowcases. Pillocases were cool. What's the like and filly? I mean, I don't remember getting to the right, honestly. But on Hollywood, what do you use? Oh, I didn't go Halloween trick or treating, going up. Oh, wow. We have to talk about this offline. OK, coming up, the Kiko Pajina is going to continue our discussion of today's hottest earnings reports, including Netflix and avid labs. This, as we see, a mixed picture for stocks that down now in the green. This is the one brand of Instagram. They go away. This is how the two kids encounter",https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OFbNeKtIJNY,16,2022-10-19 15:00:45
3631,"把 Welcome to Yahoo Finance Live. It is 11 a.m. here in New York City. I'm a Kiko Fuji. Here's where we're watching at this hour. Netflix shares still in rally mode after a strong third quarter report, but higher treasure yields keeping a lid on enthusiasm for tech. Our panel is ready and waiting to get into those numbers. I, on the midterms, abide in administration poise to dip into the strategic reserve yet again, as conflicting signals point to both bullish and bearish catalysts for crude. We're going to get the very latest report out of Washington DC in just a bit. And I, P, know the market for global stock listings has had a dire 2022 and this struggle to raise cash is just as real in the US can intel a mobile line be the rising tide that lifts all boats. We'll speak with S&P Global about that. Let's check in on the market action though 90 minutes into the trading day. We've had a bit of a choppy session here right now. The Dow, the only one that's in the green up about 38 points, the S&P 500 up or down 12 and the NASDAQ down 50. And we've been talking a lot about earnings results there numbers out from United, PNG, among the companies that have helped kind of provide support at those levels. But it is about treasurer yields today as we see the 10 year yield coming over that of 4% level and certainly that weighing on investor sentiment at least so far in the this session. Well, Netflix shares seeing a boost after beating estimates for the third quarter. The streaming giant saw rise and subscriber growth once again. It's now expected to add another four and a half million subscribers in the fourth quarter. But streaming isn't the only thing on Netflix's mind as it looks to also expand into cloud gaming joining us now with more on Netflix's journey ahead is Gita Ranganapa. Bloomberg intelligence senior media analysts. We've also got Dave Hedger. He is Edward Jones, senior equity analyst. Welcome to both of you today. Gita, let me start with you. I mean, certainly we have seen a big rally in the stock, although you could argue that's fallen so much. Expectations were pretty low coming in. They did beat on the sub numbers. What else stood out to you? Yeah, so I think definitely the one thing that stood out is this company is clearly back on track. I mean, of course, the three key numbers were definitely much stronger than expected. But I think what was equally reassuring and even encouraging is the four cube guidance kind of came in slightly higher than consensus. And remember, this was not even factoring in a huge catalyst that they have on the horizon.",https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OFbNeKtIJNY,17,2022-10-19 15:05:27
3632," and even encouraging is the four-q guidance kind of came in slightly higher than consensus. And remember, this was not even factoring in a huge catalyst that they have on the horizon, which is the debut of their new ad-supported tier. They're going to be pricing. This is at a really aggressive $7 price point, historically, the lowest price that Netflix has ever come out with. So it should kind of open up a whole new market for them. And then, of course, they're, you know, they're again reinforcing some of their financial metrics in terms of free cash flow, as well as profit margins. Yeah, indeed, to that point, the company making a pretty clear, they ad-supported tier. And not really going to be a material impact, at least in this quarter, because it's being introduced a little later. But I want to point to one thing that has really stood out here. And that's the FX headwinds highlighted many times in this report, the sequential decline in revenue. They say it's entirely because of FX looking through the numbers here. They estimate full year appreciation of the dollar will negatively affect full year revenue operating income by one billion roughly each. So how does the company adjust for that? Is there anything they can do in terms of the pricing or the cost structure that will allow them to have a bit more of a buffer with the dollar expected to be strong for longer? Well, someone that can try to adjust pricing in international markets, they count for the foreign exchange pressure. However, that's a fine tight rope to be walking just in terms of, you don't want to increase price too much. And in turn, you know, affect subscriber growth, we do think that the ad supported service should help drive subscriber growth in international markets. So I think the lower price point will be attractive in certain markets overseas. You know, there's more ability to pay at that lower price point. So that may be where Netflix can find some balance. And certainly the revenue from the advertised and could offset the lower price point and in turn also help offset some foreign exchange pressure. Geeta, as you pointed out, you know, the company highlighting that we are back on the path to reaccelerate growth. Certainly the ad tier is something a lot of analysts have been looking to, but at the end of the day, it is a content company. And they've sort of highlighted that even as the past few quarters have not been as strong in terms of their sub numbers, engagement has still been high compared to other streaming competitors. What's that next catalyst, do you think, when you look at the content pipeline for this company that could push it even higher? I think we've now seen really the steady cadence of, you know, content titles. We were kind of hit by that whole COVID log jam. And they did say that that's going to take a little bit of time to kind of unwind, but we've seen them deliver consistent hits, obviously. You know, they're, some of their biggest hitting titles being, you know, stranger things, but then they've had a lot of newer shows that have also performed really, really well. The Jeffrey Darmershow being a great example of that. And we're seeing them kind of hold their content budget steady, but remember, we are seeing a lot of the other streamers. So a lot of the competition is also dialing back on their content spend. I think that's a really important point because, you know, maybe we're going to see some of those competitive pressures ease up a little bit as some of these streamers start to understand that profitability is becoming more and more important. And I think that really gives Netflix a leg up, you know, as they try and get more and more bang for their buck. And this is exactly what they spoke to. They said they're getting more impact for every dollar of content spend. And we're seeing that with some of the engagement metrics that they post to the other point that I want to make here is that with some of those engagement metrics, you come out with an advertising product. I mean, this is really so attractive to advertisers knowing that they have that deep engagement, knowing that they have a captive audience, which is on their platform for about two to and a half hours every day. Advertisers are going to be willing to pay up. And they finally is the company looks to see, looks, looks for other levers to drive revenue. We got some news from the VP of gaming there saying that Netflix is now looking at a cloud gaming as a potential. They've also going to have a cloud or gaming segment within their Southern California headquarters there or their offices there.",https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OFbNeKtIJNY,18,2022-10-19 15:09:11
3633," as a potential, they've also gonna have a cloud or gaming segment within their Southern California headquarters there or their offices there. I mean, this is a very crowded space. This would be sort of a new venture for Netflix. They've been talking about it for some time. Is this something that you think Netflix can compete in just given the players that are already in the space? Yeah, certainly the gaming space is a challenging market and a lot of competition in that market. We view that as something that might be incremental for Netflix and in particular may not drive a lot of subscriber growth, but perhaps could help in terms of subscriber retention. Yeah, that's I think when the challenge is when the content schedule is a little more uneven that when there's not content that people are urgently wanting to watch that that's where you see churn, tick up and people, you know, put off their service for a while where gaming could be another way of keeping subscribers engaged and holding on to their subscription even when it's a time period that one of their favorite shows isn't, you know, has already debuted and they've already watched those episodes. It is about continuing to make the platforms ticky with so many of these streaming companies. Appreciate your time to both of you, Gita, Runganath and Bloomberg Intelligence, senior media analysts and Dave Hagar, he's Edward Jones, senior equity analyst. Well, now turning to the energy space. President Biden doubling down against big oil. His administration is releasing 15 million more barrels from the strategic petroleum reserve that President is set to speak on the measures in the next couple of hours. Biden also setting out a plan to refill the reserve. Just a reminder, this is oil stored in 60 giant salt caverns in Texas as well as Louisiana. We've got Yaku Finance contributor, Kevin Sirili on the story for us today. Kevin, how much of this is really about the midterms trying to keep the cap there on gas prices as a voter sort of think about that? Well, there's definitely a midterm political, domestic politics angle here, but there's also a geopolitical angle. But we are anticipating as you alluded to, the President Biden is going to release 15 million barrels from the strategic petroleum reserve. He's going to make those remarks later this afternoon. But he's also going to do something else. And that is to say that the administration will repurchase crude oil when the US energy benchmark West Texas intermediate hits between $67.72 per barrel. And what essentially the administration is saying is, quote, this repurchase approach will protect taxpayers and help create certainty around future demand for crude oil. That will encourage firms to invest in production right now, helping to improve US energy security and bring down energy prices that have been driven up by Putin's war in Ukraine. And Kevin, specifically, there's other measures that have kind of been floated around. We know these big oil companies have approached the Department of Energy, the Secretary of Energy, Jennifer Granholm, really saying that there should not be some kind of ban on exports going out of the US at a time when the anticipation is that Europe will implement those sanctions against Russian oil coming in December. I mean, as you point out, a lot of pieces to connect here, but are we expecting any kind of measures on that front to be announced from the White House? Well, potentially, and three points here. First and foremost, economically, the average price of gas that the US consumer is facing right now is about $3.87 per gallon. That's up. Get this 20 cents from just over a month ago and nearly 56 cents when you compare it to a year ago. So when you couple that with high inflation at about 8.1% in the United States, not to mention, as you said in Europe, where in the UK, it's 10.1%. Workers around the world, especially in Europe and the United States, are feeling the brunt of this. But secondly, to take this back to the US midterm election cycle just last night in Miami, when Senator Marco Rubio was up on stage debating val Demings, his Democratic challenger, he essentially said that, quote, our oil reserves do not exist to win midterms, end quote. The Republicans are seizing on this. They view this as a winning issue. They want to increase domestic US oil production. And they don't.",https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OFbNeKtIJNY,19,2022-10-19 15:13:31
3634," exist to win midterms."" End quote. The Republicans are seizing on this. They view this as a winning issue. They want to increase domestic U.S. oil production, and they don't think that the administration should just be utilizing the strategic oil reserves. In contrast to that, there's a political context in this that the President Biden's expected to make later this afternoon. And that is that they are declaring political war against big oil, and they are going to try to especially target big oil profits that have been made throughout the pandemic, and they feel that drawing that contrast is a way for them to mobilize the base of their party, especially those who have interest on climate change while essentially trying to have it both ways by releasing some from the strategic oil reserves. And then quickly, the third and final point is the geopolitics. You can't ignore Putin's war with Ukraine and the impact that that's having on European oil, but you also can't ignore that the pressure that this is now caused on the U.S. Saudi relationship. And already, again, on Capitol Hill, you're hearing members of both parties quite frankly, criticize the Saudis who, of course, run OPEC for their decision. And this impact is especially going to, I think, reveal the leverage that some foreign governments have in terms of impacting the everyday U.S. consumer. Yeah, and we've seen a number of lawmakers come out and talking about restricting arms sales, for example, to Saudi Arabia. On that second point that you just made, though, about this, you know, sort of fight that we're seeing play out between the administration and then big oil, and the reality is these reserves are at their lowest in decades. I mean, the administration needs being oil to be on board, right? What does that look like right now? Well, you know, privately, the energy sector here in Washington, DC, the energy lobby, are, I would say, rolling their eyes because, look, President Biden comes from Delaware. This was a state that has a heavy refinery contingency in the state. And it's really reflective of the dynamics within the democratic party right now, where you have the moderates who are potentially more moderate on this issue. But again, you have this new wing of progressives on the flank of the party who are trying to really move the party much more to the left, especially as it relates to climate change. And so this puts President Biden in a significant, significant political debacle, because here you have an issue that according to most polls, virtually all polls, including the CBS poll that came out just the other week, where the economy is the number one issue amongst independent voters. And in states like Florida, where again, Senator Rubio is beating Demings according to polls, the average of polls are real clear politics by five percentage points, or looking at state like Pennsylvania, where in the Senate race there met Menaz, the Republican challenging John Fetterman, the progressive, had those polls have tightened energy inflation. These are the closing arguments that Republicans are making in their closing bid as we lead up to the mid-serve elections. Just a few more weeks to go. Yeah. Should get interesting. Kevin Sereli is always appreciate your insight. Thank you for having me. Well, strong quarterly results are helping lift shares of Proctor and Gamble. Take a look at that. The stock is up nearly 3 percent after the consumer products giant Beat Wall Street estimates on the top and bottom lines as increased prices help offset lower demand and higher costs. Dollar strength, though, weighed on the company's outlook, cutting its full-year sales forecast. And now, expect sales to decline one to three percent lower than previous forecasts. Furnings per share expected to come in at the lower end of the range as well. CEO John Muller speaking to our morning team is that the consumers remains resilient even in the face of high inflation. But if we look at consumer sentiment and one measure of that is trade down to private label brands, we're seeing very little movement. So in North America, past three in six months, private label brands increase share by only 30 basis points on a 12 month basis. They're flat. Same general situation in Europe. And while we see a pop in the stock today shares of Proctor and Gamble are down roughly 20 percent year to date.

While coming up pressure persists shares an avid continuing a downtrend despite the group upping its earnings forecast. It's been a tough year for the stock despite a diversified business and a big presence in COVID testing. We'll talk health care on the other side. We'll talk health care on the other side.

The company lifted its guidance but reported a drop in sales because of the baby formula shortage. A decline in COVID-19 testing also weighed on the quarter. Averturning is called with investors just wrapping up. A key go on that point of the baby formula weighing on the nutrition line of business down 10%. The company noting that there are many global trends that are weighing COVID including inflation, strong dollar. All in all, they seem to be remaining optimistic about the baby formula shortage and that's getting over as they reopen the plan last quarter. Let's take a deeper dive into Abbott's numbers here with Shogun Singh, who's now certainly down despite some of those results. I'm imagining you've got an outperform with the price target of $132 a share so you certainly feel like there's more upside. What do you think investors are getting wrong? Thank you so much for having us here. We do like the stock. The company does have a pretty solid.",https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OFbNeKtIJNY,21,2022-10-19 15:21:58
3636," No, thank you so much firstly for having us here. You know, I we do like the stock we think, you know, the company does have a pretty solid long term financial profile of growth in the high single digits on the top line and double digit EPS growth on the bottom line. You know, if we just look at the Q3 numbers, the quarter was actually pretty strong. You know, they did beat by 700 million on the top line and about 20 cents on EPS. You know, COVID-19 testing was definitely what drove the results, you know, the results came in at about $1.7 billion. Consensus was looking at about 540 million in sales. So really impressive despite the summer months. And, you know, if you look at a full year, a full year guidance at this point, it's 7.8 billion in COVID-19 sales, which is actually ahead of what they did last year. So, you know, pretty solid revenues in terms of COVID-19. I think what the sticking point here really is is the mid to mid single to high single digit underlying growth. So there were factors that impacted the quarter such as COVID, you know, if you back out COVID-19 testing an infant formula recall, there was also medical device supply issues that impacted the company. So if you back out all those one time items on an underlying basis, the company delivered about mid single to high single digit underlying growth, which is slightly below the longer term outlook of high single digits. But I think it's more of a reflection of Q3, which is seasonally a week a quarter, and then the COVID-19 environment, whether recovery is occurring, but you know, it is at a much slower pace than what, you know, we would have liked in a normal environment. Shagun, Angelie here. I want to look at some of the very specific details that they let us know about today, one being the new plant for baby formula production. And then also looking at the Libre test and looking at also models that are pretty different when it comes to direct consumer and subscription models. I know there was mention of that. I wonder how you think this all plays for a company that's as large as it is that has had, you know, quite a diverse market so far. Yeah, I think, you know, both on infant formula recall, I think, you know, it's a good step that they are, you know, planning to, you know, they have made some leadership changes at the Michigan facility and they are planning to move forward with plans about half a billion dollar in investments in a new US nutrition facility for specialty and metabolic infant formulas. You know, I think there is, you know, upside on diabetes as well. And, you know, honestly, if you just take a step back and look at the company, you know, I do like the diversified portfolio that the company has. You know, they are continuing to move forward within medical devices. You know, again, nutrition business. I think this is lost about 20 share points given the recall they gained half of it back as of September and the impact. I think this year is about 750 million, but I think this business should recover into next year. Also in terms of diabetes, you know, there is a CMS proposed coverage guidelines for CGMs, the common period of that is open till about the 19th of November. And if expanded and coverage is approved, you know, it could really bring more eligible patients to the population, 4 million, going to about 8 million, which is another $2 billion US opportunity. So I do like their diversified portfolio. And I think they do have a leapsed of in terms of, you know, just diabetes, medical devices, diagnostics and nutrition coming back. Let's elaborate on that a bit. As you pointed out, you know, some of the sentiment that's weighing on the stock today is about the decline we've seen in COVID testing. Yes, we're going into what is expected to be a period of more optics and COVID cases, but the reality is we're not going to be at the peak that we haven't over the last few years. You mentioned a long list of other levers within their portfolio. What do you think is going to be the biggest driver that gets you to that $132 share price target? Yeah, and I just want to back up. I don't think it's so much about COVID testing. It's more about, like I mentioned, investors focus on the underlying growth profile of the company. When you back out COVID testing, the infant formula recall, which is about a $230 million hit this quarter again. And then the medical supply.",https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OFbNeKtIJNY,22,2022-10-19 15:26:30
3637," company when you back out COVID testing the infant formula recall, which is about a $230 million hit this quarter again. And then the medical supply, medical device supply issue that they faced internationally. So I think the sticking point for investors right now is really recovery. Just in terms of COVID, you know, I think in an endemic phase as a base case, the company is looking for about $500 million in quarterly sales. I think that's a good placeholder even for next year, which does provide some upside. So, you know, I think, you know, again, the mid to high single digit profile versus the highest single digit organic revenue growth that they aspire to get to on a long-term basis. You know, I think the variance between that is really, you know, I think Q3 being seasonally weaker and then, you know, the COVID-19 environment, you know, whether recovery is occurring, but it is not, you know, we are not in normal time. So I think that's having an impact. So I think that's more of a sticking point than COVID-19 testing. And again, you know, just to mention again, they are doing about $7.8 billion, you know, for the full year, that's their guidance at this point, was a $7.7 billion that they did last year. Q4 includes about $500 million in quarterly sales for for COVID-19 testing business. And, you know, again, that does not include any additional COVID surges or government contracts. Sure. Good seeing medical devices analysts at RBC capital markets. Appreciate your time today and our thanks to Angelic Kamlani as well. Well, coming up, scrutiny intensifies. Bankrupt crypto lender Celsius faces US federal investigations. According to fresh legal findings, they highlight investigations in at least 40 states we're going to continue to unravel that story next.",https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OFbNeKtIJNY,23,2022-10-19 15:30:40
3638," We're turning now to crypto Celsius. Maybe gone. But it's definitely lives on the bankrupt crypto lender facing numerous federal and state investigation over its practices, transparency, and even alleged misuse of funds. Let's bring in Yahoo Finance, senior reporter David Hollerith, who has been following all the twists and turns of this company. We're talking what, more than 40 states investigating here. I mean, this is pretty significant. Yeah, Akiko, we've seen reports since last week sort of indicating that 40 states, as well as the SEC, FTC, several other federal agencies have all been looking into the Celsius networks financial dealings before bankruptcy. To our point, if we take a step back, the most important thing for the bankruptcy proceeding, which these investigations will likely not impact too much is how much creditors, mostly customers, get a return on the funds they held on the platform. Now to move that process forward, there's going to be a bidding procedure. In the deadline for that, still hasn't been worked out. There have been a number of other crypto firms that have said they've shown some interest in buying the firm's assets. But if we turn back to what's going on right now, the next hearing for Celsius is tomorrow at 10 a.m. And we're likely to hear more clarity around all these regulatory investigations. I think one thing to point out is that since the beginning of this bankruptcy happened, there's probably potentially some consolidation in terms of all the investigations that are going on. For example, the Unsecured Creditors Committee has sort of teamed up with a third party examiner that's been appointed. So a lot of these reports, I think, are going to be worked out in tandem. That being said, this examiner report, which seems to be the timeline, seems to be shortening for it. That's probably going to be the most comprehensive thing we see from the public. And we haven't seen any outright allegations from regulators yet. But there are numerous examples sort of floating in the public of the indicate that there could be indications of fraud in Celsius's dealings. Obviously, most of it is C-suite and step down. Okay. Potentially new developments coming down tomorrow. I know you'll be on top of it. David Holler, thanks so much for that. Well, coming up the outlier, Porsche's listing may have been the only bright spot for the down-trot and IPO market this year. 2020 has seen the least money raised since 1995. So it's the only way off. We'll get into the conversation with S&P Global on the other side. Okay. All right. All right.",https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OFbNeKtIJNY,24,2022-10-19 15:34:59
3639," So They have this quarter, meaning a past quarter, third quarter, 22 growing. They have the fourth quarter, the first quarter, the second quarter, the third quarter, all negative territories around half percent, one to one and a half percent. So a slight shallow down and we're trending and growing at the end of next year. They have pushed that projection for recession out a little bit into 23, but their core belief is a mild recession. That was Bank of America CEO Brian Moynihan speaking with our very own Brian Sasi this morning. The investment bank beat the results or beat the street, which is to say with results on Monday, benefiting in part from higher rates. Well policy tightening has been the story of 2022 along with sky high inflation. Both of these factors, a lethal combination for stocks and therefore not exactly fertile ground for IPOs either. Fewer companies are looking to navigate a listing in this environment because of the high volatility and low investor appetite in part to poor returns from last year's new issues. Here break it all down to see how this is all playing out in the IPO slowdown. We've got SMP Global's senior writer, Brian Shide. Good to talk to you today. I guess the question here is are we starting to see a turn because we have seen the big, big dip in activity. We're now in October. Are things starting to look up? So thanks for having me out at Kiko. I really appreciate it. If we're looking at 2022 compared to 2021, 2021 was really this record setting breakout year for IPOs, according to SMP Global Market Intelligence data, there were more than 3,250 IPOs in 2021. In 2022, we're on track for about half that. That's thinking that things are going to keep at the same pace, which I think most people are thinking there's going to be an additional downturn. In the US, we're on track to about 1.6 as many IPOs in 2022. It's safe to say that all momentum from that breakout year has been lost. Just a little more perspective on this. For the first three quarters of this year, the IPOs worldwide raised about $144 billion. Now that's $68 billion less than what was raised in the first quarter of 2021 alone. IPO activity really has slowed down to a crawl in 2022. And I'm not sure that it gets much better from here. We have heard over and over, especially with some of these highly valued tech startups that the cons are tough. When trying to come to market, they have slash valuations. Yesterday, we saw Intel looking at a lower valuation for their IPO for mobile I. I mean, how many companies you think are willing to come to market in this environment, even with a lower valuation? So obviously, each company is very different. But you look at sort of the overwhelming factor that companies, they just don't think that they can raise that much cash right now through an IPO in 2022.",https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OFbNeKtIJNY,25,2022-10-19 15:39:30
3640," But you look at sort of the overwhelming factor that companies, they just don't think that they can raise that much cash right now through an IPO in 2022. Whether or not they can take that lower valuation, I think is anyone's guess, I think right now, they'll probably wait it out a little bit longer. If you look at the biggest US IPO as of 2022, we were looking at core bridge financial, that retirement and insurance company. They raised nearly 1.7 billion last month, TPG and asset management company raised about 1.1 billion back in January. Those are really the only billion dollar US IPO's, that's it. So you compare that to last year, you know, you had Rivian, the electric vehicle maker, they raised 11.9 billion, almost 12 billion dollars, lucid motors, EV company raising 4.6 billion. We're just not seeing anything on that scale in 2022. And with all of the different factors that play right now, you know, Fed rate, Higgs volatility, recession fears, like it was discussed, I just don't see that number jumping that much in the fourth quarter. And we're going to have, you know, this severe downturn we're seeing in 2022 and compared to last year. And that's most likely just going to continue. So what do you think is the catalyst that could turn things around? I've heard you say over and over that you don't think things are going to turn at least in the short to medium term. What are you going to be looking for that says that maybe companies are ready to come to market again? Is it about the Fed policy? You're seeing the tightening cycle, you know, wrapping up or I mean, what exactly is it that companies are going to be looking for? I mean, there's all these different factors, right? You have like I said, heightened volatility, the war in Ukraine, inflation hitting levels. We haven't seen since the early 1980s. But you did mention this. The one big thing, Fed rate hikes, that's boosted borrowing costs sort of across the board for these companies. The Fed has boosted its benchmark rate by 300 basis points since March after having this, you know, ultra low near zero rate policy for since the beginning of the pandemic. And that really fueled that IPO growth, that record breaking growth in IPOs. We saw in 2021. Now the futures market expecting another 75 basis point hike at their meeting in November. The Fed could hike, you know, I think the expectation is almost to 5%. So that ramp up from zero to 5%, but you know, by early 2023, I think, you know, at that point, you need to see some sort of Fed pivot. And I think most people, the market, you see these jump starts going on in the stock market right now. And that's, you know, sort of this hope that becomes false hope that the Fed is pivoting. And until you see a very clear sign that that Fed pivot is happening, I don't think that you're going to have much of a turnaround in this IPO and buyer. I expect a little more quiet to come here. S&P Global Senior Ryder Branshide. Get to have you on today. Or public ads are approaching the final weeks of the battle for Congress with momentum as the economy and inflation become dominant concerns. But what happens if the GOP wins one or both houses of Congress in November, Yahoo Finance, senior columnist Rick Newman has the latest analysis. Rick, it was just what a few weeks ago that we were talking about sort of these social issues, like abortion, really driving the gains for Democrats. But it certainly feels like the last few weeks have tipped things over back to the Republicans. It does seem that way. And this has a lot to do with President Biden's approval rating, which is a usually a determinant of what happens in the midterm elections. He has tipped up to around 44 percent. But that's probably not high enough for Democrats to hold onto Congress. So what's the outlook for markets if Republicans do win one or both houses of Congress? Republicans, they could pass some legislation. But if it's anything Biden opposes, he'll just veto it. So it's not like we're going to see Republican priorities suddenly becoming law. But the ability to obstruct could be pretty important. And House Marley leader Kevin McCarthy, who probably would become House Speaker for Republicans win the House, he gave an interesting hint about one thing Republicans might do around the middle of next year, which is potentially block an increase in the federal borrowing limit. Now this is a show we've seen many times before.",https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OFbNeKtIJNY,26,2022-10-19 15:43:52
3641," do around the middle of next year, which is potentially block an increase in the federal borrowing limit. Now, this is a show we've seen many times before. Republicans have used this tactic of trying to hold out on extending the borrowing limit in order to get priorities they wanted. It's usually some kind of spending cuts. This time around it could be reformed to entitlement programs like Social Security and Medicare. Now, the federal borrowing limit, Congress did raise it in last December. It didn't really make news because it just went up. Democrats controlled Congress and they weren't going to have some kind of smackdown given that they were the ones in charge. But we could end up having this battle again sometime in the summer or the fall of 23. And everybody hates this battle when it happens. So something to gurd for. Just over two weeks to go until the all-important midterms. Rick Newman, thanks so much for that. Well, coming up after the peak, use car prices, rocket and during the pandemic, and even clung on to gains during much of this year. Now, the price lump is gaining traction. But how steep for the decline B will kick the tires and Carvana's stock on the other side. Well, what bushes downgrading Carvana to neutral from outperform, saying the online use car dealer is less likely to achieve the potential for solid unit economics at scale. Joining us now with more on this is what Bush Securities Retail Hardlines Analyst Seth Basham sets, walk me three of these. Yeah, bottom line is that we think this company does have a viable business model. There's a compelling value proposition for consumers and the company can make money selling cars online to consumers. But it needs to do that by selling a lot of cars at the same time. That's the way its cost structure is built. And right now what we're seeing is falling use car unit sales and that's pressuring their profitability along with an ill time acquisition earlier this year, which is styling the company with excess capacity and excess interest costs. I mean, this has been a steep fall for Carvana this year to put it lightly. When you look at where the market is overall, how much of this is about sort of the market, the slowing demand dictating where the company has been moving. How much of it?",https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OFbNeKtIJNY,27,2022-10-19 15:48:03
3642," When you look at where the market is overall, how much of this is about sort of the market, the slowing demand, dictating where the company has been moving, how much of it is self-inflicted? That's a good question. I'd probably gauge it as about half and half. The market is certainly moving against them. We're seeing double digit declines and use unit vehicle sales for the industry right now. We're seeing fall on use car prices. They're declining nearly double digits each year, every year right now as well. However, the company was doing everything to grow as fast as it could through COVID and was not very disciplined with the way it was operating in its business that led to a lot of inefficiencies, a lot of blowback from customers, from rating from state DMVs. And it's trying to rectify those issues at the same time that's facing this big decline in the outlook for use vehicle sales. Looking at where the chart is, the stock was at over $200 a share at the beginning of the year. We're now looking at what, $15? Is this the price point to get in? $15 is our target price right now, but we stay sideline for the time being as we think that some of the near term headwinds remain severe. Our forecast for earnings ends cash flow, our well below where the consensus is right now. And I think there needs to be a reset before considering buying this stock. Well, Bush Securities Retail Hardlines Analyst, Seth Abasham, appreciate your time today. Well, new survey from the Federal Reserve shows productivity taking a hit with employees working from home. Let's bring in Yahoo Finance's Carrie Hanon with the specifics on that today. A lot of companies are saying this is not a surprise. Yeah, I mean, the study from the Federal Reserve Bank of New York shows that they looked at 15% of workers are still remote who are full-time workers and about 30% are doing hybrid. And the thing is, this is fabulous for workers. This is what, when I talk to workers out there, this is what they're looking for. They want flexibility. They want autonomy. They want to know that they have more control of their time. And they are doing that, you know, in fact, by saving that commute time, I don't see how that's really hitting productivity that much. What it's happening is people are using that save time and let's say save money as well, to do things that give them that work-life balance that we all discovered during the pandemic that we found out what our priorities were and what we really wanted to do with our time. And, you know, so they found that people under 30, you know, they tend to spend that extra time eating out or exercising. And those over 30 tend to be spending that extra bonus time that they have from saving that commute on, you know, preparing meals and childcare. And they don't mention this, but I would suggest it's probably aging relative care as well and home maintenance. Are you kidding me? That's what they're spending their time on. But guess what? It is having that sense that they know they can do their jobs from home. And they're going to use this as a bargaining thing. And I'm telling you in a type job market which still exists today, even though it's slowly changing. This is something that workers can definitely ask for, bargain for. And this is what they want. They want flexibility, no commute. Now, away from that, there are those workers who are considering making a shift in their retirement accounts. Turns out it might be costly to be moving things. I mean, what more can you tell us there? Yeah, this was so interesting to me. Pew Charitable Trust came out with this study that looked at the basic advice. We tell people, you know, that you always hear of your switching jobs. Don't forget to, you know, roll over your 401k or 430b to an IRA account. You know, your individual retirement account, where you have more control over it and more, you know, investment opportunities and you can continue to add to it. But what they found out, you found that in fact, the fees. And this is something a lot of people don't think about is what the fees charge for your, when you roll over to an IRA, even if it's the exact same mutual fund, will charge higher fees in your account and your IRA because it's a retail account. You're an individual. It's not that same mutual fund in your employer plan was an institutional fee. And so that tends to be lower and that fee, which is your expense ratio. That's what you look for. Is the expense ratio?",https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OFbNeKtIJNY,28,2022-10-19 15:52:39
3643," plan was an institutional fee. And so that tends to be lower. And that fee, which is your expense ratio, that's what you look for, is the expense ratio. That's marketing and management fees. Now, a big company can negotiate for lower fees for those institutional fees. So the point is it may be less expensive in overtime. It seems like these are little just small increments, but it's a big impact over time. They looked at one example that was someone that had, over 25 year period, the exact same mutual fund that was in a retail account and an institutional, had a $10,000 higher cost of fees in the retail fund. So what the point is people need to pay attention to the fees, do your research. Finra.org, F-I-N-R-A.org, allows you to do some research on what those fees are. It's really important. OK, some good takeaways there. And of course, all that information on our website, as well, with Kerry on top of that story. Kerry-Hannan, thanks so much for that. Well, coming up projections suggest the global sports spending market could be worth close to $1 trillion in the next decade or so. And the US wants a bigger piece of the pie. We're talking about one specific company. We'll have that discussion on the other side. So what's that? this is my new Welcome back to Yahoo Finance Live. Sports apparel and e-commerce company Fanatics has taken the next big step into the gambling world as they announced the hiring of Andrea Ellis to fill the role of chief financial officer of its betting and gaming division. For one, let's bring in Yahoo Finance is Josh Schaeffer. Josh, this comes as there's a lot of speculation about what those gambling ambitions look like for the supply. Right. So now we have Fanatics as a CFO and Andrea Ellis. They have a CMO that they hired last month. They have a CEO for the betting part of the company that's Matt King, the former CEO of Fandall. So they have everyone, seems like they're starting to get fully staffed. And Michael Rubin said last week that he thinks this is going to start in January. That's the goal here. So a little bit on Andrea Ellis just to kind of give you a little bit of background. She was at Lyme before this, the scooter company. She was a CFO over there, Harvard Business School grad, Starter Career at Goldman Sachs. So not a ton of sports betting experience per se, but Lyme, another company that is very competitive with other companies in the space, I should say. And that's obviously what we see in sports gambling a lot. Fanatics going to get into this.",https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OFbNeKtIJNY,29,2022-10-19 15:57:24
3644," But I'm another company that is very competitive with other companies in the space, I should say. And that's obviously what we see in sports gambling a lot. Phenatics going to get into this in January. They're going to be, you know, in the ring with Draft King's fan duel, those kind of companies. So let's talk about that because, you know, you cover the space. It feels increasingly crowded. How does Phenatics compete there? Right. Well, I think one of the things Michael Ruben talks a lot about is they're not going to have to spend as much on licensing, right? So they can save. I think that is key. They could save per his estimates 30 to 40%. But you're still going to have to pay to get the customers. So if you look at New York right now, which Phenatics does not have a license in to be clear, but they have very good public records. That's why I use New York and it's the biggest market. Phendual has 47% of the market share, almost 48%. Draft King's has almost 30%. So you're looking at nearly 80% of the market covered by the two companies we talk all the time about. And GM is also in the space, Penn, Caesars, how many of these companies are going to come out as winners? Phenatics is going to have to spend a lot. A company like Draft King spends about $350 per customer in the first six months to acquire a customer. Phenatics is going to want a lot of customers. We're talking hundreds of millions of dollars. Companies valued at $27, $28 billion, $27 billion. So they have the money, but it's going to cost them a little bit more than it does to sell shirts. So it'll be interesting to see how that goes. And as you said, users go where the money is or the promotions are, right? Right. Yeah, they're going to need to spend to get those customers in and then can you keep them? That'll be a big question. January, right around the corner. We'll be watching. Absolutely. Thanks so much for that, Josh. Let's do a final check of the markets before we let you go. As we said, it's kind of been an often down session here. But the Dow still, the only one in the green right now, up just slightly about 35 points there. And the S&P 500 down at seven and the Nasdaq down 27. Certainly earnings, very much the focus of what we have seen in the markets over the last few days. It's going to continue today. We've got Tesla, a big one. After the bell, we're going to have you all covered there in our afternoon show. But that does it for me in this hour. We have much more to come here and yaken finance live. We're right here. Thanks. Shots. Shots.",https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OFbNeKtIJNY,30,2022-10-19 16:01:39
3645," Thank you for being with us this morning. Man, the administration has a tough job and I'm curious how you think they're doing. I mean, between this and now reported upon further release from the strategic petroleum reserve from the back and forth with Saudi Arabia, what kind of grade would you give this administration and how it is dealing with what was a climbing market for gasoline prices? Sure. So the grade would depend on actually what you're looking at in some respects. They get a very high grade. They've managed to actually help engineer the drop in oil prices that we've seen since Brent reached 130 last spring with the height of the first disruption of Russian supply. How they've gone about it is a little bit bizarre, however. Sometimes they've antagonized the producers. I think the price cap issue is the one in which they get the lowest grade so far. Price caps have been tried before. They were tried when the Iran Iraq war broke out and they were designed by the IEA to keep oil prices from running up and they had the reverse effect actually. So the history of trying to put a price cap on is not very good and it's kind of ironic that they're doing this at a time when the producers look at them and say, hey, they're putting on a price cap. We're trying to put a floor under prices. They don't like that. Why should we like them putting a price cap on Russia when they could do the same thing to us if this kind of thing works? So it has mixed grades, I think. Is there any time frame in which this would actually kind of show up for end consumers people who are using the inter-reliant on this actually doing something on the pricing front? Sure. Well, let me give you a perfect example. So the US and allies decided to release 200 million barrels of strategic stocks. They did that when prices were exorbitantly high and there was this distortion in the market with European companies and the US avoiding imports of Russian oil. Prices went up. The release of the strategic stocks actually increased total stocks available in the commercial market by around 200 million barrels. If you look at where the stocks were in the OECD at the beginning of the year and look at where commercial stocks are now on land floating in floating inventory and in transit moving from the seller to the buyer, it's up by around 200 million barrels and we're actually relatively high in terms of total oil that we measure in high frequency data. We're relatively high in terms of the last five year average. So they've succeeded and we've seen the gasoline price come down. They're confronting another set of problems right now. One being that the European Union has decided to have no imports from Russia starting on the crude side starting on December 5th and that is already triggering a kind of buying spree. We've seen a growth in the premium of wet barrels of rent against a screen barrel. So we're seeing a bidding up at the price in the Atlantic base and just as we did last March, the price cap is designed to alleviate that telling companies that if they can buy at a price below whatever the cap is on Russian crude then they can have an exception to the embargo but then they didn't think through what would Russia do. Russia said Putin said they put on this cap, they put on the embargo and we're just going to drop our production and to prove the point they clearly stopped exporting natural gas to Europe when Europe said they were going to put a price cap on natural gas and stop importing it sooner or later. But I have a story on the Yagufan and its home page right now, Home Depot's co-founder Bernie Marcus criticizing the Biden administration for not letting or just not the administration not being encouraging to drilling in this country but the other side of this coin is that all companies may not be drilling as much as you would think in this environment. What do you think is true? What do you think of that, too?",https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OFbNeKtIJNY,31,2022-10-19 16:05:26
3646," Or just not the administration not being encouraging to drilling in this country. But the other side of this coin is that all companies may not be drilling as much as you would think in this environment. What do you think is true? What do you think of that take? So it really begins with what happened historically. We had a pandemic at that pandemic's time. The U.S. production of oil and natural gas was at pretty high. We were growing both at a rapid rate, about a million plus barrels a day per year. We had hit 13 million barrels of production in the early weeks of March 2020. We had a price collapse. We had negative pricing. U.S. companies stopped drilling. U.S. companies are in what we call short cycle oil. We also had a bad hurricane season in 2020. And that 13 million barrels a day of flows turned into about 10 and a half million barrels a day by the end of 2020. We've been rebuilding since then. We're back to 12 million a day. In the natural gas side, we actually have hit a record level of production ever. So I think the constraint there is not even conservative investments by companies because of so-called shareholder requests to return capital to the shareholder. No, on natural gas, the only constraint inside is the lack potentially a pipeline capacity to move it to the export market on the Gulf of a couple of years from now. The return of oil has been slower. It's partly a function of the discipline, the so-called discipline that some companies are imposing on themselves when it comes to drilling, but they're leading and lagging indicators. We actually think the amount of drilling taking place now will give rise to a hefty increase in production this year of around 700,000 barrels a day of crude oil, 500,000 barrels a day of natural gas liquids. So over a million barrels a day, contributions similarly next year. So we're coming back, but the U.S. would have been producing closer to 15 million barrels a day to day. Had there not been that collapse and drilling that took place in 2020? Right, which has to do with the pandemic more so than some of the other factors perhaps. Exactly. And I want to ask you about this winter, both in Europe and in the United States. It feels like there, of course, they're bracing for an energy crisis this winter with a spike in natural gas prices. Here in the Northeast, in particular, there's talk about potential blackouts or brownouts as well. What are you expecting? Can you paint the picture for us? Sure. It's called weather, weather, weather. We've managed not to have the weather that would have hit the world in a significant way had the U.S. had a hurricane season. Yes, my fingers across and the hurricane season is not technically over until November 30th. And if we were to have a big hurricane season, a little factoid in the market that people haven't noticed would really be impactful. That little factoid is that when Europe moved away from Russian gas, they started buying, excuse me, oil. They started buying U.S. oil. U.S. was a gross exporter of around 7 million barrels a day, last January in February, 5 million of that was products. 2 million of that was crude oil. We now have been hitting over 11 million barrels a day, some weeks in exports, and we're averaging closer to 10 million a day. And our exports have crude have doubled from 2 million a day to 4 million a day. So we have become the residual incremental supplier to the European market as this reshuffling is taking place. With we have cold weather this winter, there are two different effects. One is on the gas market, and the other is on the oil market. On the gas market, undoubtedly we have healthy European stocks. That's one reason on the inventory side while European prices have fallen by about 40% from their peaks of a couple of months ago on the natural gas side. But a poll of vortex would wreak havoc in the Europe and would have an impact in the U.S. and the Northeast in particular. In Europe, governments, particularly the UK government, but other governments in Europe as well, are subsidizing the cost of electricity. That means they're subsidizing the cost of gas. This is a question of subsidizing and protecting the consumer. The question is, what do you do when you run out of material? So that's the real danger of weather. With the absence of a flow of gas from Russia, a limited amount of storage, however full it might be now.",https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OFbNeKtIJNY,32,2022-10-19 16:09:57
3647," of material. So that's the real danger of weather. With the absence of a flow of gas from Russia, a limited amount of storage, however full it might be now, if we get a one or two cold spells in Europe, the inventory simply won't be there, the deliveries won't be there, and there will be blackouts. So that's one of the factors. The other on the oil side is that we have had a bizarre thing happening, a shift that is really remarkable, namely that natural gas prices around the world except for the US have risen to the point where it's cheaper to buy diesel than it is to buy natural gas. So we're seeing a lot of fuel switching. Europe is encouraging utilities to move back to using oil, to burn oil. They burned very little oil last year, which was also a last winter, was also a tough one. We don't know what the fuel switching capacity is, but diesel prices are high in part because of an anticipated increase in demand for diesel fuel for power burn, and what remains to be seen by that will actually happen. The recent market rally may give some investors a reason to be optimistic in this bear market. Our next guest says he has three reasons to be optimistic right now, including signs the Fed's plan might be working. We're joined now by pro shares, global investment strategist Simion Heim and Simion Great to have you here in St. Louis. Thanks for having me. Okay, first and foremost, when you think about the reasons to be optimistic in US equities, I mean, some of that has to be based on where valuations in the compression that we're seeing right now where they sit at this point. Absolutely. You got to start with valuations. We're trading around 16 times 2022 expected earnings. Look, we still have a 4% 10 year that still historically reasonably low supports on average something around a 20 PE. So if we do this math, that tells me that we could miss consensus expectations by at least 10 if not 15 to 20% and still be in line with 16 times consensus, which might turn out to be 18 plus times what actually turns up. So that's a valuation, please. We also put up some of the other reasons that the Fed may be achieving their objective and the US economy is relatively well positioned. If we take the second of those, the Fed may be achieving their objective, but if the Fed doesn't think they're achieving their objective and they keep going, that's really the fear of people, right? Is that they're going to keep going, overshoot, and then push the economy into a recession. The evidence, let's start with the evidence first. The break-evens are the big piece of evidence as far as we're concerned. So they have come way, way down. Yes, over the last couple of weeks, they've poked up a little bit.",https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OFbNeKtIJNY,33,2022-10-19 16:14:01
3648," Let's start with the evidence first. The break-events are the big piece of evidence as far as we're concerned. So they have come way, way down. Yes, over the last couple of weeks, they've poked up a little bit. But you had break-events on the two-year at about 5% earlier this year. They're down to about 2.5% right now. That's getting close to the 2% mark that the federal... And do you think the Fed is going to be watching the break-events? I think we have to be cautiously optimistic that we will. But the wild card is employment. If the employment market stays as tight as it is, that's where you get a little bit of the tension. We're getting into what usually is a seasonally good period for the markets. Do you think that seasonality will remain intact, given where we are at the Fed, given how low markets have come down this year? I think there's two ways to think about it. If you're looking for a little bit of a shorter term perspective, then you want to lean into the sectors that are likely as an example to do well in earning season. We're seeing pretty decent numbers for the financials right now. We have an ETF EQR, our equities for rising rates. It piles into energy, financials, materials. That's your best bet for our performance near term in the earning season and kind of if you will, a 369, 12-month horizon. When we look at the BFA Fund Manager survey today, one of the things that sticks out is that we are at the lowest level for some of the investors, the institutions, to really insert some type of speculation within their portfolio or take on risk. And that risk aversion right now at one of those lowest levels since 2008. And so when is it safe to start kind of picking at some of the more kind of speculative names that have been hit as a result of either policy or whether that just be because there's no real earnings to show for some of these companies? So I come from a trust company background and we weren't big sentiment folks really trying to call the bottom. But I think you want to play this. I don't want to call it a barbell, but I mentioned just leaning into the sectors that are likely to outperform in the near term. And that's a shorter time horizon. Again, not in days for us, but in quarters. But if you're looking for a place where you don't have to worry about the inflection point, it's those consistent dividend growers, our ETF which we always talk about at NOLBL, CSNP 500 of risk to crats, the quintessential a hedge against inflation is rising dividends. And if you look to those consistent dividend growers, you don't have to worry about the bottoms tomorrow. Is it next month? Is it even a quarter from now? We haven't talked about crypto much lately. And yet it's the one year anniversary of a crypto ETF that you guys came out with, BIT or BITO, as you guys call it in house, I guess. And I'm curious how it's been doing. I mean, because it's sort of, Bitcoin has sort of fallen out of the headlines to some extent. It's been a volatile period. And what we're very proud of about BITO BITO is that it's done exactly what it's supposed to do. It has tracked spot Bitcoin really, really well. And folks didn't think that was going to happen. They were all worked up about the roll cost. But if you open up a finance textbook, this is a non-yielding thing. It's a financial future. You don't have to store it in tankers out there. So therefore, the roll cost should be equal to the short term interest rate. And BITO holds cash such that it earns interest on the cash about equal to the roll cost. It's tracking its spot on. It's the largest cryptocurrency in the world. And it trades really well. So when you put that together, whether you're time horizon is a short one or a buy and hold, it's really moved to the fore as a vehicle of choice. Always good to get some time.

3649," you you you There's a lot of questions about whether they're behind the curve. Joining us now to discuss all of this BlackRock's global fixed income CIO, Rick Reader. Hey, Rick. How are you? Nice to see you, a person. Sure, have me. So we have this sort of bounce that we're seeing in the market here. And this debate now about whether it's going to be sustained, whether this is another head fake. What do you think? So I don't think you can count on the market, continue to have, by the way, it's nice being here on a green deck. We don't get many of those these days. But I think it's hard to count on sustained this being sustained. You've got to Fed the still tightening financial conditions. You've got inflation that's still running too hot. And they've got to keep moving. I think that the markets are priced in about as far as the Fed is going to go. But you don't know the answer to that yet. And until we get more data, we just came off a strong CPI report. We came off a strong payroll report. You know, now all eyes turn to the employment cost index, PCE data. And we need to see it start to trend down for the Fed to come off this. And then it's hard to take a lot of risk until that happens. Has it been encouraging to you, though, Rick, that we've seen the market rally in response to earnings that aren't necessarily great Goldman Bank of America? They're OK. They weren't as bad as feared. But even go back to last week, you saw some hot reads on inflation. The market bounced on those numbers as well. Those, to me, seemed like positives. They definitely do. And by the way, the bank earnings are pretty good. I mean, when you break it down, those are pretty good. You also had a big relief off of this dynamic that was happening in the UK. I mean, this unwind of the leverage in the pension system was incredibly dislocating. The impact it was having on rates in the UK, and then infecting the US and Europe. That was a big deal. Listen, I think you've got the equity market has some pretty sizable short positions in it today. And I think people underestimate how much the market has gotten repositioned around equities. And you're seeing some pretty big put option trading, very big positions. And short interest, that's pretty sizable. And so the technicals in the equity market are pretty darn good today. So you get these bounces. And my sense is you'll keep getting them. But can you count on a sustained rally? I think it's still early to think that. I want to pick up on the point about the UK for just a second. Because there was more news out this morning. The financial time said they were going to delay their quantitative tightening. Then the bank of England says, no, we're not necessarily going to delay it. But I've been sort of struggling to some extent to understand the interplay between what's going on in the UK and here. So can you sort of lay that out for us and why it is so important what's happening? 100%. So you've got dynamic in the UK, which is extraordinary, in that you had what appeared to be at the time aggressive fiscal easing. At the same time, you were seeing central bank tightening. That is not nobody in history has ever seen that work out. So that was creating this volatility in the markets. But then you have a dynamic that you had this leverage on one. So you have these pension funds had to sell huge amounts of assets, including long-term interest rates, interest rate products generally.",https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OFbNeKtIJNY,35,2022-10-19 16:22:57
3650," Then you have a dynamic that you had this leverage on one. You have these pension funds had to sell huge amounts of assets, including long-term interest rates, interest rate products generally. And so what happens is the development market interest rates, markets tend to work together. And so that was putting pressure on the markets here. And then just the general dislocation, you know, London is the second epicenter of finance. And as you're getting this extraordinary volatility there, and it was permeating all the markets generally. So by the way, you know, when the central banks raised rates as much in tight and liquidity, you see the leverage, you know, I would say every day, but periodically you see, wow, I didn't realize that risk was on. I didn't realize this leverage is on. And we're going to keep getting reminders of that for the coming weeks and months. I say, I hope that, you know, the Fed is going to reach a point where they can pause at these elevated rates, whether it's 4.5, 4.5, 3.5, 4.5, you know, once they pause, then you can start to get comfortable. And I'm going to take some more risk in my portfolio. But I'd like to see some better data to allow us to think that. Following up on something that you just mentioned a moment ago, where are you seeing the largest volume of kind of outsized short positions right now? I mean, the overall market, I mean, the size, I was looking at the size of put options trading for a week straight, you're talking about about a trillion dollars worth of, of notional puts. So by the way, I put that number in perspective, the high yield markets, the US high yield markets are trillion to quarter, a trillion a day, put options are trading. Now, they're, that's full notional size. So they're obviously trade on a delta basis lower than that. But that's, that is big. And then I look at exposures across a lot of the, what is faster money, hedge fund type, and that's really low in terms of exposure. And I think money managers have brought down their exposure pretty significantly. So, you know, that is significant. And that's where I think you've got a market that once it jumps, you get some short covering that comes in. Or so people, people worry that they're going to miss it. I guess I, I don't think they're going to miss it. But it's not to say, you know, you go through periods where you have real bear markets, you get these spiked rallies. You mentioned a minute ago, that in periods like this, we start to see where the leverages in the system, where the risk is in the system. Where do you have your eyes on that we might see more signs of that? So, you know, there's something really different than 15, 20 years ago, when you hide the big subprime crisis, and you had leverage in the financial system, corporates, households. You actually don't have that today. Banks are in good shape from a leverage perspective. Corporates are households are in good shape, relatively, or they've been in history. You know, the one place you got to keep your eye on is the real estate market. So, commercial real estate, residential real estate. You know, that's where you have financing. Not just leverage, but you've got to roll over your financing. And so, the way commercial real estate projects work, obviously, Rezzi, is you've got to roll over your financing, and that's where you can get some tricky things. And by the way, you've seen it, you know, we've been buying triple A commercial mortgages, and getting close to six and a half, and you know, there's one piece we bought, cost of seven percent, triple A. You know, so you think about subordinated, done underneath that. So, when that happens, you start to think about, gosh, if I can buy triple A assets, that's sort of yield. Why would I take much risk otherwise? Well, the other difference between now and then, though, is that you have a lot more private credit companies that are not the banks. Are they a source of risk at all in this environment? I would say generally not because they're liabilities. They're usually locked up money. Usually, they've got not money for a longer period of time. So, I don't generally don't think that they are significant risk to unwind. You know, there are structures that take place in the market that are, you know, in and around, you know, some of the COLO markets or otherwise, that you got to keep your eye on. But I would say generally, the private financing, generally, is pretty well termed out in terms of, in terms of where that capital has been raised. So, I don't think that's a stress point today. But like I say, guaranteed, whenever you get this sort of shock to the system, something's going to pop up that you didn't expect. And, you know, similar to what happened in the UK. I mean, who would have thought the UK, you know, have an issue in the pension system? And that's, but that is a lusher of what happens to these situations. Let's say on financial stability, a competitor puts out a survey this morning, lots of charts in there is noting worsening risks to financial stability, now weighing on equities. But you don't see that. This is not great recession stuff we're seeing right now in the markets. It's great recession in terms of the economy slowing or just... I mean, we don't see the same things in housing, I mean, there's not a smell.",https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OFbNeKtIJNY,36,2022-10-19 16:27:39
3651," session stuff we're seeing right now in the markets. It's great recession in terms of the economy slowing or it's... I mean, we don't see the same things in housing. I mean, it's not in the same situation. We just see stock prices going down. Right. I so... Listen, it's been historic in 50 years, probably longer than that. You've never seen rates and risk go down at the same time. And that is... I mean, that is an illustration of the fastest tightening we've ever seen by the Central Banks in history. Because, by the way, not just the US, but the emerging markets, the ECB, the Bank of England. So that is just what happens on the backside of it. And it's just not clear how much the economy is going to slow on the backside of it. What we are seeing that I think is encouraging is you're starting to see the goods part of the economy come down a bit. And that is healthy. You're seeing that inflation. You're seeing that in... In sheer demand for goods. What you're not seeing yet is a service sector. It's a service sector in great shape, education, leisure, health care, solid, both in terms of inflation as well as demand. So you've got an economy that's actually in pretty good shape. I think people underestimate while the economy is going to slow, the good sector is going to slow. You're seeing that embodied in commodity prices, home builders, etc. But the service economy, the US economy is two thirds, consumption is two thirds service. It's hard to bring that down. That's exactly what I wanted to ask you about. Both regard to where we sit right now within this shift because what we've heard so far from the banks that have reported, from the airlines that have reported, we've spoke with Delta CEO and they're talking about this shift in goods to services really benefiting the experience economy as well. Is that something that if you look out into early 2023, even further into midway through 2023, that that remains, that demand remains strong and solid enough as consumers are still looking across their own balance sheets where we've seen that go from as the banks would describe it as strong to now just healthy, if you will. I mean, listen, there is, when you lift fuel costs and food costs as much as they have, it definitely has an effect on consumption generally. But gosh, if you side, will a service sector continue to hold up? You still have got, look at where wage levels are, relative to anything we've ever seen in history. You look at where the amount of savings that's built up, my sense is the service economy will continue to do well. By the way, it's an aging demographic, the demand for health care services is not going anywhere other than up from here. So I still think you've got a solid service economy. People lament where the economy has slowed to, but keep in mind, we had double digit nominal GDP last year. We're slowing from that and you're still going to have nominal GDP this year. That's going to post an impressive number that could be closer to five. So still pretty good. Are we slowing? Is a good sector slowing? Yes. By the way, it's very different in commodity oriented economies. It's very different in parts of China today, although we think next year will be better. Emerging markets are tougher. But, and by the way, we go to Europe and this is what's creating a lot of the fall. In Europe, when you lift fuel costs as much as you have historic, and then, you look at the UK, you look at mortgage rates, spiking higher, consumer 70% of the consumption basket gets now eaten up by just their utility bill and their mortgage. So you think about how difficult that paradigm presents itself. But US relative to the rest of the world is in reasonable shape. All right. Let's leave it there on that hopeful note. Good to see you in person there, BlackRock's Chief Investment Officer of Global Fixed Income Recreator. We'll talk to you soon. Thanks for stopping by.

3652," you you You Great to have you on today. Certainly a big day. You're taking the wraps off of the big EV here. Question to you here. We have seen this market get increasingly crowded, but you are competing in the ultra luxury space. What's the demand for EVs look like there? I mean, so far I can tell you, first of all, good morning. It's great. And this is a historic day here. We are launching, first of all, the very first electric Rosroy's. We are the very first loans rightly so. As you said a minute ago, to be in that ultra luxury segment, the very first offering an electric car. And for that reason, we are very much looking forward to it. And so far, order entry is already really great and very pleasing. And it's not only the United States, but it's all over the world. And I think we are working on electrifying the brand already for quite a while. We are experimenting with it since 10 years. And quiz our clients worldwide on what their requirements would be. So I foresee a very good future also in the ultra high luxury segment. And for us, allow me to say that electric propulsion fits perfect to the brand. It's quiet, silent, very talky, delivers worthability. And also interesting story goes back to what one of our founding fathers said in 1900, Charles Rolts made a prophecy and said the perfect propulsion for cars is electric. Once charging is fixed. And I think now we are here fulfilling his prophecy. Hey, Torres St. Prasya, good to see you again. I had a question about sort of the engineering challenge is making a Rolls Royce into an EV. I know you say that it's a Rolls Royce first in an EV second. What kind of challenge did you guys face having to make this sort of a pieldier audience? Good point, Pras. I think as I said already, we started looking into it over 10 years ago when we launched that experimental phantom, a 1 or 2 ex. And we put quite a lot of clients worldwide behind the wheel. And one finding was, fits perfect to the brand. But charging time and also range needs to be fully sufficient. So for that reason, that took us a while because one thing was also clear, don't compromise the Rolls Royce experience. And all that in combination challenged our engineers, as you can imagine, because it was clear, it needed to be magic carpet ride, it was clear that it needed to carry sufficient range. And we are offering now 520 kilometers, we are in a 20 miles range. And I think that is very sufficient and definitely on what our clients expect in that segment to happen. And for that reason, I think we got here. But the challenge was on our hands and we are not yet completely finished. The car is still in the testing worldwide. And the testing ends end of June next year. And then first deliveries will be...",https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OFbNeKtIJNY,38,2022-10-19 16:35:47
3653," The car is still in the testing worldwide and the testing ends end of June next year. And then first deliveries will be done by end of next year when first clients also in the United States market take delivery of their specter. Hey Torchins, so you guys are like you mentioned the cars and they'd come out end of next year. Have you guys faced any issues with part shortages, components, things like that as you need to kind of kind of put in the place before these cars are delivered? I mean we are working here closely together also with the BMW group in terms of let's say some technical and laundry components. We have invited quite a lot of clients already over here to Goodwood to see specter and they were all highly fascinated by what they have seen. Many of them placed already orders and deposits. So for that reason I think that's good. We also see the car now more often in the markets. We will bring it also to the United States before so that clients can see it real in front of them. So I think we're going to shorten that or we're going to make waiting fun for specter. That's for sure. Torchins, I wonder where you think we are in this transition to EVs and I'm not just talking about the ultra luxury space when you look at where market share is globally. It's just over 10% in terms of where EV stand in the broader auto market. Here in the US it's just at 5%. Are we at a tipping point or is it going to take a little more whether that is higher oil prices or higher gas prices or a little more accessibility in the cars to get to full acceleration in this transition which a lot of governments hope will be 100% EVs? Yeah I mean first of all we are not really in the car business. Sounds funny now. We are in the luxury goods business. Nobody needs us to come from A to B. All our clients have multiple cars in their garage. So I think this is here different. It is that you are seen for the very first time completely emission-free in a luxury rolls Royce and I think that's a statement. Quite a lot of our clients would like to make. For that reason I definitely foresee not only specter being excess in the market but also our forescrolling strategy to say by the end of 2030 the entire brand Rosrose motor car is fully electrified. So all new Rosroises in the next years to come are fully electrified. Hey Torcins, that's clear. Sorry about that. Hey Torcins, last time we spoke at the end of the summer we talked about how there was insatiable demand for luxury cars. You mentioned the specter being at the highest in a luxury EVs. Does that still exist now? Are we still seeing any kind of hesitation as a global market uncertainty sort of builds up here? No not at all. I remember I talked that evening at Pebble Beach obviously. So no not at all. I think we still have a very strong order intake worldwide. I think there is no reluctancy currently to invest and to indulge luxury. I think the entire luxury market not only the car market but also fashion whatever runs pretty well currently worldwide. And I think that is also due to the fact that there was quite some money accumulated in the corona times. And for that reason there is a new kind of understanding you better live now and don't postpone it to later. So people are prepared to still spend money which is great. And I think that puts us here into work. We are employing here at Goodwood over 2000 people and they profit from the fact that the luxury business is allowing me to say booming. Okay. I know process waiting to take a test drive in that car, right? Always looking for a test drive. We got to make that happen. Terce and Mueller on post. It's always good to have you on this show. Really appreciate your time and our thanks to Prosubermanian as well.",https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OFbNeKtIJNY,39,2022-10-19 16:40:10
3654," you you you you A new report from the Tax Foundation finds that tax competitiveness in the U.S. remains steady among the world's top economies ahead of big changes for 2023. For more on the report is Daniel Bunn. He's executive vice president at the Tax Foundation. Daniel, good to talk to you today. Walk me through for those who aren't as familiar with this report that you put out every year. How you sort of determine what is competitive and where the U.S. ranks right now in relation to its peers. Well, thank you for having me. This report is designed to help policymakers see where their tax system is strong on things like pro-growth measures or policies that avoid distortions and complexities. It measures the tax systems of the 38 OECD countries and the U.S. ranks 22nd on the index this year. As you mentioned, the same place as it held last year. The index puts France at the bottom and Estonia at the top. Estonia has had that place every year that we've published the index and this is its ninth year. And so let's make that comparison between a place like Estonia and the U.S. Where does the U.S. really get hurt and to your point or to the point that we made in this introduction coming to you. How is this likely to shift as a result of the provisions that have been included in the Inflation Reduction Act? So the Inflation Reduction Act introduced a tax on stock buybacks. It introduced an alternative minimum tax based on financial statement and income. And introduced a different way of calculating a lot of different tax credits. And a lot of these things just add complexity to the system. And if things stay as they are in current law, including some provisions that are expiring based on the Tax Cuts and Jobs Act from 2017, the rank will likely be slipping for the U.S. next year unless other OECV countries make them even worse than the U.S. How big of a decline are we talking about? Right now, based on what other countries are looking at, it's a shift in two places. So I would say a shift from 22nd to 24th. We've also been following very closely what's been playing out over in the UK. You could call it the big reversal. Obviously, the tax cut policies that were initially proposed by UK Prime Minister Liz Truss now in full reversal as a result of her former Finance Minister getting cut. You've got Jeremy Hunt now in place as well. I wonder how you look at this in the context of how competitive the UK can be. Number one, the policies that are now being proposed by the new Finance Minister. But also just how quickly things have been reversed.

3655," seen in a very short amount of time. One of the things that really matters for tax policy is stability. And what we've seen in the UK is the opposite of that over the last several years. And what we've seen in the last few weeks is enough U-turns that we're kind of spinning in circles. I think what this means for UK competitiveness, where the UK ranks right now is 26th on the index. And it looks like, unless policies are to improve, and it's not really clear where the government's going to go over the long term here, then that rank will be slipping as well, potentially into the 30s on the index. A lot of the policies that they introduced recently, they might have improved the rank somewhat, but I think the pro-growth measures that the government could have done were left on the table. Tax Foundation Executive Vice President Daniel Baum, good to talk to you today. Thank you. The holidays will be here before we know it. And shoppers are already getting a head start. A new survey out from ICSC found that three quarters are planning to buy gifts far in advance, capitalizing on the trend of early season deals. Here for more on that, we want to bring in Tom McGee. He's the CEO of ICSC. Tom, it's great to see you again. Let's start with this survey because you were tracking how much people are looking to spend when they are planning to spend it. And on what, let's start with that, when parts, 75% are looking to shop early. Does that mean that we're already in the middle of this holiday shopping season? Yeah, it does. Well, first of all, good afternoon. It's good to be with you again. Tom, let's think you might be muted. Oh, we got you. No, we got you. You got me, okay, okay. First of all, good afternoon. And it does mean we're in the middle of the holiday season. The holiday season starts earlier. That trend really began a pre-pandemic, but as accelerated and outpost pandemic in an inflationary environment, with a price conscious consumer looking for deals and being very selective in their shopping habits, it kind of makes sense that people would start shopping earlier. We do expect it to be a solid holiday season. We're cautious, optimistic that despite the uncertainty and concerns around inflation, which are real, that consumers will shop this season where our expectations for 6.7% retail sales growth and almost 10% growth in people going out dining over the holiday season. Wow, almost 10% increase on dining. We talked about that early shopping. Amazon Prime at their October day, Target, and Walmart both had competing events is Black Friday dead. It's an iconic day for sure, but I think that Black Friday's importance in the holiday shopping season isn't what it once was.",https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OFbNeKtIJNY,41,2022-10-19 16:48:46
3656," It's an iconic day for sure, but I think that Black Friday's importance in the holiday shopping season isn't what it once was. You know, with a longer holiday season, you know, Black Friday is one of many important days during the holiday shopping season. And Tom, when it comes to promotional activity, we've heard from a number of CEOs on recent earnings calls, anyone from Target to Nordstrom that they're planning heavy discounts. I guess from your perspective, how does this year's promotional activity compare to what we've seen in the past? You know, I would expect there to be more promotional activity this year than what we saw last year. You know, the environment's different than what we were experiencing last year. There was certainly a lot of enthusiasm and pent up demand as we got back into live shopping and a lot of our holiday traditions. We still have a lot of enthusiasm, but certainly more concerned around pricing. And so I think one way that retailers will differentiate themselves is a focus upon promotions and being selective in how they price things. This is a price conscious consumer right now. They're continuing to spend and we continue to see retail sales growth, but certainly the level of consumer confidence and concern around pricing and inflation is at a very high level. Tom, for years, we've heard about the death of brick and mortar stores and then some surprising numbers. This year retail vacancies 6.1% lowest since 2015. More stores open and closed in 21. First time in 27 years is there a shift away from online shopping or how do you explain this trend? Yeah, retail real estate. You know, if you would have closed your eyes going into the pandemic, a lot of people would have assumed that this was going to be devised at retail real estate and the opposite is really happened. It's been a rebirth and a renaissance four times in many store openings and closings this year. And really it's a combination of factors. Certainly the convergence between online and physical is upon and real. Stores are being utilized in a whole host of ways for traditional shopping, but also for fulfillment. Whether that's shipping from stores or consumers coming and doing click and collect and curbside pickup. And having retailers have really understood the importance of having a physical store to build their brand and their relationship with consumers. Online acquisition costs are significant and online only retail is not very profitable. And certainly a focus and profitability is also helping the physical retail space. So there's a whole confluence of things that have come together. So the store is here to stay and it's prominent in retail is back where it belongs. Tell me, I mean, just so the store is here to say, but I want to ask you about this online trend in the journal today, they were talking about the big bet that brands are making on live stream shopping. When you take a look at the success at least that we've seen in this space in China and compare it to what we've seen here in the US, I guess, do you think we could have a similar type of success here in the US and how critical do you see this being for the future of brands? Well, I think the whole use of media and technology and shopping has continued to evolve and mature over really the last 20 plus years. So I do think there's a role for live streaming and there's a role for a whole host of media and shopping. So I think ultimately it will just enhance and adjust the shopping experience. But I don't think what we've seen over the course of the last 20 years is that really these things come together and consumers find the right balance. I don't think live stream shopping is going to, in some way, diminish online or physical retail. I just think it'll be part of a complement of things that are at a tool chest or retailer will provide. Very interesting retail season ahead, I.C.S.C.E.O. Tom McGee, good to see you, sir. Thank you. Thank you.",https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OFbNeKtIJNY,42,2022-10-19 16:53:11
3657," you you you IDIOT Oil prices retreating today as the Biden administration reportedly plans to release 10 to 15 million barrels of oil from the strategic petroleum reserve. We're joining us now as Dan Dicke, the energy world founder, good to have you back on the show. So as we're seeing here, we see WTI down about 3% today, Brent down about 1.8%. What do you make of where the oil markets are right now and the sort of factors that are weighing the heaviest on them? Well, Richelle, the fundamental picture for oil couldn't be more bullish. And I could stay with you for a long time and tell you all the bullish factors that are in the market, Russia particularly, and their troubles with Ukraine. But in the last three months, the Biden administration, along with the Federal Reserve, has done a lot to dampen the prices of oil and gas lean. The Biden administration by using these SPR releases and the Federal Reserve, obviously, with their rate hikes, which have dampened oil risk assets. And along with bringing the dollar a lot stronger, have basically said to traders, look, the United States wants gas prices to be low through the midterms. And they're going to take major steps to do that. And that has scared most traders out of their loans. We've seen loans in the oil market disappearing since late July. And that continues despite the OPEC cut of 2 million barrels a day. It made for a very, very short-lived rally in the oil market. Very short-lived. And I love the words are right. No Biden is the greatest oil trader that ever lived. Why then was it such a short-lived rally? And why are we seeing prices right back down? Is it the strategic petroleum reserve release? Again, it's been all of these factors that have been going into it. It's entirely my entire career in oil, where I have posited for decades now, that financial inputs into markets like oil can have a more significant effect than even the fundamentals can for at least a short period of time. And this is how powerful these financial tricks are in the oil markets. We've seen oil prices moderate more than 40% from a high of over $120 to under 80 before that OPEC announcement. And at least until these midterms are out of the way, the signals are to traders. Don't get long, get out of the way, and let the United States and the central banks, not just the Federal Reserve, but the European Central Banks, jawbone with financial instruments, these oil prices lower. In the end, it won't make a difference because there's a huge supply problem and oil prices will rebound to the upside and very strongly. But for a long time, you can make these inputs into the oil market and keep gas prices long.",https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OFbNeKtIJNY,43,2022-10-19 16:57:26
3658," very strongly, but for a long time you can make these inputs into the oil market and keep gas prices low. And we've seen they've been very, very successful. So how long do you expect OPEC and OPEC plus to really stay the cause? A lot of people were surprised about the production cuts. Obviously, we're seeing what's happening with Ukraine and Russia. A lot of people are saying, look, it seems as if OPEC and OPEC plus taking Russia's side, those sort of geopolitical dynamics. What does that mean for the longer outlook for oil prices? Yeah, and I think that this is, you know, you can see the frustration on the part of OPEC and the oil producers in the mid-east who rely on oil revenues for everything. And they see a fundamental picture that should allow them to get $110, $120, $130 a barrel but are getting only $80 a barrel. And that is frustrating and they know why it's happening and they're trying to fight back to gain control of their market space. But for right now, the Federal Reserve and Joe Biden do have control of this oil market, which is why I kind of made a joke about Joe Biden being the greatest oil trader I've ever seen. He released oil about 250 million barrels and basically sold it into the marketplace at $110, $115. And now he's looking to buy it back for $80. Now that's a heck of a trade on 250 million barrels. That's about $10 billion in profit, he's going to make the United States. That's a pretty good trade. He's become a pretty good oil trader. There was a relevant joke. So the midterms are less than three weeks away. Are we going to see $100 barrel by the end of the year? I don't know if it's by the end of the year, of course, because the recession talk is so massive and therefore it does, you know, put a damper on risk assets. But we will see sometime in 23 of my prediction, new highs above $120 a barrel. The fundamental picture on oil is as bullish as I've seen in the 40 years I've been following it. And in the end, fundamentals will out. We will see those prices rise. Now a lot of people are wondering, does this necessarily mean we're going to see some more relief at the pump ahead of the midterms? You know that that's one of the main reasons we're seeing this release from the SPF? Do you think that's going to be the case? Yeah, you're going to see prices. I mean, we've seen them basically moderate. A lot of people were screaming with their pants on fire when OPEC made that announcement for a 2 million barrel drop that gas prices would immediately shoot back to $5. But you know, we kind of knew that it was going to stay. It was an unsustainable rally. And so you know, you know, you're seeing what, 365, 70, a gallon, I don't think you're going to see $4 in any in any shape or form before the midterms. And if it does get close to that, a Biden will make another release of the SPR and chase more traders out of the market and drop prices because that is the prime directive right now for the Democrats to make sure that gas prices aren't what mess up for them possible success in the midterm elections. Sure. Huge ramifications for the Democratic Party. Do you expect OPEC plus to have a counter move? That was the account of move, the 2 million barrels. And in fact, now that they've made that counter move, they will wait until after the midterms and see if the markets will start to respond to fundamentals. And if they don't respond to fundamentals, that won't be the last cut that they announce and they will continue to cut prices until they feel they're going to get, you know, the fundamental price that they think they deserve, which is triple digits and above. That was my question. So post midterms, you could see a further cut from OPEC, yes? They will cut, they will continue to cut until they see what they believe to be a fair fundamental price for oil, which is what they're not getting right now. Wow, so this battle, not over yet. Dan Dicker, the energy we're good to see, man. Good information. Thank you. In this episode of influencers, New York, Congresswoman Alexandria Ocasio-Cortez. Capitalism at its core, what we're talking about when we talk about that is the absolute pursuit of profit at all human, environmental, and social cost. A lot of these pricing increases are potentially due to just straight price gouging by my corporation.",https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OFbNeKtIJNY,44,2022-10-19 17:02:08
3659," Just straight price-gouging fire corporation. If we just allow a full just continuation of student loan payments, we are talking about a catastrophic development for millions. Hello everyone and welcome to Influencers, I'm Andy Sirward and welcome to our guest representative Alexandria Ocasio-Cortez. Representative, nice to see you. Thank you, thank you so much. I know you want to talk about student debt and some other issues as well, but before we get to that, I want to ask you about inflation and interest rates and Fed Chair Powell, who recently said that the strong labor market made it appropriate for him to soon raise interest rates. I wonder what your take on that is. Well, you know, I think particularly when we have this conversation in the context of inflation as well, it's really not just labor, it's not just rising wages, but there's a lot of different dynamics that I think are contributing to the increase in prices, whether it's supply chain complications, yes, labor issues, but sometimes lack of labor, lack of the ability to be able to work consistently in their jobs, which is also tied to pandemic controls, and also there's a real distinction to be made between inflation and price gouging, and there's a lot of evidence that particularly industries with high concentrations, corporate concentrations, whether it's almost oligopoly level industries, a lot of these price increases are potentially due to just straight price gouging by corporations. Are you concerned about inflation and higher interest rates and the impact on working people? I mean, wherever prices are increasing and it's making it difficult for someone to be able to feed their family, that is always going to be a major point of concern, a primary point of concern. But the real key is making sure that we're diagnosing the causes correctly, because the danger here is that if we say we're helping working people too much and say that the cause of this is, oh, it's because we provided too much assistance during the American Rescue Plan, stimulus checks were too generous, that is why we are dealing with the problems that we're dealing with now. What that's going to result in is a pullback in the assistance that some families need the most right now. And when we already talk about the cessation of the Child Tax Credit with the failure to pass the Billback Better Act before the end of last year, we really need to be very careful about diagnosing these issues correctly, because on the flip side of that coin, if we say there are real antitrust issues here, there's a lot of corporate abuse of power, leading to price gouging, then that allows us to pursue lanes such as antitrust, and also pursue labor protections, COVID protections that can help people get back into the workplace and stay safe in the workplace. Right, so you are seeing those who are suggesting that it's because of the assistance that people had during COVID that that's inflationary and therefore we need to swing the pendulum back. Yeah, and I couldn't disagree more. I couldn't disagree more with that assessment. Student loan debt, and I know you've called repeatedly for President Biden for give student loan debt. Why hasn't that happened? And what do you think will happen if the pause that exists presently is allowed to lapse? Well, I cannot understate the danger and the risk economically, politically, and just where we are right now is a country of allowing the moratorium on student loan payments to lapse in May. If we just allow a full just continuation of student loan payments, we are talking about a catastrophic development for millions, the over almost 50 million student loan borrowers in this country. There were millions of student loan borrowers that were already defaulting, going into the pandemic.",https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OFbNeKtIJNY,45,2022-10-19 17:06:08
3660," over almost 50 million student loan borrowers in this country. There were millions of student loan borrowers that were already defaulting going into the pandemic. But more than that, we are at such a delicate point in the financial and just general economic recovery post-COVID that to then restart payments that are essentially the size of a mortgage payment, sometimes even larger on a generation that was already so devastated, not just by this, but the recession, etc. I believe it could throw out of balance already what is a very fragile recovery. Not only that, but this forgiveness is the just thing to do, it's the right thing to do. Why the president hasn't done it yet, I'm not sure, but I do think that this is an issue of increasing urgency. He has already indicated an openness to it, and he has actually already used his authority to forgive student loan debt in certain small, very narrow cases. Because there are people who suggest he doesn't have the authority, is that a legitimate argument or just maybe a smoke screen? I don't think it's a legitimate argument. We've seen, in fact, we've seen him use the same legal authority that the president is used to suspend student loan payments, is the same authority that he would use to cancel them. Not only that, but he has used that authority. He has indicated a willingness to use the authority, and I think that it would be extraordinarily important and urgent for him to do so. What about the argument that it's a moral hazard, in other words, you're letting people off the hook by forgiving the debt? Well, what I think is the true moral hazard here is the surging costs of education in the United States. What is actually created the moral hazard is this guarantee of saying we will issue minors, hundreds of thousands of dollars in student loan debt at almost any level with almost no limit, and we will allow colleges and universities to dramatically increase the costs of their tuition with the guarantee of that loan value on 17-year-olds. What is the actual true moral hazard here in the situation? Is the controls on the cost of education in the United States? One very important control in this, to that note, is tuition-free public colleges and universities, because then what that does is that it introduces competition into the market to which private universities have to actually meet a lower baseline. But people act as though it's just fancy public schools that are extremely expensive now, but public college tuition has also increased dramatically far beyond the pace of inflation.",https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OFbNeKtIJNY,46,2022-10-19 17:10:23
3661, you you you you have a huge social media following obviously in a big platform have you been either surprised by how much or how little influence that affords you in Congress in other words how does that translate representative you know that's an interesting question I think it's the way that I've thought about it I go first going into office and then continuing is that there are a lot of in Washington there are a lot of different sources of power there are some members who have extraordinary connections to different powers players different power centers that are very well connected and networked there are other individuals who are very frankly financially connected industry lobbyists corporations throw their weight and donate and give their influence their lobbyists etc throw an enormous amount of their support behind other members of Congress so every single member kind of has their their you know their assets that they lean on and for me I decided early on because I don't accept money from corporations I do not take meetings with lobbyists I am not well connected I don't come from a well connected family or or community or anything like that that my ability to navigate and advocate is going to have to be squarely rooted in relying on everyday people and their support and my ability to communicate with them what is going on in Washington. It's an interesting perspective you self-identify as a democratic socialist and have called capitalism irredeemable I believe but what does that really mean and does that mean capitalism should be eliminated and are your views compatible with capitalism. Well you know I I believe that in a broad sense because when we toss out these big words capitalism socialism they get you know sensationalized and people translate them into meaning things that perhaps they don't mean so to me capitalism at its core what weren't what we're talking about when we talk about that is the absolute pursuit of profit at all human environmental and social cost that is what we're really discussing and what we're also discussing is the ability for a very small group of actual capitalists and that is people who have so much money that their money makes money and they don't have to work and they can control industry they can control our energy sources they can control our labor they can control massive markets that they dictate and can capture governments and they can,https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OFbNeKtIJNY,47,2022-10-19 17:14:29
3662," She sources they can control our labor, they can control massive markets, that they dictate and can capture governments and they can essentially have power over the many. And to me, that is not a redeemable system for us to be able to participate in, for the prosperity and peace, for the vast majority of people. So people talk about stakeholder capitalism, like Larry Fink at BlackRock, where the waiting for different constituents besides shareholders is more equal. Is that something you'd be amenable to? Well, I think at the end of the day, it's who, it is about who has control over the very core assets of production in society. If it ultimately comes down to a billionaire or the Koch brothers or the Koch family, having control over the vast majority or large plurality of our oil assets in the United States, if it's a handful of very wealthy families having control over, you know, private families having control over means of production, that is essential to the capitalist system that we live in. It is a small group that is of privatized control over what we eat and how we fuel our society. Now where we can transition to, and there are certain ideas where we're talking about, for example, Elizabeth Warren has discussed workers being elected to the board, governing boards of companies, and also, you know, we're here in the Bronx. I represent a community that has the largest concentration of worker cooperatives in, you know, one of the largest concentrations in the world. Now these are alternative ways of doing business. You know, free markets are not the same thing as capitalism. And you can have markets where businesses and ways of producing, trading, selling goods are really controlled and not just controlled, but given more power to workers, people get a fair shake, union jobs, unionized workplaces. All of these are different steps and levels that we're talking about in a more just economy. Congress people trading stocks. You have come out calling for a ban here. And I wonder, and there seems to be some momentum, but I wonder why this seems to be such a difficult thing to pass. And is Speaker Pelosi a roadblock here? Well, you know, I, it's not, it's not really a mystery to me. Why it's difficult to pass. In an enormous amount, I wouldn't be surprised if it was a majority of members of Congress hold and trade individuals stock. I don't know the actual numbers, but it is a very large degree. And you know, the key here is that it's not to say that you can't have a retirement fund or a college savings account or a blind trust. A blind trust, a mutual fund and index fund. These are vehicles of investments that are broad. That individual members of Congress don't have direct control over. But even last year, there was at least 75 members of Congress that held individual stock in Johnson and Johnson, Viderna and Pfizer. And we're talking about in the last one to two years. And so that is where we should be drawing the line. I am a member of Congress. Members of Congress have access to very sensitive security clearances. We have access to very detailed tailored briefs. We are job is to try to anticipate and legislate for what we see as coming. And we should not have the ability to both have access to that information and be able to hold and trade individual stock. And that's really what this is about. It's about our ability to direct and hold trades in individual stock with access to the sensitive information that the public has given us. Voting rights reform. Is that a dead issue? It's tied to the filibuster? Joe Manchin, Kirsten Sinema, come out against it. What does your take on where that stands? You know, this is, I think, one of the top level questions and issues that we have before us in Congress. I very much believe that.",https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OFbNeKtIJNY,48,2022-10-19 17:19:12
3663," I think one of the top level questions and issues that we have before us in Congress, I very much believe that we are at the precipice of a return to Jim Crow style laws across the country. We are already seeing these wheels of motion, attempts in Texas and Georgia across many different states, attempts at voter suppression. And frankly, what Senators mentioned in cinema failed to recognize and what is disappointing and sad to see is how a historic their stances have been throughout this debate.",https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OFbNeKtIJNY,49,2022-10-19 17:23:20
3664," What is your ultimate objective when it comes to those big tech companies representative? Well when you look at a company like Facebook, you can't kind of put them all in the same boat. They do different things. But when you look at a company like Facebook and the completely corrosive ways that they have exercised in abuse, I believe, in civil society writ large. Not just our democracies, but you look at, for example, what we're hearing from other countries. When we talk about production of vaccines or perhaps like what we can do to export help them, they say it's not just, there are some things that the United States provide that are welcome. There's also things that we want the United States to stop exporting. And one of those things is disinformation. And disinformation through US founded companies like Facebook that have absolutely slowed and frankly sabotaged the global effort to fight against the coronavirus. And we see this both this disinformation used both in public health sphere. We've also seen social scientists have truly shown the impact that Facebook has had in contributing to social violence and perhaps even accelerating at large scale, very dangerous and some would call genocidal activities in places like South Asia, etc. human rights abuses and also hate here at home. But I'm curious what you think we should do about them or what we should do to them, I guess. Facebook should be broken up. We should pursue antitrust activity on Facebook and there are so many different reasons why. They are acting as an advertiser. They're acting as both platform and vendor. They are a communications platform which has historically been a well established domain of antitrust. And so because they are so many businesses and industries in one, the cases I believe right there in and of itself as to why they should be subject to antitrust activity. I want to ask a couple of personal questions about you. I'm teaching a Columbia this semester and one of my students Penny Ramirez Fernandez wanted me to ask you how did being a waitress help you understand the American economy is successes and failures? Well I mean I believe that my time as a waitress is the most politically formative experience that I had. It's that along with just growing up in a working class family experiencing just the ravages of the great recession, almost losing our home, all of that. But particularly the years that I spent working in restaurants. The thing about restaurants is that it is it really is such a crucible of so many different public policies. I worked alongside undocumented workers. I didn't have health insurance. I tried to buy Obamacare, you know the ACA Affordable Care Act. I actually used and relied on the policies that were coming out of Washington. And I worked, you know I was a Senate intern back in college. I got an economics degree. I worked in in in public policy spaces. I also had worked for nonprofits. There is a ocean of a difference between the white papers and the policy you see on paper and how it's experienced by everyday people. And unless you actually go on to the exchange and try to buy health care for yourself and use that health care.",https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OFbNeKtIJNY,50,2022-10-19 17:27:40
3665," by everyday people. And unless you actually go on to the exchange and try to buy health care for yourself and use that healthcare and understand how it's serving you and how it's not serving you, it's very difficult to understand why so many people are frustrated by otherwise well-meaning, sometimes democratic policy. As a former dishwasher, I can relate. So I want to ask you maybe a kind of funny question about the moniker AOC. So is that when your friends and family call you or how did that, when did that sort of evolve? When did you become AOC? I actually think it's funny enough. AOC really emerged after I won my primary. And I think there were a lot of pundits on television that were kind of like stumbling because my name is Alexandria Ocasio-Cortez. It was the news story after I won my primary. It was so sudden. And there were just all these folks on TV that I think were kind of like struggling to say my name that it actually started coming from TV. And so in the past, there were some folks that would sometimes say like jokingly, but it was never a nickname that stuck. But I think it actually kind of came from media pretty overnight. But my friends don't call me that. The folks that I organize with. Do they call you Alexandria? They'll call me Alexandria or they'll call me Alex. My friends will call me Alex. But yeah, it's a, you know, it's shorthand, but I now embrace it, welcome it, except it. And final question, maybe it's too early in your career to ask this, but I'm gonna ask anyway. How do you see your legacy going forward? You know, I always feel like I actually think that it is important for young people to ask themselves questions of legacy very early. And I think the reason that that's important is because we shouldn't root our legacy in a position or a job or a role, but we should really root it in a mission of what we want to do qualitatively and how we want to be remembered. And I don't think it's ever too early to consider that because it helps us make decisions, it helps us root us in our values and our morals. And I just hope that for me, you know, what I do and what my community understands and receives and feels for me as their representative is someone that always puts the people of this country first that doesn't allow herself to be dissuaded or distracted by power, influence, et cetera, and that we are dissuaded and relentless and honest and authentic in our pursuit for a better world and that, you know, that in that pursuit, we just tell it as it is and try to do everything we can in every moment that we can. And I think that's pretty much it. That's it. Representative Alexandria Ocasio Cortez. Thank you so much for your time. Of course, thank you so much. You've been watching influencers. I'm Andy Cerwer. We'll see you next time. We're going to talk about the other sections. Now, that is not saying no reductions, but they're going to have to make some fine-tuning given the declines, them and all of Wall Street has seen in deal activity this year. It's really hard to pick out a common theme. Because a lot of what you said sounded pretty positive. Then you get the likes of Jamie Diamond, you know, raising a lot of red flags about the economic growth and economists who we talk to who were also cautious about the economy. So it's difficult to sort of synthesize all of this into a coherent narrative. perfectly summarizes everything you just brought up. It is a weird time to be an investor. In many respects, we see economic growth slowed out. We're seeing consumer price inflation still at a 40-year high. But again, you have a proctor and gamble coming out here, beating on earnings, Goldman Sachs, beating on earnings, Bank of America beating on earnings. It's strange. We need like a wolf sound with that full screen. Oh, yeah. Something aggressive. Or you and the Michael Jackson thriller.",https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OFbNeKtIJNY,51,2022-10-19 17:32:48
3666," It's strange. We need like a wolf sound with that, with that full screen. Ooh, yeah. Something aggressive. You're, or you and, you know, the Michael Jackson thriller. Oh, sure. Yeah. It's red. All right, guys, coming up on the other side of this short break, why are next guests expects an upcoming recession that hits the economy much harder than anticipated? It's coming up. Chicken. oh, shit. [(loud exploding)] Welcome back to Yow Finance. I'm Brian Sasey alongside Julie Heiming and Brad Smith. Markets, well we're seeing some a little bit of red action on the screen despite a better than expected earnings you for from PNG. CEO John Mueller told me the consumer staying resilient in the face of high inflation, but nonetheless right now we're seeing the markets in the red. Now here's what's on tap for you this hour. Here comes Tesla's earnings. Our senior auto correspondent, Presseuber Manian, teased up Tesla's earnings for you as they are out after the close. The demand for faucets, Fortune Brand, CEO Nicholas Fink, stops by for an in-depth look into the building products maker amid the housing market slowdown. In no recession, that's a take from Bank of America, CEO Brian Moynihan, and might chat with him just a moment ago. We'll have that interview coming up. Brad, over to you. All right, taking a look at the major averages here is we've struck the top of the 10 AM hour, 30 minutes into trade. And I want to give you a three-day look at what's kind of taken place here over the course of this week, even despite today's little blip-a-dip blip, we are seeing us hold on to a three-day gain of about 2.8% here for the Dow Jones industrial average. The NASDAQ composite, you're seeing that hold on to gains of about 3.7% over that three-day period. But here today, right now, down by about 6.35% minutes into trade. Also the S&P 500, you're seeing that lower on the day. That's down by about half a percent. We ran through some of the sectors earlier, but I'd love to.",https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OFbNeKtIJNY,52,2022-10-19 17:37:11
3667," down by about six cents of percent, 35 minutes into trade. Also the S&P 500, you're seeing that lower on the day. That's down by about half a percent. We ran through some of the sectors earlier, but I'd love to shift your attention over to retail, as we're keeping an eye on some of those names, especially within that consumer discretionary construct or discussion here, and especially going into a holiday season where we're still going to be looking through Amazon, Walmart, and some of these sales that are set to commence that have already actually kicked off, Walmart actually announcing this morning that they are not going to be open on Thanksgiving. That continues what we had seen over some recent years as well in 2020 and 2021. So keep a close eye on these retail names, Amazon, down by about 1.7% Walmart, down by about two, tens of a percent, target also lower on the day by about six, tens of a percent. So that's a retail roundup, if you will, for right now, this is the top of the 10 a.m. hour. Julie? Oh, no, actually no, we've got a guest that's coming in. Although it may feel like we're already in one, many economists still don't think the US meets the formal definition of a recession based on broader measures such as income, spending, and job growth. The street is currently expecting a recession sometime in the first quarter of 2023, but our next guest says it will take a bit more time joining us now. We've got Jeffrey Senior Economist, Thomas Simon's, Thomas, great to have you here with us today. Help us really run through what your expectations are and why and when, why in terms of the catalysts and then when in terms of timing you're expecting a recession to hit. Sure. So I think the main difference between our call and many of our competitors is just a sense that the economy is really approaching this period of time from a position of much greater strength than it typically does as it rolls into a recession. So you pointed out just as the chart before you had a couple of quarters of negative GDP growth, but Q3 is really shaping up to be quite a bit stronger. And Q4, I don't have any expectations and we're going to end up with a negative number again. It's really into the second half of next year that we're going to start to see the cumulative effects of all the hikes start to really hit and plus the strength of the dollar as well. I don't think that we've really seen much evidence that that's actually taken a big bite out of economic activity just yet because the economy is just generally less interest rate sensitive than it normally is at this point in the business cycle. Lots of consumers and businesses already have a lot of locked in cheap borrowing that doesn't need to be refinanced anytime soon. You look at things like mortgage rates and these sorts of things that are spiking. But consumers don't have a lot of adjustable rate loans. So the same sort of dynamic is at play with businesses. With balance sheets are very, very strong. We haven't seen much margin compression just yet either. These sorts of things we expect are going to start to really take hold into the second half of 2023, especially as effect continues to raise interest rates here. Thomas, man, we have been on the drumbeat for this recession for what feel is like so long now. And now it sounds like according to you, we're going to be on it for quite a while longer before we actually get there. You in your latest note have this sort of scenario that you're painting of entering it later. And then I believe in the first quarter of 2024 seeing the worst of it with a drop of 2.3% in growth here or in GDP, I should say, what is that going to feel like? How does that comport with what we are hearing generally painting a picture of a relatively mild recession? I mean, 2.3% is that a relatively mild recession? Now what it all happens in one quarter, it's not going to feel particularly great. One thing to keep in mind is that it's not going to feel like 2020 and it's not going to feel like 2009 either. Even though 2.4% are thereabouts for a quarterly decline is something that we are not used to. And it seems like a lot in the context of some pretty positive growth rates we've seen recently. It's not totally out of the question relative to how the economy used to behave before the financial crisis. So I mean, I think it's interesting just in the past segment that we had before, we're talking about all these comments from CEOs about how the inventory cycle isn't as bad as they thought, like the margins are still good, pricing power is still pretty well retained. These sorts of things are what's going to push us a little bit further and is what again, is going to have to make the fed raise rates even a little bit higher.",https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OFbNeKtIJNY,53,2022-10-19 17:41:08
3668," are still good, pricing power is still pretty well retained. These sorts of things are what's going to push us a little bit further. And is what again, is going to have to make the Fed raise rates even a little bit higher and is going to cause us to fall farther and faster and slow down faster when we get into the second half of 2023 and into 2024, like you mentioned as well. So Thomas, you know, against this backdrop of a recession next year at some point of some magnitude, what happens to inflation? So inflation, we expect is going to gradually slow through this year, you know, the remainder of this year and into next year. We probably have peaked, I want to say, although I feel like we've been saying that inflation has peaked since March of this year, something like that. And then we continue to see this really sticky pressure in a lot of the core measures, you know, specifically housing seems to be pushing us recently. I do think that as we get into the second half of, or into the first half of next year, excuse me, we will see a gradual decline and then more of an acceleration of that decline as we get into the second half of next year as unemployment rises. It's really that's the key is that the Fed needs to raise rates to lower demand, which is going to lower employment, raise the unemployment rate and get us to lower inflation eventually into next year. The question is how much does unemployment have to really rise, right? That's certainly an open point of debate at the Fed right now. We think that the unemployment rate probably has to get above 5% before we're going to get meaningful significant deceleration towards target for inflation, because, you know, with inflation so high as it is now, it can decelerate a lot and still be uncomfortably above target for the Fed. 5% out. All right. That's Jeffrey senior economist Thomas Simon. Thank you so much. Really appreciate perspective here. And even big tech can't shake off the economic slowdown that we have been again looking ahead to for a long time. You know, who finance this tech editor Dan Halley is joining us now. And obviously we've been paying a lot of attention to tech and sort of a retrenchment in tech. But you've got a sort of big picture look at what we're seeing. Yeah. So, you know, we're talking about the different variables that are going into kind of the tech industry right now and what we're seeing. And so, you know, we usually look at tech obviously is kind of not necessarily not even close to, you know, recession proof, but we have these stalwarts that you think can weather these storms pretty well. But we're starting to see cracks in this kind of facade. So, Microsoft obviously announcing layoffs yesterday not saying how many exactly we had, but about 1,000 is what the going number is. That follows their prior move to layoff about 1% of their workforce in July. So, Microsoft despite being this huge cloud company that does incredibly well in that area, they had, you know, double-digit growth in cloud in the prior quarter, they're still having to contend with these kinds of issues. We have Meta and Intel, two of the worst performers right now, Meta stockdowns, 60% year-to-date, Intel down 49% year-to-date. We also have Meta pushing people out the door, not necessarily laying people off, but saying, hey, maybe you're not right for this position in so many words. We had Google, they weren't necessarily laying people off, but they closed their area 120 division, which does some research for different products. And so, they shuttered those products and they had these people reapply for jobs. And then, when you look at the consumer side of things, we have Apple yesterday, basically not announcing, but the reports coming out that they're cutting production of their iPhone 14 plus. And that was prior to that, we had heard that they were reducing some of the production for their iPhone 14 in general to about what the iPhone 13 levels were. So, you know, this whole idea of, you know, big tech being this huge force, obviously, the idea that them being immune to any kind of market factors is really, I mean, that's not true at all, but we are starting to see kind of the pain really set in for these companies. And, you know, I talked to some people, they're saying that essentially, this isn't going to get better until perhaps some point in 2023, at least for the tech industry, could go into 2024, though. There's effects concerns that they've cited as well. Many of these tech businesses, if not all of them, are certainly impacted by that.",https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OFbNeKtIJNY,54,2022-10-19 17:45:22
3669," could go into 2024 though. There's effects concerns that they've cited as well. Many of these tech businesses, if not all of them, are certainly impacted by that. But then you mentioned the consumer side, and if we can go deeper into that, what does that really spell out for this holiday season for some of the consumer technology that they're expecting to move through into households and into consumers' hands? You know, it's interesting because, as obviously these, a lot of products haven't, companies haven't raised prices on consumer products just yet, right? At least here in the US, overseas, we've seen Apple raised prices, we saw Sony raised prices on their PlayStation 5. Obviously a big holiday gift, you know, both of those. If you can find it. If you can find it. Now it's a little bit easier because not everybody's looking for them again. But, you know, I do think that we're seeing this issue with, you know, not just the slowdown in the PC market, which we've been talking about, that obviously impacts likes of Microsoft, then Intel, AMD, Nvidia. It's all these kind of knock on effects. The memory chip makers. But we're starting to perhaps see it on the smartphone inside of things. And that, you know, that would then start to hit the likes of Apple, the likes of Samsung companies in those areas. So I do think that we're going to see fewer people spending on these big ticket items. Yeah, video games, I think you're still going to do pretty well. We have a couple that are coming out, that are big names. But, you know, I don't know if it's going to necessarily be this huge blowup that we saw during the pandemic where gaming was so big, but, you know, that should still continue to do well. But, you know, the PCs, the tablets, I don't necessarily know if people are going to be getting those just because they already bought them. And so you're going to a season where people are trying to save maybe. I don't know if those are going to do particularly well. There's only so much space you have in your place to store the next computer, Dan Hall of Amen. I know, right, Dan Hall of Amen. Great analysis, appreciate it. Okay, before we had to break, let's highlight a bullish trade on Amazon, speaking of tech into its earnings report in October 27th. Well, Sandler at Barclays says he is constructive on Amazon's stock on add to positions into the earnings release, says Sandler. Proficiary data shows a couple point B on North America retail revenue, and we think international is holding up relatively well through the third quarter. Coming up, Mackenzie Scott is making a big donation to the Girl Scouts of America. Julie will break down today's top headlines next. Yeah'....",https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OFbNeKtIJNY,55,2022-10-19 17:50:06
3670," Ganif에요 Let's get down to business now. Look at some of the other headlines that we are watching. One of them involves French cement maker Lafars. It's going to pay $778 million in penalties for conspiring to support the Islamic State and an al-Qaeda affiliate. In 2013 and 2014, the company made regular payments to the Islamic State to protect its cement plant in Syria from attack. That agreement evolved into a de facto revenue sharing scheme in which Lafars actively concealed payments by forging invoices. Although Lafars' Syrian subsidiary involved in the scheme is now defunct, the company's guilty plea marks the first time a company has been charged with providing material, support, and resources to a terrorist organization. Chimaker TSMC could expand its production capacity in Japan, this according to the Walls Free Journal. That move helps Taiwan's semiconductor hedge its chip production against potential conflicts over Taiwan. All as an increasingly belligerent China continues to claim the self-governed island as part of its territory. A new Japanese plant would be in addition to one already established in Kyushu and would focus on chips used in automobiles and sensors. And Billion Armequenzi Scott is donating $84.5 million to the Girl Scouts. It's the largest donation by a single person to that youth program. Scott, who deforets Amazon founder Jeff Bezos in 2019, had earlier pledged to give away about half of her fortune to charity. The Girl Scout says the funds will be used to expand STEM and career training in its programs. What's the cost? All right, Tesla earnings are out after the close today. Yeah, finance senior auto-correspondent press, supermaning, has a preview. So, prize, I'm guessing Tesla is going to beat by 10 cents. Stocks going higher, right? I mean, with the bulls, I'm going to be a lot faster. Yeah, you know, I think it's going to be all about the delivering, I'm sorry, the demand and production sort of outlook and story there. Big headline numbers here, we're looking at about 22.13 billion. We'll be its highest ever record, highest ever, quarterly record on adjusted EPS of $1.02 cents, gap net income of $3.2 billion, that would be near and all the time. I saw a big quarter for them in the books, but we're all watching that. Can they hit that 1.4 million 2022 annual production delivery outlook? You have to make 500,000 vehicles in Q4, which is possible, but the question is, is there demand? There's concern about demand slowing in China and things like that. But other things we're going to watch, for me personally, I'm going to kind of watch about these Tesla semi kind of outlook. Are they going to be able to hit that delivery, December 1st delivery kind of with Pepsi and what's coming up for that in 2023? And then also what's happening to Cybertruck? Is that still on track for mid next year? Okay, and so it's all about where we're also going to hear capacity being brought online at some of the new factories, whether that's Austin or Berlin. What do we expect there and how many vehicles are they going to continue to produce at these factories? So, you know, that's quarterly. So that free amount was about 450,000 vehicles a year. Shanghai, they say 850,000 vehicles a year, install capacity. So that's already 1.3. The rest, Austin, Giga, Berlin. You get a couple hundred thousand from each of those. They're still ramping up. So maybe you're at 1.5, 1.7 give or take. I think that's what the street is looking for, but they're going to have to hit about 2 million in 2023 to hit that 50 percent of compound annual growth rate. So there's a lot a long way to go, but in the question also, he's like, you know, how can they keep raising prices for their cars and then also in this kind of slowing global macro environment? Are those, you know, sales going to come down potentially? Did we talk about mask being on the call yet? Did we talk about that? We didn't talk about that. He's going to be on the call. Yeah, he's going to be on the call, which he hasn't been on the call recently. And you have to wonder like the whole Twitter thing is still going on, but he hasn't really gotten a lot of money.",https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OFbNeKtIJNY,56,2022-10-19 17:54:02
3671," Did we talk about that? We didn't talk about that. He's going to be on the call. Yeah, he's going to be on the call, which he hasn't been on the call's recent. And you have to wonder, like, the whole Twitter thing is still going on, but he hasn't really gotten a lot of questions directly about that. So you wonder, are Tesla analysts going to ask about that? I don't know. I'm scared. They're going to have to ask about the call. That's what I was going to say. They posted a couple of the institutional questions that they did on their like, they pulled a survey monkey kind of thing, and also their top retail investor question. I didn't see any on the, what is Musk going to do with Twitter, et cetera, on there. Probably asked about stock sales, but I didn't see anything about his role in Twitter as of yet. I don't know. We got that. Yeah. I found that confusing. We'll see how much of this time goes there. Frost, thanks so much for there. You're going to be tracking this after the close, very closely. Everyone coming up, President Biden has unfailed his plan to combat oil production cuts by OPEC Plus. We're going to share the details next. President Biden has unveiled his plan to release 15 million barrels of oil from the U.S. strategic reserve in response to OPEC Plus production cuts. Yahoo, finances, Rick Newman joins us now with the details. Hey, Rick. Hey. So Biden is now going to release more oil from the U.S. strategic reserve and other 15 million barrels. This is a continuation of a program that's been going on since May, and that was originally supposed to end in October, and it has now been extended into November and then into December. And I wonder why that might be. Oh, it could only be the midterm elections, but obviously once it looks like he's doing something continually to get gasoline priced down. There's another important element of this though that's new, it's getting less attention, but it might be more important by the energy department is going to do something new, and they're going to enter into contracts to buy.",https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OFbNeKtIJNY,57,2022-10-19 17:58:16
3672," attention, but it might be more important by the energy department is going to do something new and they're going to enter into contracts to buy oil from the private sector from the market at prices of around $70 and the reason that's important is that it is telling oil producers that there's going to be demand for oil even when the price falls below current levels. So the government is kind of establishing itself as a customer of last resort if you will and the thinking behind this is oil producers will say oh well if oil prices fall we will still be able to sell it to the government at prices where we can make a profit and so that's a little bit of extra demand that producers know will be there in the future and that might get them to produce more oil. We will find out this goes all the way into 23, 24 and probably even into 2025. So it's meant to have a long-term effect on oil supplies. But that also continues the sort of thorny questions of climate change and the sort of push pull that the Biden administration has done with the oil industry right if they're you know saying on the one hand everybody should be transitioning to renewables on the other hand we're going to be buying oil from you for a few years for $70 but I guess that also helps ease the transition for the oil companies. You're right Julie but I think one of the things that we we should have clearly learned in 2022 is we need a better a better bridging strategy from fossil fuels to renewables because we don't have nearly enough renewables to replace fossil fuels right now and because markets energy markets are priced at the margins you could have just a small shortfall of oil or natural gas or whatever it might be and prices can double or go up by more than double. So you know Obama during the Obama administration he had a phrase you know what's our approach to energy all of the above and I think Democrats got away from that and they pushed a little bit too hard on renewables without figuring out how to meet you know the demand for the fuel that we need today and I don't think Biden's going to come out and say this but I think what we're seeing from the Biden administration is kind of an all of the above energy strategy which is acknowledge that we need these fossil fuels today and we need to we need to assure these supplies for the next several years while at the same time pushing for renewables. Good analysis Y'all fine says senior column is Rick Newman good to see you. Hi guys coming up we'll share my interview with Bank of America seal Brian Lonehan on the back of there better than expected earnings report earlier this week that's next.",https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OFbNeKtIJNY,58,2022-10-19 18:02:26
3673," You You Welcome back Bank of America, CEO Brian Moynihan tells me spending remains strong among consumers and that a recession may not be imminent take a listen Nice to be with you again and my teammates produced a great quarter again, and I thank him for that But I think if you're talking about what we saw our customers in turn are the consumers spending for the third quarter of 2022 the consumers spent about 10% more than they did in the third quarter of 2021 so 2022 third quarter 10% over Third quarter 2021 and frankly for the first couple weeks and October we've seen that same 10% increase Now when you think about that spending think about two things one is still very strong at a relative basis even the transactions are up 6% outpaces inflation travel being a very growing part because coming from last year when you had the Delta of COVID you know Variant to this year people are traveling but on top of that though be mindful that early in the year is probably more like a 13 14% to 12% to 10% So it's being mitigated so I think the the feds changes and rates the concerns about it's going out there people are slowing down a bit But not slowing down consistent with a real slowdown economy yet, and that's that's the good news Brian, that's interesting just that you're you're calling out 10% growth Through October and I just talked to proctor and gamble CEO after their earnings They're talking about a resilient consumer are you surprised by the resilience we're seeing in US consumers here? Well, we talked in our earnings materials about resilient consumer frankly and you think about that long three three two or three dimensions First is the unemployment obviously still very low people working Second is do they have money in their bank accounts in the money in the bank accounts of our consumers are 35 million Core households a bank of America at the end of September was the same as it was at the end of August and in fact is Multiple multiples over where it was before the pandemic Especially for those consumers who are in the $100,000 under income bracket That means that they haven't spent down the stimulus and stuff and I say multiples. I give you an example consumer had about an average of $3,500 an account pre pandemic now has 13,000 that count and it's not going down so that's good news So one they have money in accounts to their spending three they are employed for they have capacitive borrow or credit card Barrowings are still about 12% below where they were peep endemic home equity line draws are down about 25 30% still now mortgage finances slow down because rates went up but the people have home equity lines in place or Have capacitive bar the house values are still strong so all that bodes well now inflation hurts Consumers especially consumers in the modern income because the inflation and goods and services spend a lot of their income on but You know, so we have to be careful about the overall position versus certain types of consumers But generally the American consumer is very resilient Brian a lot of your peers on the street over the past few weeks have come out And warned about a recession sometime over the next six months. Of course that brings us into 2023. Where does Brian Moana hints it? Well, I don't make those projections. I have this talented research team one of the best in the world if not the best in the world run by Canis Browning Platt and the team and they basically been consistent They they have this quarter meaning past quarter third quarter 22 growing then it has the fourth quarter of the",https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OFbNeKtIJNY,59,2022-10-19 18:06:46
3674," Tannis Browning, Platinum Team, and they basically been consistent. They have this quarter, meaning the past quarter, third quarter, 22 growing. Then they have the fourth quarter, the first quarter, the second quarter, the third quarter, all, and negative territories around half percent, one and a half percent. So a slight shallow down, we're trending and growing at the end of next year. They have pushed that projection for recession out a little bit into 23, but their core belief fits in the mild recession. It's coupled with unemployment that gets up to, you know, 4 to 5 percent. A Fed funds rate, likewise around 5 percent. But inflation does get under control and we come out of that recession. That's the core projection. Now against that though, the real facts are today, the consumers are spending commercial credits and great shape, consumer credits and great shape. Even though things like housing and stuff like that have flattened out because that's the way the Fed slows down the economy. The reality is that consumers still are employed in earning money. And so the Fed's toughest job and inflation is also the best thing about the U.S. economy, which is a strong consumer. So our team predicts a recession, a mild recession. They have had that projection, frankly, six months ago. They had the same projection, more or less, it just pushed out a little bit. But what we're not seeing is it come to for you yet. And that keeps moving it out because of that resiliency and the consumer. By all indications, Brian, the Federal Reserve is going to continue to move higher with rates over the course of its next few meetings. What does that mean for your net interest margins over the next couple quarters? Well, one of the things that people know about banking is a core way we make a half our money or more is through what they call a spread. I had the difference between what we lend a customer money and what we pay on the deposits and the money customers give us or we can borrow in the market. And that margin had been compressed dramatically as rates fell. And so it expands back out, getting to a more normal level, which it usually is. And that has shown a rapid increase in net interest income and II improvement over last year. As you look forward, we told our shareholders earlier this week that we'd expect another billion dollars plus increase from the third quarter to the fourth quarter. But that's driven by the great core deposit franchise we have. We have a lot of zero interest checking balances, which are transaction accounts, which money flows for all of the time. That will stay at zero interest no matter what the rate environment. And the rest of our deposit rates move up and the loan rates move up and we get back to the two and a half percent spread that we have typically made in our balance sheet. It's been depressed for the last few years and then was okay in a 17th time when the rates came up. It was depressed before that. So this is really the basic structure banking to get back to margin in those ranges as opposed to a depressed margin under 2 percent we've had for the last few quarters. Want to give your team a shout out here, Brian? People markets business up 30 percent in the quarter, strongest since the third quarter of 2010, but no trading lost days in the quarter. Despite all the market volatility we've seen, how does that happen? And do you think that can continue and just be sustained over the next few quarters? Well, it happens because we have a talent team in Jimmy D'Amara that runs a business force has, you know, better run in major parts of business for a long time. We've got to go over the whole business last year and we went on Montagg retired. And so it's a great business. The team that works for Jimmy is very solid, but it also comes from a decade long focus on responsible growth. We're in a business to move and risk through the system. We're in a business of managing risk. We're in a business of helping customers achieve what they want and not taking big principal risk. And therefore, evil in market volatility, team did a good job and we didn't lose money on a trading day. But by the way, if you look back across the last 10, 12 years, very rarely do we lose money maybe a couple of trading days a quarter when something really changes dramatically. But this year, what we saw is from last year to this year, the investments we've made in the last couple years in the business in terms of talent, technology, even more capital, more balance sheet capacity has shown up and that our team has a consistent drive to it. And Jimmy and the team did a great job this quarter and we expect them to do more next quarter. And lots there to unpack from Bank of America CEO Brian Monhan. Mikey take it away was that ox sales in October, consumer spending in October up 10%. So still running at double digits despite what we're seeing with inflation and the economy is going to.

3675,"<|pl|><|translate|> 3 people Camera Time Dat R等等 This is absolutely a block Wulu Regards 5 lives We're rising interest rates are causing new headwinds in the housing market. Our next guest though says any slowdown should be relatively short-lived. Fortune Brands home and security CEO Nicholas Fink is joining us now and Fortune Brands home and security home to a lot of different brands that people use in their houses, mown faucets, for example, master lock is another one of your brands. So talk to us about what you're seeing in this current cycle. Well, you know, in the cycle right now you're at a point where we have seen a lot of home price appreciation. You are seeing obviously mortgage rates go up significantly and that does put pressure on the consumer and the affordability of housing, right? And so what did expect to see and we've seen in prior points in the cycle is you do see a slowdown in new construction. You may see a slowdown in home sales turnover, but ultimately the market remains fundamentally underbuilt. There are huge demographic tailwinds in need for housing, particularly in our core U.S. market. And there's this little thing called supply and demand, which will always come back into effect over time. And so the fundamentals of housing are very, very intact. There is a period of softness that we expect to see as consumers, buyers and sellers adjust to this affordability pricing in the market, interest rates. And we've usually seen that take anywhere between one to three quarters and then the market digestives and people get back to get back to some of them turnover. Ultimately, as I've said, housing is not a discretionary purchase. The timing of housing may be discretionary, but ultimately it's not a discretionary purchase that people come back to the marketplace. Nicholas, we were talking earlier on about a company called Genorac and they warned this morning about higher inventory levels in the channel. Now you're a major player at home due point and lows. I mean, what are you seeing from these home improvement chains in terms of inventory given things have slowed down? Right. Well, they do an excellent job managing inventory, managing work in capital. We work very closely with them. Now one of the hallmarks of our business is in addition to really managing our brains and innovation really, really well. We do manage our channel and our service to the channel really well. So if you look back at how we've performed through the whole COVID period, you would have seen that we were able to serve at superior levels. We were able to gain market share as a consequence. And so we've been back in the market, I would say, certain customers really well. And as a consequence, we've seen inventories right size over the period. And we've talked about that previously. And so there's certainly dollar inventory as higher as pricing and inflation is the impact of the customer inventory. But I think in a lot of our major customers that is kind of equalizing over time as service levels come back into line. I mean, at the end of the day, it's still going to come down to where we're seeing more of the DIY projects that perhaps move forward from this point. If people are getting into some of the user, not used, but existing homes out there on the market. So as you're kind of tracking both the health of real estate more broadly as well as how that correlates to your business, what are your expectations going into next year where there's already been a slowdown in housing? Right. Well, you know, you come back to that fundamental, right? The consumer over time is going to need housing. The US market's hugely underbuilt. And so over time, we're going to have to add more hums into the marketplace. Thank you, Joe.",https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OFbNeKtIJNY,61,2022-10-19 18:18:31
3676," overtime is going to need housing. The US market is hugely underbuilt. And so, over time, we're going to have to add more homes into the marketplace. So, you know, that's a fact. I think we'll see a slide down. In your construction, you saw some of that in today's data, although they put it in context. I mean, single-family reconstruction is now at 2019 levels and multi-family is still well above. That's on today's data, right? And so, kind of returning to the pre-COVID levels. But you have a lot of consumers that are in homes with, you know, the majority of mortgages are below 4%. You know, those homes need renovation. And, you know, even today, we're seeing consumer interest, for example, we look at Google search data, you know, 25-35% above pre-COVID levels. And so, people are really interested in the home. They're really interested in that space. And so, we expect that to carry through. Now, you know, you may again see a period of softness around some uncertainty, I think, as we get into 2023. That's a fair expectation. We pride ourselves in being able to manage those and actually turn them into opportunity to gain more share, really, to like the consumers and meet the consumers where they are with our brains. But, you know, over the medium term to long term, we expect both from the R&R perspective as well as new construction consumers to come right back in and be supporting the tremendous equity that they have in their homes today. And, Nicholas, when it comes to your business, how much is split between going directly into the retail channels to how much ends up in professional hands and kind of how does that have been flow with the housing market? Yeah, I mean, we're still, you know, very heavily geared towards, I'd say, the old sell channel. So, if you think about it's probably 23rd, 23rd, similarly for renovation and repair, where 23rd's new construction more, you know, 1-3rd or less, or some international markets as well. And so, that is very much the gearing of the poor fall. You know, there's a little bit of ebb and flow, I think, depending on times, you know, where products sit, where inventories that, you know, you saw some of that during the pandemic. I mean, as the retailers opened up, people really went in there looking for product that had inventory there, able to service the channel. You know, but that's our broad exposure. But, you know, we really focus on meeting the consumers where they are. And, you know, one of the big drivers, I think, in the home market over the next period, is really going to be creating affordable homes for consumers in the US. And, you know, here in the build, there's talk a lot about the work they're going to do to create affordable homes. You know, we geared up, we're following it to be at the heart of the market. And so, whether it's a consumer that's moving up through the price points and some of our higher end brands and offerings or whether it's really at the heart of the market, you know, we've had the, we're following it very, very good to meet them there. At good margins. And so, we'll continue to do that and continue to leverage the brands and the innovation to be at that point. And I think that's going to play very strongly through, you know, both the retail as well as the wholesale channels. Nicholas, I recently got a new faucet and it's one of those touchless faucets. And once I installed it, I'm like, wow, why have I not been using this the past 10 years of my life? I'm glad I created up to get it. I think it just works. It's good. You know, but what type of innovation? What's the next big product for a brand like a moment? Well, I'll tell you, I mean, as we, you know, as you may know, we're taking the company through a separation of some of our businesses now, one of our cabinets business that's, you know, really going to focus on being the best in that industry. But then the rest of the business and you're touching on sort of water management business is really going to be focused on supercharged categories. So things that are connected, water management, outdoor living, you know, things that really, really drive consumer value. And that experience you have, I'm smiling because I hear that all the time, you know, people like, I got this in and how did I live without it? I mean, we're actually taking that product line as an example to a completely connected ecosystem inside of the house. I mean, you know, it's the touchless faucet that's going to be connected to it already is, you know, an AI system that understands water flowing in house can tell you if you've got a leak. And shut your main down if you're going to have a catastrophic leak will save just an absolute fortune for homeowners and insurers can protect you from freezes, can protect you from health threats by managing your water supply. So that experience you're having is really one of the most exciting moments in our industry.",https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OFbNeKtIJNY,62,2022-10-19 18:22:51
3677," protect you from freezes, can protect you from health threats by managing your water supply. And so that experience you're having is really one of the most exciting moments in our industry. It's really this convergence from, you know, historical kind of mechanical water management into these connected products that we have in the marketplace. Nicholas, I wish you would have told me that before. I would have not gotten this touch. I want to know when there's leaks. I mean, that makes sense. That's a good product. That's a good product. We can help you out with that. No problem. Nick, you got anything that's going to help Amazon packages from getting stolen? We got, you know, we do have some great security products in our master brand, Master Lock portfolio. And again, becoming more and more kind of connected and remote is kind of the big driver of that portfolio. So stay tuned. All right. We'll accept that for now. Nick, thank you. What is the fortune brand's home in security CEO? We appreciate the time here with you today. Guys coming up inflation may now impact your tax bracket. We've got the deeds on the other side. So, that's it. Slap on database. It's time for a cup of time. Three stories, one minute each. We start with this on the day. You might find yourself in a new tax bracket next year. The IRS says it's raising tax brackets and standard deductions by 7% for the 2023 tax season. The move is in response to high inflation, giving taxpayers a chance to shield more of their earnings from income tax. All right. The IRS, everybody. All right, cool. Yeah, this is an automatic thing. Actually, remember they just did it for Social Security also. Now they are doing it for taxes also. And it doesn't just affect like the highest earners. It also affects things like a state taxes. So it's this automatic adjustment that happens that Congress put in place. And I don't think there's a lot of awareness about it because we haven't had as big an increase in inflation for a long time. So this is the biggest adjustment to this for a long time. You consumer spending boom in the spring next year. I kind of like that. I think that. I think it's also an acknowledgement too for the IRS and looking at the tax brackets, especially as they know that they're needing to add on more to their workforce as well. I mean, the IRS right now is still so backlogged. And so this could. Oh, good tax. Oh, over time. Indeed. All right, taxes to rides. Lyft can help you find a parking spot now. Right, sharing app.",https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OFbNeKtIJNY,63,2022-10-19 18:27:31

Now, the ride sharing app launched Lift Parking, a partnership with Chicago-based spot hero, feature lets you search, reserve, and pay for parking spaces in the app. So I already reserved the closest six spots to the mall on Black Friday. So sorry, guys, but I'm really not sorry, because this is great. I mean, there are lots of other apps that already do this. Really? Yes. I did. I can't, you can book most garages in New York City garages. You can't book spots on the street necessarily. So maybe there's not as much competition for that market. But I mean, this business already exists. I'm going to try to book the hot spots in front of restaurants. I mean, I drive nice cars. But I car should be in front of the restaurant. But it has to be a spot with a meter. You can't just go and park at the mall. Oh, OK. I thought, well, like, this thing is great. I love it. This is my spot. This is my spot. I love it. I have a meter there that is hooked up to assist. Oh, then I cast my car, camp here, in front of the restaurant. No, wait, we're in my tape. There's a meter there you can. I was going to reserve a spot to the restaurant this weekend. I'm sorry. I apologize.

The toys that came inside the meal are now selling on eBay for thousands, which one listed as high as $300,000. If you want to buy one yourself, don't worry. There are plenty on the website still selling for $10 or $20. A whole set could run you up to $70. The fry smell, it comes with it for free. You ever notice that?

Here's where we're watching at this hour. Netflix shares still in rally mode after a strong third quarter report, but higher treasure yields keeping a lid on enthusiasm for tech. Our panel is ready and waiting to get into those numbers. I, on the midterms, the Biden administration poised to dip into the strategic reserve yet again as conflicting signals point to both bullish and bearish catalysts for crude. We're going to get the very latest report out of Washington, DC in just a bit. And I, P, know, the market for global stock listings has had a dire 2022 and this trouble to raise cash is just as real in the US can Intel and mobile line be the rising tide that lifts all boats. We'll speak with S&P Global about that. First, let's check in on the market action though 90 minutes into the trading day. We've had a bit of a choppy session here right now. The Dow, the only one that's in the green up about 38 points, the S&P 500 up or down 12 and the NASDAQ down 50. And we've been talking a lot about earnings results there. Numbers out from United, PNG among the companies that have helped kind of provide support at those levels. But it is about treasure yields today as we see the 10 year yield coming over that 4% level and certainly that weighing on investor sentiment at least so far in this session. Well, Netflix shares seeing a boost after beating estimates for the third quarter. The streaming giants all rise and subscriber growth once again. It's now expected to add another four and a half million subscribers in the fourth quarter. But streaming isn't the only thing on Netflix's mind as it looks to also expand into cloud gaming joining us now with more on Netflix's journey ahead is Gita Ranganappan Bloomberg intelligence senior media analyst. We've also got Dave Hedger. He is Edward Jones senior equity analyst. Welcome to both of you today. Gita, let me start with you. I mean, certainly we have seen a big rally in the stock. Although you could argue it's fallen so much expectations were pretty low coming in. They did beat on the sub numbers. What else stood out to you? Yeah, so I think definitely the one thing that stood out is this company is clearly back on track. I mean, of course the 3Q numbers were definitely much stronger than expected. But I think what was equally reassuring and even encouraging is the 4Q guidance kind of came in slightly higher than consensus. And remember, this was not even factoring in factoring in a huge catalyst that they have on the horizon, which is the debut of their new ad supported tier. They're going to be pricing this at a really aggressive $7 price point historically, the lowest price that Netflix has ever come out with. So it should kind of open up a whole new market for them. And then of course, they're, you know, they're again reinforcing some of their financial metrics in terms of free cash flow as well as profit margins. Yeah, indeed to that point, the company making a pretty clear they add supported tier and not really going to be a material impact at least in this quarter because it's being introduced a little later. But I want to point to one thing that has really stood out here and that's the FX had wins highlighted many times in this report, the sequential decline in revenue, they say is entirely because of FX looking through the numbers here. They estimate full your appreciation of the dollar will negatively affect full your revenue operating income by 1 billion roughly each. So how does the companies and the money how much there a different base quality statistics being that the",https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OFbNeKtIJNY,65,2022-10-19 18:35:55
3680," Estimate full year appreciation of the dollar will negatively affect full year revenue operating income by 1 billion Roughly each so how does the company adjust for that? Is there anything they can do in terms of the pricing Or the cost structure that will allow them to have a bit more of a buffer with the dollar expected to be strong for longer Well, it's only can try to adjust pricing in international markets they count for the foreign exchange pressure However, that's a fine tight rope to be walking just in terms of you don't want to increase price too much and in turn New affect subscriber growth. We do think that the ad supported service should help drive subscriber growth in international markets So I think the lower price point will be attractive and certain markets overseas You know, there's more ability to pay at that lower price point So that may be where netflix can find some balance And certainly the revenue from the advertise and could offset that the lower price point and in turn also help offset some foreign exchange pressure Geeta as you pointed out, you know the company highlighting that we are back on the path to reaccelerate growth Certainly the ad tier is something a lot of analysts have been looking to but at the end of the day It is a content company and they've sort of highlighted that even as The past few quarters have not been as strong in terms of their sub numbers Engagement has still been high compared to other streaming competitors What's that next catalyst you think when you look at the content pipeline for this company that could push it even higher Yeah, I think we've now seen really the steady cadence of you know content titles We were kind of hit by that whole covid log jam and they did say that that's going to take a little bit of time to kind of unwind But we've seen them deliver consistent hits obviously You know they're some of their biggest hitting titles being you know stranger things But then they've had a lot of newer shows that have also performed really really well the the Jeffrey Darmershow being a great example of that And we're seeing them kind of hold their content budget steady But remember we are seeing a lot of the other streamers So a lot of the competition is also dialing back on their content spend I think that's a really important point because You know maybe we're going to see some of those competitive pressures ease up a little bit as Some of these streamers start to understand that profitability is becoming more and more important And I think that really gives Netflix a leg up You know as they try and get more and more bang for their buck and this is exactly what they spoke to They said they're getting more impact for every dollar of content spend And we're seeing that with some of the engagement metrics that they post to the other point that I want to make here is that With some of those engagement metrics you come out with an advertising product. I mean this is really So Attractive advertisers knowing that they have that deep engagement knowing that they have a captive audience Which is on their platform for about two to and a half hours every day Advertisers are going to be willing to pay up And day finally is the company looks to see look looks for other levers to drive revenue We got some news from the VP of gaming there saying that netflix is now looking at a cloud gaming as a potential They've also going to have a clouds or gaming segments within Their southern california headquarters there or their offices there I mean, this is a very crowded space This would be sort of a new venture for netflix. They've been talking about it for some time Is this something that you think Netflix can compete in just given the players that are already in the space Yes, certainly the gaming space is a challenging market and and a lot of competition in that market Um, we view that as something that might be incremental for netflix and in particular may not drive a lot of subscriber growth But perhaps could help in terms of subscriber retention Uh, you know, that's I think one of the challenges uh when the content schedule was a little more uneven uh that you know when there's that content that people are urgently wanted to watch that that's where you see turn Take up and people you know cut off their service for a while where gaming could be another way of keeping subscribers engaged and",https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OFbNeKtIJNY,66,2022-10-19 18:40:01
3681," So you see churn, tick up, and people, you know, cut off their service for a while, where gaming could be another way of keeping subscribers engaged and holding on to their subscription, even when it's a time period that one of their favorite shows hasn't, you know, has already debuted and they've already watched those episodes. It is about continuing to make the platform sticky with so many of these streaming companies. Appreciate your time to both of you. Gita, Runganathan, Bloomberg Intelligence, Senior Media Analyst, and Dave Hagar. He's Edward Jones, Senior Equity Analyst. Well, now turning to the energy space. President Biden doubling down against big oil. His administration is releasing 15 million more barrels from the Strategic Petroleum Reserve. The president is set to speak on the measures in the next couple of hours. Biden also setting out a plan to refill the reserve. Just a reminder, this is oil stored in 60 giant salt caverns in Texas as well as Louisiana. We've got Yahoo Finance contributor. Kevin Sirili on the story for us today. Kevin, how much of this is really about the midterms trying to keep the cap there on gas prices as voters sort of think about that? Well, there's definitely a midterm political, domestic politics angle here, but there's also a geopolitical angle. But we are anticipating as you alluded to, the president Biden is going to release 15 million barrels from the Strategic Petroleum Reserve. He's going to make those remarks later this afternoon, but he's also going to do something else. And that is to say that the administration will repurchase crude oil when the US energy benchmark West Texas intermediate hits between $67.72 per barrel. And what essentially the administration is saying is, quote, this repurchase approach will protect taxpayers and help create certainty around future demand for crude oil. That will encourage firms to invest in production right now, helping to improve US energy security and bring down energy prices that have been driven up by Putin's war in Ukraine. And Kevin, specifically, you know, there's other measures that have kind of been floated around. We know these big oil companies have approached the Department of Energy, the Secretary of Energy, Jennifer Granholm, really saying that there should not be some kind of ban on exports going out of the US at a time when the anticipation is that Europe will implement those sanctions against Russian oil coming in December. I mean, as you point out, a lot of pieces to connect here, but are we expecting any kind of measures on that front to be announced from the White House? Well, potentially, and three points here. First and foremost, economically, the average price of gas that the US consumer is facing right now is about $3.87 per gallon. That's up, get this 20 cents from just over a month ago and nearly 56 cents when you compare it to a year ago. So when you couple that with high inflation at about 8.1% in the United States, not to mention, as you said in Europe, we're in the UK, it's 10.1%. Workers around the world, especially in Europe and the United States are feeling the brunt of this. But secondly, to take this back to the US midterm election cycle just last night in Miami, when Senator Marco Rubio was up on stage debating Val Demings, his Democratic challenger, he essentially said that, quote, this our oil reserves do not exist to win midterms, end quote. The Republicans are seizing on this. They view this as a winning issue. They want to increase domestic US oil production and they don't think that the administration should just be utilizing the strategic oil reserves. In contrast to that, there's a political context of this that the President Biden's expected to make later this afternoon. And that is that they are declaring political war against big oil. And they are going to try to especially target big oil profits that have been made throughout the pandemic. And they feel that drawing that contrast is a way for them to mobilize the base of their party, especially those who have interest on climate change, while essentially trying to have it both ways by releasing some from the strategic oil reserves. And then quickly, the third and final point is the geopolitics. You can't ignore Putin's war with Ukraine and the impact that that's having on European oil. But you also can't ignore that the pressure that this is now caused on the US-Saudi relationship. And already, again, on Capitol Hill, you're hearing members of the President.",https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OFbNeKtIJNY,67,2022-10-19 18:44:28
3682," peon oil, but you also can't ignore that the pressure that this is now caused on the U.S. Saudi relationship. And already, again, on Capitol Hill, you're hearing members of both parties, quite frankly, criticize the Saudis who, of course, run OPEC for their decision. And this impact is especially going to, I think, reveal the leverage that some foreign governments have in terms of impacting the everyday U.S. consumer. And we've seen a number of lawmakers come out and talking about restricting arm sales, for example, to Saudi Arabia. On that second point that you just made, though, about that, you know, sort of fight that we're seeing play out between the administration and then big oil, the reality is these reserves are at their lowest in decades. I mean, the administration needs big oil to be on board, right? What does that look like right now? Well, you know, privately, the energy sector here in Washington, DC, the energy lobby, are, I would say, rolling their eyes. Because, look, President Biden comes from Delaware. This was a state that has a heavy refinery contingency in the state. And, but it's really reflective of the dynamics within the Democratic Party right now, where you have the moderates who are potentially more moderate on this issue. But again, you have this new wing of progressives on the flank of the party, who are trying to really move the party much more to the left, especially as it relates to climate change. And so this puts President Biden in a significant, significant political debacle. Because here you have an issue that according to most polls, virtually all polls, including the CBS poll that came out just the other week, where the economy is the number one issue amongst independent voters. And in states like Florida, where again, Senator Rubio is beating Demings according to polls, the average of polls of real clear politics by five percentage points, or looking at state like Pennsylvania, where on the Senate race there, the Republican challenging John Fetterman, the progressive, those polls have tightened energy inflation. These are the closing arguments that Republicans are making in their closing bid as we lead up to the mid-serve elections. Just a few more weeks to go. Yeah. Should get interesting. Kevin Sireli, as always, appreciate your insight. Thank you for having me. Well, strong quarterly results are helping lift shares of Proctor and Gamble. Take a look at that. The stock is up nearly 3 percent after the consumer products giant Beat Wall Street estimates on the top and bottom lines as increased prices helped offset lower demand and higher costs. Dollar strength, though, weighed on the company's outlook, cutting its full-year sales forecast. And now, expect sales to decline one to three percent lower than previous forecasts. Furnings per share expected to come in at the lower end of the range as well. CEO John Mueller speaking to our morning team, and set the consumers remains resilient, even in the face of high inflation. But if we look at consumer sentiment, and one measure of that is it's trade down to private label brands, we're seeing very little movement. So in North America, past three in six months, private label brands increase share by only 30 basis points on a 12-month basis. They're flat, same general situation in Europe. And while we see a pop in the stock today shares of Proctor and Gamble are down roughly 20 percent year to date. While coming up pressure, persists shares an avid continuing a downtrend. Despite the group upping its earnings forecast, it's been a tough year for the stock, despite a diversified business and a big presence in COVID testing.

3683," Our video is equipped with some task learning applications that give us a free We'll share as of Abbott are slumping after reporting third quarter results this morning. The company lifted its guidance but reported a drop in sales because of the baby formula shortage. A decline in COVID-19 testing also weighed on the quarter. That earnings call with investors just wrapping up for more on that. Let's bring in Angelie Kamlani who's been tracking those comments for us this morning. Angelie. Absolutely. I could go on that point of the baby formula, really weighing on their nutrition line of business down 10%. And then the COVID testing still pretty a decent demand, even though a reduction from the last quarter, the company noting that there are many global trends that are weighing including COVID, including inflation, strong dollar. But all in all, they seem to be remaining optimistic about specifically the baby formula shortage and that sort of getting over as they reopen the planned last quarter. So that's where things stand right now. Okay. Let's take a deeper dive into Abbott's numbers here with Shugun Singh, he's medical devices, analysts at RBC, capital markets, joining us today. Shugun, I'm looking at where the stock is trading right now, certainly down despite some of those results. I'm imagining you've got an outperform with the price target of $132 a share. So you certainly feel like there's more upside. What do you think investors are getting wrong? No, thank you so much firstly for having us here. You know, I we do like the stock. We think, you know, the company does have a pretty solid long term financial profile of growth in the high single digits on the top line and double digit EPS growth on the bottom line. You know, if we just look at the Q3 numbers, the quarter was actually pretty strong. You know, they did beat by 700 million on the top line and about 20 cents on EPS. You know, COVID-19 testing was definitely what drove the results. You know, the results came in at about $1.7 billion. Consensus was looking at about 540 million in sales. So really impressive, despite the summer months. And you know, if you look at a full year guidance at this point, at 7.8 billion in COVID-19 sales, which is actually ahead of what they did last year. So you know, pretty solid revenues in terms of COVID-19. I think what the sticking point here really is the mid to mid single to high single digit on the line growth.",https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OFbNeKtIJNY,69,2022-10-19 18:53:33
3684," solid revenues in terms of COVID-19. I think what the sticking point here really is the mid-single to high-single digit underlying growth. So there were factors that impacted the quarter, such as COVID, if you back out COVID-19 testing, an infant formula recall, there was also medical device supply issues that impacted the company. So if you back out all those one-time items on an underlying basis, the company delivered about mid-single to high-single digit underlying growth, which is slightly below the longer-term outlook of high-single digits. But I think it's more of a reflection of Q3, which is seasonally a weaker quarter, and then the COVID-19 environment, whether recovery is occurring, but it is at a much slower pace than what we would have liked in a normal environment. Shagun, Anjali here. I want to look at some of the very specific details that they let us know about today, one being the new plant for baby formula production. And then also looking at the library tests and looking at also models that are pretty different when it comes to direct consumer and subscription models. I know there was mention of that. I wonder how you think this all plays for a company that's as large as it is that has had quite a diverse market so far. Yeah, I think both on infant formula recall, I think it's a good step that they are planning to. They have made some leadership changes at the Michigan facility, and they're planning to move forward with plans about half a billion dollar in investments in a new US nutrition facility for specialty and metabolic infant formulas. I think there is upside on diabetes as well. And honestly, if you just take a step back and look at the company, I do like the diversified portfolio that the company has. They are continuing to move forward within medical devices. Again, nutrition business. I think they did lost about 20 share points, given the recall, they gained half of it back as of September and the impact. I think this year is about 750 million, but I think this business should recover into next year. Also in terms of diabetes, there is a CMS proposed coverage guidelines for CGMs. The common period of that is open till about the 19th of November. And if expanded and coverage is approved, it could really bring more eligible patients into the population, 4 million, going to about 8 million, which is another $2 billion US opportunity. So I do like their diversified portfolio. And I think they do have levers to pull in terms of just diabetes, medical devices, diagnostics, and nutrition coming back. Let's elaborate on that a bit. As you pointed out, some of the sentiment that's weighing on the stock today is about the decline we've seen in COVID testing. Yes, we're going into what is expected to be a period of more optics in COVID cases. But the reality is we're not going to be at the peak that we haven't over the last few years. You mentioned a long list of other levers within their portfolio. What do you think is going to be the biggest driver that gets you to that $132 share price target? Yeah. And I just want to back up. I don't think it's so much about COVID testing. It's more about, like I mentioned, investors focus on the underlying growth profile of the company when you back out COVID testing, the infant formula recall, which is about a $230 million hit this quarter again. And then the medical supply issue that they faced internationally. So I think the sticking point for investors right now is really recovery. Just in terms of COVID, I think in an endemic phase, as a base case, the company is looking for about $500 million in quarterly sales. I think that's a good placeholder even for next year, which does provide some upside. So I think again, the mid to high single digit growth profile versus the highest single digit organic revenue growth that they aspire to get to on a long-term basis. I think the variance between that is really Q3 being seasonally weaker. And then the COVID-19 environment, whether recovery is occurring, but it is not, you know, we are not in normal time. So I think that's having an impact. I think that's more of a sticking point than COVID-19 testing. And again, you know, it's.",https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OFbNeKtIJNY,70,2022-10-19 18:57:22
3685," but we are not in normal times. So I think that's having an impact. So I think that's more of a sticking point than COVID-19 testing. And again, just to mention again, they are doing about $7.8 billion, for the full year, that's their guidance at this point versus $7.7 billion that they did last year. Q4 includes about $500 million in quarterly sales for COVID-19 testing business. And again, that does not include any additional COVID searches or government contracts.

Let's get you up to speed on the market action because we are looking at losses almost across the board, at least for the three major averages of reversal from the two days of gains that were coming off us. So the Dow now off just around 200 points. And now is that moving to the downside off just over one person.",https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OFbNeKtIJNY,71,2022-10-19 19:01:58
3686," actually because we are almost across the board, your averages of reversal gains that were coming off off just around 200 points to the downside off just o today at S&P off just around off just over 1% taking a 2000 that's a small cap off just over 2% today. the bond market yield push again, the 10 year yield that we've seen since 2008 the two year yield hitting that we've seen since 2007. This is on the expectation of maybe more rate hikes from some comments that we got from Fed officials earlier today. Take a look at the reaction that we're also seeing play out in the crude market. We're seeing oil jump to the upside here this afternoon now right around $85 a barrel some data out government data showing that supplies did drop and of course traders are weighing this against what we just heard from President Biden. We're seeing a little bit more detail here in just a few minutes. Let's first take a look at the sector. I mentioned the ad the gains that we're seeing in energy. You can see the XLE up nearly 3% certainly the outlier when you look at the rest of the 10 S&P sectors moving to the downside worst performance coming from financials and real estate and digging in to some of those financial players. We did get more earnings out this morning to see Bank of America off nearly 3% in really setting that pace to the downside. JP Morgan, Wells Fargo, Morgan Can Abdul-Korey. In the morning also said well old Soh maybe about about 2% off just a couple days of gold and about 1% off just around 4% account. Good stuff, Shahna Thank you. Let's get shift speech. Now it's the key economic data out today The beige book reflects current economic conditions across and gender Labour detailed financials here. Genaros Schanberger here. Will want to see you what are we learning. Well increases in prices remained high. With significant increases products according to anecdotal evidence on inflation and the economy across the Federal Reserves 12 bank districts. Now, taking a look overall at that inflation picture, some contacts noted solid pricing power over the past six weeks, while others said passing on costs was becoming difficult as customers started pushing back. Though several districts noted some easing of pricing, and the expectation looking ahead is for prices to moderate. Now, taking a look at the job market, is that also leads into inflation as to how high prices consumers are willing to swallow and able to swallow. Overall, seeing some signs of cooling, but the job market remaining strong overall, several districts reporting cooling in demand for workers, while some noted that businesses were hesitant to add to payrolls, because of concerns of a forthcoming economic downturn. Now, there were also scattered mentions of hiring freezes. Half of the districts also noted some easing of hiring, and or retention difficulties. Though, as I mentioned, overall, the job market remaining strong competition for workers has led some companies to try to poach from competitors, or have to offer higher pay in order to get those workers. Weage pressures remained wide spread overall, and contacts expect wage growth to continue as higher pay remains essential to retain those workers. Now, overall, the economy expanded modestly on net since September. However, conditions varied across districts. For districts noted, flat activity, two noted declines was slowing our weak demand attributed to inflation higher interest rates and supply chain issues. Consumer spending has fooled with consumers pulling back on that discretionary spending. And outlooks grew more pessimistic amid growing concerns of weakening demand. So, Dave, bottom line here, the economy holding in relatively strong position with inflation remaining in issue, though there are signs of cooling and businesses do expect a slowdown. Beneficials will take this information into account at their policy meeting in two weeks, where they are widely expected to raise their benchmark interest rate by 75 basic points for the fourth time in a row. Thank you. All right, Jen. Thanks so much for that, Breita. We want to talk about what this means for the broader market for that. We want to bring Michelle Schneider, marketgauge.com, partner and director of trading and research and education as well. Michelle, it's great to see you. So, we just heard.",https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OFbNeKtIJNY,72,2022-10-19 19:07:08
3687," The broader market for that we want to bring in Michelle Schneider, marketgage.com, partner and director of trading and research and education as well. Michelle, it's great to see you. So we just heard from Jen what we got from the Fed-Bajibok and squaring that off with what we just heard from Minneapolis Fed President Neil Kashkari saying that there's no signs that inflation is slowing more rate hikes due in fact to seem to be needed. What's your reaction from that and the losses that we're seeing play out in the market today? Well, if you start to look at all the economic data right now, you can get kind of dizzy because there's contradicting things going on out there, although the labor market is strong if we just look at that. The labor participation rate is still declining and there's this whole movement out there among the younger generations called quiet quitting on top of the fact that many people don't want to work. So I think it's very regional and very corporate based in terms of where they're struggling to find people and where they're still begging for help. So if we just take all of the stats and the interest rate rises and just look at what I think are really key factors right here on whether or not we'll get a soft landing or session, more inflation or whatever have you, is if we just take a look now at the indices, they're all except for the Russell 2000 and the NASTIC above a 200 week moving average and all of them including the Russell 2000 and NASTIC are well above a six to seven year business cycle moving average measured by 80 months, which means that this destruction that we're seeing in the market is certainly hurting and rates are having a lot to do with it, but we still don't really know what's going to happen in the future at this point. The deep recession calls may be premature. I know that sounds like incredibly optimistic. Of course we have to be prepared for the worst. So that's kind of how we're looking at it with the dollar as well. Super, super important right here is what happens with the future of the dollar, which right now still been right a flight to safety. Then you've got Jeff Bezos with a little gasoline on the fire saying we need to batten down the hatches. So let's look at earnings. We've got United, we've got Delta, we've got Netflix, we've got the big banks. What are you learning that might be in stark contrast to all the predictions of a recession? Well, I think basically that reality may have not fully set in in terms of the impact of these higher yields on one level. And we know the consumer obviously has been hurt to a degree, but it's still relatively strong. So like airlines, for example, is a great thing to look at. Actually airfares and clamoring to travel has gone up. And so Netflix of course was a big surprise. The banks they're getting more their money based on deposits because people are putting money in the bank because they're getting higher rates. But none of it, I think really reflects what we could see going forward. And that's where, you know, like today Tesla will be an interesting, I think, barometer because Tesla is going to be, we already know they've delivered a lot of cars, but really it's going to be demand going forward. Maybe that'll give us a clue. But right now we're in a big soup. I don't think anybody really knows exactly what's going to happen except for the fact that inflation that everybody keeps thinking is peaking doesn't seem to be peaking Europe. Historical highs for inflation since 1982 today. Michelle, when we take a look and I know you're watching some key levels here, S&P falling back below 3700 today as we have just around 50 minutes to go in the trading day. It's right at 3680. In terms of the key levels when you're trying to figure out if there's more downside risk or when the market is going to remain bullish, what are you looking for? Well, that 3600 has been extremely pivotal and that is exactly where, Sean, we were just talking about that 200 week moving average, which is kind of an indicator that's often overlooked, but it's a four year cycle. So 3600 is pivotal. We broke through it as we know a couple of weeks ago, but now we're back through it. So if it holds here, that would be good. If we can get through 3800, that would be amazing. We could just chop for a while until we have more data from what happens with the next Fed meeting, more earnings reports. And of course, what happens really with the Bank of England's been affected too because people think, hmm, how far will the Fed go here before they finally say, you know what, we're going to have to start buying bonds back because we don't want things to crash. And again, goes back to the dollar. At least they have reigned it in. A lot of people are pointing to that.",https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OFbNeKtIJNY,73,2022-10-19 19:10:36
3688," finally say, you know what, we're going to have to start buying bonds back because we don't want things to crash. And again, goes back to the dollar. At least they have reigned it in. A lot of people are pointing to the housing sector to suggest things are going to get bad. What are you seeing there? Well, again, that's regional. It depends on where you live. If you like New Mexico, where we live in Santa Fe, the housing market is still tight because there's a shortage of housing. Other areas where they went crazy with new construction, obviously, are feeling big declines. I know the housing numbers came out today with like 8.9 percent decline. Mortgage rates obviously have to hurt. But then again, who's going to sell their house right now? Because if they have to buy a house with a mortgage, they're going to have to pay if they refinance during the drop. They're going to have to pay double triple what they paid back then. So like everything gave, it is so complicated. So to sink your teeth into one aspect and say, that's the defining reason we're going to a recession, I think right now might be a little bit remiss until we have more data coming out. And whether we can see these numbers can hold here, as I said in this 200 week moving average. Interesting times in the market gauge dot com partner and director of trading research and education Michelle Schneider. Good to see thanks so much. All right, we're just getting started here on Yahoo Finance Live coming up president Biden announcing his latest plan to tackle high gas prices. We'll find out if it'll work.

Senior Autos reporter, possibly, remaining here with more on that.",https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OFbNeKtIJNY,74,2022-10-19 19:14:41
3689," BMW plans to invest $1.7 billion to build electric vehicles and batteries here in the United States. Senior Autos reporter, possibly remaining here with more on that story. Good to see you, Matt. So what are we learning here? Yeah, so you know, it's kind of a slam dunk for them to do this. They already built cars and Spartan Briggs, South Carolina there for like their XUVs and some of their older cars. So now it's like put more morning to make an EVs and do six EVs by 2030, I believe. Including the new XM SUV EV. So kind of a move that you're not sort of surprised by because they want to take advantage of those tax credits and those assembly credits making cars here in the States. A $1 billion towards the factory and 700 million towards a new battery kind of plant. So it's a little bit of mix there of what they're going to do. So I'm not surprised by it. And this is still the IRA in effect, right? This is it's them doing this. It's earlier we saw Polestar, Fisker, even VinFast from Vietnam wanting to make factories in the US to take advantage of these tax credits. Yeah, I'm probably speaking of those tax credits. There is obviously some people on the other side of this who aren't investing in manufacturing here in the US who aren't happy about the new rules that we just got from the Biden administration. What can you tell us about that? Yeah, Hyundai, I don't know, report at Bloomberg, they're really lobbying to kind of get changes into this law that you know, the mansion adding that whole North American assembly requirement for consumer tax credits. That's kind of a big deal for Hyundai because they make other cars and so it's South Korea. They're EVs. They're going to open a plant in Georgia, a $5 billion plant, but not until 2025. So they're going to miss out on credits for three years. And this is a really, really competitive landscape. When more and more cars come online that are cheaper and can compete with Hyundai and Kia on price, they really want that tax rate in order to like kind of up the game for themselves. Yeah, they certainly do. It'll be interesting to see if the Biden administration responds. I don't know off the wait and see about that. Thanks so much for coming on here and explaining that to us. All right, President Biden speaking from the White House earlier this afternoon, outlining his latest plan to lower gas prices. Let's take a listen. Today, I'm announcing three critical steps at my administration will take to reduce gas prices at the pump. First, the Department of Energy released another 15 million barrels from the Strategic Petroleum Reserve extending our previously announced release through the month of December. With my announcement today, we're going to continue to stabilize markets and decrease the prices. I've told my team behind me here to be prepared to look further, look for further releases of the months of head if needed. We're calling it a ready and release plan. All right, let's talk about what this means for the energy markets for that. I want to bring in Alan Nuffman bulls die option dot com's chief market strategist. Alan, it's great to see you. So we just got this announcement from President Biden. And then we also got the data just that regarding supplies. It seems like that's really the driver in today's action with oil back above 85. I guess your reaction first to what we just heard from the president and the potential implications. Well, the president in reality cannot control the price of energy control the price of oil or gas prices. They they try and pamper it because it's a big issue for the markets and for people in general, especially consumers. But if you look at it, we've been trading roughly between 85 and 95 in true oil for the last three or four months. We did have a failed test to the downside and we bounced back up again. So I'm so optimistic overall that in price could move back up once again, but let's put it in perspective. We're still half of the price from 2008. If you adjust for inflation, we have to be above $200 a barrel. It's interesting. I'd love to hear what he means by if needed because theoretically, it's only needed politically speaking. This is not to solve an emergency as the SPR usually is. He also follows that with the tweet and it says when the cost of oil comes down, we should see the price of the pump come down as well. That's how it should work. But right now, we're fine. There's retailers are making record profits at the expense of Americans. What does he have right? What does he have wrong? Well, it's capitalism. Again, the president does not control the price. That'd be a whole different country if the president could determine the price of energy and he can. But that's one of the strongest sectors of the market. If you look at any of the oil companies over the last year and over the last couple of the weeks, we've seen a big rebound in oil and oil services company because slumberj, Halle Burton, Oxy, everybody's had a big bounce and it looks like we're making another attack on those highs. So we've been seeing that sector lead the way here and we've seen a bounce in the overall market. Let's.",https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OFbNeKtIJNY,75,2022-10-19 19:19:16
3690," you know, everybody's had a big bounce and it looks like we're making another attack on those highs. So we've been seeing that sector lead the way here and we've seen a bounce in the overall market. Let's remember that there's still a lot more upside in these oil company stocks. They had the lowest PE of around nine or ten compared to any sector in the S&P. So there's still more upside and money to be made in these in these particular stocks and sector even though it looks like the price of gas may go maybe going higher in the near term. Alan, how much higher could the price of gas go do you think? Well, it can go back up. But again, we had a pretty sharp decline. Let's talk about what's happening in your last gas diluted to it. It's all about the dollar. The dollar had a QRiversal a couple weeks ago where it made new oil, new highs and that had a lower weekly close. That is destructive for the dollar. So if the dollar can decline, that's going to be very much a positive for stocks and for oil. So that's something to watch and the key component obviously is interest rate. Interest rates are going to top out at five percent here in 2023 and then they decline after that. 2024, 2025, they all stabilize around four percent all the way out to 2030. So that's the market telling us that the rate hike cycle is going to be done and the dollar shouldn't go up anymore. That's going to push the energy and commodity complex higher and that's going to hurt the consumer. But like I said, there's money to be made and some of these stocks that will benefit from it. Got to push a little bit. Dan Dicker here yesterday in the program said $120 a barrel early 23. Do you agree with that? Do you at least see over $100 a barrel? Yeah, I see $100 a barrel that's again, like I said, that would be half of where we were. I know it hurts psychologically and it's a red button issue for people, but it's still half off of 2008. The Fed got what they wanted. They knocked oil prices down. They knocked about 35 percent, but I see that as a temporary respite here. And Poowell is always has price pop potential. And you understand there are certain, there are a lot of people around the world that have a vested interest in a higher energy prices and they're going to do what they're going to do because that's how they make money. And let's talk about the energy crisis in Europe. Obviously a huge story, a huge mover here throughout the energy sector. EU companies at least right now at odds just over how best to tackle the energy crisis. What's your takeaway? And I guess what do you think should be done at this point? I just got back from Europe and they live a different lifestyle than we do. Their inflation rate has been much higher and I took advantage of the strong dollar, you know, being an American for that trip. You know, it's always in flux. And you know, in they live, like I said, a different lifestyle than we do. Everybody was driving the little cars and it got a good chuckle. I mean, to not see a truck, I did not see a pickup truck probably for three or four days, which is like I said, a different lifestyle and they're just used to these things. And it's a cycle that we all have to get through. And you know, prices move up, prices move down. That's what we do as traders is we take advantage of those price movements. But I think there's more pop when it comes to these energy prices, especially here in the winter time. Get a Gucci bag, a proud of bag. Curious to hear how you made this. Okay. I'm curious back here, the Strategic Prolete Petroleum Reserve. We're talking 1984 type levels. What are the implications? Again, it's nothing but psychology. You know, it's psychology and sentiment. And right now it's an interesting time for me as a trader. I have never seen the sentiment this negative. Now, you know, let's remember where we were in 2008. And you know, things were much, much different. We actually had a real financial crisis. Now we've got too many jobs and too few people. And you've got corporate profits and margins at record, record levels. So, you know, it's a disconnect. I think the average consumer, the average American is very concerned about the economy. But we're 70% off the COVID lows in the S&P and 20% off the highs. We made 70 some new all-time highs just last year low. So yeah, the market's taken a little bit of a break. But if you do it on a PD ratio, you know, we right now we're at 15. Think about what percentage that is off the high back in January. We're 30% off the high in the P.E. So stocks are cheap. At some people, at some point people are going to realize that. I just don't know when. All right, either do we. We've been trying to figure that out. Alan Nuckman, always great to have you.

When we come back. It's time for triple play three stocks that we're watching in the final 35 minutes of trading. We have Generac lows, Uber and Lyft. Let's stick out with my pick start with my pick. I should say and that's Generac. It's a top trading ticker on Yahoo Finance. Stock today. Look at that. Falling through the lowest level that we've seen in two years on track for its biggest intraday drop ever. This comes after the company cut its full year outlook and announced pre-limbed third quarter results that missed big on both profit and sales. Now Generac cited disappointing residential sales as a headwind here for the company during the quarter. It now expects 2022 sales growth of between 22 and 24%. That's down from its prior estimate of 36 to 40% growth. Now some analysts weighing in here, JP Morgan's slashing its price target on this stock. We also key bank cutting its rating to sector perform from overweight and taking a look at that reaction today, Josh. Over 20% decline. It's a stock that's been under tremendous amount of pressure and really Wall Street trying to figure out exactly what's next. One thing that stuck out to me from the earnings call, Shawna, was that CEO Aaron Yagfeld kind of highlighted the standby generations demand is lagging where production is at right now. The reason it stuck out to me was because a short seller made that call backing June. So Spruce Capital Management said back then that demand wasn't quite where people thought for those generators and that Generac might actually been distracting the street a little bit with some of these acquisitions. They put a price target between 110 and 130 on the stock. Look at it today. It's sitting at $111. They were taking a little bit of a victory lap today on Twitter and talking about that. As they said. Yeah, look at that. That dropped 25%. No.",https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OFbNeKtIJNY,77,2022-10-19 19:27:35

This is a partnership between lift and spot hero if you're not where we are in New York In Chicago spot heroes how we all find discounted parking spaces Lift shares are down 70% near-to-date and about 2% today Uber fell as well But just about a half percent down 38% and just when I thought that was all there was more news Josh it was that Uber is testing tablets in San Francisco and Los Angeles of course to run ads I'm shocked it took this long for Uber to test a tablet We have maxed a cabs and maxed the cabs in New York which already do that right is that interesting where Uber is now following cabs I mean it's we have come for a circle one thing I want to say to on that lift thing Sean I think it's interesting is how much more they're going to get you on the app now right yeah Uber's so good at getting me on the app for Uber eats and things like that now with you're not even getting a ride But they're getting you back on that app that's a me is impressive innovation It is and it's really smart on their part We talked about the fact that they need to diversify their business model They need to find new avenues in terms of revenue and this is a smart play I think by them Dave you mentioned that 70% year-to-date drop it doesn't I guess it's more so I don't know how much the upside potential is but it's definitely not a downside risk I don't think teaming with with spot here are getting people to use or at more and more because I think the data has shown when you take a look at The ride at the ride numbers Uber clearly has the as the advantage here people tend to search Uber first before going to lift So if you get yourself more accustomed to using lift and pray and two pretty key markets I think it can be a huge opportunity for them and back to the ads real quick Uber's ad chief saying that he wants it to become a billion dollar plus business by 2024 so yeah, that's a hundred and forty million and twenty one though. That's almost ten X It is it is ambitious schools. They're laying it out there They needed to do something we've talked about the fact that they needed to be more innovative Two things that they're doing I think it's a step in the right time I just wanted to disagree with you guys on lift because why am I gonna look for parking space from the ride hailing app if I'm in Get if I'm not driving why do I say right now, but what are you gonna say two months from now after you've gone to it a few times Only if they link and give me some loyalty points.

Coming up, US Home Builder sentiment falling as mortgage rates rise, the CEO of the National Association of Home Builders fills us how the industry what lies ahead for that industry ahead. Get inflation under control is impacting the housing market. High mortgage rates leading to a decline in demand. US Home Building fell more than expected last month. Housing starts dropping with an 8% in September building permits up slightly at 1.4%. But one of the biggest laggards of 13% dropped in multi-unit projects. National Association of Home Builders, CEO Jerry Howard joins us now with more on all this data. Good to see you, sir. All this data continues to pour in showing essentially the same things. We're right around early 2020 levels. Right when the pandemic took hold, what concerns you the most about what's to come? Well, that's an interesting question. I think what concerns me the most is the failure of public policy makers to act to stem the tide of this housing recession. Virtually every reason that we are currently in a housing recession is tied directly to public policy, whether it's interest rates being raised. And by the way, those interest rates not only impact the housing consumer, they impact the builder at the front end of the pipeline as the cost of capital for the builders has gone up to get the loans to acquire the land, develop it and construct the homes. It's a double whammy on the cost of capital. We're still having labor problems. We've got to get...",https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OFbNeKtIJNY,79,2022-10-19 19:36:24
3694," get the loans to acquire the land, develop it and construct the homes. It's a double whammy on the cost of capital. We're still having labor problems. We've got to get our immigration situation fixed. We're still having supply chain problems as a hangover from the pandemic. And we're still having regulatory problems, whether it's regulations involving the importation of lumber from Canada, labor regulations, environmental regulations, or simply the reinstitution of the regulations that the Trump administration did away with. Right now, it's a perfect storm for housing. We're predicting that, well, this year, we'll be the first year since 2011, that we built fewer houses than we did the year before. We're worried about next year, not really looking for much of a turnaround until 24. That was the kitchen sink approach, right? But there, your colleague Jerry Conte, the chairman of the NHAB, said, quote, with inflation continuing to run above an 8% annual rate since March, it's truly disingenuous of President Biden to hail their progress on inflation without recognizing the cost of it. Do you agree with that sentiment and what can the President do to fix this situation? Well, in fact, we talked with the White House today. They assure us that they are taking the housing situation seriously. Obviously, we'll see what actions they take. This housing recession is being caused by inflation that is a direct result of a supply shortage. The administration can do everything that I just mentioned, correct all those, egregious policies, and make it easier to build homes that'll end the inflation. Jerry, let's start with labor. One of the things that you just cited in terms of some of the problems that you are facing. It's interesting because I was actually looking at a tweet from an economist that we've had on Yahoo Finance a number of times Diane Swank and she was saying that we could actually see job cuts from home builders because of the fact that the backlogs are declining and demands dropping. But it sounds like, at least from your perspective, that you still can't find the number of workers that you need. Is that right? When we are operating in a normal economic environment, we are woefully short of skilled labor. Obviously, when we're in a recession and building slows down, yeah, we're not in the same boat. But remember, housing has always led the country out of every recession since World War II. If we don't have labor, if we don't have a supply of building materials that can be counted upon to get there on time, we're not going to be able to lead the country out of a recession. And I don't know what other sector of the economy can do it. Someone has done it since, as I said, World War II. You mentioned a conversation with the White House. How did they push back on your recommendations and will housing lead us into a recession? Well, we're already in one. Housing is clearly in a recession right now. I believe, and I think that most economists are now starting to come around, that the likelihood of an overall recession is greater every day. Hopefully, and right now, I think people are saying it would be a shallow and a short lived one. But I think that, yeah, we're headed into an overall economic recession. I think the White House is very aware of what's going on. To the administration's credit, they noted that we had an affordable housing issue, and we also had a housing affordability issue, two distinct problems. They've noted that from the time they were campaigning, but I think the time to put it on the front burner, and that's what they need to do, is put housing on the front burner of all the domestic policies. Jerry, is this in terms of what is the biggest problem facing housing industry? Is it more of a demand problem? Is it more of a supply problem? What do you see at least right now today? Right now, it's probably about 50-50 interest rates have definitely driven demand down, but we still have a major supply problem, which is why, unlike during the Great Recession, when you saw a house prices completely plummet, there's sort of a buffer this time in that there's not enough of a supply for housing values to go all the way down into the tank. It's going to be a unique situation we're facing right now. But Jerry, by some respects, it's still relatively healthy because we're seeing...",https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OFbNeKtIJNY,80,2022-10-19 19:40:50
3695," Values to go all the way down into the tank. It's going to be a unique situation we're facing right now. But Jerry, by some respects, it's still relatively healthy because we're seeing prices still increase. It's just the rate of increases cooling. Where will prices get, too? Do you believe we're talking 2019 pre-pandemic levels? If they got there, that would be about as low as I think they get. All right, Jerry Howard, NAHB. Appreciate being with us, sir. Thank you. All right, coming up, a new study reveals how remote employees are spending the time they save by not having the commute to the office. Stick around. The international monetary funds, as policymakers should re-examine ETFs. The IMF reports saying, quote, ETFs can increase non-fundamental volatility in asset markets and amplify the sensitivity of cross-border capital flows to global financial conditions. Here to attempt to put that in layman's terms, Cynthia Murphy, ETF Think Tank Director of Research as part of our ETF report, brought to you by InvescoQQQ. Cynthia, can you put that in layman's? Should we re-examine ETFs? Seriously, what a mouthful. In the ETF world, we have gotten used to getting this dramatic language of the world is coming to an end. Anytime the markets perform poorly, ETFs get all of the bad rap. The problem ETFs face in situations like this, the trigger these reports. One is, it's just great headline making. I mean, seriously, everybody stopped for a second to look at this study. Second because...",https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OFbNeKtIJNY,81,2022-10-19 19:44:58
3696," In situations like this, the trigger these kinds of reports, one is it's just great headline make-em. I mean, seriously, everybody stopped for a second to look at this study. Second, because ETFs are trading vehicles. So when you're concerned about market action volatility, you immediately look for things that trade a lot and are the culprits of market volatility. In truth, from where we sit, this is a lot of unfair, but there's really nothing here. If you actually read the study, their biggest concern is mutual funds, not ETFs, because ETFs are actually great price discovery vehicles that allow people to understand what's going on in the market, react tactically, implement different things in a way that mutual funds can't. So mutual funds really are more of a risk in a crash than ETFs are, but ETFs always get the bad rap. But we've seen this a lot. We saw this in 2008, we see that every time there's a big market crash, there's the big headlines about ETF risk. Well, some they despite some of the bad rap that you're saying that the ETF industry gets, certainly it is a popular investment vehicle. You can tell that just simply by looking at the fund flow numbers. I do want to bring up though, the people that do have this appetite for investing in index funds or ETFs. There is a different way to go about that. And that of course is direct indexing. This is the other option that's out there at this point. I guess when you're trying to compare the two, what would you say are maybe the biggest differences when it comes to direct indexing versus ETF and what will make the most sense? Yes, so direct index is an interesting new trend. Intruth direct indexing is a really old concept is basically what separately managed accounts have done as a maze for high net worth clients. It's more of a story now really because of technology has evolved and developed in a way where direct indexing can be accessible now to everyone, which basically is ETF is a basket of stocks that are tracking an index for the most part, most of them are passive. Direct indexing or creating your own basket of stocks. The advantage of it relative to ETFs is just this idea that you can customize it. Customization is really the big story here. So say for example, you work for Cisco systems and you have a lot of company stock as a benefit of your job there. So do you want to own a ETF that's also heavily allocated to Cisco? Then you may have too much risk in that stock. So through direct indexing you can have a basket of stocks that you may have thrown ETF, but you can customize that position away. And that's in today easy to do through technology and most asset providers as a managers out there have either acquired that technology or developed their own so that you can actually start creating all these really customized portfolios at a retail level. Before you it takes a lot of assets, it requires an advisor, it can be cost prohibitive if you're only doing it in a thousand dollars, zero thousand dollars there, but technology has made this more mainstream. You know the other advantage of it is just the way you can tax manage your positions, which in ETFs truthfully ETFs are very tax efficient. So at the portfolio level, ETFs are doing a great job at tax loss harvesting, making sure they're constantly lowering the cost basis of the portfolio. I think last year less than 8% of all ETFs issued any capital gains. So ETFs are super tax efficient, but the argument goes at indirect indexing. You can take that to another level because you can do it at the single stock level yourself and really manage that tax exposure in a way. So the story really is, is it a replacement to ETFs? You know time will tell, I mean SMAs have existed forever. This is more of a mainstreaming of that concept, but it's really just another technologically enabled way to invest that has its pros and cons relative to what it else is out there today. All right, Cynthia Murphy, always great to get your perspective of ETF think tank director of research. Thanks so much. Well, with millions of Americans still working from home, a new study reveals what workers are doing with the time that they're saving on commuting and it's actually not works. So let's take a look at this. Those under 30, they're using their extra time to attend social events, eat out, exercise those over 30 in this report, spend more time and there's some of their extra time on childcare maintenance of their house.",https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OFbNeKtIJNY,82,2022-10-19 19:49:30
3697," A 10 social events, eat out, exercise those over 30 in this report, spend more time, and there are some of their extra time on childcare, maintenance of their house, meal prep. This is interesting here because I think one of the big arguments of working from home is yes, you want that flexibility, but you don't have to spend what, three in your case, four hours commuting to and from the office every day. And you can spend that time working more at home, but at least in this study from the New York Fed, it doesn't seem that that is exactly the case. It's not at all. But I think the bottom line is, and this study doesn't directly look into it, it doesn't appear that productivity is in fact going down. If anything, it seems to be a push, therefore giving workers more reason. The one thing that the two age groups had in common is more sleep, an hour extra of sleep across all age groups. And yes, my four hours of commuting is certainly taken, it's told a lot of things. But I think as we learned yesterday with where we are in terms of return to office levels, peaking pre pandemic, still below 50% just tells you, these workers, if they can show that they are every bit as productive, they are going to fight to remain some type of hybrid arrangement, which is what I think currently 30% of the workforce. Yeah, exactly. 15% are full time employees working fully remote, at least according to this survey. So it's a strong argument. I think you have to look at that productivity, that of course is key here. If they're as productive as they were in the office, and I don't think there's anything to be worried about, if in fact they're not and they're taking advantage and maybe slacking off a little bit, then that of course is an argument to get people back into the office. I do wonder about the trickle down of 60 million fewer hours commuting. How does that impact restaurants, bars, gas stations, things all the way down the economy? There's certainly some impact. Yeah, certainly a huge impact, you would think. All right, well, coming up next, the FDA giving Americans another option when it comes to mixing and matching COVID boosters. Take care.",https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OFbNeKtIJNY,83,2022-10-19 19:54:20
3698," The U.S. Food and Drug Administration on Wednesday granted emergency authorization to NOVA. meet on Tuesday at 1 a.m. M. not yet gotten a booster dose, so that's about 50% of the population Novavax says. And then there's also those that still remain unvaccinated that could use the booster in addition to a Novavax primary series or those who've already gotten a primary series. The FDA made sure to point out that this is an option for those who do not want to get an mRNA by-valent booster or those who cannot for medical reasons get a by-valent booster. And that is for the adult population only 18 and up. So that's a good news. I did get word from the company that they are working on getting data to the FDA that would possibly allow them to remove that caveat about a first dose and move into the market for second boosters as well. And Audrey, think this would be good news for the stock. However, it's down with a 4% why? Yeah, you would think, especially considering this vaccine as the first to really get the original formula to get that approval as a booster. But it seems like the investor market is still kind of if you on what the actual market is for the late entrance of Novavax. We spoke to Chief Commercial Officer John Trazino and here's what he had to say. We've got additional data coming that will relieve us of it just being the first dose. But let's remember that there is still 50% of people 18 years of age and above that have yet to receive their first dose. So there's a significant opportunity for us to make our vaccine available to those folks that have previously not wanted to get boosted or not wanted to be boosted with an mRNA vaccine. There's some doubt in the investment community about what the total global COVID marketplace looks like into the future. You know, there's a range of estimates anywhere from, you know, the low teens, 15 billion dollars of market size up to as much as 30 billion dollars of market size going forward. Trazino has also told me that while the US may seem to slow down in COVID uptake, vaccine uptake, they are still looking at the global market which they have had a little bit more success in. So based on the and energy they're seeing there and momentum they're seeing there, they do believe that going into next year, there's still going to be a strong market. Indeed, all right, Anthony, Kamalani. Thanks so much. Appreciate that. Coming up, we're counting down to the closing bell on Wall Street.

3699," Let's go to grab aGL today! We're a minute away from the closing bell and stocks still under pressure. Jereblicri is a closer look at some of these movers here in the final minute. Hey, Jared, risk on risk off today. It's risk off. But just want to show you something. Nasdaq, though it's down almost 1% today still up to and a half percent over the trailing five days. And let's take a look inside the market as has been the case many days this year. Energy and the forefront, in fact, the only thing in the green today up over 2.5% followed by some laggards here. Well, excuse me, it's followed by some leaders, which are actually not in the right communication services, basically unchanged, followed by tech and staples. Interesting. A leadership mix there. All of those are outperforming. But really to the downside is where we're seeing some pressure due to rates. That comes from real estate, financials, health care, utilities, also materials and discretionary. All of those underperforming huge surge today upwards in the 13 week tea bill rate. All of this is pricing in an increasingly hawkish fed, no new news today. But apart from the course, you see a US dollar surging. Well, we see stocks ending the day and the red. Now, it is a mixed board here. We're seeing some special weakness here in Chinese stocks. And a lot of these have idiosyncratic risks because of what's going on with President G over there. But I have to say, a lot of these names have already been under a pressure, not looking for a bid definitely today. Here is the our component list. We can see 20 to down 3% square, down 6%. But you kind of get the picture. What has been happening today? So in Erning's land, we had Goldman Sachs this morning. That stock is down to 30% but heading into the bell here. We see more red. Then green, guys. All right, there. Now you're closing bell on Wall Street. Let's check out how the numbers closed for the day. A lot of red on the board, down about 100 points on the Dow. 25 or so on the S&P in the NASDAQ sliding also just less than 1%. All red. Close look at the broader market. Let's bring in a leo chief, UBS chief investment investor of emerging markets America's global wealth management and Mike Vogelzang, cap trust, CIO. Mike, anything to learn from the broader market action but more importantly earnings. We've seen a lot of earnings. But have you got any indication that indeed that recession that everyone's talking about is coming? Yeah, that's the sort of sword point that the market is fighting with right now. We've had the first 25% of the market down drop this year has been sort of valuation compression. As interest rates have risen, equity values have fallen. I think now the...",https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OFbNeKtIJNY,85,2022-10-19 20:02:37
3700," percent of the market down drop this year has been sort of valuation compression. As interest rates have risen, equity values have fallen. I think now the bears are sort of looking at at the likelihood or not of a earnings recession next year down 10, 15, 20 percent in earnings. If that comes through, I think we're going to get some more downside. But if we don't, if we can hang get earnings to hang in there, I think we actually might might have seen the bottom so at this point. So we'll see, but that's really the tug of war that's going on. And optimistic view there, Leho. What do you think? Do you agree? Have you seen the bottom? Look, I think the next three to six months are going to be quite challenging for risk assets. Until we see a clear indication that the Fed has reached a terminal rate, things are going to remain choppy, things are going to remain uncertain. We're positioning portfolios to protect against downside at the same time that we try to allow this portfolio to maintain exposure to medium to longer term upside. We do believe that earnings are likely going to compress in the US in the next 12 months on the in an environment of pretty depressed economic activity. And this is not fully priced in as we speak. So, Leho, what did you make then of those comments from Neil Kashkary that the Fed may have to push rates above 475? Look, I mean, this has been the story of the last 12 months, standing in January of this year, terminal rate was supposed to be zero. In March, one and a half, in June, 3%, in September, 4.5%. We're standing right now today with market pricing in a terminal rate of 5%. What are the balance of risks from this terminal rate levels expectations? I think they continue to be tilted to the upside. Therefore, the conclusion that the next three to six months are not going to be easy for investors. Mike, when you take a look at maybe that risk reward balance here in the markets, what makes sense at this point in the cycle? Where are you seeing, I guess, the most value right now when you're trying to figure out what to do with the portfolio? Yeah, it's a really difficult question in an equity portfolio today. I mean, obviously, the defensive sectors have held in beautifully. Energy is leading the way as I think it's the only sector up this year. The rule of trouble with earnings is so far they haven't fallen much as a block in the S&P 500. But that's because of equity, sorry, energy earnings are up so much. This quarter, I think, they're supposed to be up 115%. So without that, actually, the S&P is already beginning to fade earnings down 3%, 4% for this coming quarter if things continue to play out. So it's very clear, your decision as to whether or not you remain defensive. That is consumer staples and healthcare and potentially utilities, but particularly energy in this environment is really outlook on higher interest rates. I don't disagree with the leo. The point here is going to be the Fed is going to do what the Fed's going to do and they've been very clear about their discipline and the fight against inflation. So I think we simply take them at their word and assume it's going to be a fairly choppy market for a while. And if we do take them at their word, Leo, how do you position yourself? It's very well with what we've heard. We're talking about quality, defensive bias in portfolios. In equities, this means value, prefer to growth. It means defensive sectors such as consumer staples prefer to more cyclical sectors such as consumer discretionary. In fixed income, it means take credit risk responsibly, selectively remain in the shorter to intermediate spectrum of the duration side of the of the equation. In a way, handker down for at least a few months, but important message here is at the same time keep some exposure to the outside because we do think that 12 months from now, the investment environment is going to be much superior than it is today. My God, a lot of the focus here is on earnings. We're waiting for IBM and Tesla. Both of those are expected to cross now any minute. It's very, very early in the quarter in terms of what the earnings that we've gotten so far, but the number and the magnitude of the positive earnings and revenue surprises have been smaller than what we've seen in terms of recent averages. I guess do you expect that to continue? Where do you expect to see some of that outperformance? It's hard to hard to see how earnings are going to accelerate here, right above.",https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OFbNeKtIJNY,86,2022-10-19 20:06:54
3701," recent averages. I guess you expected that to continue. Where do you expect to see some of that outperformance? It's hard to hard to see how earnings are going to accelerate here, right above and beyond expectations. So it's not a surprise if we if we underperform expectations a bit. I'm we're reasonably happy with how it's coming so far with less than 15% of the S&P reporting. One of the things that's interesting to note under the surface is that, you know, revenues have actually been doing okay. They've been doing better than earnings earnings growth. That means margins are beginning to get squeezed by inflation. And I think you're going to see that more. The question is when revenue growth drives up as margins have already been begun to collapse a little bit, we expect to see some significant weakness in earnings going forward, particularly in 2023. So that's the dilemma. That's the question. And that's the point of the sort of being defensive hunkering down. The only worry we have about that outlook is that it's almost consensus in the market. There's not many people who don't expect the softening in the economy and not a lot of people who don't expect an earnings recession. So you're seeing all kinds of very, very interesting valuations in some of the deep cyclical names, whether it's housing, whether it's energy, frankly, you know, some retailers. They're just incredibly inexpensive. The market's clearly anticipating much, much worse news. It's coming. I think it makes some sense to have a little bit of that in your portfolio. All right, Mike Volga-Zang and Alayho Cherwonco. Thanks so much for joining us today, really appreciate it. All right, coming up, we're still waiting on Tesla earnings. We've got that for you when we come back. All right, an earnings alert. Now you can see Tesla shares down just",https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OFbNeKtIJNY,87,2022-10-19 20:11:01
3702," All right, an earnings alert. Now you can see Tesla shares down just over 3% after hours earnings are out. Yahoo! Fanat's senior auto reporter, Prasupramanian, has the numbers for us. Hey man, what are you seeing? Hey man, so yeah, it's knocked down a bit here. There was a miss on revenue, Q3 revenue, $21.45 billion that's a miss. They wanted to see $22.13 or thereabouts. Adjusted EPSB though, $105 versus $101 estimate. And then also the gap made income was $3.3 billion. That topped, estimates $3.2 billion, but it's that top-line revenue figure that's kind of weighing on the stock. They've also maintained their production outlook for the year of a 50% compound annual growth rate. So about, that would be about $1.4 million vehicles in 2022. That means they got to make around 500,000 vehicles in Q4, so that's kind of a stretch. We'll see if they can do that, but that's what they're saying with both do. One of here more about the demand story here tells us about how they're trying to basically increase production as much as they can in the letter. They talk about how we remain focused on increasing vehicle production as quickly as possible, increasing our weekly bill rate in Fremont and Shanghai and progressing steadily through the production ramps in Berlin and Texas. They also added in the shareholder that they see Berlin and both Texas with an in-salt capacity of around 250,000 vehicles or less. So we're seeing that. That's new. So I'm hoping to hear more tonight. Elon Musk will be on the call. We want to hear more about the Cybertruck production and also Tesla selling, which they see still kind of seeing deliveries happening in December 2022. Yes, certainly. That's look out to me, pros. The initial phase of semi deliveries on track to happen in just about two months. Again, on track for that 50% in average annual growth in deliveries. Dave, a couple of other things that stuck out to me in this report, logistics volatility supply chain bottlenecks, remaining immediate challenges here for Tesla. And also they're saying that they continue to believe that battery supply chain constraints will be the main limiting factor to EV market growth in the medium and longer term. So yes, things are improving, but still a number of headwinds do remain. We've heard a lot about that in terms of the supply chain, but really the story leading up has been about demand. They have repeatedly raised their prices several times in the last couple of months. And how will that impact demand around the world? How are the COVID lockdowns in China impact their their Shanghai factory? But a mixed report, but still say they are on track. It is remarkable to hear about the the semi do in December of 2022. And almost no one saw that coming, but a solid, certainly not spectacular report. All right. From more on this, you see the stock off just around 5%. We want to bring Craig Irwin. He's Rothcapital partners, a senior research analyst. Craig, I guess first just your reaction to the number, the stock off a lot of that. I would assume has to do with the revenue miss. Yeah. I know there was a little too much optimism about pricing the follow through from the pricing that was put in in the second quarter, lifting the top line and bringing that possibly in line with original expectations. You know, margins missed by what roughly 50 basis points, you know, clearly top line miss because of this. And you know, they put through the right amount of price to pass through the increased cost that they're seeing. They're they're not being greedy. They're pricing the vehicles appropriately such that they can sell them in volume in the market. The problem is they did they didn't miss by 19,000 in the quarter. And you know, I remember back in the day where 19,000 was a day dream for Tesla as far as delivery in a year. But that's not what counts now. They missed and expectations were too high. Carl's coming up at 530 Eastern time. Biggest question. Oh my gosh. I think the biggest question for investors is how much Twitter, how much stock does he have to sell to fund his Twitter acquisition? I mean, kind of depends where he parked his cash, right? You know, 15 million a sold. You know, he could have done well or he could have done not so well. And you know, it could be anywhere between $5 and $10 billion with the potential equity sales. That I think is is really going to weigh on sentiment for investors until we get clarity. Other than that, the guide for units in the fourth quarter is going to be incredibly important. They should be approaching 2 million units in production rate, exiting the year with both Austin.",https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OFbNeKtIJNY,88,2022-10-19 20:15:31
3703," Other than that, the guide for the units in the fourth quarter is going to be incredibly important. They should be approaching two million units in production rate exiting the year with both Austin and Berlin ramping. That's a phenomenal production rate. We've got to see the demand there and the confidence that they could serve that demand. That'll also have a big impact on the stock. To talk about the stock though, I think the bigger impacts exiting this year, things like Porsche, success at companies like Polestar and obviously the upcoming Ford spin-off. Those are really impacting investor sentiment as they look at things that are potentially much better valued with that similar or maybe even more attractive growth prospects. Great. Let's talk about pricing power because Tesla's cars sold for an average of $57,000 in Q3 up from 49,000 just a year ago. They have been able to pass along those higher prices to consumers. As you mentioned, the demand aspect of this, any worry that that's no longer going to be the case if we do see a bigger slowdown? I'm not worried about demand. I see EVs as inevitable. I think EVs are going to be an increasing mix of transportation no matter what. No matter what we have to do for price because of the technology integration of vehicles. I may be a bear, a loud voice bear on Tesla, but I actually drive an EV. I think the momentum in the market is real Tesla is the category king. And that makes it a difficult path for them that needs to blaze when so many very well-resourced companies are coming right behind them. So the shares are still down 45% year to date and down almost 20% since they slightly misdeliveries. What's the next catalyst to get that stock moving in that direction? And how significant is the Tesla semi, which we just mentioned, begin delivery in December? Honestly, I see the Tesla semi almost as a bad joke because the battery in there, the more range you need on this thing, the bigger battery you have to have, the less cargo you have. So it's cash 22. Either you have range or you have cargo, that's the business model of a semi is to have cargo. So I see that as a much better match for hydrogen. If people really want an advanced drive train technology, I don't know. I mean, I've met with a man that's the largest piece of the Tesla order book. I think there's going to be a very realistic calibration of these vehicles after they're brought online, after they're commissioned. And the actual sales rate might end up disappointing versus what some of the more aggressive bulls would imagine on this. On this vehicle. Okay, let's talk about supply chain because it was one of the bottom supply chain bottlenecks and remaining a immediate challenge. That's what Tesla said in its earnings release. I'm curious from your checks, just improvement that we have seen there. They did know that that they are seeing some improvement. I guess how much improvement are we seeing and how long do you think it's going to be until we're able to resolve these issues? So it keeps the supply chain for Tesla is actually wolf speed. Wolf speed had been a little bit behind on their on their wafer deliveries to both SD micro non-semi. I think some of the upside we've seen a wolf speed over the last two quarters has come from the catch up. As they've brought on additional manufacturing capabilities and six-inch and wafering capabilities there. So that I see as a key component there. Obviously connectors can be a major headache. It can even just be harnesses that you outsource these days. So it doesn't have to be an exotic high technology piece of the build. And everybody's having these problems. Nobody's immune. But I would say that I think Tesla is probably doing one of the best jobs of the companies in the market as far as managing their supply chain. It's stock off just around 3.5 percent on that revenue miss. At Craig Irwin, great to have you. Thanks so much for joining us. Thank you. Are we have earnings results? Keep rolling in IBM out with their quarterly numbers. Do I have a look? Yes, that's right. And you can see the stock up almost so well is up 4 percent. And after I was trading that's after third quarter results showing a beat on top line revenue. $14.11 billion. Beating the street estimate by about half a billion dollars. $13.53 billion. That number is up 6.5 percent year over year. Adjusted gross margin coming at 53.8 percent. That best the estimate of 55.3 percent.",https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OFbNeKtIJNY,89,2022-10-19 20:19:53
3704," 3 billion that number is up 6.5% year over year. Adjusted gross margin coming at 53.8% that best the estimate of 55.3% Operating EPS this is that bottom line number 1.1. And that exactly meets the estimate of a dollar 81 as well. Free cash flow ending the quarter a little bit light at 752 million the estimate was for quite a bit higher 2.76 billion In terms of their full year forecast they are seeing constant currency revenue growth above the mid single digit model And then previously they saw it at the high end of this mid single digit model still seeing free cash flow of about 10 billion dollars The estimate was for 10.04 billion oh four billion so we're going to call that in line and then gap results include the impact of a one-time Non cash pension settlement charge of 5.9 billion dollars and that is 4.4 billion net of tax I do have a quote from the CEO and chairman arvin krischna He said IBM delivered strong revenue growth in the quarter reflecting our continued focus on the execution of our strategy globally clients view technology as an opportunity to enhance their business which is evidence in the results across the portfolio With our year-to-day performance we now expect full year revenue growth above our mid single digit model and Just pointing out too at mid October the foreign exchange rates currency They're expected to be about a seven point headwind so that is a big headwind because by the US dollar Just want to show you a chart real quick. This is the over the last year. This is IBM stock You can see very choppy here although ending on the lower end of the range on the 20 year view also pretty low here But breaking out recently from that very long trend line there guys Yes, certainly and they have outperformed some of their peers at least when you take a look When you align up IBM against some of the larger tech players as of lay pretty strong results here That's why we're seeing that the stock pop Jared like you were just saying after hours in terms of they also Alifted their full year revenue guidance so revenue for the quarter. They'll come in at 14.1 billion in Dave I was able to uh I spoke with Gary Cohen the vice chairman of IBM earlier this week and we were talking about the chips act And I bring that up because it's so central to so many of these players and he was saying that the rollout is going well It's a little bit slower although that had been Anticipated IBM was one of the companies that did come out with an announcement They announced 20 billion dollar commitment to their new york state facilities They're he also went on to say that there is leverage in the system now the big problem that they face is just in terms of speeding up the Permitting process. That's what the government is facing right now But it will be interesting if we do hear any more commentary on that and the impact of the chips act not only on IBM But really on the sector at large here during this earnings call that was that we'll get underway later this afternoon chips act has certainly not been the catalyst that many thought it would be going all the way back to when that was first passed Let alone The recent action and really surprising to see the numbers given the strength of the dollar because they had said Commentary leading up that they expect the strengthening dollar to be a massive headwind and cut down So really when you take into in the context all the issues they're facing and all the headwinds a pretty darn good report And that's why you see after hours up about 3.7% After a beat there for IBM up next we'll get analyst reaction to these numbers from IBM after the break",https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OFbNeKtIJNY,90,2022-10-19 20:24:13
3705," Music Music Music Music Music Music Music Music Music Music Music Music Music Music Music Music Music Music Music Music Music Music Music Music Music Music Music Music your reaction? I reaction as I think this was better than a lot of people were expecting. I think in the lead in you were talking about the potential for currency headwinds. Those were definitely present, but I think people admitted and anticipated those challenges. Notwithstanding that, you're looking at a normalized revenue growth rate approaching double digits, which I think for IBM is probably something that people didn't anticipate. And this is also something that they signaled could very well continue. So overall, I think people are probably encouraged by the growth not only on a corporate level, but by the constituent businesses that the company now is focusing on. And Scott, when you take a look at IBM, its performance has certainly been a steady performer compared to some of those other larger tech firms, the guidance, the up their revenue guidance here for the year. When you look out, pass the current quarter and into 2023. Do you think they're going to be able to maintain that outperformance? Well, look, I mean, I think over the last, I don't know, number of months, maybe a couple of quarters, people have looked to IBM as kind of a safe haven. But not for the reasons that you might think. I think this has historically been a company that's been, you know, at best a mature growth company and at worst, a no growth company. And it's really at this point kind of a low to slow growth company, but when growth globally, when we're talking about global economies, global markets, global demand, it doesn't seem quite so disadvantageous. And in fact, they have a stable kind of customer and revenue base. And so the revenue has remained largely stable, actually, even outperforming as we've been talking about, whereas in other cases where you're talking about high growth companies potentially being impacted by these global headwinds, that's something that I think people have been thinking about and focusing on as it pertains to IBM. They spend more than $100 billion in remaking this company over the past decade. Where has that been the most success? Yeah, I mean, I think it's a good point. I think the company's market cap is only slightly.",https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OFbNeKtIJNY,91,2022-10-19 20:28:14
3706," over the past decade. Where has that been the most success? Yeah, I mean, I think it's a good point. I think the company's market cap is only slightly over $100 billion at this point. And if you think about what they've been focusing on, they've been focusing on handful of things, right? They've been focusing on software, IT consulting, and cloud. And one of the things that we've been told by the experts that we talk to day in and day out is their orientation to being multi-cloud. That being that they can work with whatever cloud environment, a client wants to work with, that actually is very appealing, given all the different choices and all the different technologies, and frankly, all the different options that IBM can fit into. That's something that works really well in an environment where people are looking to make difficult choices. Scott, when you take a look at some of the underperformance or maybe the headwinds that the chip makers are facing, at least in the near term we've heard from a number of companies just about falling demand, yet when you take a longer term look at it, there certainly seems to be this optimistic of you, and you're seeing that by a number of investments that have been made over the last several weeks or announcements, I should say, they have been made by IBM and some of its competitors out there. I guess how do these companies balance that trouble here in the short term, but then also make sure that they have enough invested to capitalize on that long term success? I mean, it's really hard sometimes to not focus on the short term disruptions when it comes to macro conditions, right? And I think all of these companies are dealing with those realities, and we're going to see indications of those loud and clear I would imagine over the coming days and weeks as the reporting results and providing guidance. That being said, historically it's been my experience that those companies that can kind of see through that fog, that uncertainty, those more troubled times, to make investments are the companies that benefit on the other side of those issues. And so companies like IBM that have large kind of financial flexibility and balance sheets are able to do those types of things. And it's my sense that IBM very much has a long-term view, and if they make the right types of investments, they could be one of those winners when it comes to investment now benefiting later. The calls in about 30 minutes, your biggest question? I mean, I think my biggest question is what the single biggest contributors to the upside and revenue were. There are a lot of different categories that IBM has been focusing on, that they've been highlighting, but I'd want them to get very specific on where the upside came from. And then the follow-up would be, how sustainable is that kind of outperformance? And what shall we be expecting, given 2023 is anticipated to be a pretty tough year? All right, Scott Kessler, great to get your perspective here. Again, IBM shares moving to the upside after it's up just around 3% on that piece. Higher inflation is hurting Americans when it comes to things like consumer prices and mortgage loans, but see where it will be helping next. 잼 E This is the first time I've ever been in a car like this. I've never seen a car like this before. I've never seen a car like this before. I've never seen a car like this before. I've never seen a car like this before. I've never seen a car like this before.

3707," AD. One more way inflation is impacting you, your taxes, but it might not be in the way you think. The IRS announcing it's raising both the standard deduction and the income thresholds where tax rate take effect for the year 2023. Basically means because of the price increases Americans are seeing, they'll be able to shield more of their income from taxes. Let's start with the standard deduction. Climbing to 27,700 for couples, that's an increase of $1800 from this year for individuals and increase of $900 to $13,850. Tax brackets are also seeing an adjustment of about 7%. Here are a couple of examples. The top marginal tax rate of 37% will apply to individual income above 578,125 and married couples income above $693,750 next year. The 32% rate. That applies to those with incomes over $182,100 or married couples with income of $364,200. The 22% rate will go to those with incomes over $44,725 or $89,450 for married couples filing jointly. Some other ways inflation will impact taxes. The earned income tax credit will increase. The alternative minimum tax EMT amount is increasing and the benefits for tax-free public transit and parking costs will rise to a maximum of $300 a month for commuters that's up 20 bucks from this year. John? All right. Well, midterm elections are about three weeks away in Wall Street, a standing buy to see which party will control the House and the Senate. Now, Edelman Financial Engines recently publishing a study on how markets perform based on the balance of power on Capitol Hill. We want to bring in Isabelle Barrow, a director of Financial Planning at Edelman here to break down this report in. Isabelle, let's take a look at some of these different scenarios here that you guys took to when you took a look at this data. We know there's going to be a Democrat in the White House. So let's start with if the Democrats are able to hang on to both the House and the Senate. What does that mean for the market? Well, overall, we know that politics is a very passionate topic and it can make people act emotionally. We tend to be emotional out so many things when it comes to our money. It may be market volatility, inflation, world events, but ultimately it's best to keep your emotions about those political outcomes out of your investing decisions. So what we like to tell our clients is money is green. It's not red or blue. So in this study at Edelman Financial Engines.",https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OFbNeKtIJNY,93,2022-10-19 20:37:06
3708," decisions. So what we like to tell our clients is money is green, it's not red or blue. So in this study at Edelman Financial Engines, we looked at how the S&P performed under different administrations and political parties from 1948 through 2021. And we analyzed eight possible combinations of control that could have existed in the White House and the two houses of Congress during that period. And ultimately what we found was that no political party substantially impacted long-term market returns. And is about what we hear repeatedly on this show and every show, is that the markets like divided government, do the numbers bear that out? It's true. You know, like I said, no political party has substantially impacted long-term market returns. So for example, when Democrats controlled all three areas, the S&P produced an average annual return of about 15.1%. Under Republicans, it was about 15.9%. Both of which returns are far above the average return. If you had invested, however, $100,000 in 1947 and kept it invested through 2021 only when one party was in the Oble Office, the best return you would have had would be about $3.7 million. So from 47 through 2021, $100,000 grew to $3.7 million. It's not bad. But if you had stayed invested through the entire time, regardless of which party was in power, regardless of the mix of Democrat, Republican Democrat, and this chart you're showing, you would have had more than $31 million over that same period of time. So if you're focused on just who's in the White House, you know, you're missing out on in this case, what would have been around $27, $28 million over that period of time? So is it well done from an investor's perspective? I guess should people be doing anything different with their portfolios or just simply keeping everything the same? Well, ultimately, you know, what the study shows us is that the economy drives the markets long-term. It's not elections. So politics is just one of like thousands of things that are impacting the economy. There are so many factors. It's, you know, not just, and it's not just the markets. It's the Fed, geopolitical events, the market cycle, I mean, pandemics. So what we need to remember as investors is it's best to stay neutral when it comes to our money as it relates to politics or timing the market. So ultimately, don't let the politics dictate your portfolio because politics and investing don't mix. You can change your investment strategy based on all of the other issues within the economy that, you know, are helping to influence those decisions, but don't let it be for one thing like just investment results. So keep your eyes focused on your long-term goals, keep separate, keep separate, fact from fiction when it comes to elections in your portfolio. And it's essential to keep in mind that no outcome of this year's midterm elections will hurt your portfolio more than making that decision based on just the emotion behind it instead of focusing on your long-term plan. But remember the old saying, it's time in the market, not time in the market, and that relates to politics as well. But if you're picking policies when it comes to taxes and regulations, those things certainly are impacted by which parties in control, right? Well, and so that's a little bit of a separate conversation, I think, because what we're talking about in that case is more related to your personal financial economy, your personal economy, your own, you know, your own long-term objectives and how that, how that impacts your financial plan. What I'm talking about and what this study was really focused on is how the political environment impacts the stock market. So yeah, if you're talking about policy, policy can impact us in so many other ways other than just our investments. But if we're focusing on the market, that's what this study showed was that ultimately, who's in power is not what dictates those market returns. Worried about the green, not the red, not the blue, Edelman's, Isabel Barrow, really appreciate that breakdown. Thank you.

Coming up, Cannes is looking to make a splash with its cannabis-infused cocktails. But first, they have to deal with a patchwork of state laws that regulate cannabis products. And the company's founders joins us to discuss. Go ahead. Hurry! I'm going to do a little bit more. I'm going to do a little bit more. I'm going to do a little bit more. I'm going to do a little bit more. I'm going to do a little bit more. All right, assign marijuana to be going mainstream green thumb industry, signing a deal with circle cake convenience stores to sell licensed marijuana at its gas stations in Florida. The effort will start with 10 stations in the state and green thumb locations will be branded Rise Express with a separate entrance from the store now because marijuana is not recreationally legal in Florida. Purchases at the store will be restricted to residents who have medical marijuana cards. Terms of the deal were not disclosed but green thumb shares did jump more than 3% on this news. Definitely a sign that we are changing. Circle K, just the latest expansion of the cannabis industry. You can get it in all types of forms and you can get it in 19 states recreationally. One of the forms that is the hottest seller in this country includes beverages. Currently the fastest growing segment there. Luke Anderson is the co-founder of the Cannes Social Tonic. That is the best selling THC beverage in the country surpassing 10 million cans sold. Luke, good to see you man. Good to see you too. Kind of felt mainstream when you hit the New York Times with an article all about cannabis drinks with the question, are they safe? So you answer that question. There's not a lot of knowledge. There's not a lot of research. Are they safe? I think the better question is alcohol safe. I think they point a finger at cannabis beverages.",https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OFbNeKtIJNY,95,2022-10-19 20:45:49
3710," that question. There's not a lot of knowledge, there's not a lot of research, are they safe? I think the better question is alcohol safe. I think they point a finger at cannabis beverages as a buzzy alcohol substitute, but they're ignoring the bigger issue, which is trunk driving, domestic violence, the health and wellness issues that alcohol, which is just so apologize for, and advertised so freely, I think that cannabis beverages are absolutely safer than alcohol. Interesting point. What do you want to educate people on them? First off, how do they react differently than alcohol? Well, the other thing that the New York Times piece missed is there are so many different types of cannabis beverages. Can, which is the lowest dosage on the market, two milligrams of THC. It's a product you can drink and it has a similar intensity of effect to light beer or glass wine. There are 100 milligram THC beverages that for an uninitiated consumer, those are dangerous, but because the category is so new, they're all lumped together and sometimes people even think CBD beverages, which don't have an intoxicating effect, are put in that same category. And you think CBD beverages are effective or placebo? I think they're about as effective as a spirulina smoothie, and I think that because it's a three-letter acronym, it's a cannabinoid, there was a lot of confusion. Consumers thought when there were big CBD beverage marketing campaigns a couple of years ago, is this an alcohol substitute? But it does not get you a buzz because it does not have the THC. A study said that more than half of the cannabis beverages purchased in 21 were of the 100 milligram variety Jones soda just came out with 100 milligrams. Yesterday, how do you feel about that segment? Per dollar sales, the 100 milligram beverages are absolutely where the market is today. But if you look at the units and you see these cans here, one unit is six cans. So if you look at a per unit measure, low dose products are actually far outpacing because for every unit that people are buying, you're actually getting six drinks. And we think that that's going to continue to accelerate. The overall cannabis market's growing 30%, beverages are growing 50%, we grew in that same time period last 12 months, 150%. Why? I think it's because we're attacking the mainstream consumer. 80% of adults wants to drink less booze. We are the only product on the market that's safe enough for someone who's trading alcohol with a cannabis beverage to consume without fear of being too intoxicated. So it's a real category expander. The people who are buying can, sometimes it's their first ever cannabis purchase. Sometimes it's their first trip to a dispensary. And we think that's powerful. We think that the growth of the cannabis market relies on welcoming new consumers with something safe. You say you're going 150% yet a patchwork of state laws must make it exponentially more difficult to operate. Absolutely. We have to build a manufacturing facility in every single state we're in. So expanding from California to Nevada to Arizona, we can't move product across state lines. And the packaging looks different because local regulations indicate that it has to. We're also available in Massachusetts and in Illinois with the THC product. But we do have an unspiked product which is available nationwide. You can order it online but no THC, no CBD, just a good tasting drug. Is that selling comparatively? It's a 10% of our overall business, but we don't really market it. It's more for people who want to try can, at least the flavor, and they're not available in the state that they're in. You have some celebrity endorsers, Gwen, if Paul Trollmost notably, who is your target audience? Our target audience is the healthy hedonist. And our celebrity endorsements and we have 35. So they span ages, genders, sexualities. There's no real demographic here that describes someone who wants to drink less booze and switch to cannabis. It's just a desire to be healthy, but you still want to have a little fun. And so we've partnered with a bunch of athletes, actors, musicians, YouTube creators, and we use their celebrity to drive awareness of the brand. And it's an army of people who really just believe in it and they invested with their own money. So it's not like we're paying them a ton of money to do a puff piece. It's just they're part owners of the business. Biggest news to come out of cannabis lately was President Biden with these pardons that some felt was largely symbolic because federally not many were arrested on possession, but reexamining schedule one.

3711," I tell you what, it would be a very popular move to legalize. And I think Biden stands to gain a lot by accelerating the progress on rescheduling, descheduling, and eventually decriminalization, expungement, full legalization. But it's a very complicated process. It'll probably take years. We're building this business as if it could be 2028. And so investors are betting on the dream and the long-term vision, not a short-term outcome. How far are we from drinking these in a restaurant or a bar? Great thing you asked. We actually can do it today in Minnesota. I don't know if you saw, but Minnesota accidentally legalized THC and fuse beverages under a certain threshold. So can is able to be sold in convenience stores just like green thumb and circle K. Those would be adjacent partnerships. Can in Minnesota you can buy convenience stores, grocery, and on-premise consumption? Wow, fascinating. Luke Anderson, co-founder of Can, social ton, a good to see, man. Thank you. Thank you. Shana. All right, David, let's take a look at some of these after hours, movers here. We have Tesla, IBM, Las Vegas, ANS, and LAM research. Let's kick it off with Tesla, the stock here after hours. You can see still under pressure off just around 3.5% mixed results here from the company revenue coming in just a bit late at 21.45 billion. EPS though, better than expected, a dollar and five cents, a company reaffirming. Their delivery target saying that they still see 50% average annual growth in deliveries. They also mentioned that they expect the initial phase of semi deliveries to begin in December just two months from now. Logistics, volatility, supply chain bottlenecks remaining immediate challenges here for the company. Over the past three months, the stock still in the red off just around 9.5% year-to-date. You can see that bigger move here to the downside off just around 36%. All right, let's pull up IBM here. The stock actually popping after hour, strong results here from the company, is again just around a five and a half percent revenue coming in. 14.1 billion. The street was expecting 13.5 billion EPS of a dollar 81 red hat revenue up at 12% here. The company also returning $1.5 billion to shareholders. They also lifted their full year revenue guidance on the three-month basis down 6% so when you compare it to the broader market, IBM has actually been fairing pretty well on a year-to-date basis. This year looking at just an 8% drop. Let's move on to Las Vegas, San, you can see the stock. Not moving a lot here after hour is actually exactly a flap, but we did get some results here from the company revenue just better than expected at 1.01 billion. They did, though, report a wider than expected loss of companies saying that travel restrictions reduced visitation, obviously impacting financial results still. CEO Rob Goldstein, though, was pretty optimistic. He said, quote, he is confident in the recovery of travel and tourism spending year-to-date stock off just around a five percent. Over the past three months, though, we have seen a bit of a recovery, if you can call that, the stock just holding on two gains up just around two tenths of a percent. Let's round it out with lamb research. That's a chipmaker here reporting $5.07 billion in revenue that was better than what the street was looking for. We also beat here on a just an EPS of $10.42, CEO Tim Marterson, a solid execution, also using supply chain constraints as helping the company produce strong overall performance over the past three months. Just around 26 percent. We know that lamb research is far from the only semiconductor that has been under pressure over the last several months. Year-to-date, you're still looking at the stock off just around 54 percent. Dave? Now thank you, all right, we're watching the airline sector. Tomorrow we'll be getting earnings from Alaska and American Airlines. The results come on the heels of very strong numbers in the last week from both Delta Airlines and United Airlines. Just last week, American raised its third quarter revenue guidance to a gain of 13 percent from 2019 levels. The expectation for Alaska earnings of $2.39 per share on revenue of $2.8 billion. There's a very strong sector despite prices up 8 percent month to month with a 40 percent year over year strong demand from both United and Delta.

3717," Shares of Chipotle of Sky Rock and since Brian Nookle took over a CEO all the way back in March of 2018, before he had the company though he was a recent college grad working at Proctor and Gamble, the road of his career caught the attention of our Brian Saasie and that's where he find his stake day. Brian's got to stick together, is that what it is? It's something like that, you see me slew thing, I'm still going over all the transcripts from all markets some had earlier in this week. I'm trying to pick up things that maybe I missed and investors should know about these leaders. I happen to think it is very important that investors know about the people leading the companies that they are invested in. But Brian Nichol, believe or not, started working at Proctor and Gamble on scope mouth watch. Here's story. You never really know where your journey is going to go, but I was very fortunate to get my first job at Proctor and Gamble. I got to work with a lot of great people. They took the time to invest in me so that I became much better at marketing and general management skills. I've taken that with me down the road and here I am at Chipotle. One thing I did discover a while is at the opportunity to work on Pringles is I loved working in the space of food. It just resonated with me. So fast forward here we are today. I still strongly encourage you to scope mouth watch. Obviously I'm a much bigger fan of Blockamolly and Burritos these days. Yeah, just an interesting there, little nugget. My experience has been just talking to a lot of many leaders for many years. Proctor and Gamble and PepsiCo, they just turn out a ton of top executives. There's something about those processes at those older companies, whether it's in the market, how they teach marketing, how they teach leadership. I can't tell you how many people get poached from those organizations to work at mid-level positions and ultimately end up in a CEO job like Brian Nichol. I look at two names, two people that I've gotten to know through the years. That's Chip Berg, the CEO of Levi's. He created the Swiffer device, over at Proctor Gamble and then Clorox CEO, Beno Dora, or former CEO, I should say. He worked at Proctor Gamble as well and he ended up at Clorox. It's just interesting to see the journey for a lot of these executives. But my take here is that it is very important as an investor. Do a search on the internet, see how these company leaders grew up, where they work, where they work, what have they done, pull up their LinkedIn profile and the information is right there. Start putting two and two together. I think it will go a long way to explain why companies are doing good and then why companies may be doing bad. That's really encouraging. Especially for a person like myself whose background was in marketing before getting more into the sales side and the integration and of course they go one and the same and one faster or another. Hearing that about Brian Nichol and the CPG side of his background too, really gives you some insight into how he thinks about the behavioral construct of the consumer and how that's ever changing and what he's navigating Chipotle through with that too now. Yeah and there's no disrespect to Chipotle. This is a restaurant operation increasingly becoming global over 3,000 restaurants. When you work on a global brand like a Pringles and have those complicated operations, that is an incredible experience. So ultimately take over and for him he went to young brands, spent many years at young brands, created the Liv Moss Logan while Taco Bell. And ultimately using all those skills that he learned at Procter and Gamble and now he's putting it all to play over at Chipotle. Oh, that's remarkable. All right, well I ordered one of the burritos. Well the burrito bowl influenced by of course Brian Sasi and broke the palm of the chest. You only got one now. Oh, but I doubled the meat. I doubled the meat. I did double the meat. Yeah, I did. All right, by the way Brad remembered he does have his own Netflix account. This is true. Update on the financials folks. I'm in the financials folks. I mean there's names. And there's names for it. Big time. Guys coming up, if you're in the market to buy a house, we've got some breaking news just for you. We hope it's good. It's on the other side of the show for you. Yeah. Yeah.",https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TFE9bMjrlhU,1,2022-10-20 13:58:21
3718," facile..... Welcome back to OutFiance. I'm Brian Sousy alongside Julie Hyman and Brad Smith. You have some, we will have soon surely some breaking news on existing home sales but Julie over to you right now we're seeing the markets up ahead of that news. Yeah we have it and it looks like it's pretty much in line with estimates here existing home sales coming in annual pace of 4.71 million. It is a decline month over month of about one and a half percent. We also by the way got the index of leading economic indicators down about four tenths of one percent but there's been a lot of attention on the housing market. We also by the way just got the news from Freddie Mac about the average 30 year fixed mortgage rate rising to 6.94 percent and it's obvious the effect that is having when you look at that existing home sales number and the declines that we are seeing there is that higher interest rates are having an effect on the ability of people to buy homes here eighth straight month that we saw the existing home sales number decline. That is the longest declining streak that we have seen since 2007 and obviously 2007 was when we were beginning to see the housing collapse and the beginnings of the great financial crisis and so interesting here that we are seeing that even though most predictions are not for something similar to happen this time around because the tendrils of the housing market and the capitalization of the banks and other lenders is in a different stage now than it was at that point in time. So all of that said this does show the sort of continuation of the waning housing market partly as a result of higher rates. Yeah let too.",https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TFE9bMjrlhU,2,2022-10-20 14:02:51
3719," All of that said this does show the sort of continuation of the waning housing market Partly as a result of higher rates. Yeah, I'll add to I believe was yesterday Just tracking some redfin data that they report on housing. They noted in September 60,000 deals were called off so that was you could see that that slowed down redfin has been reporting some some very good stats on this It's gonna be a question too of where there's gonna be supply that continues to come on the market whether that's on the new homes front and actually being able To complete some of those projects, but then also on the existing side if you have put prospective sellers that are now looking at the market and saying where we're gonna find buyers Then that's still gonna have a contraction in the supply that's actually coming through and so that is a particular risk in the near term as well Even as the rates are rising and compressing the amount of buyers that are prospectively out there the sellers the cell side of the equation That's also still seeing its own Looking across the market and saying all right. Well, why would we list our house now if there's not gonna be people who are able to bid on it right now at this price Yeah, and to your point the number of homes for sale declined to 1.25 million in September from 1.28 million in August So we continue to see that number go down a little bit in the meantime regional Fed officials out recently with some comments on Fed Policy I'll find it's Jen Schomburger has the details we heard from the likes of James Bullard Good morning. That's right Julie St. Louis Fed president James Bullard says he expects the Fed to end Frontloading aggressive interest rate hikes by sometime early next year, but still maintain an aggressive policy stance Now Bullard who made these comments in a Bloomberg TV interview Wednesday suggested he doesn't need to see rate pushed higher Then that 4.5 to 5% range currently projected by the committee Bloomberg Bullard told Bloomberg rather he thinks next year the Fed will be closer to running what he calls quote ordinary monetary policy He said the Fed is at the right level of policy rate to full inflation and can adjust as the data come in now These comments coming as the Fed has said it will be appropriate at some point to slow down the pace of interest rate hikes and Assess what the current rate hikes impact has already had on the economy elsewhere Minneapolis Fed president Neil Cash Carrey said that the Fed could potentially pause interest rate hikes sometime next year if inflation cools Cash Carrey Carrey told travelers Institute that he thinks inflation will level out over the next few months But underscored he doesn't yet the evidence that core prices which of course exclude volatile food and energy costs are moderating Now these are some of the last comments from Fed officials on monetary policy before we go into that so-called Black out period ahead of the Fed's next next interest rate policy meeting and less than two weeks Fed officials widely expected to raise that benchmark interest rate by 75 basis points again for the fourth meeting in a row guys Is there any inclination to or anything that we can extrapolate from Bullards comments? Especially as we were just talking about the housing market as well Bullard seemed to be acknowledging at least of the equation there and what the housing market represents or does not represent but is there a clear sense of how the Fed will continue to monitor housing particularly even as they're going along in their policy pathway Well two points there obviously on the housing front That is the one that has been most sensitive to the interest rate heights and is seeing the cooling Fed officials are still waiting for those rate high risks on the housing front And other interest rate sensitive sectors. They're still waiting for that to filter through now I think there was sort of an understanding from the market that perhaps the Fed to get even more hawkish on the back of an increase in Core inflation on the CPI reading that we got last week moving up to six points that Percent in September from six point three in August, but what Bullard is towing the line here saying look I think that our industry projections are the correct path policy path for right now And that's exactly what Mary Dalley told me last week as well So perhaps that could give investors some solace that the Fed still looking at that range of four and a half to five percent as the peak rate on the Fed funds rate All right, go finance his own Gen Sean burger Gen.

3720," after 5% as the peak rate on the Fed funds rate. All right, go finance his own, Jen Schomburger. Jen, thanks so much for breaking this all down. The Bullard commentary and where this all sits well, or not so well with the markets. Let's continue the conversation on markets with an eye to what fiscal and economic policies have worked and what hasn't in the past. Our next guest is out with a new book called a monetary fiscal history of the United States. Jenny, as now we've got Alan Blender, who is the Princeton University professor of economics and public affairs. Alan, great to have you here with us this morning. First, you just heard some of the comments from Fed, Representative Bullard, James Bullard, essentially saying, within this policy pathway going forward from here, that there could be a pivot sometime in the future, but they're going to wait to see if their policy has actually taken effect. What data would you be most notably looking towards to see where that policy is actually being ingested fully by the economy? Well, I think there's no doubt that you look first at housing as you were just talking about. If you go back through the history of the Federal Reserve in recent decades, I'm not talking about the 1920s, when monetary policy tightens, it has its principal effects on spending in two places. One is new houses, and the other is automobiles. So the spending on houses looks like it's behaving like it has in previous Fed tightnings. It's very sensitive because people finance it with mortgages. The spending on automobiles is a lot trickier because, as you all know, we've had this crazy cycle where people couldn't buy cars. They weren't enough cars to buy because they weren't enough chips to make cars. And a lot of automakers who've got backlogs. Now, a backlog is one thing. People come back out of their intention to buy a car. But I think it's at least believable hypothesis that the impact on automobile sales will be less than it normally has been in the past because of this backlog. Alan, it's Julie here. As you look across back at the history of monetary policy, it seems like no matter what the Fed does, there are always critics of the Fed and what it's doing. And there's always this backward looking. They should have done this. They should have done that. As you look at that history, what lessons do you take away for the Fed today? I guess you can't entirely avoid that criticism, but maybe to lessen it. You know, the old Joe Klein was that something that they paid them to make bucks for. If you actually look at Federal Reserve salaries, you would see how lovely they are. The answer to your question is it's part of the job description. The Federal Reserve knows that it's going to get criticism from one side or the other. Often both, some people criticizing it for being too selfish. Some people for being too hawkish. By the way, that's happening now. That's not that unusual. I can remember just to give you an anecdote in 1994 when we started raising interest rates. I was vice chairman of the Fed. And that was, by the way, ended up with the perfect soft landing. The absolutely perfect soft landing, the best the Fed has ever done. But we were criticized tremendously for wrong footing in the markets and surprising them by raising interest rates, even though Greenspan had signaled that months before. So it's just part of the atmosphere. It's the air you breathe has criticism in it if you're a FFED. Alan, yesterday I spoke to Bank of America CEO Brian Moynihan and he was talking a lot about a recession. Take a listen. Love to get your reaction on the back side. Our team predicts a recession, a mild recession. They have had that projection, frankly, for six months ago they had the same projection more or less. It just pushed out a little bit. But what we're not seeing is it come to four yet and that keeps moving it out because of that resiliency and the consumer. Alan, do you agree that if we are going into recession then it will be mild? I think so. Now one never knows because all kinds of known things can happen. Like a big oil shock from OK. I don't think that.",https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TFE9bMjrlhU,4,2022-10-20 14:11:18
3721," So now one never knows because all kinds of unknown things can happen. Like, you know, big oil shock from OK. I don't think that will happen, but it's possible. So events on unforeseen events can upset the apple card. But I think my central prognostication, if you want to call it that is very similar to what Mr. Miningham was just speaking about with the single exception. And it's trivial is that a few months ago, I was not saying it would happen in 2022. It would probably happen in 2023, which is what I hear him saying. There are a number of reasons to think it'll be fairly mild. I'll just take off too. One is the huge amount of liquidity that consumers have accumulated, largely because of the transfer payments that were made to to lessen the impact of the terrible pandemic recession. So consumers are sitting on a cash pile, depending on how you measure it of two trillion, two and a half trillion. So that's going to be enabling them to bolster their spending, even if their factor incomes go down. And the second thing that's rarely discussed, but Neil Kashkary is a good example of it. You had him on a moment ago. This is a fairly dovish FOMC, Federal Open Market Committee. They vary, you know, it's human beings that are making these decisions. And sometimes the committee has a very hawkish tilt there eager to raise rates. They're very, very inflation-versed. And sometimes they're more hawkish and they're more concerned about the employment impacts. They're still trying to get inflation down. No question about that. It's a matter of degree. And I think by historical standards, this is a fairly dovish FOMC. And what that means to me is they're less likely to overdo it. Kind of piggybacking on something that you just mentioned a moment ago, Alan. I mean, we are emerging from a situation, a crisis that none of us had ever been through in our lifetimes with the coronavirus pandemic. And with that, you had seen economies around the world try to stimulate growth once again, coming out after that. But now there's the larger question of on a global front, on a global picture here, where one economy's trouble is maybe a precursor to another's, or where they may not be. And do you believe that there's anything within Europe right now that is a precursor to what the U.S. may be heading towards? A little bit, right? It's easy to, you know, it's hard to put the right spin on this. I don't want to say it doesn't matter, but it's easy to exaggerate it. Also, point one is that Europe is almost certainly headed for a worse recession than we are. They are more impacted by the food and especially. Oh, it looks like we've got Professor Blinders shot frozen, unfortunately. We got some gremlins today. We got some gremlins today. Well, all right. Nonetheless, we will continue to watch all things fed policy. Very interesting point there, Alan Blinder, making about a potential recession next year if anything, he's looking forward to maybe be mild. He actually, I think we got him back. Alan, do we have you back? I'm here. Okay, great. Can you see me? Yes, we are. I wanted to get you actually for one last question here. And that has to do with the report in the New York Times today. Gina Smilak over there. Talk to you about some comments that James Bullard made on the sidelines, Dan and DC, while the IMF meetings were going on to a private audience of city clients. And this is a pretty rare occurrence for a fed governor to make comments on monetary policy to a private group. I'm just wondering if you could give us your take on that. It is unusual. It's not unheard of. It is unusual. And I'm sure Jim Bullard understood. I don't know the occasion, but I mean, I was sometimes in positions like that when I was vice chairman of the fed. And I'm sure Jim Bullard understands that after more than three people in the room, it wasn't really a provocation. It was going to leak out. And so I'd rather doubt that he would have said anything to that group that he wouldn't say on television. Makes sense. Yeah, appreciate that perspective. Alan Blind or Princeton University professor of economics.",https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TFE9bMjrlhU,5,2022-10-20 14:15:34
3722," would have said anything to that group that he wouldn't say on television. Makes sense. Yeah, appreciate that perspective. Alan Blinder, Princeton University, professor of economics and public affairs and author of a monetary and fiscal history of United States. Always good to see Alan. We'll talk to you soon. All right, before we had to break, let's shed light on some positive comments on the retail sector from Wells Fargo analyst, Ike Barchow. The analyst says his data shows US consumer demand continues to be stable across the mall notes Barchow. It appears most companies took their medicine and set more prudent plans post their summer slowdowns. And as such, we see much less near-term risk in the third quarter. His top picks include a bath and body works, tapestry, Burlington stores and barfetch. Coming up, the latest executive movement at Metta, Brad is back with that plus more of today's top headlines next. The UK's Prime Minister Liz Trust resigned this morning. She will stay in the role until a successor is chosen. Until yesterday, there was a widely held view in her party that a leadership change should wait at least until a new economic plan is announced on October 31st to calm financial markets. But in fighting within the Tory party and a realization that she will no longer be able to fulfill her promises sped up that process. The British government will hold a leadership election within the next week. And Marble or Maker, Philip Morris reported third quarter earnings before the bell this morning.

And big departures over at Metta, Amin Zuafunin. That is the company's vice president of corporate developments. The same guy behind Metta, formerly Facebook's acquisition of Instagram, WhatsApp, and Oculus, is leaving the company after almost 12 years at the social media giant. He said in a Facebook post that strategic technology deal work is pretty intense, which is why he wants to take a break for a bit, Julie. Alright, earnings season is just beginning here, but we've already heard several executives talk about the impact the strength of the dollar is head on the top and bottom lines. The dollar has been on a tear, having his best quarterly performance in seven years. But why exactly does this impact companies? And how can they hedge against it, Professor Julie Heimner's year for her debut of Yahoo, you, Julie, take it away. Alright, take your seats, Jens, because class is indeed in session. We have seen this enormous strength in the dollar this year. We've been talking a lot about it. It has meant about a 14% rally for the dollar versus the likes of the euro, 30% rally versus the Japanese yen. If you look at the year to date, you've seen the dollar index versus a basket of currencies. Go higher. What does this mean in real terms? Well, let's say I had a company called Jewels Tools. I saw all kinds of stuff, square drivers, hammers, power drills. What have you? Let's say I have a big business in the EU and I sell 1000 euros worth of hammers in the European Union. If you go back to March, that sale, if I brought it back to profits here in the US, would be worth about $1,112.40. However, as of yesterday, it was worth less than $1,985. This tells you in real terms, when you bring those profits back to the United States, what happens? It's the inverse of you going to vacation over in Europe and having more power to spend there. A lot of companies have already talked about this effect. We've already heard so many during this earning season thus far from the netflixes and proctoring gambles of the world, for example. It's going to take a head of $3.9 billion over the next year. I forgot that I controlled this and you don't. So here are the various companies that we're seeing here, guys Tesla, one of the companies also talking about the currency impact. Netflix making these kinds of comments as well that it's really costing these companies billions of dollars as we are seeing the currency effect. And most of the currency strategies we've spoken to are saying the dollar is going to continue to go up. So this is not something that's over. So what can companies do in order to try and hedge against the dollar strength? That's something we hear about frequently, this hedging activity. There's a couple things we can do. Jules Tools can pay workers in local currency. In other words, if I have workers in the European Union that are making those hammers, I can just keep the euros there and pay the workers in that currency. I don't have to bring it back to the United States. So that's one way that I can do it. Another way I can do it is issue debt in that foreign currency. So for example, I can sell corporate bonds denominated in euros. And that way I don't have that currency translation effect that is hitting my bottom line. So that's another way that we can hedge potentially. But overall, this is undoubtedly going to have an increase in effect on corporate profits here. 2% increase in the trade-weighted dollar will subtract about a percent from earnings per share in the United States for S&P 500 companies. And according to City and JP Morgan, they estimate that if you see a 10% increase in the dollar basket, it could cut S&P earnings by 15 to 20 dollars or share. So we're talking about a substantial effect here. And this is why we've been hearing about companies offsetting it in a number of different ways, including raising prices. But this is a theme that is going to stick around for a while. Yeah, and it's definitely impacting companies in a big, big way. Really good stuff, Julie. I think that's the debut of the Julie emoji here on Yago Fine. Yeah, I think what for you, Brad. I like my look at mine. I see your, it looks exactly like us. I don't know how they, I don't know how they come up with these things. You're just always good. I'm excited for the new Julie emoji. Within this, though, the impact that you're mentioning, I mean, we've already gotten into some of the tech companies, but we're just at the tip of the iceberg for some of the tech companies that are going to be reporting.",https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TFE9bMjrlhU,7,2022-10-20 14:24:19
3724," OG, within this though, the impact that you're mentioning, I mean, we've already gotten into some of the tech companies, but we're just at the tip of the iceberg for some of the tech companies that are gonna be reporting and talking about FAC. And when you're talking about the hedging that the tech companies can do, for example, if I am a software company, most of my developers are likely in the United States. So I can't do that keeping the currency local situation quite as well to account for expenses. I gotta bring that money back to pay my programmers. Top work there, my friend, Professor Hyman, very good stuff. I very much enjoyed that. All right, coming up, we'll speak to the CFO of AT&T on the back of their third quarter earnings report. That's next.じゃあ 다음에 봐요. Here's a VAT&T. I'm moving higher this morning. After the telecom company reported third quarter earnings showing 708,000 postpaid phone net ads and a 6% rise in mobility revenue year over year. AT&T, CFO, Pescal, Deroch joins us now to discuss. Pescal, good to see you again. Three months ago, we were here having a conversation at a time. Your stock was down, double digits, and you weren't worn on free cash flow. Now today, the stock is up, and there seems to be a different tone on this earnings release. Why is that the case? Look, first of all, good morning, Brian, good morning, everybody. You know, maybe let me just start. I think this journey dates back to a couple of years ago. What we've said is we were going to invest to re-energize growth in this business with a priority towards re-energizing wireless and fiber growth. For a long time, we said that that investment initially would reduce earnings, but over time would produce significant returns. And last year, we said at the second...",https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TFE9bMjrlhU,8,2022-10-20 14:28:57
3725," reduce earnings, but over time would produce significant returns. And as late last year, we said, at the second half of this year, earnings would start to see the benefits of all the work that's been done. So things are playing out exactly as we said. And look, overall, I'd be remiss if I didn't thank my colleagues across the company for all their hard work and getting us to this point. In terms of what's different now, I think, class quarter, there was a bit of an overreaction by, I think, the marketplace and some of the media. In the end, what we flagged and we tried to we tried to every cord to be really transparent what we were seeing in the marketplace. What did we see? We saw that there was a normalization of collection patterns back to pre-pandemic norms. That hasn't gotten any worse. It's pretty much the same. And, you know, in terms of overall delinquencies that I've been saying this since the spring, we are probably slightly worse than pre-pandemic norms, but all of them are really strong fundamentals. The thing to keep in mind is, our business has a history of performing well even in challenging economic times. And we don't expect this time to be any different. You know, that's an amazing acknowledgement here, especially as we think about the fact that within the market, consumers are paying more in some of their other necessities that they have to account for as well. And so when it comes down to their telecommunications service provider, like an AT&T, and the delinquencies that you are seeing, where are you also seeing perhaps the either type of device that customers that are net ads may be opting in for? Is it on the higher tier? Is it on the mid tier? And what type of service for those devices as well? Yeah, and I would say it's a bit across the board. First and foremost, consumers as a general matter, more and more people are signing up to higher price plans because of the value that those plans provide in terms of additional bandwidth. But not everyone is taking the device promotions. In fact, a meaningful portion of our subscriber additions in wireless come through our business relationships. And that channel, it has been and continues to be really efficient source of generating new subscribers. And so we're benefiting from that. And we're seeing just the consistency of our offer quarter after quarter, resonating with customers. And our sales team know how to execute it. And all those things are contributing to continued improvement in continued growth and subscribers, as well as higher RPUs. You layer on top of that a better international, more international travel also contributing to higher roaming revenues. All those things are driving improvements in RPU. And we've been doing a lot of work in our cost structure. And you're starting to see some of that benefit come through to the bottom line. So we feel really good about how we're performing. Pascal, it's Julie here. So obviously a lot of attention being paid to your networking investments as you pointed out. And there have been some reports that you are in discussions to spend a lot more on the network. There was a report recently that you're working with one of the big banks to increase your fiber optic cable investment, a 10 to 15 billion dollar investment potentially. Is there anything you can tell us about that and what it would mean for your customers and for your network? As a matter of policy, we don't talk about rumors in the press. But let me tell you, overall, how we think about fiber. Fiber right now is the best technology. And as we look out the next decade or two, there is nothing under horizon that will match the effectiveness of fiber, especially in terms of the speed that bandwidth and importantly symmetrical speed. And we don't see anything changing that. We are the largest provider in the U.S. We know how to do it very well. We can do it more efficiently than others. And we are prioritizing investing in fiber. If there are opportunities for us to accelerate that through different partnerships, of course we'll look at it.",https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TFE9bMjrlhU,9,2022-10-20 14:32:54
3726," others and we are prioritizing investing in fiber. If there are opportunities for us to accelerate that through different partnerships, of course we'll look at that. As John Stake said on the call this morning, his job and my job is to make sure we are looking at all opportunities to potentially accelerate returns on our owners. Pascal, as it pertains to your planning for 2023, two part question one, are you planning for a recession? And the number two, are you planning for a pickup in promotions to consumers given the slowdown we might see? Here is what I would tell you. You will hear more about how we're thinking about 2023 when we report our fourth quarter earnings. Overall, what I did say on this morning's call is that we understand, we're more than three quarters of the way through the year and we understand what sort of macro environment we're operating in now. And they even considering all the challenges that we read about, we expect to grow earnings of free cash flow next year. But we want to make sure we wait till the fourth quarter and have the best possible information. And at that point, we will tell you how we are thinking about more precisely how we expect the magnitude of earnings of free cash flow growth. Within that, though, and as you start to think about what a potential recession might look like for the business, what does that real margin run rate actually sustain at over that period of time, given the delinquencies that you were talking about a moment ago? When you look back at history, even in downturns, the telecommunications sector tends to be more resilient than most. Clearly, we would be impacted like others, but not nearly to the same extent. And right now, when you look at the criticality of telecommunication, whether wireless or broadband connectivity, that's one of the last things the consumer will turn off, even in a challenging economic environment. With that said, look, they pay me to make sure that we have the opportunity in the event that we encounter difficult operating environments to identify potential offsets. And you know, things we would look to are things like, do we moderate the pace of our investments then in capital, but all in all, the good news about where we are today is that we believe we can continue to invest meaningfully in our business, comfortably pay our dividend, and still continue to deliver over the next several years. But look, if they're really challenging economics environment that we're operating in, you know, we will look for other ways to offset that. They may not turn it off, but would they trade down in terms of the service that they are receiving from AT&T? And have you seen that show up in anywhere in the business? Yeah, it hasn't shown up. In fact, more consumers are opting for the higher price plan. That's part of what's driving the growth in our RRQ that we reported. All right, we'll leave it there. AT&T, CFO, Pascal DeRosch. Good to see you again. We'll talk to you soon. Good seeing you. Thank you, everyone. Appreciate it.

Joining me now discuss is Antonio Nairi, heal the Packard Enterprise CEO. Antonio, always nice to see you. Right off the top, you guys highlighted a $250 billion market opportunity by 2025. What is that market opportunity? Well, good morning, Brian. Thank you for having me today. It's a big market opportunity because not only that market is expanding, but we are entering new segments of the market with new offers as a part of our age-to-class strategy. And those new offers are in the private 5G, in the IoT, and in the data switching portfolio in the connectivity space, as well as security in the SaaS space together with our flagship product, the SD1. And as well, increasing number of offers as a part of our HP Green Lake platform and new data services. So a combination of cable growth at the time and new segments, that give us the opportunity to play over the next three years in that $250 billion market. Antonio, that shift to software as a service which ultimately drives to annual recurring revenue. Where are you at in that journey? Well, we have made a tremendous progress, if you recall, in 2019, I committed to make available all our offers from age-to-cloud as a service. And at the HP Discovery in June, we achieve a major milestone because not only our age solutions are now part of our HP Green Lake platform, but as well as workload optimization infrastructure as a service, as a service, and as well as data services. So we made tremendous progress, but now we are operating as a company in a cloud operating environment where all our new offers are designed and delivered to HP Green Lake. So now is the journey on continuous adding and renewing those offers as we go forward. And that AIR, as we guided for the next three years, is going to grow between 35 and 45 percent, also not only on the back of a significant growth, which this year alone, we are growing up bookings in excess of 86 percent a year today. But the fact that we already have $7.7 billion of total contravalue in the Azure Service Business in our balance sheet. Are you seeing any red flags or areas of concern in your business? Are customers cancelling orders? Are they delaying decisions at all? Well, what is fascinating to me, Brian, is that we continue to see enduring demand for our products and our services. And Green Lake is at the top of that demand. Well, customers love about HP Green Lake. It's the fact that they get a unified cloud experience, inclusive of the public cloud and all the services and applications they have on premises. And now they get the opportunity to extend not only into the public cloud with the same experience, but also at the edge. And that's the next big opportunity for us because we live in a much more distance.",https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TFE9bMjrlhU,11,2022-10-20 14:41:51
3728," to extend not only into the public cloud with the same experience, but also at the edge. And that's the next big opportunity for us because we live in a much more distributed enterprise than ever before. And also new use cases are being developed and deployed at the edge. So that's for us is a point of differentiation in my mind. And then when it comes down to momentum, again, enduring the demand, but we have not seen any major or the cancellations at all. And that to us is a very positive sign that digital transformation and a key top priority for our customers and IT plays now a bigger role than ever before. Antonio, some of the analysts commentary I saw this morning. A lot of them seem to be flagging the outlook for next year. A little cautious, a little below some of the estimates that were out there. Does that outlook account for our potential recession in the US? Well, that outlook has started and I stated yesterday includes what we see as a potential disruption that made the market creates because of the inflation and the foreign current exchange, you know, kind of trends we see. So we have comprehended all of that in our outlook, but we are very confident about our outlook because obviously we have a record-breaking backlog with again, enduring the demand continue to be in the market. Second is that also we continue to make a significant shift in not only in our product and portfolio mix, but in a way with the liver that makes. And third also, this company generates a lot of cash. And so from my vantage point, we are very well positioned to meet or exceed that outlook. Understanding that the biggest issue unknown today is actually in my mind not so much the macro environment, but more the volatility of the foreign exchange. Antonio, I'm on the the Hula Packard Enterprise Staff page on Yahoo Finance and I see your stock trading at under six times for earnings. That is more than half of the broader market. Just given the performance of the business, I mean, that is that shocking how you guys performed compared to the past year. You mentioned you have a lot of cash. How are you going to deploy cash over the next 12 months to get that multiple up? Yeah, I think you just said that really well. I mean, our disappointment is on the multiple because not only we're growing revenues, we are also growing recurrent revenues, which they represent more than one-third of our total revenues. And by the way, almost 80% of our profits are recurring. Okay. I think the market still want to see ongoing what I call performance on a free cash flow, which obviously has been a little bit losing through the separation and spin-offs in the restriction we have to do to rise size the company, which we are now. And our guidance on free cash flow now is at the midpoint two billion dollars. What you're going to see is the convergence of a non-GAP EPS to free cash flow. And that free cash flow is deploying in a balanced way. Obviously, we are super committed to dividends, which today at the current stock price are represented almost at 4% yield, probably one of the highest in my mind in the tech sector. Continue to aggressively buy shares back, obviously because the share price is depressed. But at the same time, we have to continue to invest in the business because ultimately we've got to bring breakthrough innovation for our customers. But that investment in the business has a significant discipline around it or return to invest the capital. And obviously, gear to higher margins and higher areas of growth, but all delivered through HP Green Lake, which drives the recurring revenue. And obviously, over time, that will help our multiples as well. All right. We'll get some rest. I know it's been a long week for you. Antonio and Eric, he'll have packed an enterprise CEO. Always good to get some time with you. I'll talk to you soon. Catch you on Twitter. Thank you, Brian. All right. airline earnings have been impressive. Notably, American Airlines out today and united out on Wednesday. So what do these reports mean for results coming from Airbnb, Expedia, and others?

3729," Über Thanos With consumer confidence, sticking higher in September, signs of life are coming back to the travel industry. Occupancy rates were in line with 2019 levels in September and domestic travel intent trended higher. That's according to data from STR and the conference board. Of course we got a lot of positive airline earnings as well to support that notion. Joining us now to discuss JMP Security's equity research analyst Nick Jones, Nick, you covered the digital travel companies, the booking.coms of the world. And I imagine that the picture is similar for them. Is it sort of a rise in tide lifts all boats? Are we just seeing a kind of rosy outlook right now for the travel industry writ large? Yeah, I think that's right. The airlines have given some good commentary that trends remain resilient. Occupancy rate as you pointed out is back to 2019 levels in September. Conference four is saying intent to travel is increasing average daily rates or are elevated still indicating demand is still high. So trends are really looking good into the end of the year and that it both evolved for early 2023. I think near term, that's absolutely right. In the longer term, we look kind of further in the next year, the probability of a recession continues to increase. If you look back over history, generally the spend on travel does start to decline in a recession. So I think in part that's what's maybe keeping these stocks and really breaking out of kind of near term positive data points. Hope this keeps some of the airlines honest here. From what you're seeing in terms of the number of different flights, the routes that are available, is there actually more capacity that is increasingly being added on here? And is that translating through to better fares for customers from what you've been tracking in your own research? Yeah, I mean so far, the intent is there, the demand is there, but it does not appear that fares are really coming down yet from the kind of the check.",https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TFE9bMjrlhU,13,2022-10-20 14:50:36
3730," research. Yeah, I mean so far the intent is there, the demand is there, but it does not appear that fairs are really coming down yet from the kind of the checks we've done in a anecdotal. You know, the price of flights are still pretty elevated and some are the price of hotels. So, despite their still being pretty high cost, the demand of travel is still there. You know, we have heard some commentary, particularly the hotels, that not all of the rooms are actually available today because they'll have a staffing to make them available. So, that could in Part B, why some of, you know, the average daily rates remain elevated. So, it's kind of more supply comes on. It'll be interesting to watch if the airlines and the hotels actually lower prices are today kind of hold on to where prices are today is kind of input cost increase. What about the sort of international lumpiness, if you will? I mean, a booking.com, which gets more of its revenue from Europe than the others. Is that then more vulnerable? Yeah, there's kind of puts in takes there. So, the US dollar strength is it could create some effects, headwinds, kind of two revenues and costs at booking, but at the same time, the intent to travel from the US to foreign destinations is actually increased back to 2019 level. So, a strengthening US dollar can benefit a company like booking as more US will look to travel to Europe and outside of the US. Is Airbnb still in any type of growth phase from right now, from what you can see? Yeah, Airbnb is, you know, they've benefited from really making alternative accommodations, really just another accommodation. They've really normalized that type of accommodation to consumers. Their growth does appear to be moderating. We have a market for form rating on it, largely due to valuation, but what they've done is, you know, it's heroic what they've done to kind of a new accommodation class. The company still has room to add experiences to its offering. They could have promoted listing to kind of the supply side of the platform that could continue to drive net revenue kind of faster than we're looking for today, but we look for more evidence before we really start making that intro model. But from what we can tell, it looks like kind of the, you know, GBV growth at Airbnb is going to be in line with kind of expedient booking in a couple years and be a similar kind of nominal dollar growth rate. All right, good time to be a bills fan. See the helmet in the back of your shot there. JMP Securities Equity Research Analyst Nick Jones, joining us here today. Thanks so much Nick. Thanks, go bills. Coming up, we're going to take a look at some more movers, including all states on the back of its quarterly results. That's next.",https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TFE9bMjrlhU,14,2022-10-20 14:54:41
3731," //music旆 Here's the music, you know it's time to go for time. We got two stories today, one minute each. Put it on the clock here, all state issuing a warning. On its third quarter results, expecting a net loss for the quarter. The first three years responded to the news by dropping sharply this morning. According to insurers, inflation is causing costs for payouts to jump across the board with auto and medical costs, climbing significantly this year shares down to 10% right now in trading. The investors aren't in good hands, I guess. Oh, well they are in good hands, but it's costing all state more. Right? If you file a point. Then the company has to pay board. There was also some hurricane costs and that also really weighed on the bottom line for all state. It's going to be hurricane, right? And they do a lot of modeling at the insurance companies, but I guess if your modeling is off from what actually happens with the hurricane. And then you're forced to pay a high number of claims at a higher cost, this is then the result. I'm just fascinated how these stocks are going to do as we get more focus on climate change in this country and as these events potentially pick up over the next decade. Well, it's interesting because for all state, I imagine it's very similar to what I'm going to say. Okay, we're done with that story. In good hands though, China reportedly holding emergency talks with chip makers following restrictions on imported semiconductors from the US. That's according to Bloomberg. The meetings happen behind closed doors to assess the possible damage to China's developing semiconductor markets. So we're seeing all chip stocks rise on this news, but again, a very contentious situation here. Well, the rise in the stocks doesn't make a lot of sense to me, honestly. This report said in this closed-door meeting that there were as many questions as answers. So like, yeah, they met to try and figure out what to do about the issue, but they have no answers. Right, but it's also a very one-sided conversation that's taking place, especially if you still have the US, that is not as willing to let the chip companies hear or abroad either come into the US or for some of the chip companies here go abroad, especially into China. And so that is still very one-sided, even to say, yeah, we're having these discussions on our side right now. Yeah, I think the bigger story, at least near-term for investors, is the PC slowdown over. Do we have any visibility when this might end? Because that is hammered stocks like AMD and Intel. Right, and there's no closed-door meeting. No closed-door meeting. They're reporting earnings soon. It's open to the motto. Yes, it is. All right, let's take a look at what stocks are doing here as we leave you, because we have seen an uptick overall across the board. So really, what started as a very mixed picture today is turning more uniformly positive. All three major averages are higher here. It doesn't seem like there was any particular catalyst that I could see. This chip maker's being up, doesn't hurt matters, to be sure. And coming up in the next hour, Kiko Fujita will speak with Union Pacific Sea-O lands. But that's on the back of his company's earnings report. We talked about it earlier.

3732," This is a free Mississippi and permanent I'm curious about how to do a tour today Onップтос kroс Чесь you you you Welcome to Yahoo Finance live. It is 11am here in New York City. I'm a Kiko Fugi's up. Here's what we're watching at this hour. Tesla failing to impress we see the stock falling even as Elon Musk reaffirms strong demand adding the company will sell every car it makes. We're going to break down the numbers straight ahead. And it's goodbye for Liz trusts. Given the situation, I cannot deliver the mandate on which I was elected by the Conservative Party. The UK Prime Minister resigns after just 44 days becoming the shortest serving UK leader in history, sterling rallies while guilt yield slip as the UK goes in search of yet another new leader. And Union Pacific chugs hire the railroad operator beats on earnings and revenue, but the stock falling on concerns about a trimmed outlook as that takes hold, we're going to be joined by the CEO of Union Pacific Landsfrets a little later in the show. But first, a look at the markets. We are seeing green arrows across the board. Take a look at the bottom of the screen there. The Nasdaq seeing the biggest gains up about 1.3% the Dow up 1% and the S&P 500 up about 810s of a percent. So from start to the day, two key things we're watching outside of those majors yields as well as currency swing.",https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TFE9bMjrlhU,16,2022-10-20 15:03:18
3733," S&P 500 up about 8 tenths of a percent. So from start to the day, two key things we're watching outside of those majors, yields as well as currency swings. And we're starting on those treasury yields. They're pushing higher as well. We did see that 10-year yield briefly touching a level. We have not seen since 2008 and you see it well above the 4 percent mark right now at 4.15. Currency swings is Japanese yen and focus yet again. Remember that intervention from the BOJ about a month ago, certainly has not helped the yen's cause. We did see it briefly touch $152 right now at $149.59. A lot of investors waiting to see if the BOJ intervenes yet again there and you see at the bottom of the screen the dollar hitting that mark for the first time since 1990. We are beginning this hour though which shares of Tesla down nearly 4 percent after its latest quarterly results topping earnings estimates for the third quarter. The revenue came in below expectations as electric carmaker saw costs in Austin and Berlin way on margins. CEO Elon Musk though painting a brighter picture on demand in yesterday's earnings call. Take a listen. I can't emphasize enough. We have excellent demand for Q4 and we expect to sell every car that we make for as far into the future as we can see. For more on Waskat, what Musk had to say, let's bring in Yahoo Finance as prize, supermanian. So process interesting, you have those comments coming from Elon Musk saying that we want to reiterate demand is going to be strong for Q4 but we've also heard him talk about this gap that we're seeing between production and deliveries. That seems to be the concern that's kind of weighing on the stock today. Yeah, I feel like half the street is sort of seeing that delivery versus production sort of issue as a, oh, it's not a big deal to pick up right now. We're seeing other half saying, no, this is demand problem. And Musk's sort of saying that, hey, we're hitting a lot of issues with trucks and boats and other means of transporting their cars to customers so they can't actually recognize those as delivery. So he's sort of paying that picture but then I was saying that, oh, we're also seeing demand soften in China, Europe's getting hit by energy crisis and the US, the Fed is hitting the US economy. So he's talking about all these other things that are hurting demand. They're hurting demand. Exactly. So we can't, Q4 looking great. That's going to be a huge quarter for us. They maintain that 50% compound annual growth rate for even for this year. I mean, they got to build like 500,000 cars in Q4 alone. I mean, look, it's maybe looking back on that math. They could probably build 400,000 max maybe. I could be wrong but that's looking more likely but they said, hey, we're going to do this. We're going to hit that target around 1.4 to 1.5 million this year. Okay. The headwinds are outweighing sort of the positives that you just highlighted. Let's bring in another guest into the hour here. We've got George, a Jennifer, Rekas, a chemical originality managing director. George, let's just build on those comments from Praz. What's your sense right now on why the stock is pulled back so significantly? Is this about the street just simply saying we don't necessarily buy this story that demand is going to stay strong in Q4? Well, first thanks for having me. And I think Praz kind of nailed it. Look, it was an issue where there's a little bit of double speaker on the one hand. So the first time that I can remember and I've been looking at the stock for a long time, Elon Musk acknowledged that there was a demand issue particularly in China. And if you guys remember several years ago and someone asked about demand, he called it a boring question. Right? So this might be the first time where he actually acknowledged a little bit of a down tick. But at the same time, he said the company would grow significantly in Q4 and we think they could do about 450,000 deliveries. And then they're going to sell as many cars as they can build for the foreseeable future, which is about 50% year-rear growth as far as the I can see. And so what we did is we thought about how we can square that circle. And for us, it came up to a couple of things. First, the company has had backlog for a really long period of time and they're probably going to drain a little bit of that in Q4. There are some fleet sales. The company's like hurts that they could maybe sell in Q4 that help. And then when you look into 2023 specifically, the cyber truck comes online and that really helps to start producing more in Austin. They have Tesla semi-sales. And then beyond that, hopefully we're out of this economic bunk that they were in currently. But it's kind of like,",https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TFE9bMjrlhU,17,2022-10-20 15:07:45
3734," They start producing more in Austin. They have Tesla semi-sales. And then beyond that, hopefully we're out of this economic bump that they were in currently. And EVs, if you remember, are really, really, really small percentage of overall sales. And so that will start to help. So we think there's some method to the madness and there's logic as to why he guided them to grow significantly this year and continue their growth and connection. But I completely agree and understand there's too many breadcrumbs to that indicate that there's been a slowdown in the man and even acknowledging them yesterday's fall. Hey, Georgia, pros again. So I just wanted to talk to you about a couple of things that I sort of struck me last time the call. You mentioned the cyber truck, how they're going in the tooling phase for potential sort of, I guess, production start in mid-2023. But also you mentioned the cheaper Tesla, the kind of entry-level car that would potentially be half the cost or something like that versus the Model 3. What did you think about that? Because they actually kind of sort of confirmed that this is actually in the works. Yeah, so on the cyber truck, it's one of the things that may give the company a lot of confidence in growth in 23 and beyond. Because look, I'm pretty confident that the company won't keep the pricing that had discussed last time when they first introduced it. But remember, they had millions, according to the press, millions of orders for the cyber truck, starting in 2023. And so even if they had a lot of cancellations, that's a lot of demand. I personally would get one if my wife let me, but she told me she would be content driving it. So it's clearly an acquired taste. And a lot of people really like it. On the Robotaxi platform, it's a really interesting question. And so basically, when you think about the company's ability to bring down the cost of production for a vehicle, they've done a really, really marvelous job with the Model 3 slash Model Y platform, which cost about, somewhere in the mid $30,000 range to make. And when it comes to Robotaxi, that's another step down in production cost. Now, granted, it won't be as a big of a vehicle. There'll be a lot of nuances to it. You know, probably won't have a steering wheel and some odd stuff like that that will enable autonomous driving. But it's another platform through which the company can reduce costs and help you these proliferate the gold. George, in terms of potential for buybacks, it sort of felt like Elon Musk dangled that carrot for investors who have been a little jittery around the stock. He said, $5 to $10 billion is certainly possible. These were his words for next year. I wonder what you make of that. How much of this is about trying to get those investors to stick it out, those who have been concerned about his distractions with Twitter? And is this really the best use of capital for a company? Should that be used towards more catbacks? Just to be blunt, we don't like it. Buybacks are things that companies like newspaper company do not Tesla that has significant opportunity in front of it. We think there's better use of capital to accelerate catbacks plans, to build cars, to build the robot army that Elon Musk wants to build. It's just, in our opinion, they're just better ways to accelerate their plans around, you know, having EVs proliferate the globe. And other opportunities, including battery factories and robots. So look, I'm sure that they've done a lot of math behind it and they want to see the support the stock down here in the 200s. But we think ultimately long term, the best way to support the stock is to grow for as long as you can. George, we didn't even get to ask you about the valuation. And Elon Musk's calling for a valuation for a Tesla could equal Apple and Saudi Aramco combined. But that's for another conversation around a time here. George, you know, he gets Ken Accord, Genuity, Managing Director, our thanks to you and our thanks to Yahoo Finance's Pros Supermanian. Well, American Airlines topped Wall Street's estimates for the third quarter. Reporting record revenue of $13.5 billion as demand remains strong for travel shares of the airline, though, down nearly 3%. Let's bring in our very own Brad Smith for a look at the numbers. It's a pretty steep fall when you consider how strong the quarter was.

Actually get back to full capacity We know that United American Airlines there right around 90% of that 2019 capacity Delta lagging behind that just a little bit But it's really this effort to do so Wisely and diligently with the resources that they do have whether that be the number of pilots whether that be the hubs that That they're operating in and the number of routes that they're still flying anybody that has traveled over the last few months knows how high airline Tickets have been yes, you know, I mean airlines not the only one but sort of this offset that we're seeing with fuel costs going up But then companies charging more and when you look at where the revenue came in how much of this had to do with the higher prices They were able to charge well They had to pass through a lot of that higher costs on the fuel side Air American Airlines rather that fuel price was actually up 97% relative to years past when We had watched over the summer and many of the prices because of that demand They knew that they could pass through that that price and that cost was being absorbed by consumers It's a larger question of as those fuel prices start to come down and these are contracts that they negotiate well in advance So perhaps still working through what they had actually paid for some of the Excesses that they would been able to have to operate so many of their routes and their flights So perhaps as we work through that you'll start to see some of those prices come down for the consumers and especially going into a holiday season Where it doesn't look like demand is going to dampen we've heard that consistently throughout the quarter throughout the results from American Airlines from Delta From Alaskan Airlines even is that the man is strong right now And so it's a larger question of when the customers will actually push back on pricing But even with this capacity it seems like they're still going to see some of that strength continue to move forward as well Well, that was my my follow-up question obviously we're going into one of the busiest seasons We heard early on it is the year in the years that you know travelers were already booking flights for Q4 Right, but now we're talking about more economic headwinds Do we get any more color on the outlook and you know? Yes holiday demand is still holding up, but when do they expect it to start to slow down? You know, it's actually I think an acknowledgement that they made on the call for American Airlines just a few minutes ago And it is that they're actually going to be removing their business or their first class rather and replacing that with more business class seats And if there's anything that we can really extrapolate from that It's in the fact that with the absence of as much corporate travel demand as we had seen and more of that leisure demand really relied upon It's this bleezure customer that many of the airlines are talking about and within that customer profile How are you going to continue to be able to see some of the incremental costs not just nickel and diamond people on baggage and things of that nature But where are you going to up the experience and hopefully bring down the fuel or the the prices for those fares It's going to be in the type of ticket somebody is purchasing and then what is the add-on to that experience as well And so it's not just the fare itself, but where else within that flying experience? Can you be able to make sure that we're increasing the value that we're giving customers? Yeah, you want a slight upgrade, but not full-first class, right? Yeah, no. It terms a cost. Bratz, I'm a thanks so much for that. We'll share some AT&T on moving higher and stronger subscriber growth help propel the company to a strong quarter. The wireless carrier added 964,000 subscribers in Q3. It's well above analyst estimates while wireless revenue rose 6.6 or 5.6 percent. That marked the biggest quarterly improvement for the company in more than a decade. AT&T also reiterating its free cash flow guidance for the year despite following short of analyst expectations in a quarter. You spoke with AT&T CFO earlier today.

3736," recovery and overall the financials were strong, right? Record EPS net income operating income, free revenue. But at the same time, we did say that the heat's coming out of the marketplace, that guidance that we gave at the beginning of the third quarter about what we thought volume would look like in the back half, we had to trim down because volume's cooling off a bit across a number of our markets. And so that was a lot of the conversation this morning. Yeah, talk to me a bit more about that, where you're seeing the pull back in volume, and where are the biggest, biggest headwinds for you right now. Yeah, it's mostly related to the consumer. So consumer oriented shipments on our railroad, that tends to be domestic intermodal, parcel, you know, a few things driven by the consumer. Those are looking like they're cooling off. The consumer has already been shifting from goods back to services, not all the way back. We recall there was a real fundamental shift towards goods during the pandemic. So it hasn't gone all the way back, but at the same time, it does appear that they're buying less. And you can see that in international intermodal boxes hitting the West Coast ports, and you can also see it in demand for truck and demand for domestic intermodal on our railroad. There are some markets though, where we're seeing strong demand, and it's not going away, it's like coal, some of the bulk commodities, grain, rock, and then a handful of our industrial segments as well. But the total picture says we're going to grow year over year in the fourth quarter. It's just not going to be as much as we thought it would. Last last time we spoke, we were talking about the labor agreements ongoing, and I saw the number here in your quarter, $140 million charge related to labor agreements. How comfortable are you with worthings stand right now on that front? Yeah, you know, I'm less comfortable than I was before the B&W E are maintenance of way employees failed ratification, but I'm not concerned. We've got six unions having ratified, we've got five in the ratification vote, and we've got more work to do now with the BMW EED. I think that vote failed to ratify for a very specific reason, the PEP, in addition to proposing wage levels, which are very attractive to our employees. They also said for about half, about 40% of that craft that does maintenance of way, we needed to adjust the travel that we would pay them to go from home to their away from home work location, and the paradigm we'd pay while they were working away from home. That negotiation happened on property, and it just closed up on UP about a week ago, a couple of weeks ago. And that was at the very tail end of the ratification vote for that contract. So I think those were connected. We're back out now working with the BMW to try to figure out a temporary agreement that can be or a tentative agreement that can be taken back out for ratification. I anticipate we're going to be able to do that. We've got status quo in place there. Other than that, we need to get through the ratification on these other five unions, and get this baby closed out by the end of the year. And I think that's still the probable outcome. So end of the year, still the timeline that you're looking at, despite some of the snacks that you've hit. Yeah, I am, you know, I guess the maintenance away employees could drag over into next year. I don't anticipate that. I think there's a path forward for us to get another tentative agreement, get it back out for vote. Lance, it's always great to have you on the show, Union Pacific CEO Lance Fritz, appreciate your time today. Thank you, Akiko. We're trying to this capital stepping up measures to stop the spread of COVID in Beijing once again. Let's bring in Yahoo Finance, Senior Health reporter, Angelie Kamalani. Angelie, it's interesting timing in all of this. Obviously, there's been a lot of focus on the party Congress. She's being sort of reiterating that he's not, zero COVID isn't going anywhere. And yet, there seems to be some rubblings about whether there could be a little loosening of the policy. There's also some discussion about what else can be done. We've seen some pushback, of course, in recent weeks that there have been some cases tied to quarantining and isolation that have resulted in negative results of 14-year-old, I believe, recently died after unclear whether or not she was taken to the center because she had COVID or was taken to the center.",https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TFE9bMjrlhU,21,2022-10-20 15:24:53
3737," Fulton negative results of 14-year-old, I believe, recently died after unclear whether or not she was taken to the center because she had COVID or was a COVID contact. So a lot of focus on the zero-COVID policy and what that means with ongoing lockdowns, residents really struggling to access food and medicine. And because of that slight up to 18 new locally transmitted cases in a day, a certain residential compounds have now been locked down again. And we've seen in recent days certain parts of the country going back into lockdown mode, we know right near the Apple Hub the other day. So a lot of mixed efforts and unclear whether or not it's actually doing anything to really pull back on the case rise because we've seen how even here, there still is a concern about rise in cases and these new transmissible variants are really going to make it hard for them to continue what has been now more than two years of this kind of lockdown. Yeah, so let's talk about what's happening here locally. I don't know, I walk out in here sitting, nobody's wearing a mask. No, they're not. Because the policy isn't there in place. Right. And we started to see the uptick in cases again. What is that saying? And that is the concern. So we've started to see a few cases, a few areas of Manhattan rising above that 20% positivity rate as an average for the last 70s. And that is a sign of more increase. We saw the same uptick in the other boroughs in the last couple of months. And so it does seem to be sort of creeping back with a rise in COVID cases, which is not unexpected. Now the thing to watch is those new Omicron variants, the BQ1, BQ1, one. That's where experts are really keeping in their eye as the BAPI have started to decline in its presence around the country. We've seen in the New York, general New York area, which the CDC includes with Puerto Rico and New Jersey has also seen an increase in those numbers for BQ1 and BQ1, 120% almost. And that's a little bit higher than the national average right now. So definitely something to keep an eye on. Also a good reminder to go out and get your booster. Yes. If you haven't already. I know you're saying that's off of that. All right, Angelique and Lonnie, thanks so much for that. Well coming up, short stay at number 10. Liz Tross Rosalind says UK Prime Minister is saying she cannot fulfill her man. And a new leadership election sets take place within a week. We're going to look at the market reaction to the chaos that is British politics. It's on the other side.",https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TFE9bMjrlhU,22,2022-10-20 15:29:20
3738," If you'd like one, click thumbs up by sharing, don't miss some of my video and ideas for upcoming videos. Yep. That's for sure.... Mr Speaker, I have been very clear that I am, that I am sorry and that I have made mistakes. But the right thing to do in those circumstances is to make changes which I have made and to get on with the job and deliver for the British people. I recognise though, given the situation, I cannot deliver the mandate on which I was elected by the Conservative Party. I have therefore spoken to his majesty the King to notify him that I am resigning as leader of the Conservative Party. What a difference a day makes. Just yesterday outgoing UK Prime Minister Liz Truss pledged to battle on defending herself in that brutal session you just saw in the House of Commons today that pressure simply became too much for her. Her resignation coming after an embarrassing budget, U-turn and high profile cabinet departures, she becomes by the way the shortest serving Prime Minister in UK history, just 44 days. A leadership contest will now take place in the next week. A general election is not scheduled for another two and a half years but it could of course come sooner. So what's the market saying about all of this? Let's bring in Yahoo finances, Jared Blyckery. And Jared Blyckery was just saying you're surprised that the market reaction wasn't more significant. I guess you could argue the expectation had been building for some time. It seems that way. And you know, they're all jokes aside. You got the head of lettuce and everything else, the head of state. Let's put that aside. I need to explain that one a bit. No, no, everybody's saying that. The British pound, okay. So the British pound has gained 6.10% on the US dollar. I would say we saw some fireworks but these were just sparklers here. You compare this to some of the volatility that we've seen over the last few months. With all due respect to a lot of the serious plans that Truss had and bringing in some of those fiscal reforms, the worst time to do the most difficult challenging time to do those is during a time when you see incredible people in the global markets. We simply don't have the liquidity to have spillover effects when these changes are large. So here's a British pound versus US dollar over the last three months. Let me just put a line chart here so you can see it a little bit better. Now we can see this is pretty close to one. You take a look at the max chart in the global financial crisis. A pound was trading at two per dollar. So much stronger. It's been cut in half since then. And this by the way is, I believe, a record low down here. But this has spilled over into their rates market. So the whole deal with her cutting taxes was you had over leverage positions in the rates market, not seated. Nobody saw that coming. And the central bank there, the Bank of England had to ring fence the entire pension system, bail them out. And that worked temporarily. But that destroys the notion that there can be these kinds of massive fiscal reforms in the face of this global financial situation that we find ourselves. So I can put a heat map of the US dollar here. Some of these are going to be inverse to the pairs that you're used to seeing here. But today only the dollar is only stronger versus the Argentine peso. And then if we take a look at a year to day chart, you can really see some of the outsized move. If you were a",https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TFE9bMjrlhU,23,2022-10-20 15:33:48

You have the Turkish Lair. Then you have the Yan Akiko. We've been talking about that recently, not necessarily today, but to finish off the top line here, we have Norway, we have Sweden, we have the British pound. All of this portans, potentially future consternation and volatility in the rates markets, which we know can spill over into our own risk markets, aka stocks here at Kiko.

3740," actually not making enough pre-tax profit to meet their interest payments or their debt payments. So it's just a matter of time before they either have to take on some very expensive additional financing if they can find it or they go bankrupt. So to what extent have we seen the number of those zombie stocks accelerate as you see, as you point out, as we've seen the Fed's tightening cycle? Yeah, I mean, I think, you know, for a while, there was no such thing as a zombie stock when there was effectively an infinite amount of liquidity out there. I mean, companies were getting funded for really no business plan at all. They could just lose money into perpetuity. And as the Fed has pivoted and decided they're no longer going to sort of continually inflate the economy that they actually need to take some air out, well, the limit to the funding available has created, you know, we think we see at least 300 zombie stocks out there in the market. And we've highlighted up to this point a list of 19 that we think are in the most imminent danger. And yeah, that number's going to only get larger, right? Because the cutoff point is 24 years of cash to sustain the cash burn. And, you know, as each month that passes, there are sort of more stocks that are coming on the list. So let's highlight those 19 that you've honed in on. A lot of familiar names, Snap, Rivian, AMC, GameStop, among others. Who's in the most dire position as far as you see it? Well, some of the ones we put on there first, like Carvana, you know, FreshPet was on the list. We took it off once the activists came in because that was basically about to go under. Snap is a good one, Robin Hood is a good one. You know, these are businesses that really aren't making any money and really have no no real potential to make money and their valuations are still really expensive as well. So it's it's almost hard to say which one is worse because none of the business models in our opinion are viable. And, you know, Peloton's another one. You know, we see, we know shortly after we wrote our zombie stock report on Peloton, the CEO and effectively came out and agreed. It is a zombie stock and they got six months to prove that they're not going to go break bankrupt. So the, you know, those are some of the highlights, but none of them are good businesses at the end of the day. And that's the sad part here is that they probably should have never gone public. And they should never have been allowed to take as much shareholder capital as they did. David, there's one name that you flag that's getting a lot of attention today and that is, of course, Tesla. I mean, you point out that you think the cash flow expectations baked into the stock price are unreasonably optimistic. A bit of a mixed message coming from Elon Musk yesterday about where that demand picture looks like moving forward. He also sort of dangled that buyback of five to ten billion dollars in there for next year. What do you see in terms of where the stock could go? You know, how much lower and do you, is this defined as one of those zombie stocks? Well, the only reason it's not a zombie stock is because Musk has raised so much money that they've got a lot of cash on hand to sustain a burden for a long time. Now, the real question for us, though, is for how long can Musk sustain the super high expectations? And look, I mean, mixed messaging, Musk is the king of mis-messaging, right? I mean, that's part of why he's not been hauled into court more often because he says, oh, yeah, we're going to have full self-driving my next year and maybe probably, you know, or if not next year, the next six months of all, you know, he's kind of constantly dithering, never making really matter of fact statements. And that's what allows his legal team to go to the regulators and say, well, yeah, he said this here, but he said something else here. It's all a bunch of God will you, right? Unfortunately, too many investors still really pay a lot of heed to it. But I feel like the tightest beginning to turn, more and more folks are sort of starting to see, hey, there's been a lot of promises made and not a lot delivered. And some of these stunts are beginning to be seen for what they are as stunts. And so, you know, this whole Twitter deal is one that's really got a lot of people scratching their head, you know, if Tesla's such a great company, then why are you spending so many billions of dollars to buy something that isn't so great? How does that fit into the bigger plan? How are you focused on making sure Tesla doesn't continue to sustain serious market share losses?

Now that the incumbent automakers are ramping up production, Tesla had success when there was no competition and they are not having any success. They're losing market share as the competition is coming online and that competition is set to ramp up huge. So it's going to be really difficult to make a straight face argument on the merits of the underlying business of Tesla. And I think that's why Musk spent so much time talking about periphery items because he really wants to distract people from the core issues. Well also interesting to hear Elon Musk you know address the Twitter issue head on on an earnings call for Tesla which probably points to how jittery some investors are.

Well it's too soon to tell what this means for Democrats and Republicans going into the midterms the findings underscore Latinos collect of hold on the American swing vote. And by the way if you're counting we're just over two weeks out from the midterms. Well President Biden is attempting to put downward pressure on gas prices with the decision to release more oil from the nation's strategic petroleum reserve. There's another move though the president is buying that could be even more important for all the details let's bring in Yahoo finances Rick Newman and Rick. Whatever you release you have to buy back right and we've started to hear some details about how the administration is looking at this especially considering how low the reserves are. Right this is not getting very much attention but it's but it's something new and I think it's something important so what the Biden White House said this week is that when they do start to refill the reserve which they're going to have to do the government has always what after it dries down it does replace those barrels and what it normally does is it waits for oil prices to come down and it just buys them at the market price when prices are low. What Biden says they're going to do differently is they're actually going to sign contracts with oil producers to buy oil in the future and this could be one two three years in the future at prices that are between $67 and $72 so let's call it $70 as a as a rounding number and that number seems they seem to have settled on that number because just about every producer in the United States can sell oil profitably at around $70 so what Biden is trying to do here is he's trying to give producers more incentive to add capacity today because they know that in the future they will have one big purchaser willing to pay whatever the contract and price is so if they start writing these contracts let's say the price is $70 so oil producers adding capacity today don't have to worry what if prices fall down to 50 and suddenly we've added capacity and we can't make a profit on that they will have this one very large buyer in the United States government that will be willing to buy oil from them at a price they can make a profit at so the idea is to increase oil production today and in the near term to keep prices down which is in a way kind of a backdoor subsidy to the oil industry. Yeah curious to see how big oil responds especially given just how contentious things have been between the administration and some of those companies Rick Newman as always thank you so much for that.

3742," vs FEveryone Survival GDPand remainder are sales still involving our support we're concerned some working hardstyle will us at last two metrics with tight supply. Those buyers that got in at lower rates or owners that were able to refinance, now unlikely to sell or buy a new home with current mortgage rates. Let's bring in Daniel Hell. She is realtorad.com's chief economist. Daniel, we're not looking at eight straight months of declines in terms of existing home sales. How much worse do you think things get from here? A lot depends on what happens with the Fed and with mortgage rates going forward. So mortgage rates are one of the major challenges that home shoppers in today's market are facing as they climb. They're up very close to 7% haven't quite crossed that threshold yet according to Freddie Maxx data out today, but very close to the highest levels in two decades. At the same time, home prices are high and continue to rise and that one to punch a higher prices and higher mortgage rates make it very difficult for home shoppers in today's market to find a home that fits their needs and still also is affordable within their budget because budgets are under incredible pressure right now because of the inflation that is happening economy wide. So it's home shoppers today aren't a tough spot. Yeah, I mean, you just sort of crunch the numbers and it's easy to see where the slow down is. You're looking at a 30 or fixed mortgage at what roughly 7% sometimes a little higher, sometimes a little lower. So the mortgage rates or the monthly mortgage payment is more expensive. At the same time, I've seen a lot of price cuts for homes that are listed right now and I wonder what you're seeing on the seller side of things. How much pullback are you seeing there? Those who are saying, look, I can actually make more money renting out my property than trying to sell it when you consider where the buyers are. Yeah, I think that's an excellent point. So if you look at the total number of homes that are on the market, those are compared to a year ago and that's because we've had buyers pullback a little bit, homes are taking longer to sell as you mentioned and it's difficult for buyers to navigate this market. When you think about what sellers are doing, we look at newly listed homes and those are actually down on a year-over-year basis and that's because sellers who have other options who don't need to sell right now are exploring other options either choosing to state put, maybe remodeling if they need to state put and change these their house or renting their homes out as you mentioned. So sellers or homeowners in today's environment are aware of the fact that the housing market is challenging for buyers and aren't choosing to list at the same pace as they have in health care for backup. Yeah got puddle. And that's in auto is true now. So we haven't levered",https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TFE9bMjrlhU,27,2022-10-20 15:51:27
3743," Sellers or homeowners in today's environment are aware of the fact that the housing market is challenging for buyers and aren't choosing to list at the same pace as they have in previous years staying put instead. That's keeping home prices relatively elevated because even though we have more homes for sale, we still have fewer homes for sale than most normal in the market before the pandemic. And so we have more balance than you would expect given how much of a pullback and demand we've seen in the housing market. Really quickly, Daniel, the Fed doesn't show, hasn't shown any indication they're planning to slow down the tightening soon given where inflation is right now. So when you consider that being the driving factor we find behind this housing slowdown, how much longer do you think this last minute? Are there parallels to draw from previous market pullbacks? Yeah, I think we are going to see more trades continue to climb until inflation is back under control. So it's more about what happens to inflation, what's driving the Fed to raise rates than the Fed's actual policy decisions. Once we see inflation start to move back convincingly toward that 2% target that the Fed is aiming for, then I think we'll see more good rate steady, maybe even start to decline in anticipation on the Fed's eventual pullback and monetary policy, but that could not that could take until the end of next year to happen. So I think we're in for a challenging year ahead for the housing market realtor.com chief economist Danielle Hill appreciate your time this morning. Well, Uber is now stirring up rides, foods and now adds the right sharing company unveiling advertising options that will target riders at every point during their use of the app. That could raise eyebrows and uncomfortable questions about location and privacy. Let's bring in Dan Haley who's on top of the story. Daniel, we've sort of come become accustomed to having every part of our lives tracks, whether it's an Amazon purchase or anything else. How is this different in terms of approach? Yeah, I think you touched on it right away. Keiko is the idea that this is going to be tracking where you are and where you're going. And so the idea is that, you know, if you have a destination in mind, an airport, a specific type of store, Uber would be able to serve up ads related to those destinations. Now, obviously there's issues there that consumers and users may be uncomfortable with. Obviously with the fall of Roe v Wade, there's questions about whether or not issues of reproductive rights or reproductive locations would come into question. If you're going to plan parenthood, for instance, if Uber would have that data, and then if it would sell that data, parts of this would appear in the app. You could see it from the start of the ride when you order to your actual ride and then towards the end. And I think one of the things to take into account is Uber says that they won't be selling individual data, but it will be aggregate. But as with any kind of online data, once your information is out there, it can then be put together via other data that data brokers use to create kind of a profile about you in particular. Something that other companies have warned about in the past, particularly Apple. So it'll be interesting to see how Uber rolls this out and then what kind of reaction they get from actual Uber riders. I know I already see some ads, but they're not based on my location or destination. It's more data being collected on our lives. Dan Halley. Thanks so much for that.

They object to the idea that the president is using the 2003 Heroes Act, an act that was passed to give relief economic relief to military families who were serving in Afghanistan in Iraq, simultaneously some of them. So this objection is really based on that what law was for a different purpose. This group goes on to say in their application to the Supreme Court that if the program goes forward as planned on Sunday, then the president will unilaterally spend roughly 4% of the nation's GDP in 2021 that was approximately $23 trillion estimates go as far as saying this program will cost taxpayers a trillion or more dollars. Now the big problem though, they're going to have is the problem that all of the parties that have challenged this law have had and that is standing and that means there has to be a particularized interest in the case, meaning they will be harmed in a way that others aren't. That's a really hard argument to make when you're talking about taxpayers because that's all of the taxpayers, right? They don't have a specific enough interest in an injury that they would suffer if this law and if this relief were to go through. Okay, so it's just important to know this is kind of the first step, but a little skeptical about how much they'll actually be able to get in front of the Supreme Court. We'll do that. We'll succeed. I know you'll see on top of it. We will. We'll like to scheme and thanks so much for that. Let's do a final check of the markets before we let you go. We're seeing all three major indices still in the green holding on to their gains with a doubt up to 258 points. That does it for me in this hour. We've got much more to come here and Yachtel Finance live. Keep it right here. All right.",https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TFE9bMjrlhU,29,2022-10-20 15:59:48
3745," constantly lose hope...... The most shares are on the move after the company beat earnings and revenue estimates in the latest quarter. The higher prices offset lower demand for its products. I have the chance to speak with CEO John Mueller about the quarter. Take a listen. Strong core business. I mean, very strong top line growth. Organic sales up 7% growth in 10 out of 10 categories in almost every market. And we're dealing with the significant headwinds from the combination of commodities, foreign exchange, transportation, and warehouse. That had a 32% impact negative on earnings in the quarter. We offset 30 of those 32 points through the combination of strong top line growth and a very strong productivity focus. So I think it speaks to a very healthy business that has bright prospects going forward. Johnny, surprise a little bit by the resilience of your categories. You did push through price increases. Prices were up at each segment, but volume did not fall off cliff. That's exactly right. If you take Russia out of the equation, volume was essentially flat versus year ago. So we've held volume with what is effectively 9% price increases. The consumer is resilient. We see that also in the mix component of top line growth with mix up a point in addition to the price increases. But we're working hard, Brian, to communicate the value that our products offer in a time of stretched household budgets. If you use Cascade Platinum in an ever-star rated dishwasher, for example, you can save $130 a year on your energy bill and save 140 gallons of water per week. So helping consumers understand those benefits has enabled us to be a positive value for us in their lives. I was joking with the I will find it's team John, dawn without a cap. That is innovation. And that is stuff you pay more for. I have done so. So what other, as you look towards next year, take us through that product innovation road map. What brands are you really keen in on and what might innovation look like last year? Because as to your point, that innovation will help you push through higher prices. Again, you're absolutely right. But value is not just price. Value is found in the intersection of price, performance, and usage experience, which is what you're speaking to with the product that you've bought. And thank you for doing that. And we're bringing innovation to market across the categories, across markets. Our intent is to build our business by growing markets and not by taking business from competition. And to grow markets, you need to innovate. And so from a spending standpoint, also on innovation, we're stepping forward, not back. It's crucial that we do that in addition to.",https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TFE9bMjrlhU,30,2022-10-20 16:04:03
3746," our gets you need to innovate. And so from a spending standpoint, also on innovation, we're stepping forward, not back. It's crucial that we do that, in addition to the smart communication, et cetera, and meeting consumers where they are and having price points and value propositions that are relevant for them. How does the messaging to consumers likely to change in coming months? How do you communicate this value? And when they walk into a target store, a Walmart store, there's a lot of choices out there, and the prices are up. Are you expecting more advertising spend? Do you change the messaging at all? We move a little bit towards what we refer to as performance-based value messaging. So I gave you an example with automatic diswashing detergent. Another example is tide cold water. If you use tide cold water in cold water, so you turn the dial on your washing machine to cold, you receive better cleaning performance than the next best brand in warm water. And you save all that money in heating the water, essentially paying for the detergent itself. So another example is on Charmin, where we have advertising that talks about roll it back. Meaning you don't need to pull as much off the roll. Sometimes you do, John. Sometimes you do. I'm just going to put that out there. I said, I go there. But in terms of the markets, look, the volume did come down in all the businesses except grooming. And I guess that's the consumer. Be a little more cautious on pricing and giving everything they're dealing with in their economic and circumstances. But anything in these numbers that would suggest, we're going into a recession here in the US the next six months. Not necessarily. I don't know how to answer that question definitively, because as you're well aware, there are lots of variables that go into that. But if we look at consumer sentiment, and one measure of that is trade down to private label brands, we're seeing very little movement. So in North America, past three in six months, private label brands increased share by only 30 basis points on a 12 month basis. They're flat, same general situation in Europe. So purely from a consumer demand and willingness to spend standpoint, we wouldn't predict a recession. But again, I'm not saying there's not going to be a recession. There are many things that go into that. These currency swings are wild, John. In many respects, I haven't seen them in my career, and I'm about almost 20 years into this gig. Because of this FX volatility, do you have to raise prices even more to offset that? Really, for currency, we're focused on productivity offsets. And we had huge productivity gains in the quarter. And that's because most of our competition is internationally domiciled, think of L'Oreal, Hankel, Byerstorf, Unilever. And they don't see that negative impact from the dollar strength. So we have to find other ways to offset it, which we are. Lastly, John, I believe you're coming up on your one-year mark officially as CEO of PNG. If you look back, what is your biggest lesson that you've learned over these past 12 months? The power of people and what our organization has been able to accomplish in very challenging time is whether it's with a war, a pandemic, the highest inflation in 40 years, they're delivering. And they're focused on continuing to serve our consumers, our customers, each other, society, and shareholders.",https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TFE9bMjrlhU,31,2022-10-20 16:08:16
3747," you you you you my dream is to clear to third quarter, 2021. And frankly, for the first couple of weeks in October, we've seen that same 10% increase. Now, when you think about that spending, think about two things. One, it is still very strong at a relative basis. Even the transactions are up 6% outpaces inflation. Travel being a very growing part because coming from last year, when we had the Delta of COVID, you know, variant to this year, people are traveling. But on top of that, though, be mindful that early in the year, there's probably more like a 13%, 14% to 12% to 10%. So it's being mitigated. So I think the Fed's changes in rates, the concerns about going out there, people are slowing down a bit, but not slowing down consistent with a real slowdown in economy yet. And that's the good news. Brian, that's interesting that you're calling out 10% growth through October. And I just talked to Proctor and Gamble CEO after their earnings. They're talking about a resilient consumer. Are you surprised by the resilience we're seeing in U.S. consumers here? Well, we talked in our earnings materials about resilient consumer, frankly. And you think about that long, two or three dimensions. First is the unemployment, obviously, still very low. People working. Second is, do they have money in their bank accounts? And the money in the bank accounts of our consumers, our 35 million core households at Bank of America. At the end of September was the same as it was at the end of August. And in fact, it's multiples, multiples over where it was before the pandemic, especially for those consumers who are in the... $100,000 under income bracket. That means that they haven't spent down the stimulus and stuff. And when I say multiples, I give you an example. Consumer had about an average of $3,500 in account, pre-pandemic, now has 13,000 in account. And it's not going down, so that's good news. So one, they have money in accounts. Two, they're spending. Three, they are employed. Four, they have capacitive borrow. Our credit card borrowings are still about 12% below where they were pre-pandemic. Home equity line draws are down about 25%, 30% still. Now mortgage finance is slowed down, because rates went up, but the people have home equity lines in place or have capacitive borrow the house by...",https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TFE9bMjrlhU,32,2022-10-20 16:12:36
3748," We're down about 25, 30 percent still. Now mortgage finances slow down because rates went up, but the people have home equity lines in place or have capacitive bar, the house values are still strong. So all that bodes well. Now inflation hurts consumers, especially consumers in modern income because inflation and goods and services they spend a lot of their income on. But, you know, so we have to be careful about the overall position versus certain types of consumers. But generally, the American consumer is very resilient. Brian, a lot of your peers on the street over the past few weeks have come out and warned about a recession sometime over the next six months. So of course, that brings us into 2023. Where does Brian want to hit? Well, I don't make those projections. I have this talented research team, one of the best in the world. If not the best in the world run by Candace Browning, Platinum team. And they basically been consistent. They have this quarter, meaning past quarter, third quarter, 22 growing. Then they have the fourth quarter, the first quarter, the second quarter, the third quarter, all, and negative territories around, half percent, one to one and a half percent. So a slight shallow down, or trend, and then growing at the end of next year. They have pushed that projection for recession out a little bit into 23. But their core belief, it's a mild recession. It's coupled with unemployment. It gets up to, you know, four to half to 5%. A Fed funds rate, likewise around 5%. But inflation does get under control and we come out of that recession. That's the core projection. Now against that though, the real facts are today, the consumers are spending commercial credits and great shape, consumer credits and gate shape. Even though things like housing and stuff like that have flattened out because that's the way the Fed slows down the economy. The reality is the consumers still are employed in earning money. And so the Fed's toughest job and inflation is also the best thing about the US economy, which is a strong consumer. So our team predicts a recession, a mild recession. They've had that projection, frankly, for six months ago, they had the same projection more or less. It just pushed out a little bit. But what we're not seeing is it come to four yet. And that keeps moving it out because of that resiliency and the consumer. By all indications, Brian, the Federal Reserve is going to continue to move higher with rates over the course of its next few meetings. What does that mean for your net interest margins over the next couple quarters? Well, one of the things that people know about banking is a core way we make a half our money or more is through what they call a spread. I hear the difference between what we lend a customer money and what we pay on the deposits and the money customers give us where we can borrow in the market. And that margin had been compressed dramatically as rates fell. And so it expands back out, getting to a more normal level, which it usually is. And that has shown a rapid increase in net interest income and II improvement over the last year. As you look forward, we told our shareholders earlier this week that we'd expect another billion dollars plus increase from the third quarter to the fourth quarter. But that's driven by the great core deposit franchise we have. We have a lot of zero interest checking balances, which are transaction accounts, which money flows for all time. That will stay in zero interest no matter what the rate environment. And the rest of our deposit rates move up and along rates move up and we get back to the 2.5% spread that we have typically made a balance sheet. This is really the basic structure banking to get back to margin in those ranges as opposed to a depressed margin under 2%. We've had the last few quarters. Want to give your team a shout out here, Brian? Global markets business, up 30% in the quarter. Strongest since the third quarter of 2010, but no trading lost days in the quarter. Despite all the market volatility we've seen, how does that happen? And do you think that can continue and just be sustained over the next few quarters? Well, it happens because we have a talent team in Jimmy D'Amara that runs a business force that has been running major parts of business for a long time, took over the whole business last year and we went on, on tag, retired. And so it's a great business. It's a team that works for Jimmy's very solid, but it also comes from a decade-long focus on responsible growth. We're in a business to move and risk through the system. We're in a business of managing risk. We're in a business of helping customers achieve what they want and not taking big principal risk. And therefore, evil and market volatility team did a good job and we didn't lose money on a trading day. But by the way, if you look back across the last 10, 12 years, very rarely do we lose money.",https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TFE9bMjrlhU,33,2022-10-20 16:17:09
3749," risk and therefore, even with Mark of all tilde team did a good job when we didn't lose money on a trading day But by the way, if you look back across the last 10-12 years very rarely do we lose money? Maybe a couple of trading days of quarter when something really changes dramatically But this year what we saw is from last year to this year the investments we've made in the last couple years in the business in terms of talent, technology, even more capital, more balance sheet capacity has shown up and that our team has a consistent drive to it and a gym and a team did a great job this quarter and we expect them to do more next quarter and lots there to unpack from Bank America CEO Brian Moynihan Mikey take it away was that ox sales in October consumer spending in October up 10% so still running at double digits despite what we're seeing with inflation and the economy's going down they had a lot of new credit card accounts that they added on during the quarter as well they got into this a little bit more on the earnings call 1.3 million new credit card accounts and you know I love talking about this shift right now that we're seeing in how consumers are spending because it's so important especially as households are really looking through where their spending capacity is that's why it was diving into retail earlier on because going into this holiday season it's just going to be a huge question of how consumers are spending where they are trying to figure out okay are we in a recession are we going into a recession and what do I need to do now preemptively to prepare for that too? Well if unemployment is going to 5% at some time in late 2023 2024 they still have some time to save, to spend, to look at guess before that happens. They have this quarter meaning past quarter third quarter 22 growing then they have the fourth quarter the first quarter the second quarter the third quarter all and negative territories around half percent one to one and a half percent so a slight shallow down and we're trending and growing at the end of next year they have pushed that projection for recession out a little bit into 23 but their core belief it's a mild recession. That was Bank of America CEO Brian Moynihan speaking with our very own Brian Saasie this morning the investment bank beat the results or beat the street we should say with results on Monday benefiting in part from higher rates. Well policy tightening has been the story of 2022 along with sky high inflation both of these factors a lethal combination for stocks and therefore not exactly fertile ground for IPOs either fewer companies are looking to navigate a listing in this environment because of the high volatility and low investor appetite in part to poor returns from last year's new issues.",https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TFE9bMjrlhU,34,2022-10-20 16:21:33
3750," I'm for IPOs either. Fewer companies are looking to navigate a listing in this environment because of the high volatility and low investor appetite in part to poor returns from last year's new issues. Here to break it all down to see how this is all playing out in the IPO slowdown. We've got SMT Global's senior writer, Brian Shied. Good to talk to you today. I guess the question here is, are we starting to see a turn? Because we have seen the big, big dip in activity. We're now in October. Are things starting to look up? So thanks for having me out at Kiko. I really appreciate it. But if we're looking at 2022 compared to 2021, 2021 was really this record setting breakout year for IPOs. You know, according to S&P Global Market Intelligence data, there were more than 3,250 IPOs in 2021. In 2022, we're on track for about half that. And that's thinking that things are going to sort of keep at the same pace, which I think most people are thinking there's going to be an additional downturn. So in the US, we're on track to about half about 1-6th as many IPOs in 2022. And it's safe to say really that all momentum from that breakout year has been lost. You know, just a little more perspective on this, you know, for the first three quarters of this year's, the IPOs worldwide raised about 144 billion. Now that's 68 billion less than what was raised in the first quarter of 2021 alone. IPO activity really has slowed down to a crawl in 2022. And I'm not sure that it gets much better from here. We have heard over and over, especially with some of these highly valued tech startups that the cops are tough when trying to come to market. They have slashed valuations. Yesterday, we saw Intel looking at a lower valuation for their IPO for mobile I. I mean, how many companies you think are willing to come to market in this environment, even with a lower valuation? So obviously, each company is very different. But you look at sort of the overwhelming factor that companies, you know, they just don't think that they can raise that much cash right now through an IPO in 2022. You know, whether or not they can take that lower valuation, I think is anyone's guess. I think right now, they'll probably wait it out a little bit longer. If you look at the biggest US IPO as of 2022, we were looking at, you know, core bridge financial, that retirement and insurance company, they raised nearly 1.7 billion last month, TPG and asset management company, raised about 1.1 billion back in January. Those are really the only billion dollar US IPO's. That's it. So you compare that to last year, you know, you had Rivian, the electric vehicle maker. They raised 11.9 billion, almost $12 billion, lucid motors, EV company raising $4.6 billion. We're just not seeing anything on that scale in 2022. And with all of the different factors that play right now, you know, Fed rate, Higgs volatility, recession fears, like it was discussed, I just don't see that number jumping that much in the fourth quarter. And we're going to have, you know, this severe downturn we're seeing in 2022 and compared to last year. And that's most likely just going to continue. So what do you think is the catalyst that could turn things around? I've heard you say over and over that you don't think things are going to turn at least in the short to medium term. What are you going to be looking for that says that maybe companies are ready to come to market again? Is it about the Fed policy? You're seeing the tightening cycle, you know, wrapping up? Or I mean, what exactly is it that companies are going to be looking for? I mean, there's all these different factors, right? You have, like I said, heightened volatility, the war in Ukraine, inflation hitting levels, we haven't seen since the early 1980s. But you did mention this. So one big thing, Fed rate hikes. That's boosted borrowing costs sort of across the board for these companies. The Fed has boosted its benchmark rate by 300 basis points since March after having this, you know, ultra low, near zero rate policy for since the beginning of the pandemic. And that really fueled that IPO growth, that record breaking growth in IPOs. We saw in 2021. Now the futures market expecting another 75 basis point hike at their meeting in November, the Fed could hike, you know, I think the expectation is almost to five percent.",https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TFE9bMjrlhU,35,2022-10-20 16:25:43
3751," Now, the futures market expecting another 75 basis point hike at their meeting in November. The Fed could hike. I think the expectation is almost to 5%, so that ramp up from 0 to 5%, but by early 2023, I think at that point, you need to see some sort of Fed pivot. And I think most people, the market, you see these jump starts going on in the stock market right now. And that's sort of this hope that becomes false hope that the Fed is pivoting. And until you see a very clear sign that that Fed pivot is happening, I don't think that you're going to have much of a turnaround in this IPO and buyer. Okay, expect a little more quiet to come here. S&P Global Senior Ryder Rineshide. Get to have you on today. Well, Netflix share seeing a boost after beating estimates for the third quarter. The streaming giant saw rise and subscriber growth once again. It's now expected to add another 4.5 million subscribers in the fourth quarter. But streaming isn't the only thing on Netflix's mind as it looks to also expand into cloud gaming. Joining us now with more on Netflix's journey ahead is Gita Ranganathan, Bloomberg Intelligence Senior Media Analyst. We've also got Dave Hedger, he is Edward Jones, Senior Equity Analysts. Welcome to both of you today. Gita, let me start with you. I mean, certainly we have seen a big rally in the stock, although you could argue it's fallen so much. Expectations were pretty low coming in. They did beat on the sub numbers. What else stood out to you? Yeah, so I think definitely the one thing that stood out is that this company is clearly back on track. I mean, of course, the 3Q numbers were definitely much stronger than expected. But I think what was equally reassuring and encouraging is the 4Q guidance came in slightly higher than consensus. And remember, this was not even factoring in a huge catalyst that they have on the horizon, which is the debut of their new ad supported tier. They're going to be pricing. This is at a really aggressive $7 price point, historically, the lowest price that Netflix has ever come out with. So it should kind of open up a whole new market for them. They're reinforcing some of their financial metrics in terms of free cash flow as well as profit margins. Yeah, indeed, to that point, the company making it pretty clear they ad supported tier are not really going to be a material impact at least in this quarter because it's being introduced a little later. But I want to point to one thing that has really stood out here, and that's the FX headwinds highlighted many times.",https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TFE9bMjrlhU,36,2022-10-20 16:30:06
3752," It's not really going to be a material impact at least in this quarter because it's being introduced a little later. But I want to point to one thing that has really stood out here and that's the FX had wins highlighted many times in this report, the sequential decline in revenue. They say it's entirely because of FX. Looking through the numbers here, they estimate full your appreciation of the dollar will negatively affect full your revenue operating income by one billion roughly each. So how does the company adjust for that? Is there anything they can do in terms of the pricing or the cost structure that will allow them to have a bit more of a buffer with the dollar expected to be strong for longer? Well, I assume they can try to adjust pricing in international markets they count for the foreign exchange pressure. However, that's a fine tight rope to be walking just in terms of you don't want to increase price too much and in turn affect subscriber growth. We do think that the ad supported service should help drive subscriber growth in international markets. So I think the lower price point will be attractive in certain markets overseas. There's more ability to pay at that lower price point. So that may be where Netflix can find some balance and certainly the revenue from the advertised and could offset the lower price point and in turn also help offset some foreign exchange pressure. Gita, as you pointed out, the company highlighting that we are back on the path to reaccelerate growth. Certainly the ad tier is something a lot of analysts have been looking to, but at the end of the day, it is a content company. And they've sort of highlighted that even as the past few quarters have not been as strong in terms of their sub numbers, engagement has still been high compared to other streaming competitors. What's that next catalyst, you think, when you look at the content pipeline for this company that could push it even higher? I think we've now seen really the steady cadence of content titles. We were kind of hit by that whole COVID log jam and they did say that that's going to take a little bit of time to kind of unwind, but we've seen them deliver consistent hits obviously. Some of their biggest hitting titles being stranger things, but then they've had a lot of newer shows that have also performed really, really well. The Jeffrey Darmarshow being a great example of that. And we're seeing them kind of hold their content budget steady, but remember, we are seeing a lot of the other streamers. A lot of the competition is also dialing back on their content spend. I think that's a really important point because maybe we're going to see some of those competitive pressures ease up a little bit as some of these streamers start to understand that profitability is becoming more and more important. And I think that really gives Netflix a leg up, as they try and get more and more bang for their buck. And this is exactly what they spoke to. They said they're getting more impact for every dollar of content spend. And we're seeing that with some of the engagement metrics that they posted. The other point that I want to make here is that with some of those engagement metrics, you come out with an advertising product. I mean, this is really so attractive to advertisers knowing that they have that deep engagement, knowing that they have a captive audience, which is on their platform for about two to and a half hours every day. Advertisers are going to be willing to pay up. And they finally is the company looks to see, looks for other levers to drive revenue. We got some news from the VP of gaming there saying that Netflix is now looking at cloud gaming as a potential. We're also going to have a cloud or gaming segment within their Southern California headquarters there or their offices there. I mean, this is a very crowded space. This would be sort of a new venture for Netflix. They've been talking about it for some time. Is this something that you think Netflix can compete in just given the players that are already in the space? Certainly, the gaming space is a challenging market and a lot of competition in that market. We view that as something that might be incremental for Netflix and in particular may not drive a lot of subscriber growth, but perhaps could help in terms of subscriber retention. I think one of the challenges.",https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TFE9bMjrlhU,37,2022-10-20 16:34:20
3753," And in particular, it may not drive a lot of subscriber growth, but perhaps could help in terms of subscriber retention. That's I think one of the challenges when the content schedule is a little more uneven that when there's that content that people are urgently wanting to watch, that's where you see turn, tick up, and people cut off their service for a while, where gaming could be another way of keeping subscribers engaged and holding on to their subscription, even when it's a time period that one of their favorite shows has already debuted and they've already watched those episodes. It is about continuing to make the platform sticky with so many of these streaming companies. Appreciate your time to both of you, Gita Ranganathan, Bloomberg Intelligence, senior media analyst, and Dave Hagar, who's used Edward Jones, senior equity analyst. Absolutely. I could go on that point of the baby formula, really weighing on their nutrition line of business down 10%, and then the COVID testing still pretty a decent demand, even though a reduction from the last quarter, the company noting that there are many global trends that are weighing, including COVID, including inflation, strong dollar, but all in all, they seem to be remaining optimistic about specifically the baby formula shortage and that sort of getting over as they reopen the planned last quarter. So that's where things stand right now. Okay, let's take a deeper dive into Abbott's numbers here with Shugun Singh, he's medical devices analyst at RBC, capital markets, joining us today. Shugun, I'm looking at where the stock is trading right now, certainly down despite some of those results. I'm imagining you've got an outperform with the price target of $132 a share, so you certainly feel like there's more upside. What do you think investors are getting wrong? No, thank you so much, firstly, for having us here. I do like the stock, we think the company does have a pretty solid long-term financial profile of growth in the high single digits on the top line and double digit EPS growth on the bottom line. If we just look at Q3 numbers, the quarter was actually pretty strong. They did beat by 700 million on the top line in about 20 cents on EPS.",https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TFE9bMjrlhU,38,2022-10-20 16:38:52
3754," to look at the Q3 numbers. The quarter was actually pretty strong. They did beat by 700 million on the top line and about 20 cents on EPS. COVID-19 testing was definitely what drove the results came in at about $1.7 billion. Consensus was looking at about 540 million in sales. So really impressive despite the summer months. If you look at a full year guidance at this point, it's 7.8 billion in COVID-19 sales, which is actually ahead of what they did last year. So pretty solid revenues in terms of COVID-19. I think what the sticking point here really is the mid-single to high-single digit underlying growth. So there were factors that impacted the quarter, such as COVID, if you back out COVID-19 testing, an infant formula recall, there was also medical device supply issues that impacted the company. So if you back out all those one-time items on an underlying basis, the company delivered about mid-single to high-single digit underlying growth, which is slightly below the longer term outlook of high-single digits. But I think it's more of a reflection of Q3, which is seasonally a weaker quarter, and then the COVID-19 environment, whether recovery is occurring, but it is at a much slower pace than what we would have liked in a normal environment. Shagun, Angelie here. I want to look at some of the very specific details that they let us know about today, one being the new plant for baby formula production. And then also looking at the library tests and looking at also models that are pretty different when it comes to direct consumer and subscription models. I know there was mention of that. I wonder if I think this all plays for a company that says, large as it is, that has had quite a diverse market so far. Yeah, I think both on infant formula recall, I think it's a good step that they are planning to, they have made some leadership changes at the Michigan facility, and they're planning to move forward with plans about half a billion dollar in investments in a new U.S. nutrition facility for specialty and metabolic infant formulas. I think there is upside on diabetes as well. And honestly, if you just take a step back and look at the company, I do like the diversified portfolio that the company has. They are continuing to move forward within medical devices. Again, nutrition business, I think they did lost about 20 share points, given the recall, they gained half of it back as of September and the impact. I think this year is about 750 million, but I think this business should recover into next year. Also in terms of diabetes, there is CMS proposed coverage guidelines for CGMs. The common period of that is open till about the 19th of November, and if expanded and coverage is approved, it could really bring more eligible patients into the population, 4 million, going to about 8 million, which is another 2 billion dollar U.S. opportunity. So I do like their diversified portfolio, and I think they do have levels to pull in terms of just diabetes, medical devices, diagnostics, and nutrition coming back. Let's elaborate on that a bit. As you pointed out, some of the sentiment that's weighing on the stock today is about the decline we've seen in COVID testing, yes, we're going into what is expected to be a period of more optics in COVID cases, but the reality is we're not going to be at the peak that we haven't over the last few years. You mentioned a long list of other levers within their portfolio. What do you think is going to be the biggest driver that gets you to that $132 share price target? Yeah, and I just want to back up. I don't think it's so much about COVID testing. It's more about, like I mentioned, investors focus on the underlying growth profile of the company when you back out COVID testing, the infant formula recall, which is about a $230 million hit this quarter again, and then the medical supply issue that they faced internationally. So I think the sticking point for investors right now is really recovery. Just in terms of COVID, I think in an endemic phase, as a base case, the company is looking for about $500 million in quarterly sales. I think that's a good place.",https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TFE9bMjrlhU,39,2022-10-20 16:43:04
3755," I think in an endemic phase, as a base case, the company is looking for about $500 million in quarterly sales. I think that's a good placeholder even for next year, which does provide some upsides. So I think, again, the mid to high single digit growth profile versus the high single digit organic revenue growth that they aspire to get to on a long-term basis. I think the variance between that is really Q3 being seasonally weaker, and then the COVID-19 environment, whether recovery is occurring, but we are not in normal times. So I think that's having an impact. So I think that's more of a sticking point than COVID-19 testing. And again, just to mention, again, they are doing about $7.8 billion for the full year. Their guidance at this point was a $7.7 billion that they did last year. Q4 includes about $500 million in quarterly sales for COVID-19 testing business. And again, that does not include any additional COVID surges or government contracts. Shuguen Singh, Medical Devices Analyst at RBC Capital Markets. Appreciate your time today and our thanks to Angelique Kamlani as well. President Biden speaking from the White House earlier at this afternoon, outlined his latest plan to lower gas prices. Let's take a listen. Today I'm announcing three critical steps at my administration will take to reduce gas prices at the pump. First, the Department of Energy released another 15 million barrels from the Strategic Petroleum Reserve, extending our previously announced release through the month of December. With my announcement today, we're going to continue to stabilize markets and decrease the prices. I've told my team behind me here to be prepared to look further, look for further releases of the months of head if needed. We're calling it a ready and release plan. All right. Let's talk about what this means for the energy markets for that. I want to bring in Alan Neckman, bullsci option dot com chief market strategist. Alan, it's great to see you. So we just got this announcement from President Biden. And then we also got the data just that regarding supplies. It seems like that's really the driver in today's action with oil back above 85. I guess your reaction first to what we just heard from the president and the potential implications. Well, the president in reality cannot control the price of energy control the price of oil or gas prices. They try and pamper it because it's a big issue for the markets.",https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TFE9bMjrlhU,40,2022-10-20 16:47:25
3756," in reality, cannot control the price of energy, control the price of oil or gas prices. They try and pamper it because it's a big issue for the markets and for people in general, especially consumers. But if you look at it, we've been trading roughly between 85 and 95 in crude oil for the last three or four months. We did have a failed test to the downside and we bounced back up again. So I'm still optimistic overall that in price could move back up once again, but let's put it in perspective. We're still half of the price from 2008, if you adjust for inflation, we have to be above $200 a barrel. It's interesting. I'd love to hear what he means by if needed, because theoretically, it's only needed politically speaking. This is not to solve an emergency as the SPR usually is. He also follows that with a tweet and it says, when the cost of oil comes down, we should see the price of the pump come down as well. That's how it should work. But right now, we're fine. We're just retailers are making record profits at the expense of Americans. What does he have right? What does he have wrong? Well, it's capitalism. Again, the president does not control the price. That'd be a whole different country if the president could determine the price of energy and he can. But that's one of the strongest sectors of the market. If you look at any of the oil companies over the last year and over the last couple of weeks, we've seen a big rebound in oil and oil services company. If you've got slumber, Jay, Halle, Burton, Oxy, everybody's had a big bounce and it looks like we're making another attack on those highs. So we've been seeing that sector lead the way here and we've seen a bounce in the overall market. Let's remember that there's still a lot more upside in these oil company stocks. They had the lowest PE of around nine or 10 compared to any sector in the S&P. So there's still more upside and money to be made in these particular stocks and sector, even though it looks like the price of gas may go maybe going higher than the near term. Alan, how much higher could the price of gas go do you think? Well, it can go back up. But again, we had a pretty sharp decline. Let's talk about what's happening in your last gas diluted to it. It's all about the dollar. The dollar had a few reversal a couple weeks ago where it made new highs and that had a lower weekly close. That is destructive for the dollar. So if the dollar can decline, that's going to be very much a positive for stocks and for oil. So that's something to watch. And the key component obviously is interest rate. Interest rates are going to top out at 5% here in 2023. And then they decline after that. 2024, 2025, they all stabilize around 4% all the way out to 2030. So that's the market telling us that the rate hike cycle is going to be done. And the dollar shouldn't go up anymore. That's going to push the energy and commodity complex higher. And that's going to hurt the consumer. But like I said, there's money to be made in some of these stocks that will benefit from it. Got to push a little bit, Dan Dicker here yesterday in the program said, $120 a barrel early 23. Do you agree with that? You at least see over $100 a barrel. Yeah, I see $100 a barrel that's again, like I said, that would be half of where we were. I know it hurts psychologically. And it's a red button issue for people. But that's still half off of 2008. The Fed got what they wanted. They knocked oil prices down. They knocked about 35%. But I see that as a temporary respite here. And Pooelk is always has price pop potential. And you understand there are certain, there are a lot of people around the world that have a vested interest in a higher energy prices. And they're going to do what they're going to do because that's how they make money. And let's talk about the energy crisis in Europe. Obviously a huge story, a huge mover here throughout the energy sector. EU companies at least right now at odds just over how best to tackle the energy crisis. What's your takeaway? I think what do you think should be done at this point? I just got back from Europe and they live a different lifestyle than we do. Their inflation rate has been much higher. And I took advantage of the strong dollar, you know, being American for that trip. You know, it's always in flux. And you know, they live in, like I said, a different lifestyle than we do. Everybody was driving the little cars and it got a good chuckle. I mean, to not see a truck. I did not see a pickup truck probably for three or four days, which is, like I said, a different lifestyle and they're just used to these things. And it's a cycle that we all have to get through. And you know, prices move up, prices move down. That's what we do as traders. We take advantage of those price movements. And I think there's more pop when it comes to these energy prices.",https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TFE9bMjrlhU,41,2022-10-20 16:51:47
3757, get through and you know prices move up prices move down that's what we do as traders is we take advantage of those price movements but I think there's more pop when it comes to these energy prices especially here in the winter time get a Gucci bag a proud of bag curious to hear how you made the shoes I got shoes okay I'm curious back here the strategic prolette petroleum reserve we're talking 1984 type levels what are the implications again it's nothing but psychology you know it's psychology and sentiment and right now it's an interesting time for me as a trader I have never seen the sentiment this negative now you know let's remember where we were in 2008 and you know things were much much different we actually had a real financial crisis now we've got too many jobs and too few people and you've got corporate profits and margins at record record levels so you know it's it's a disconnect I think the the average consumer the average American is very concerned about the economy but we're 70% off the COVID lows in the S&P and 20% off the highs we made 70 some new all-time highs just last year low so yeah the market's taken a little bit of a break but if you if you do it on a PE ratio you know we right now we're at 15 think about what percentage that is off the high back in January we're 30% off the high in the PE so stocks are cheap at some people at some point people are gonna realize that I just don't know when all right let's talk housing the fed's aggressive monetary policy to get inflation under control is impacting the housing market high mortgage rates leading to a decline in demand U.S. home building felt more than expected last month housing starts dropping with an 8% in September building permits up slightly at 1.4% but one of the biggest laggards of 13% drop in multi-unit projects national association of home builders CEO Jerry Howard joins us now with more on all this data good to see us sir all this data continues to pour in showing essentially the same things were right around early 2020 levels pre-pa or right when the pandemic took hold what concerns you the most about what's to come well it's an interesting question I think what concerns me the most is the failure of public policy makers to act to stem the tide of this housing recession virtually every reason that we are currently in a housing recession is tied directly to public policy whether it's interest rates being raised and by the way those interest rates not only impact the housing consumer they impact the builder at the front end of the pipeline as the cost of capital for the builders has gone up to get the loans to acquire the land development and construct the homes,https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TFE9bMjrlhU,42,2022-10-20 16:56:01
3758," at the front end of the pipeline as the cost of capital for the builders has gone up to get the loans to acquire the land, develop it and construct the homes. It's a double whammy on the cost of capital. We're still having labor problems. We've got to get our immigration situation fixed. We're still having supply chain problems as a hangover from the pandemic. And we're still having regulatory problems, whether it's regulations involving the importation of lumber from Canada, labor regulations, environmental regulations or simply the reinstitution of the regulations that the Trump administration did away with. Right now it's a it's a perfect storm for housing. We're predicting that well this year we'll be the first year since 2011 that we built fewer houses than we did the year before. We're worried about next year not really looking for much of a turnaround until 24. That was the kitchen sink approach right there your colleague Jerry Contr, the chairman of the NHAB said quote with inflation continuing to run above an 8% annual rate since March it's truly disingenuous of President Biden to hail their progress on inflation without recognizing the cost of it. Do you agree with that sentiment and what can the president do to fix this situation? Well, in fact, we talked with the White House today. They assure us that they are taking the housing situation seriously. Obviously we'll see what actions they take. This housing recession is being caused by inflation that is a direct result of a supply shortage. The administration can do everything that I just mentioned correct all those egregious policies and make it easier to build homes that'll in the inflation. Jerry, let's start with labor. One of the things that you just cited in terms of some of the problems that you are facing. It's interesting because I was actually looking at a tweet from an economist that we've had on Yahoo Finance a number of times Diane Swank and she was saying that we could actually see job cuts from home builders because of the fact that the backlogs are declining and demands dropping. But it sounds like at least from your perspective that you still can't find the number of workers that you need. Is that right? When we are operating in a normal economic environment, we are woefully short of skilled labor. Obviously when we're in a recession and building slows down, yeah, we're not in the same boat. But remember, housing has always led the country out of every recession since World War II. If we don't have labor, if we don't have a supply of building materials that can be counted upon to get there on time, we're not going to be able to lead the country out of a recession. And I don't know what a sector of the economy can do it. None has done it since, as I said, World War II. You mentioned a conversation with the White House. How did they push back on your recommendations and will housing lead us into a recession? Well, we're already in one. Housing is clearly in a recession right now. I believe, and I think that most economists are now starting to come around that the likelihood of an overall recession is greater every day, hopefully. And right now, I think people are saying it would be a shallow and a short-lived one. But I think that, yeah, we're headed into an overall economic recession. I think the White House is very aware of what's going on. To the administration's credit, they noted that we had an affordable housing issue, and we also had a housing affordability issue, two distinct problems. They've noted that from the time they were campaigning, but I think the time to put it on the front burner. And that's what they need to do is put housing on the front burner of all the domestic policies. Jerry, is this answer right now, just in terms of what is the biggest problem facing housing industry? Is it more of a demand problem? Is it more of a supply problem? What do you see at least right now today? Right now, it's probably about 50-50, interest rates have definitely driven demand down. But we still have a major supply problem, which is why, unlike during the Great Recession, when you saw how prices completely plummet, there's sort of a buffer this time in that there's not enough of a supply for housing values to go all the way down into the tank. It's going to be a unique situation where phase-",https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TFE9bMjrlhU,43,2022-10-20 17:00:20
3759," Sort of a buffer this time in that there's not enough of a supply for housing values to go all the way down into the tank. It's going to be a unique situation we're facing right now. But Jerry, by some respects, it's still relatively healthy because we're seeing prices still increase, it's just the rate of increases cooling. Where will prices get to? Do you believe we're talking 2019 pre-pandemic levels? If they got there, that would be about as low as I think they get. In this episode of influencers, Katie Curry, former Today Show host and author of Going There. I think that people who spread it, who are quote unquote super spreaders, should be held liable for spreading disinformation, whether it's about COVID or vaccines or about Sandy Hook. I think journalism is still a really noble profession. The problem is so much of journalism has seeped into commentary. I hope that I'll be seen as somebody who did what my father told me my entire life. Do your best and that's what I've done. Hello everyone, I'm Andy Sirware and welcome to InfluentSurs. And welcome to our guest, Katie Curry, a course former host of the Today Show, CBS Evening News, co-founder of Katie Curry Media and author of the book Going There and My Former colleague at Yahoo, which we'll get to. I'm sure Katie, welcome. Great to see you. Hi Andy, great to be here. Thanks for having me. Of course. Why don't we start out before we talk about the book? I'm curious to know about Katie Curry Media and what you're up to and what's that all about. Well, I love sort of being the boss of me as our kids used to say Andy and about three and a half years ago, my husband and I saw that the media landscape was changing dramatically. I actually noticed that over the past decade or so. And instead of depending on people to give me a job, I decided I wanted to be a job creator. I wanted to try my hand at being an entrepreneur. And that I thought the brand that I had established over 30 to 40 years in media was as powerful as some of the bigger brands and would be enabled me to really personalize the news and view it from my perspective. So we decided to be pan media. We have a newsletter that goes out to well over half a million people with a very high engagement rate. We have a podcast. I'm going to be recruiting other talent to contribute. And we already have done that. We have somebody who's our book editor. We have a very vibrant relationship with Bobby Brown also used to be at Yahoo. And so we're really establishing a collective of voices. And in the meantime, I'm also developing documentaries. I have a couple of scripted projects and development. I was an executive producer of a series on Netflix called Unbelievable. And I want to realize, Andy is storytelling has changed dramatically. It's no longer siloed. You can, the dissentral mediation allows you to go direct to consumer just as brands are doing. And we now have about 35 people working at the company. And really what I'm trying to do, we also have a shop that has picks of what we think are purpose driven brands and female founded by pot founded LGBTQ plus founded companies that we're supporting and really shining a light on. So it's been really exciting because you know, it's hard working for a big lumbering bureaucratic organization at times. And I find",https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TFE9bMjrlhU,44,2022-10-20 17:04:38
3760," Well, it's been really exciting because, you know, it's hard working for a big, lumbering bureaucratic organization at times. And I find that I can be much more nimble and I can create content at the drop of a hat, a drop of a hat, or I can do longer profiles and series. And really explore topics I'm interested in that I think are worthy of a listener or reader or viewer's attention. What do you think about TV news right now, Katie? And, you know, we're seeing the emergence of streaming services like CNN plus. And what does that mean for the industry? How would you describe it? Well, I think it's just another way to provide interesting content to consumers. You know, it'll be interesting to see if people are gonna pay for those services when there is so much news everywhere. I mean, I'm just inundated with news 24-7. And a lot of it is really high quality. I was just reading a great piece this morning on Joe Manchin and the Rolling Stone that someone brought my attention to. So I think it'll be an interesting experiment to see if people are gonna want that content. Will they wanna see Chris Wallace doing interviews? I'm not sure. Maybe hardcore Chris Wallace fans will, but it seems to me that there is so much news that's so ubiquitous now that they're gonna have to provide something that is really unique. And I think they're trying to do that with sort of the model of Anthony Bourdain, which, you know, was established on CNN many years ago with Eva Longoria. You know, I just don't know at what point I guess is the content overload Andy, you know? Is there just so much to choose from? Will the cream still rise through the top? Probably, but will it be enough to sustain some of these newer business models? I'm not sure. Right, and then ubiquity is both a blessing and a curse from the consumer standpoint, because there is so much out there, but then how do you choose? And so I'm sure you're asked this question, Katie, people ask me all the time, what do you look at? What do you read? And how do you decide what to look at when there is so much stuff? Well, you know, I do rely primarily on newsletters and on Apple news. And, you know, I remember when I was at Yahoo with you, Andy, I begged for them to let me start a newsletter that would basically go straight to people's inboxes and help kind of churrate the things they needed to know. You know, they weren't interested in that at Yahoo for a variety of reasons, which we can talk about later and sort of what Yahoo's ultimate business goals were at the time. But, you know, I read a lot of newsletters. I try to read the economists. I look at Time Magazine. I read The New York Times, The Washington Post. I read various newsletters from reporters from those outlets. I read The Pointer Institute. Tom Jones does a media newsletter. The Pew Center Research Center does kind of what's going on in media. I'm interested in kind of looking at trends. I read The Information by Jessica Lesson. So I really try to get a good cross section of helpful and useful information. And sometimes I just look at Apple news and see what's trending. And if there are articles that I'm interested in. And I feel like I really get a good sense of what's going on in the world with the malcom of sources that I turn to.",https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TFE9bMjrlhU,45,2022-10-20 17:09:15
3761," you you you you you you you you you you you you you you what ending are we in when it comes to a reckoning with women and diversity in the workplace? I mean, are we? I mean, are we? Is it early days, middle days, sometimes? I think it's you know, I think it's early days, um, but I think maybe early to middle days, Andy. You know, I think this is so important and I think it, you know, you can't just wave a magic wand. Um, it's it's there's there's so many factors I think contributing to this imbalance of power that have been entrenched in our society for decades, if not centuries. And so one of the things that I hope we can do is have honest conversations about this. I think that's so imperative. And if my book models that, and that's something I'm really pleased about. And because I think what happens is, um, you know, there, there's, there's progress and then there's a backlash. There's progress and then there's a backlash. And I think having open and honest conversations and not, you know, canceling people because they say the wrong thing or not, uh, rejecting them. And so you know, it's like, I think that's why I think it's not just a lot of things that are out of hand because of the way that they see things which and their products of their own environment. Is a really important component to leveling the playing field for everyone. You write a course about, we talked about Matt Lauer, or I mentioned him, I should say in the problems, and let's moon this. worse than other businesses, or is it just that they're more high profile? You know, it's hard for me to answer that question Andy because I haven't really been in other businesses. But having said that, I do think they're more high profile. I think there's probably a little more, you know, it's not exactly a low profile.",https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TFE9bMjrlhU,46,2022-10-20 17:13:35
3762," or high profile, I think there's probably a little more, you know, it's not exactly a low-key or low-profile industry. So I think probably the ego level, men in television in general and sort of media is probably feeds into or fed, excuse me, fed into certain behavior for many, many years. So I think that, you know, I think it was just sort of business as usual. It was sort of the status quo for this kind of behavior. I think it was not only tolerated, but in some cases encouraged in television news and especially as women were entering that industry and significant numbers, I think we forget that, you know, I graduated from college Andy in 1979 and this was when women were really entering the workplace in big numbers. And so it was male dominated for quite a while. Women were in positions that were dependent on their male bosses. So that created a dynamic that just, I think, opened up for a lot of abuses. That, and add to that kind of the culture that existed, you know, a bit of Hollywood, we're going to make you a star. I control your fate. You are subservient to me and I think that provided a recipe for that kind of really unacceptable behavior. Any of them come back or should they be allowed to come back or talk about canceling people and people paying the price? I think a lot of it depends on your response to the allegations. I think people who recognize, I think James Franco did something very interesting that we haven't seen with a lot of these men who had been, and I think that I don't know, we could have a whole conversation of the word canceled. You know, I think they were removed with cause. I think canceled sometimes suggests that a small, you know, a smaller or infraction or whatever was overly penalized. So I think James Franco talked about, you know, getting help, acknowledging his issues and trying to understand the damage that he did. And I think that other people should probably take a page from that playbook and do some serious introspection and then try to kind of contribute to, you know, be the change that we hope to see instead of kind of digping in their feels. But, you know, I think with any kind of social movement, there is bound to be some collateral damage. Right. Good point about how I use the word canceled, by the way. Well, I mean, I know I appreciate that. No, you are spot on. You are spot on. I want to switch over and get back to some of those tech companies in the platforms a little bit because they're so powerful. And, you know, they're relying on them. We're relying on them. We're one of them in a way. But Facebook, Twitter, how are you thinking about them, Katie? Are they to blame for the widespread proliferation of misinformation? Should they be held responsible? Should they be broken up? I mean, there are a thousand big questions there. But just your thousand foot take. You know, it's, I wish I were even, you probably are more of an expert on this Andy than I am. I was a co-chair of the Aspen Commission on disinformation. And obviously we took a close look at some of these platforms. I mean, I think the problem with disinformation in our society is very multi-dimensional, but.",https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TFE9bMjrlhU,47,2022-10-20 17:17:37
3763," We took a close look at some of these platforms. I mean, I think the problem with disinformation in our society is very multi-dimensional, but the algorithms and the way things are shared and amplified certainly I think have been fueled by the social media platforms. You know, it's also lack of trust in mainstream media or more traditional media outlets and also the democratization of information where everyone who has a digital device or an iPad or a computer can spread misinformation and disinformation and malinformation. And so I think that we really do need to look, take a close look at the liability of some of these platforms that claim they are not a publisher that they're just a platform. And Congress should get involved. I think the federal government needs to have a more unified approach because I don't think there's really a centralized policy arm of the government to deal with this. President Obama says disinformation is the biggest threat for our democracy. Certainly when you look at things like the big lie and the fact that more than 60, you know, courts and judges have said there's no merit to the argument that the election was rigged, that it was one of the fairest elections in our history, but the fact that this persists that a huge percentage of the public and particularly the Republican Party continues to believe that the election was rigged. Obviously they're getting this information and it's being reinforced over and over again. And though people gave me a hard time because when I was on Bill Mar, I talked about the need for people to be deprogrammed, which really met just kind of separating themselves from the information that they're being almost being almost brainwashed to believe through the repeated serving up of disinformation. So I think we need to take a multi-approach and and get everyone involved. And I think that people who spread it, who are quote unquote super spreaders should be held liable for spreading distance, disinformation, whether it's about COVID or vaccines or about Sandy Hook. And I think that platforms need to be more aggressive about monitoring it. Of course the problem and it's not a problem, but the sticky wicked in America is free speech. And how do you balance free speech with the need to have outright lies be removed and not see the light of day where unfortunately an audience is receptive to believing them? It's an complicated topic, is there anything? But it does go back to can you yell, fire in a crowded theater? I mean, it's also timeless, but now it's just this new way of getting the information that's sort of, it's a super spreader. Yeah, and I think the Supreme Court, the Supreme Court said you cannot yell fire and it's very sad. You're absolutely right, thank you. And similarly, I think this is the semantic version of yelling fire in a crowded theater. And I think the technology has almost outrun the ethical considerations of all this, but it's a really serious problem. I think it's shaping up to even be more serious in 2024. And so it's something that we need to pay attention to.",https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TFE9bMjrlhU,48,2022-10-20 17:22:00

We need smart, curious young people, men and women. And people who represent this country demographically. So we're talking about people from all kind of socio-economic backgrounds, Andy, people from different, who've had different experiences.",https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TFE9bMjrlhU,49,2022-10-20 17:26:10
3765," and tree demographically. So we're talking about people from all kind of socioeconomic background zandee people from different, who've had different experiences because of their race and ethnicity. We need to be kind of this great American will, by between 44 white people will be in the minority in this country. And we just need to make sure that our journalists represent the people they're serving. Having said that, I do think we need to look at the model of journalism. And I know a lot of people are thinking about this and talking about it. How can we restore trust in the media? How can we be less polarized and speak to just one audience or the other? I think that's a really challenging question. But I think it's one that deserves a lot of attention and thought. And I think we need a lot of people, young people, smart, young people, who can maybe look at it and look at it in a different way. And are we forever going to be siloed and have our own information? My friend Nicole Seligman talks about affirmation instead of information. I think these are all big, head-e-medie topics. And we need the greatest minds in the country to focus on them. So I would encourage people, especially idealistic people to go into journalism. Great. We're almost at a time, Katie. So quickly, if you can, what do you see as your legacy? Well, I hope that I contributed to the national conversation and help people understand complicated issues. I hope that I helped show that women were capable. And that it's interesting to think about the fact that in 2006, it was such a big deal to have a woman do the evening news. And now we see the evening news is declining in terms of its influence and importance. They still have a lot of people watching, but much older demographics. And I think very few young people are watching the network evening newscast. But I hope that I helped move the ball a little bit forward for women. Was an easy, I write extensively about my experience at CBS. And I think I was met with a lot of resistance there, partially because I think, well, there are a whole lot of reasons, which I detail in the book. But I hope that I moved the ball forward for women, whether it was asking that I had a 50-50 division of labor on the today's show with Brian Gumball, or took the leap and became the first solo female anchor of an evening newscast. And I also hope that I try to explore important topics and do it honestly. And that I have the vulnerability and humility to say when there were times when I didn't get it right. I don't know any journalists who batted 1,000 for decades. And I think that I'm proud of myself that I had the courage to say maybe I could have done something differently, or why did I approach a topic this way? Or here were some of the factors that were influencing me when I was making decisions. Because when all is said and done, journalists are human beings. They're not perfect. They try, I think, to do the best job they can, mostly. And so I hope that I'll be seen as somebody who did what my father told me my entire life do your best. And that's what I've done. And sometimes it's been great. And sometimes I've fallen on my face. But to me, that's kind of a life well-lived. And the ability to admit that is, I think, takes a lot of guts. Hey, DeCork.

3766," and the ability to admit that is I think takes a lot of guts. Hey, DeCork. Thank you so much for your time. Thanks, Andy. You've been watching Influencers. I'm Andy Sirware. I'll see you next time. Welcome back to OutFine. It's I'm Brian Sousy alongside Julie Hyman and Brad Smith. You have some we will have soon surely some breaking news on existing home sales, but Julie, over to you right now we're seeing the markets off ahead of that news. Yeah, we have it and it looks like it's pretty much in line with estimates here existing home sales coming in an annual pace of 4.71 million. It is a decline month over month of about one and a half percent. We also by the way got the index of leading economic indicators down about four tenths of one percent, but there's been a lot of attention on the housing market. We also by the way just got the news from Freddie Mac about the average 30 year fixed mortgage rate rising to 6.94 percent. And it's obvious the effect that is having when you look at that existing home sales number and the declines that we are seeing there is that higher interest rates are having an effect on the ability of people to buy homes here. Eighth straight month that we saw the existing home sales number decline. That is the longest declining streak that we have seen since 2007. And obviously 2007 was when we were beginning to see the housing collapse and the beginnings of the great financial crisis. And so interesting here that we are seeing that even though most predictions are not for something similar to happen this time around because the tendrils of the housing market and the capitalization of the banks and other lenders is in a different stage now than it was at that point in time. So all of that said this does show the sort of continuation of the waning housing market partly as a result of higher rates. Yeah, I'll add too. I believe yesterday just tracking some redfin data that they reported on housing. They noted in September 60,000 deals were called off. So that was you continue to see that slow down. Redfin has reporting some very good stats on this. It's going to be a question too of where there's going to be supply that continues to come on the market, whether that's on the new homes front and actually being able to complete some of those projects. But then also on the existing side, if you have perspective sellers that are now looking at the market and saying where we're going to find buyers, then that's still going to have a contraction in the supply that's actually coming through. And so that is a particular risk in the near term as well, even as the rates are rising and compressing the amount of buyers that are prospectively out there, the sellers, the sell side of the equation, that's also still seeing its own looking across the market and saying, all right, well, why would we list our house now if there's not going to be people who are able to bid on it right now at this price? Yeah, and to your point, the number of homes for sale declined to 1.25 million in September from 1.28 million in August. So we continue to see that number go down a little bit. In the meantime, regional Fed officials outreceling some comments on Fed policy. The out-of-finance is Jen Schomburger has the details we heard from the likes of James Bollard. Good morning, that's right. Julie St. Louis Fed President James Bollard says he expects the Fed to end frontloading aggressive interest rate hikes by sometime early next year, but still maintain an aggressive policy stance. Now, Bollard who made these comments in a Bloomberg TV interview Wednesday suggested he doesn't need to see rate pushed higher than that 4.5 to 5% range currently projected by the committee. Bollard told Bloomberg, rather, he thinks next year the Fed will be closer to running what he calls, quote, ordinary monetary policy. He said the Fed is at the right level of policy rate to full inflation and can adjust as the data come in. Now, these comments coming as the Fed has said it will be appropriate at some point to slow down the pace of interest rate hikes and assess what the current rate hikes impact has already had on the economy. Elsewhere, Minneapolis Fed President Neil Cash Carrey said that the Fed could potentially pause interest rate hikes sometime next year if inflation cools. Cash Carrey Carrey told Brawler's Institute that he thinks inflation will level out over the next few months, but underscored he doesn't yet the evidence that core prices, which of course, exclude volatile food and energy costs are moderating.",https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TFE9bMjrlhU,51,2022-10-20 17:35:05
3767," out over the next few months, but underscored, he doesn't yet the evidence that core prices, which have forced exclude volatile food and energy costs, are moderating. Now, these are some of the last comments from Fed officials on monetary policy before we go into that so-called blackout period, ahead of the Fed's next interest rate policy meeting, and less than two weeks, Fed officials widely expected to raise that benchmark interest rate and the basis point again for the fourth meeting in a row, guys. Is there any inclination to or anything that we can extrapolate from Bollard's comments, especially as we were just talking about the housing market as well? Bollard seemed to be acknowledging at least of the equation there and what the housing market represents or does not represent, but is there a clear sense of how the Fed will continue to monitor housing particularly, even as they're going along in their policy pathway? Well, two points there, obviously on the housing front, that is the one that has been most sensitive to the interest rate heights and is seeing the cooling. Fed officials are still waiting for those rate heights to penetrate other sectors of the economy. So while they are seeing some progress on the housing front and other interest rate sensitive sectors, they're still waiting for that to filter through. Now, I think there was sort of an understanding from the market that perhaps the Fed could get even more hawkish on the back of an increase in the core inflation on the CPI reading that we got last week, moving up to six points that percent in September from six point three in August. But Bollard is towing the line here saying, look, I think that our interest rate projections are the correct path policy path for right now. And that's exactly what Mary Dalley told me last week as well. So perhaps that could give investors some solace that the Fed is still looking at that range of four and a half to five percent as the peak rate on the Fed funds rate. All right, go finance his own Jen Schaunberger Jen. Thanks so much for breaking this all down. The Bollard commentary and where this all sits well or not so well with the markets. Let's continue the conversation on markets with an eye to what fiscal and economic policies have worked and what hasn't in the past. Our next guest is out with a new book called a monetary fiscal history of the United States. Joining us now we've got Alan Blender, who is the Princeton University professor of economics and public affairs. Alan, great to have you here with us this morning. First, you just heard some of you. Absolutely. You just heard some of the comments from Fed Representative Bollard. James Bollard essentially saying within this policy pathway going forward from here that there could be a pivot sometime in the future but they're going to wait to see if their policy is actually taking effect. What data would you be most notably looking towards to see where that policy is actually being ingested fully by the economy? Well, I think there's no doubt that you look first at housing as you were just talking about. If you go back through the history of the Federal Reserve in recent decades, I'm not talking about the 1920s. When monetary policy tightens, it has its principal effects on spending in two places. One is new houses and the other is automobiles. So the spending on houses looks like it's behaving like it adds in previous Fed tightnings. It's very sensitive because people finance it with mortgages. The spending on automobiles is a lot trickier because as you all know, we've had this crazy cycle where people couldn't buy cars. They weren't enough cars to buy because they weren't enough chips to make cars and a lot of automakers who've got backlogs. Now, a backlog is one thing. People come back out of their intention to buy a car. But I think it's at least believable hypothesis that the impact on automobiles sales will be less than it normally has been in the past because of this backlog. Alan, it's Julie here. As you look across back at the history of monetary policy, it seems like no matter what the Fed does, there are always critics of the Fed and what it's doing. There's always this kind of backward looking. They should have done this. They should have done that. As you look at that kind of history, what lessons do you take away for the Fed today? I guess you can't entirely avoid that kind of criticism.",https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TFE9bMjrlhU,52,2022-10-20 17:39:25
3768," done that. As you look at that kind of history, what lessons do you take away for the Fed today? I guess you can't entirely avoid that kind of criticism, but maybe to lessen it. You know, the old Joe Klein was that something that they paid them to make boxwar. If you actually look at Federal Reserve salaries, you would see how lovely they are. The answer to your question is it's part of the job description. The Federal Reserve knows that it's going to get criticism from one side or the other. Often both, some people criticizing it for being too selfish, some people for being too hawkish. By the way, that's happening now. That's not that unusual. I can remember just to give you an anecdote. In 1994, when we started raising interest rates, I was vice chairman of the Fed. And that was, by the way, ended up with the perfect soft landing. The absolutely perfect soft landing, the best the Fed has ever done. But we were criticized tremendously for wrong footing in the markets and surprising them by raising interest rates, even though Greenspan had signaled that months before. So it's just part of the atmosphere. It's the air you breathe has criticism in it if you're a FFED. Alan, yesterday I spoke to Bank of America CEO Brian Moynihan and he was talking a lot about a recession. Take a listen. Love to get your reaction on the back side. Our team predicts a recession, a mild recession. They have had that projection, frankly, six months ago. They had the same projection more or less. It just pushed out a little bit. But what we're not seeing is it come to for you yet. And that keeps moving it out because of that resiliency and the consumer. Alan, do you agree that if we are going into recession, that it will be mild? I think so. Now, one never knows because all kinds of unknown things can happen. Like a big oil shock from OPEC. I don't think that will happen, but it's possible. So events on, on proceed events can upset the apple card. But I think my central prognostication, if you want to call it that, is very similar to what Mr. Moynihan was just speaking about. But the signal exception and its trivial is that a few months ago, I was not saying it would happen in 2022. It would probably happen in 2023, which is what I hear him saying. There are a number of reasons to think it will be fairly mild. I'll just take off too. One is the huge amount of liquidity that consumers have accumulated largely because of the transfer payments that were made to lessen the impact of the terrible pandemic recession. So consumers are sitting on a cash pile, depending on how you measure it of 2 trillion, 2.5 trillion. So that's going to be enabling them to bolster their spending, even if their factory incomes go down. And the second thing that's rarely discussed, but Neil Kashkary is a good example of it, you had him on a moment ago. This is a fairly dovish FOMC, Federal Open Market Committee. They vary. It's human beings that are making these decisions. And sometimes the committee has a very hawkish tilt there eager to raise rates that vary, very inflation of worse. And sometimes they're more hawkish and they're more concerned about the employment impacts. They're still trying to get inflation down. No question about that. It's a matter of degree. And I think by historical standards, this is a fairly dovish FOMC. And what that means to me is they're less likely to overdo it. Kind of piggybacking on something that you just mentioned a moment ago, Alan. I mean, we are emerging from a situation, a crisis that none of us had ever been through in our lifetimes with the coronavirus pandemic. And with that, you had seen economies around the world try to stimulate growth once again, coming out after that. But now there's the larger question of on a global front on a global picture here, where one economy's troubles may be a precursor to another's or where they may not be. And do you believe that there's anything within Europe right now that is a precursor to what the US may be heading towards? A little bit. That's easy.",https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TFE9bMjrlhU,53,2022-10-20 17:43:40
3769," And do you believe that there's anything within Europe right now that is a precursor to what the US may be heading towards? A little bit, it's easy to, you know, it's hard to put the right spin on this. I don't want to say it doesn't matter, but it's easy to exaggerate it also. Point one is that Europe is almost certainly headed for a worse recession than we are. They are more impacted by the food and especially. Looks like we've got Professor Blinders shot froze, unfortunately. We got some gremlins today. We got some gremlins today. Well, all right, nonetheless, we will continue to watch all things Fed policy. Very interesting point there, Alan Blinder, making about a potential recession next year. If anything, he's looking forward to maybe be mild. He actually, I think we got him back. Alan, do we have you back? I'm here. Can you see me? Yes, we are. I wanted to get you actually for one last question here. And that has to do with the report in the New York Times today. Gina Smilak over there. Talk to you about some comments that James Bullard made on the sidelines down in DC, while the IMF meetings were going on to a private audience of city clients. And this is a pretty rare occurrence for a Fed governor to make comments on monetary policy to a private group. I'm just wondering if you could give us your take on that. It is unusual. It's not unheard of. It is unusual. And I'm sure Jim Bullard understood. I don't know the occasion. But I mean, I was sometimes in positions like that when I was vice chairman of the Fed. And I'm sure Jim Bullard understands that after more than three people in the room, there wasn't really a provocation. It was going to leak out. And so I'd rather doubt that he would have said anything to that group that he wouldn't say on television. Makes sense. Yeah, appreciate that perspective. Alan Blinder, Princeton University professor of economics and public affairs and author of a monetary and fiscal history of United States. Always good to see Alan. We'll talk to you soon. All right, before we had to break, let's shed light on some positive comments on the retail sector from Wells Fargo, analyst, Ike Barchow. The analyst says his data shows US consumer demand continues to be stable across the mall notes barchow. It appears most companies took their medicine and set more prudent plans post their summer slowdowns. And as such, we see much less near term risk in the third quarter. His top picks include a bath and body works, tapestry, Burlington stores and barfetch.

Until yesterday, there was a widely held view in her party that a leadership change should wait at least until a new economic plan is announced on October 31st to calm financial markets. But infighting within the Tory party and a realization that she will no longer be able to fulfill her promises sped up that process. The British government will hold a leadership election within the next week. And Marble or Maker, Philip Morris reported third quarter earnings before the bell this morning. It beat estimates and increased its offer for smokeless tobacco specialists Swedish match to $15.7 billion. That purchase would actually help it expand into cigarette alternatives. Philip Morris, Philip Morris, rather also reached a deal with ultra-retabuy the US rights to ICO's heated tobacco products. Now it plans to resume making those in the US next year. And big departures over at Metta, Amin Zouafunin. That is the company's vice president of corporate developments. The same guy behind Metta, formerly Facebook's acquisition of Instagram, WhatsApp and Oculus, is leaving the company after almost 12 years at the social media giant. He said in a Facebook post that strategic technology deal work is pretty intense, which is why he wants to take a break for a bit, Julie. All right, earnings season. It's just beginning here, but we've already heard several executives talk about the impact the strength of the dollars head on the top and bottom lines. The dollar has been on a tear, having his best quarterly performance in seven years. But why exactly does this impact companies? And how can they hedge against it? Professor Julie Heimann is here for her debut of Yahoo! You, Julie, take it away. All right, take your seats, Jens, because class is indeed in session. We have seen this enormous strength in the dollar this year. We've been talking a lot about it. It has meant about a 14% rally for the dollar versus the likes of the euro, 30% rally versus the Japanese yen. If you look at the year to date, you've seen the dollar index versus a basket of currencies. Go higher. What does this mean in real terms? Well, let's say I had a company called Jules Tools. I saw all kinds of stuff, Square Drive or Samarice, Power Drills. What have you? Let's say I have a big business in the EU and I sell 1000 euros worth of hammer. It's in the European Union. If you go back to March, that sale, if I brought it back to profits here in the US, would be worth about $1,112.40. However, as of yesterday, it was worth less than $1,985 or so. So this tells you in real terms, when you bring those profits back to the United States, what happens? It's the inverse of you going to vacation over in Europe and having more power to spend there. So, a lot of companies have already talked about this effect. We've already heard so many during this earning season thus far from the netflix's and proctor and gambles of the world, for example. Proctor and gamble, for example, saying that it's going to take a head of $3.9 billion over the next year. I forgot that I controlled this and you don't. So here are the various companies that we're seeing here, Guy's Tesla, one of the companies also talking about the currency impact, netflix making these kinds of comments as well, that it's really costing these companies billions of dollars as we are seeing the currency effect. So, most of the currency strategies we've spoken to are same.",https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TFE9bMjrlhU,55,2022-10-20 17:52:28
3771," these kinds of comments as well that it's really costing these companies billions of dollars as we are seeing the currency effect. And most of the currency strategies we've spoken to are saying the dollar is going to continue to go up. So this is not something that's over. So what can companies do in order to try and hedge against the dollar strength? That's something we hear about frequently, this hedging activity. There's a couple things we can do. Jules Tools can pay workers in local currency. In other words, if I have workers in the European Union that are making those hammers, I can just keep the euros there and pay the workers in that currency. I don't have to bring it back to the United States. So that's one way that I can do it. Another way I can do it is issue debt in that foreign currency. So for example, I can sell corporate bonds denominated in euros and that way I don't have that currency translation effect that is hitting my bottom line. So that's another way that we can hedge potentially. But overall, this is undoubtedly going to have an effect on corporate profits here. A 2% increase in the trade-weighted dollar will subtract about a percent from earnings per share in the United States for S&P 500 companies. And according to City and JP Morgan, they estimate that if you see a 10% increase in the dollar basket, it could cut S&P earnings by 15 to 20 dollars a share. So we're talking about a substantial effect here and this is why we've been hearing about companies offsetting it in a number of different ways, including raising prices. But this is a theme that is going to stick around for a while. Yeah, it's definitely impacting companies in a big, big way, really good stuff. Julie, I think that's the debut of the Julie emoji here on Yago Fine. Yeah, I think what for you, Brad? I look at mine. It looks exactly like us. I don't know how they come up with these things. You're just always good. And I'm excited for the new Julie emoji within this, though, the impact that you're mentioning. I mean, we've already gotten into some of the tech companies, but we're just at the tip of the iceberg for some of the tech companies that are going to be reporting and talking about effect. And when you're talking about the hedging that the tech companies can do, for example, if I am a software company, most of my developers are likely in the United States. So I can't do that keeping the currency local situation quite as well to account for expenses. I got to bring that money back to pay my programmers. Top work there, my friend, Professor Hyman. Very good stuff. I very much enjoyed that. All right, coming up, we'll speak to the CFO of AT&T on the back of their third quarter earnings report. MUSIC",https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TFE9bMjrlhU,56,2022-10-20 17:57:08
3772," yes Here's a VAT&T. We're moving higher this morning after the telecom company reported third quarter earnings showing 708,000 post paid phone net ads and a 6% rise in mobility revenue year of a year. AT&T, CFO, Pescal, Deroch joins us now to discuss Pescal. Good to see you again. Three months ago we were here having a conversation at a time. Your stock was down double digits and you weren't worn on free cash flow. Now today the stock is up and there seems to be a different tone on this earnings release. Why is that the case? Look, good morning Brian, good morning everybody. Maybe let me just start. I think this journey dates back to a couple of years ago. What we've said is we were going to invest to re-energize growth in this business with a priority towards re-energizing wireless and fiber growth. For a long time we said that that investment initially would reduce earnings but over time would produce significant returns. And as late last year we said that the second half of this year earnings would start to see the benefits of all the work that's been done. So things are playing out exactly as we said. And look, overall I'd be remiss if I didn't thank my colleagues across the company for all their hard work and getting us to this point. In terms of what's different now, I think last quarter there was a bit of an overreaction by I think the marketplace and some of the media. In the end what we flagged and we tried to effort to be really transparent. What we were seeing in the marketplace. What did we see? We saw that there was a normalization of collection patterns back to pre-pandemic norms. That hasn't gotten any worse. It's pretty much the same. And in terms of overall delinquencies I've been saying this since the spring, we are probably slightly worse than pre-pandemic norms. But all of them are really strong fundamentals. The thing to keep in mind is our business has a history of performing well even in challenging economic times. And we don't expect this time to be any different. You know, that's an amazing acknowledgement here, especially as we think about the fact that within the market consumers are paying more in some of their other necessities that they have to account for as well. And so when it comes down to their telecommunications service provider, like an AT&T, in the delinquencies that you are seeing, where are you also seeing perhaps the either type of device that customers that are net ads may be opting in for? Is it on the higher tier? Is it on the mid tier? And what type of service for those devices as well? Yeah, and I would say it's a bit across the board. First and foremost, consumers as a general matter, more and more people are signing up to higher price plans because of the value that those plans provide in terms of additional bandwidth. But not everyone is taking the device promotions. In fact, a meaningful portion of our subscriber additions and wireless come through our business relationships. And that channel has been and continues to be really efficient source of generating new subscribers. And so we're benefiting from that. And we're seeing just the consistency of our offer quarter after quarter, resonating with customers. And our sales team know how to execute it. And all those things are contributing to continued improvement.",https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TFE9bMjrlhU,57,2022-10-20 18:01:09
3773," are offered quarter after quarter, resonating with customers. And our sales team know how to execute it. And all those things are contributing to continued improvement in, continue growth in subscribers, as well as higher R-PROs. You layer on top of that, a better international, more international travel, also contributing to higher roaming revenues. All those things are driving improvements in R-PRO. And we've been doing a lot of work in our cost structure, and you're starting to see some of that benefit come through to the bottom line. So we feel really good about how we're performing. Pascal, it's Julie here. So obviously a lot of attention being paid to your networking investments as you pointed out. And there have been some reports that you are in discussions to spend a lot more on the network. There was a report recently that you're working with one of the big banks to increase your fiber optic cable investment, a $10 to $15 billion investment potentially. Is there anything you can tell us about that and what it would mean for your customers and for your network? As a matter of policy, we don't talk about rumors in the press, but let me tell you, overall how we think about fiber. Fiber right now is the best technology. And as we look out the next decade or two, there is nothing under horizon that will match the effectiveness of fiber, especially in terms of the speed, the bandwidth, and importantly symmetrical speed. And we don't see anything changing that. We are the largest provider in the US. We know how to do it very well. We can do it more efficiently than others. And we are prioritizing investment fiber. If there are opportunities for us to accelerate that through different partnerships, well of course we'll look at that. As John Stake said on the call this morning, his job is to make sure we are looking at all opportunities to potentially accelerate returns to our owners. Pascal, as it pertains to your planning for 2023, two part question, one, are you planning for a recession? And the number two, are you planning for a pickup in promotions to consumers given the slowdown we might see? Here is what I would tell you. You will hear more about how we're thinking about 2023 when we report our fourth quarter earnings. Overall, what I did say on this morning's call is that, we understand, we're more than three quarters of the way through the year and we understand what sort of macro environment we're operating in now. And they even considering all the challenges that we read about, we expect to grow earnings of free cash flow next year. What we'll do, but we want to make sure we wait till the fourth quarter and have the best possible information. And at that point, we will tell you how we are thinking about more precisely how we expect the magnitude of earnings of free cash flow growth. Within that though, and as you start to think about what a potential recession might look like for the business, what does that real margin run rate actually sustain at over that period of time given the delinquencies that you were talking about a moment ago? When you look back at history, even in downturns, the telecommunications sector tends to be more resilient than most. When clearly we would be impacted like others, but not nearly to the same extent. And right now, when you look at the criticality of telecommunication, whether wireless or broadband, connectivity, that's one of the last things the consumer will turn off even in a challenging economic environment. With that said, look, they pay me to make sure that we have the opportunity in the event that we encounter difficult operating environments to identify potential offsets. And things we would look to are things like, do we moderate the pace of our investments, Ben, in capital, but all in all, the good news about where we are today is that we believe we can continue to invest meaningfully in our business, comfortably pay our dividend and still continue to deal with.",https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TFE9bMjrlhU,58,2022-10-20 18:05:21

3775," 50 plus billion dollar market. And Tony, that shift to software as a service, which ultimately drives to annual recurring revenue, where are you at in that journey? Well, we have made a tremendous progress, if you recall, in 2019, I committed to make available all our offers from H2 Cloud as a service. And at the HP Discovery in June, we achieve a major milestone because not only are edge solutions are now part of our HP green lake platform, but as well as workload optimization, infrastructure as a service, as a service, and as well as data services. So we made tremendous progress. But now we are operating as a company in a cloud operating environment, where all our new offers are designed and delivered to HP Green Lake. So now is the journey continues adding and renewing those offers as we go forward. And that AIR, as we guided for the next three years, is going to grow between 35 and 45%. Also, not only on the back of a significant growth, which this year alone, we are growing a bookings in excess of 86% year to date. But the fact that we already have $7.7 billion of total contra value in the as a service business in our balance sheet. Are you seeing any red flags or areas of concern in your business? Are customers cancelling orders? Are they delaying decisions at all? Well, what is fascinated to me, Brian, is that we continue to see enduring demand for our products and our services. And Green Lake is at the top of that demand. Well, customers love about HP Green Lake. It's the fact that they get a unified cloud experience, inclusive of the public cloud, and all the services and applications they have on premises. And now they get the opportunity to extend not only into the public cloud with the same experience, but also at the edge. And that's the next big opportunity for us, because we live in a much more distributed enterprise than ever before. And also new use cases are being developed and deployed at the edge. So that's for us is a point of differentiation in my mind. And then when it comes down to momentum, again, enduring demand, but we have not seen any major of the cancellations at all. And that to us is a very positive sign that digital transformation and key top priority for our customers and IT plays now a bigger role than ever before. Antonio, some of the analysts commentary I saw this morning. A lot of them seem to be flagging the outlook for next year. A little cautious, a little below some of the estimates that were out there. Does that outlook account for a potential recession in the US? Well, that outlook as Tarek and I stated yesterday includes what we see as a potential disruption that made the market creates because of the inflation and the foreign current exchange, kind of trends we see. So we have comprehended all of that in our outlook. But we are very confident about our outlook because obviously we have a record breaking backlog with, again, enduring demand continue to be in the market. Second is that also we continue to make a significant shift in not only in our product and portfolio mix, but in a way with the liver that makes. And third also, this company generates a lot of cash. And so from my vantage point, we are very well positioned to meet or exceed that outlook. Understanding that the biggest issue unknown today is actually in my mind not so much the macro environment but more the volatility of the foreign exchange. Antonio, I'm on the Hewlett-Packard Enterprise stats page on Yahoo Finance. And I see your stock trading at under six times Ford earnings. That is more than half of the broader market. Just given the performance of the business, that's shocking how you guys performed compared to the past year. You mentioned you have a lot of cash. How are you going to deploy cash over the next 12 months to get that multiple up? Yeah, I think you just did that really well. I mean, our disappointment is on the multiple because not only we're growing revenues, we are also growing recurrent revenues, which they represent more than 1 third over total revenues. And by the way, almost 80% of our profits are recurring. OK.",https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TFE9bMjrlhU,60,2022-10-20 18:14:03
3776," With consumer confidence sticking higher in September, signs of life are coming back to the travel industry. Occupancy rates were in line with 2019 levels in September and domestic travel intent trended higher. That's according to data from STR and the conference. Of course, we got a lot of positive airline earnings as well to support that notion. Joining us now to discuss JMP Security's equity research analyst, Nick Jones, Nick, you covered the digital travel companies, the booking.coms of the world. And I imagine that the picture is similar for them. Is it sort of a rise in tide lifts all boats? Are we just seeing a kind of rosy outlook right now for the travel industry writ large? Yeah, I think that's right. The airlines have given some good commentary that trend remain resilient. Occupancy rate, as you pointed out, is back to 2019 levels in September. The conference forward is saying intent to travel is increasing average daily rates or are elevated still indicating demand is still high. So trends are really looking good into the end of the year and this is both of our early 2023. So I think near term, that's absolutely right. But longer term, we look kind of further in the next year and the probability of a recession continues to increase. If you look back over history, generally the spend on travel does start to decline in a recession. So I think in part, that's what's maybe keeping these stocks and really breaking out of kind of near term positive data points. Help us keep some of the airlines honest here. From what you're seeing in terms of the number of different flights, the routes that are available, is there actually more capacity that is increasingly being added on here? And is that translating through to better fares for customers from what you've been tracking in your own research? I mean, so far, the intent is there, the demand is there, but it does not appear that fares are really coming down yet from the kind of the checks we've done in a anecdotal. The price of flights are still pretty elevated and some are the price of hotels. So despite their still being pretty high cost, the demand of travel is still there. We have heard some commentary, particularly the hotels, that not all of the rooms are actually available today, because they don't have a staffing to make them available. So that could in part be why some of the average daily rates remain elevated. So it's got a more.",https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TFE9bMjrlhU,61,2022-10-20 18:21:02
3777," because they'll have a staffing to make them available. So that could in part be why some of, you know, the average daily rates remain elevated. So it's kind of more supply comes on. It'll be interesting to watch if the airlines and hotels actually lower prices are today kind of hold on to where prices are today is kind of input cost increase. What about those sort of international lumpiness, if you will? I mean, a booking.com, which gets more of its revenue from Europe than the others. Is that then more vulnerable? Yeah, there's kind of puts in takes there. So the US dollar strength is it could create some effects, headwinds, kind of two revenues and costs at booking, but the same time the attempt to travel from the US to foreign destinations actually increased back to 2019 level. So a strengthening US dollar can benefit a company like booking as more US is would to travel to Europe and outside of the US. Is Airbnb still in any type of growth phase from right now, from what you can see? Yeah, Airbnb is, you know, they've benefited from really making alternative accommodations, really just another accommodation. They've really normalized that type of accommodation to consumers. Their growth does appear to be moderating. We have a market for form rating on it, largely due to valuations, but what they've done is, you know, it's heroic what they've done to kind of a new accommodation class. The company still has room to add experiences to its offering. They could have promoted listing to kind of the supply started the platform that could continue to drive net revenue kind of faster than we're looking for today, but we look for more evidence before we really start making that into our models. But from what we can tell, it looks like kind of the, you know, GBV growth at Airbnb is going to be in line with kind of expedient booking in a couple of years and be a similar kind of nominal dollar growth rate. All right, good time to be a Bill's fan. See the helmet in the back of your shot there. JMP Securities Equity Research Analyst Nick Jones, joining us here today. Thanks so much, Nick.

3778," Here's the music. You know what time it is? Time to tough time. We got two stories today. One minute each. Put it on the clock here. All state issuing a warning. On its third quarter results, expecting a net loss for the quarter. Shares responded to the news by dropping sharply this morning. Coming to insurers, inflation is causing costs for payouts to jump across the board with auto and medical costs, climbing significantly this year shares down to 10% right now in trading on the best as aren't in good hands, I guess. Well, they are in good hands, but it's costing all same more, right? It's a good plan. Thanks, coming through. Yeah. Then the company asked to pay board. There was also some hurricane costs, and that also really weighed on the bottom line for all state. There's always going to be hurricanes, right? But they do a lot of modeling at the insurance companies, but I guess if your modeling is off from what actually happens with the hurricane. And then you're forced to pay a high number of claims at a higher cost, this is then the result. I'm just fascinated how these stocks are going to do as we get more focus on climate change in this country, and as these events potentially pick up over the next decade. Well, it's interesting because for all state, I imagine it's very similar to what, oh my goodness, okay, we're done with that story. We're still in good hands, though. China, we're part of the holding emergency talks. The chip makers following restrictions on important semiconductors from the U.S., that's according to Bloomberg. The meetings happen behind closed doors to assess the possible damage to China's developing semiconductor markets. We're seeing all chip stocks rise on this news, but again, a very contention situation here. Well, the rise in the stocks doesn't make a lot of sense to me, honestly. This report said in this closed-door meeting that there were as many questions as answers. So like, yeah, they met to try and figure out what to do about the issue, but they have no answers. But it's also a very one-sided conversation that's taking place especially if you still have the U.S. that is not as willing to let the chip companies hear or abroad either come into the U.S. or for some of the chip companies here go abroad, especially into China. And so that is still very one-sided, even to say, yeah, we're having these discussions on our side right now. Yeah, I think the bigger story, at least near-term for investors, is the PC slowdown over. Do we have any visibility when this might end because that is hammered stocks like AMD and Intel? Right. So close-door meeting. Close-door meeting. They're reporting earnings soon. It's open to the motto. Yes, it is. All right. Let's take a look at what stocks are doing here as we leave you because we have seen an uptick overall across the board. So really what started as a very mixed picture today is turning more uniformly positive. All three major averages are higher here. It doesn't seem like there was any particular catalyst that I could see. There's chip makers being up, doesn't hurt matters, to be sure.

CEO Elon must though painting a brighter picture on demand in yesterday's earnings call. Take a listen. I can't emphasize enough. We have excellent demand for Q4 and we expect to sell every car that we make for as far into the future as we can see. For more on was that what must have to say let's bring in Yahoo Finances prize supermanian so process interesting you have those comments coming from Elon Musk saying that you know we want to reiterate demand is going to be strong for Q4 but we've also heard him talk about this gap that we're seeing between production and deliveries that seems to be the concern that's kind of weighing on the stock today. Yeah I feel like half the street is sort of seeing that delivery versus production sort of issue as a oh it's not a big deal to hiccup right now. We're still have significant loss of demand problem and must sort of saying that hey we're hitting a lot of issues with trucks and boats and our mother means a kind of transporting their cars to customers so they can't we they can't actually recognize those as delivery so he's sort of paying that picture but then also saying that oh we're also seeing demand soften in China Europe's getting hit by energy crisis and the US the Fed is hitting the US economy so he's talking about all these other things that are earning demand exactly but hey all we're going to deliver as much as we can Q4 looking great that's going to be a huge quarter for us they maintain that 50% compound annual growth rate for even for this year I mean they got to build like 500,000 cars in Q4 alone I mean look it's it's maybe look at the back of the math they could probably build 400,000 max maybe I could be wrong but that's looking more likely but they said hey we're going to do this we're going to hit that target around 1.4 1.5 million this year. Okay the headwind so outweighing sort of the positives that you just highlighted let's bring in another guest into the hour here we've got George, Jim, Rickas, a chemical originality managing director George let's just build on those comments from Praz you know what's your sense right now on why the stock is pulled back so significantly is this about the street just simply saying we don't necessarily buy this story that demand's going to stay strong in Q4. Well first thanks for having me and I think Praz kind of nailed it look it was an issue where there's a little bit of double speaker on the one hand for the first time that I can remember and I've been looking at the stock for a long time Elon Musk acknowledged that there was a demand issue particularly in China and if you guys remember several years ago when someone asked about demand he called it a boring question right so this might be the first time where you actually acknowledge a little bit of a of a down tick but at the same time he said the company would grow significantly in Q4 and we think they could do about 450,000 deliveries and then they're going to sell as many cars as they can build for the foreseeable future which is about 50% year of year growth as far as the I can see and so what we did is you know we thought about how we can square that circle and for us it came up to a couple of things first the company has had backlog for a really long period of time and they're probably going to drain a little bit of that Q4 there are some fleet sales the companies like hurts that they could maybe sell in Q4 that help and then when you look into 2023 specifically the cyber truck comes online and that really helps they start producing more in Austin they have Tesla semi sales and then beyond that hopefully we're out of this economic bump that they were in currently and EVs if you remember are really really really small percentage of overall sales and so that will start to help so we think there's some there's method to the madness and there's logic as to why you know he guided them to grow significantly this year and continue their growth and connection but I completely agree and understand there's too many breadcrumbs to that indicate that there's been a slowdown in the man and even acknowledge it in yesterday's call. Hey Georgia Prost again so I just wanted to talk to you about a couple of things that I sort of struck me last time the call you mentioned the cyber truck",https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TFE9bMjrlhU,65,2022-10-20 18:38:08
3781," and the man and even acknowledge it in yesterday's call. Hey, Georgia, I'm pros again. So I just wanted to talk to you about a couple of things that I, that sort of struck me last time the call. You mentioned the cyber truck, how they're going in the tooling phase and put for a potential sort of, I guess, production start in mid 2023. But also you mentioned the cheaper Tesla, the kind of entry level car that would potentially be half the cost or something like that versus the Model 3. What did you, what did you think about that? Because they actually kind of sort of confirmed that this is actually in the works. Yeah, so on the cyber truck, it's one of the things that may give the company a lot of confidence in growth in 23 and beyond because look, I'm pretty confident that the company won't keep the pricing that it discussed last time when they first introduced it. But remember, they had millions according to the press, millions of orders for the cyber truck, you know, starting in 2023. And so even if they have a lot of cancellations, that's a lot of demand. I personally would get one if my wife let me, but she told me she would be 10 driving it. So it's clearly an acquired taste and a lot of people really like it. You know, on the Robotaxi platform, it's a really interesting question. You know, and so basically you think about the company's ability to bring down the cost of production for a vehicle. They've done a really, really marvelous job with the Model 3 slash Model Y platform, which cost about, you know, somewhere in the mid $30,000 range to make. And when it comes to Robotaxi, that's another step down in production cost. That granted it won't be as a big of a vehicle. They'll be a lot of nuances to it. You know, probably won't have a steering wheel and some odd stuff like that that will enable autonomous driving. But it's another platform through which the company can reduce costs and help you these proliferate the gold. George, in terms of potential for buybacks, it sort of felt like Elon Musk dangle that carrot for investors who have been a little jittery around the stock. He said, five to $10 billion is certainly possible. These were his words for next year. I wonder what you make of that. How much of this is about trying to get those investors to stick it out, those who have been concerned about his distractions with Twitter. And is this really the best use of capital for a company? You know, should that be used towards more catpacks? Just to be blunt, we don't like it. You know, buybacks are things that companies like newspaper company do not Tesla that has significant opportunity in front of it. We think there's better use of capital to accelerate catpacks plans, to build cars, to build the robot army that Elon Musk wants to build. It's just, in our opinion, they're just better ways to accelerate their plans around, you know, having EVs proliferate the globe and other opportunities, including battery factories and robots. So look, I'm sure that they've done a lot of math behind it. And they want to see the support to stock down here in the 200s. But we think ultimately long term the best way to support the stock is to grow for as long as you can. George, we didn't even get to ask you about the valuation. And Elon Musk's calling for, you know, is the valuation for a Tesla could equal Apple and Saudi Aramco combined. But that's for another conversation, we're out of time here. George, you know, he gets Ken Accord, Genuity, Managing Director, our thanks to you and our thanks to Yahoo Finance's Pros Supermanian. Well, American Airlines topped Wall Street's estimates for the third quarter, reporting record revenue of $13.5 billion as demand remains strong for travel. Shares of the airline though, down nearly 3%, let's bring in our very own Brad Smith for a look at the numbers. It's a pretty steep fall when you consider how strong the quarter was. It is a pretty steep fall in the strong quarter that we've seen for a lot of airlines, at least to this point in time, over the course of the year and a season. You saw a record quarterly revenue for Delta. You saw that for American Airlines as well. That revenue coming in at $13.5 billion, which is actually a 13% increase over the same period, the comparable 2019 period is what the period that they're looking back to here. And we've heard that from many of the airlines at this point because that is the last time period that really represents full capacity. And that's the other side of this equation too. When are you going to see more of the airlines actually get back to full capacity? We know that United, American Airlines, they're right around 90% of that 2019 capacity.",https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TFE9bMjrlhU,66,2022-10-20 18:42:29
3782," This equation, too, when are you going to see more of the airlines actually get back to full capacity? We know that United American Airlines, they're right around 90 percent of that 2019 capacity, Delta lagging behind that just a little bit, but it's really this effort to do so wisely and diligently with the resources that they do have, whether that be the number of pilots, whether that be the hubs that they're operating in, and the number of routes that they're still flying. Anybody that has traveled over the last few months knows how high airline tickets have been. Yes. We've seen airlines not the only one, but sort of this offset that we're seeing with fuel costs going up, but then companies charging more. And when you look at where the revenue came in, how much of this had to do with the higher prices, they were able to charge? Well, they had to pass through a lot of that higher costs on the fuel side. American Airlines, rather, that fuel price was actually up 97 percent relative to years past when we had watched over the summer and many of the prices because of that demand, they knew that they could pass through that price and that cost was being absorbed by consumers. It's a larger question of, as those fuel prices start to come down, and these are contracts that they negotiate well in advance. So perhaps still working through what they had actually paid for some of the excesses that they would been able to have to operate so many of their routes and their flights. So perhaps as we work through that, you'll start to see some of those prices come down for the consumers, and especially going into a holiday season where it doesn't look like demand is going to dampen. We've heard that consistently throughout the quarter, throughout the results from American Airlines, from Delta, from Alaska Airlines even, is that the demand is strong right now? And so it's a larger question of when the customers will actually push back on pricing, but even with this capacity, it seems like they're still going to see some of that strength continue to move forward as well. Well, that was my follow-up question. Obviously we're going into one of the busiest seasons. When we heard early on it is the year, in the years that, you know, travelers were already booking flights for Q4. Right. But now we're talking about more economic headwinds. Do we get any more color on the outlook? And, you know, yes, holiday demand is still holding up, but when do they expect it to start to slow down? You know, it's actually, I think, an acknowledgement that they made on the call for American Airlines just a few minutes ago, and it is that they're actually going to be removing their business, or their first class, rather, and replacing that with more business class seats. And if there's anything that we can really extrapolate from that, it's in the fact that, with the absence of as much corporate travel demand as we had seen, and more of that leisure demand really relied upon. It's this bleezure customer that many of the airlines are talking about, and within that customer profile, how are you going to continue to be able to see some of the incremental costs, not just nickel and diamond people on baggage and things of that nature, but where are you going to up the experience and hopefully bring down the prices for those fares? It's going to be in the type of ticket somebody is purchasing, and then what is the add-on to that experience as well. And so it's not just the fare itself, but where else within that flying experience can you be able to make sure that we're increasing the value that we're giving customers. Yeah, you want a slight upgrade, but not full-first class, right? Yeah, no. In terms of costs. Bratz, but thanks so much for that. We'll share some AT&T on moving higher, and stronger subscriber growth help propel the company to a strong quarter. The wireless carrier added 964,000 subscribers in Q3, as well above analyst estimates while wireless revenue rose 6.6 or 5.6 percent. That marked the biggest quarterly improvement for the company in more than a decade. AT&T also reiterating its free cash flow guidance for the year, despite following short of analyst expectations in the quarter, you spoke with AT&T CFO earlier today. You're certainly going to have to say on business performance take a look. A meaningful portion of our subscriber additions in wireless come through our business relationships, and that channel has been and continues to be really efficient source of generating new subscribers. And so we're benefiting from that, and we're seeing just the consistency of our offer quarter after quarter, resonating with customers, and our sales team know how to execute it, and all those things are contributing to continued improvement in continued growth and subscribers, as well as higher all crews.",https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TFE9bMjrlhU,67,2022-10-20 18:46:48

But it cut its outlook for car load growth and stock repurchases. Joining us now to discuss the results, union Pacific, Lenspress, Lenspress is always good to have you on. Taking a look at the quarter here, it certainly look like increased pricing as well as fuel surcharges, certainly help drive revenue higher. But looking at the stock reaction today, investors concerned about those operational efficiencies that you sort of flagged along with the inflationary pressures. How much of that have you seen accelerate in this quarter? Yeah, Kiko, thank you for hosting me this morning. The quarter was a bit noisy. The fundamental story is we made sequential improvement from second quarter to third quarter in terms of fluidity, the network and operation inefficiencies. And as we exit and head into the fourth quarter, that continues. And so we're continuing to recover the network from where we were in the middle of the second quarter. And I anticipate back to normal in the fourth quarter. That's been our story all along. We showed that progress. Perhaps not as much progress as we had anticipated, but real progress nevertheless. Inside of that, to your point, we had solid pricing gains, good fuel surcharge recovery. And overall, the financials were strong, right? Record EPS net income operating income, free revenue. But at the same time, we did say that the heat's coming out of the marketplace that guidance that we gave at the beginning of the third quarter about what we thought volume would look like in the back half. We had to trim down because volumes cooling off a bit across a number of our markets. And so that was a lot of the conversation this morning. Yeah, talk to me a bit more about that. Where you're seeing the pullback in volume. And where are the biggest biggest headwinds for you right now? Yeah, it's mostly related to the consumer. So consumer oriented shipmen",https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TFE9bMjrlhU,68,2022-10-20 18:51:08
3784," pull back in volume. And where are the biggest, biggest headwinds for you right now? Yeah, it's mostly related to the consumer. So consumer oriented shipments on our railroad, that tends to be domestic intermodal parcel, you know, a few things driven by the consumer. Those are, those are looking like they're cooling off. The consumer has already been shifting from goods back to services, not all the way back. You recall there was a real fundamental shift towards goods during the pandemic. So it hasn't gone all the way back, but at the same time, it does appear that they're buying less. And you can see that in international intermodal boxes, hitting the West Coast ports, and you can also see it in demand for truck and demand for domestic intermodal on our railroad. There are some markets though that where we're seeing strong demand, and it's not going away, things like coal, some of the bulk commodities, grain, rock, and then a handful of our industrial segments as well. But the total picture says we're going to grow year over year in the fourth quarter. It's just not going to be as much as we thought it would. Last last time we spoke, we were talking about the labor agreements ongoing, and I saw the number here in your quarter, a hundred forty million dollar charge related to labor agreements. How comfortable are you with worthing stand right now on that front? Yeah, you know, I'm less comfortable than I was before the BNWE, our maintenance of way employees failed ratification, but I'm not concerned. We've got six unions having ratified, we've got five in the ratification vote, and we've got more work to do now with the BNWED. I think that vote failed to ratify for a very specific reason, the PEP, in addition to proposing wage levels, which are very attractive to our employees. They also said for about half, about 40% of that craft that does maintenance of way, we needed to adjust the travel that we would pay them to go from home to their away from home work location, and the per diem would pay while they were working away from home. That negotiation happened on property, and it just closed up on UP about a week ago, a couple of weeks ago, and that was at the very tail end of the ratification vote for that contract. So I think those were connected. We're back out now working with the BNWE to try to figure out a temporary agreement that can be or a tentative agreement that can be taken back out for ratification. I anticipate we're going to be able to do that. We've got status quo in place there. Other than that, we need to get through the ratification on these other five unions, and get this baby closed out by the end of the year. And I think that's still the probable outcome. So end of the year, still the timeline that you're looking at, despite some of the snacks that you've hit. Yeah, I am, you know, I guess the maintenance away employees could drag over into next year. I don't anticipate that. I think there's a there's a path forward for us to get another tentative agreement, get it back out for vote. Lance, it's always great to have you on the show, union Pacific CEO Lance Fritz, appreciate your time today. Thank you, Akiko. We're trying to this capital stepping up measures to stop the spread of COVID in Beijing once again. Let's bring in Yahoo Finance, Senior Health reporter, Angelie Kamalani. Angelie, it's interesting timing in all of this. Obviously, there's been a lot of focus on the party Congress. Xi Jinping sort of reiterated that he's not, zero COVID isn't going anywhere. And yet, there seems to be some rubblings about whether there could be a little loosening of a policy. A little loosening in inbound travel and quarantining there. There's also some discussion about what else can be done. We've seen some pushback, of course, in recent weeks that there have been some cases tied to quarantining and isolation that have resulted in negative results of 14-year-old, I believe, recently died after unclear whether or not she was taken to the center because she had COVID or was a COVID contact. So a lot of focus on the zero lockdown policy and what that means with ongoing lockdowns. It residents really struggling to access food and medicine. And because of that slight up to 18 new locally transmitted cases in a day, a certain residential compounds have now been locked down again. And we've seen in recent days certain parts of the country going back into lockdown mode, we know right near the Apple Hub the other day. So a lot of mixed, you know,",https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TFE9bMjrlhU,69,2022-10-20 18:55:23
3785," days, certain parts of the country going back into lockdown mode, we know right near the Apple Hub the other day. So a lot of mixed efforts and unclear whether or not it's actually doing anything to really pull back on the case rise because we've seen how even here, there still is a concern about rise in cases and these new transmissible variants are really going to make it hard for them to continue what has been now more than two years of this kind of lockdown. Yeah, so let's talk about what's happening here locally. I don't know, I walk out in here today and nobody's wearing a mask. No, they're not because the policy isn't there in place. And we started to see the uptick in cases again. What is that saying? And that is the concern. So we've started to see a few cases, a few areas of Manhattan rising above that 20% positivity rate as an average for the last 70s. And that is a sign of more increase. We saw the same uptick in the other boroughs in the last couple of months. And so it does seem to be sort of creeping back with a rise in COVID cases, which is not unexpected. Now the thing to watch is those new Omicron variants, the BQ1, BQ1, one. That's where experts are really keeping in their eye as the BAPI have started to decline in its presence around the country. We've seen in the New York, general New York area, which the CDC includes with Puerto Rico and New Jersey has also seen an increase in those numbers for BQ1 and BQ1, 120% almost. And that's a little bit higher than the national average right now. So definitely something to keep an eye on. Also a good reminder to go out and get your booster. Yes, if you haven't already. I know you're staying up top of that. All right, Angelique and Lonnie, thanks so much for that. Well coming up, short stay at number 10.

Shona Smith alongside Dave Briggs. the Dow and Nasdaq and S&P both trading to the downside, the Dow, which was up more than 300 points at the highs of the day, giving back some of those earlier gains after the hawkish comments that we've gotten from some fed officials throughout the day. Take a look at the Nasdaq. The Nasdaq off just around 6.10% of a percent S&P, you see falling further from 3,700 trading down another 7.10% of a percent today, Russell 2000, that small cap index off just around 1.5%. Take a look at the bond market, though. Once again, we are seeing yields push higher, the 10-year yield. Up another 10 basis points today to 4.22, that's the highest level that we've seen in the 10-year since 2008, the two-year yield, also pushing those highest levels that we've seen since 2007. The dollar index pulling back just a bit today, you can see it just below 113. Take a look at the sector action here as we enter the final hour of trading. You can see communication services, energy and technology, only three sectors holding on to gains today, technology just in positive territory, utilities and consumer discretionary, the underperformance. Let's look inside some of the major averages here. This is the Nasdaq 100, you can see Tesla off just over 6.5%. We brought you those earnings after the bell yesterday, that revenue miss, weighing on the stock today, you can see it off just around 6.5% and inside the Dow, a big reason why we're not further trading to the downside. Are the gains that we're looking at in IBM, IBM beating the streets estimates yesterday after the bell, we're seeing that reaction in the stock today, with IBM up just around 5%. I'm still processing Elon, telling us he's going to be bigger than Saudi-Iranco and Apple combined in market cap. That was a doozy, man. Thank you, Shana. Let's get you up to speed now on the cooling housing sector. Mortgage rates rising again, a 30-year fixed bearing down on 7%. Now averaging 6.94, that's the highest we've seen. Since April 2002, it's up slightly from last week and more than doubling. From the 309 we saw one year ago, Sam Cotter, Freddie Mac's chief economist says rates are, quote, adversely impacting the housing market in the form of declining demand. We're seeing that in today's existing home sales, selling at the slowest pace in September 2012, with the exception of the start of the pandemic. We hear that just about every day with housing, finally sales of previously owned homes, falling for the eighth, straight, month down 1.5% from the prior month and nearly 24% down year over year. Jared? Yeah, well let's get up to speed on some of the currency moves here, checking out the British pound. Now we know the U.S. dollar has been broadly stronger this year. That has been giving global markets, risk markets, a lot of consternation, and especially over there in Great Britain, where they saw their yields market, their guilt market, kind of get out of hand. And all of this comes from trust instituting some very conservative reforms. She was advocating for tax cuts and those were not liked by the market. Here's the British pound.",https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TFE9bMjrlhU,71,2022-10-20 19:04:11
3787," from Truss instituting some very conservative reforms. She was advocating for tax cuts and those were not liked by the market. Here's a British pound. Now, on her announcement of the resignation this morning, it did spike up so it got a little bit stronger, but you can see it has given back those gains. And I gotta tell you, even when it was up here, it wasn't even up 1%. So not a huge move. It was probably somewhat telegraphed. And I wanna show you the year to date move. Now, this is British pound losing 17% versus a US dollar. I'm gonna show some candlesticks so you can see the volatile price action, a little bit hard to see there, but that's some pretty volatile price action. Volatile enough that the entire package was revisited and the tax cuts no more. And the B of E, the Bank of England, had to intervene in their markets to support their pension system. I think all of this illustrating that's very, very difficult to institute reforms in the midst of a terrible recession over there, in the midst of a terrible market sell off, you gotta have incredible political will, I guess to overcome the prospect of losing your entire pension system. Having said that, markets seem to have stabilized a little bit, at least for the time being, on the promise that some of those economic reforms will not be reintroduced here. But just goes to show you that a lot can happen, that we're not thinking about, a lot from left field, when we talk about some of the moves in response to everything that we're seeing, guys. Lasted what, four scare moochies did. He tweeted that himself. I know. My mouth's out of this new order. Order Mary. Scare moochies, but good for him. Jumped on that, Jared. Thank you. From wall on the markets, we turn to Brian Jacobson, all spring, global investments, senior investment strategist. That's right, four scare moochies, if you missed that, Brian. Let me just quickly start over there in the UK. Is it going to make our equity markets a safe haven, or will we feel that pain eventually? You know, I think that we are going to see some of that pain, but it's more in the strength of the dollar. And we're already hearing about that from corporate America. Actually, this began, I think, with Microsoft, even back in March, when they were talking about how a stronger dollar was likely going to be weighing on the revenue growth. So the US is still a safe haven, but being a safe haven doesn't mean that there isn't some cost associated with that. The stronger dollar likely to be a headwind going forward for a lot of corporate America. And it's also been a bit of a headwind for US investors overseas. So here at Allspring on my multi-acet team, when we're looking at the global landscape, something we have to consider is the outlook for the currencies. And so if you've been a US-based investor investing in the UK, it's been a double whammy. You've got the declining markets and then also their currency depreciating as well. Brian, let's talk about, I guess, focus here on the US and specifically today. Once again, we're looking at all three the major averages trading to the downside after we got more hawkish comments from the Fed, the Fed's harker saying that he expects rates to be, quote, well above 4% by the end of the year. Clearly, it doesn't seem like we're out of the woods yet. I'm curious just from your perspective, what your view of the downside risk is from here? Yeah, so we actually think that we might be, not, I mean, this isn't really a copo, it's trying to answer it, but kind of a choppy bottom here, right? We've had this significant decline with the S&P 500 already. We think that we are likely going to go into recession in the first part of 2023 and markets typically begin rebounding. The median is around about four months before recession ends. So if we do get a rather short-lived recession, we think that we could get a decent recovery in 2023. So between now and then, we think it's actually more of a micro, as opposed to a macro story. And by that, I mean, talking to Ann Molletti, our head of fundamental equities, she has said that eventually every storm runs out of rain. And we have to ask ourselves, well, it kind of with Credence Clearwater Revival, the song, right, who will stop the rain? Well, sometimes it's the companies, as far as how well they're running their businesses, but then for the bigger picture, the macro environment, it's really the Fed, it's the Fed speak. So until they actually get close to the 4.5% what we think is their terminal rate, we think that we're still in for these ups and downs. Speaking my language, no way, Shana caught the CCR reference. I didn't. Wow, okay, I just wanted to be clear. No way, but Brian, I am with you. I'm with Dave to call me on, and I do. I try to fly under the radar there, but God. I'm with you on this issue.",https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TFE9bMjrlhU,72,2022-10-20 19:08:35
3788," I didn't. Wow. Okay. I just just want to be clear. No way. But Brian, I'm with the calm. Yeah. I'm trying to fly into the radar there. But God, I'm with the on the CCR though. That is some legendary stuff. So until then, how do we position ourselves, Brian? Yeah. So until then, the way that we're doing things on our systematic edge multi-acetine is trying to take a little bit more defensive positioning, but still trying to participate in the upside. So allocating more to active managers like Anne Molletti and the fundamental equity team there. And then as far as with doing the individual security selection on the fixed income side, because we think that there's actually a tremendous amount of value that can be derived from doing the sifting and winnowing between the winners and the losers. Who is it that's going to be positioned for gathering market share here? Well, everybody else seems to be struggling. But then from that broader kind of asset allocation perspective, you know, consumer staples. It's one of our favorite places, a little bit more defensive. They already got battered down in the first quarter, especially with the inventory overbilled that a lot of them have. We think that they're working through those issues. But then investment grade fixed income. So kind of that consumer staples for some defensiveness, but participation in the equity markets. And then doing the investment grade analysis on the fixed income side to generate some of that coupon income. Brian, when it takes, I guess when you're trying to figure out what's going to lead us higher, a catalyst that's going to make it stick other than inflation, other than the Fed pulling back anything else that you think could really push equities substantially higher from here. Yeah, so I was actually talking to our head of risk analytics the other day we were recording a podcast, kind of a spooky podcast about the things that to be afraid of in the markets for Halloween. And we were talking a lot about geopolitics, right? So Russia, Ukraine, that's a big wild card. How is that going to play out and win? Because, you know, it's kind of this binary outcome. It's going to be a deep, dark winter and a rather difficult recession for Europe. Unless, of course, there is some sort of breakthrough with the Russia Ukraine situation. And then it could actually be off to the races as far as a significant revaluation with European equity markets. So some of the geopolitical issues could really be that big catalyst. But otherwise day to day, it really feels like it is the Fed speak. You know, what did Harker mean when he said significantly higher than 4% if they could operationally define these terms? I think it would give a lot of investors a little bit more clarity that we're all seeking. Yeah, one more CCR reference long as I can see the light would be a good one for this moment here. Are you seeing that light thus far in the earnings reports? You know, so far, yes. And thankfully that light coming at you is not a train barrel and down at you. It actually does look like it's the sun coming out a little bit. Or at least it's the fact that some of these businesses, right, they are able to navigate this environment. And I think that's an incredibly important thing for investors to remember is that businesses are operated by managers and employees that can adapt to a changing environment. Right. So we shouldn't just assume that the way that they operated in the 80s or the 90s is the way that they operate today. You know, they're going to be dynamic. And that's one of the big reasons why we focus a lot on understanding corporate governance. So in terms of the ES and G for ESG investing, all of those are incredibly important. And right now it's really those that have the good corporate governance and good management that seem to be really exceeding the expectations. Brian Jacobson always great to have you. Thanks so much for joining us today. All right. We are just getting started here on Yahoo Finance live coming up. Many are concerned that the feds fight against inflation is going to send the US into a recession. Economist Mark Zandy gives us his take on what lies ahead.

It's not releasing a third quarter earnings after the bell will bring those numbers as soon as they break. Don't go anywhere.

3789,"...... You data out showing that jobless claims fell again. Some of the other signs that the Fed has more work to do in that notion was echoed by Philadelphia Fed President Patrick Harker today who warned in his speech that the Fed's going to have to keep raising rates for a while giving, quote, our frankly disappointing lack of progress on curtailing inflation. Let's bring in Mark Zanney, Moody's analytics chief economist Mark, it's great to see you. So I guess just to start off here from your perspective, we're all debating how much progress the Fed has made if any. So far what's your assessment of where we stand today and how much progress they have made? They made progress. They had two goals. One is to keep inflation expectations down close to their inflation target. The second is the slow growth in the job market, wage growth moving lower to help quell the inflation. On the inflation expectations objective, they succeeded. If you look at one year or five year forwards, that's inflation a year from now on the subsequent five year period. That of the bond market, these are investors putting the money where their mouth is. It's very consistent with the Fed's target of two to two and a half percent on the consumer of price index. And with regard to growth on jobs, same progress. If you go back say six months ago, average monthly job growth was about 500,000. Now it feels like it's about 300,000. Still a lot more work to be done here. We need to get down below 100K to get unemployment from stop to stop falling and start moving a little bit north and slowing the wage growth and quelling the inflation. So still more work to be done, but I think they've made progress. It's a pretty good progress since the beginning of the year. Will they need a recession to get things back to 2 percent? I don't think so. I mean, I don't say that with a lot of confidence. Recession risks obviously are very high. This is going to be very difficult. But my sense is that there is a path forward that will allow them to soften the economy. And I do think they laid out a script for us. The federal funds rate target, which is three to three and a quarter percent. It's headed to more than half to four and three quarters by early next year. And I think that should be.",https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TFE9bMjrlhU,74,2022-10-20 19:17:35
3790," us the federal funds rate target, which is three to three and a quarter percent. It's headed to more than half to four and three quarters by early next year. And I think that should be sufficient given the tightening and financial conditions that the kind of stock market the increase in the value of the dollar, the increase in mortgage rates, the tightening and bank underwriting standards to slow the economy sufficiently to get inflation moving in the right direction. But, but it is a it's a path, but it's a narrow path and it is getting narrower as we get these inflation statistics that are definitely a disappointment. Mark, when you I guess when you expect us to start seeing in the data that CPI that inflation has significantly cooled, are we talking two months from now, four months from now? I guess what's your best prediction on that? Yeah, I think over the next six months, we should see inflation CPI inflation, let's say rounding is eight percent ish. I think by next spring, we should be four percent ish and that assumes the main assumption there is that oil prices stay 90, 95 bucks a barrel right now. There are 85 bucks that would be consistent with $4 for gallon of regular and let it if we if we can manage that oil prices can stay roughly in that range, then the arithmetic here is in our favor because of the this is all year over year and we saw some big increases in oil energy prices a year ago. So that should bring in inflation to eight to four. The hard part is going to be though getting from four to two to two and a half. That's going to be more difficult that goes to. And then we're getting some better news there, but that'll take a while in the most difficult part of this will be getting the job market to slow get wage growth moderating because that's key to service price inflation and that's the last mile and that's going to take a while probably not until early 2024. And because of that, do you think at some point the Fed calls it a win with inflation around four percent? Yeah, so what I think they'll do is they'll follow the script. They'll go to four and a half four and three quarters by by end of January. That's the meeting in early early next year. They stop the tickle look around. They know that the impact of the rate hikes will filter through the financial system and economy with a long lag. So they want to take a look around. I want to make sure job growth is slowing as I anticipate that wage growth is rolling as I anticipate that inflation has moderated as I just articulated and moving in the right direction. And if it is, then that's the end of the story that four and a half percent upon rate is the so called terminal rate, the highest rate in the cycle and they'll keep it there until for a while into 2020 for until it's obvious that we're headed back to target or close to. But that would be a scenario where we kind of sort of squeak our way through avoid a recession, although I don't want to say on two polyannish under any scenario. The next year 18 months are going to feel pretty uncomfortable. It's just a matter of how much discomfort we're going to feel. I guess when we're also trying to figure out whether or not the risk here that the Fed is going to overshoot, I know you're saying that you expect them to pause. But what do you think the risk is though that they front load too much if we get a more aggressive rate hikes in the next two meetings before the end of the year. Are you concerned at all just about the spillover effect looking ahead to 2023. The risk here are two sided. They certainly could overshoot. They may not pause as I anticipate early next year they keep on going and something breaks in the financial system. The higher rates go the faster they go the longer they stay up, something in the financial system is not going to work as anticipated. We got a taste of that over in the UK a couple of three weeks ago when the British pension funds choked on the former Prime Minister's plan, so interest rates rise and it exposed some problems and their derivatives product that they've been using to match their assets and liabilities. That's very esoteric, but that's the kind of thing that you know will happen in a highly stressed environment with interest rates at high levels for an extended period. But you know there is also the other risk that they misjudge they should continue to tighten because inflation isn't moderating sufficiently. They keep rates too low at 4.5% for too long the inflation gets entrenched and that's a stack flation scenario, which is pretty ugly, particularly because we will ultimately experience recession, but just later and it will be more deep and severe. So the risks on either side that which you know obviously makes this really tricky going forward, hopefully they can kind of calibrate things.",https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TFE9bMjrlhU,75,2022-10-20 19:21:33
3791," but just later, and it'll be more deep and severe. So the risks on either side that, which obviously makes this really tricky going forward. Hopefully they can kind of calibrate things and get it roughly right. But a lot of risk around that. Mark, that's something many fear might break is the housing sector where we are seeing some fed success. If you want to see it that way, how much pain is it had in housing? How do you quantify it? Yeah, well, housing's the most race-sensitive sector of the economy. So it's not surprising it's taking it on the chin. I mean, this is by design. The Federal Reserve is raising rates to slow the economies growth rate, the job market, to quell inflation. And so housing is going to suffer. And it really is. It's getting nailed. You saw today's existing home sales numbers that gives you a sense of the hit to the man. The net goes to high rates. The 30-year fixed mortgage rates over 7%, you multiply that by the house prices. And it's just unaffordable for most people. Potential first-time laboratories just can't afford that. And then people will own their home with a mortgage. They're kind of locked in because if they have to sell their home, and get a new mortgage to buy another home at a much higher rate, that's just not going to work economically. So it does mean that house prices are going to come in. They have to come in. They are coming in pretty fast. I've been surprised at how fast they started to fall, particularly in places like California, we're already seeing 5%, 6%, 7% declines from the peak. So we should buckle in. And this is going to happen to me. I do expect even with no recession, we'll probably get a double-digit kind of decline in house prices nationwide peak to trough. I am hopeful though that that's not the place, anything where anything breaks, because in the sense of what's going on in the system, because the underlying quality of the mortgages, the underwriting, the bars has been excellent since the financial crisis. And of course, even with these house price declines, that's after a period of very strong house price growth. All you're doing is retracing part of the increase that we've experienced since the pandemic hit. So I'm hopeful we will see some increase in mortgage defaults and foreclosure and distress sales, but I am hopeful that that's modest. And so that's not, I don't think that's the place where the system will break. Moody's chief economist, Mark Zandee, good to see you, sir. Thank you.

3792," Today you can buy our FHV Someone call to fix it Sorry if I have to do it It's time for triple play three stocks that we are watching in the final 30 minutes of the on its softer second quarter with today's beat. Quest looks like it will be exiting the pandemic in a stronger position. I'll bear it. Analyst Eric Coldwell writing in a note to clients that the company's base business is quote, looking good city, highlighting that that business is picking up in August and September, which of course would vote well in the current quarter of the fourth quarter. And as we head into the new year, and Josh, I bring this play up because so many people were thinking that Quest I Nostas simply would not be able to hold the momentum that we saw during the pandemic that was strictly a pandemic play because of the role that they played in COVID testing, but the strong results from their base business they're really showing that they will be around to stay and they could be a power player in this space. Absolutely, and you know, it's a stock the street hasn't really loved either. Seven buys, 10 holds on the stock. It's not a stock that many analysts have been bullish on. So I think the earnings were very important for that case. And one other thing that was interesting from the call that I wanted to point out, Hurricane Ian impacting the company. The company specifically said that they had all time testing at all time highs in Florida, and then they saw a drag about five cents on their adjusted earnings because of Hurricane Ian and the slow downing testing. Something that I thought was interesting will probably see from some other companies that also have high volume in Florida. My play though is Seasers Entertainment. Shears up today marginally about half a percent, but that says the casino giant launches a new partnership with SL Green Realty Corp to redevelop 15-15 Broadway. That's a portion of Times Square here in New York City. And Seasers is the latest casino brand to pursue one of New York's three remaining casino licenses. Now it would come with a big cost, Dave, and expected $500 million in licensing fees. But the key here is gonna be the integration of Seasers Entertainment's rewards program because what you can do with those rewards, but they wanna do with this if they get the approval. You can go to Seasers, bet, win some money on the rewards, go to Broadway and spend it there. You can go somewhere else in Times Square and spend it out of restaurant, spend it out of bar. Now you're talking about a holistic experience in Times Square, one of the top tourist locations obviously in the country in the world. I think it could be a really big play for Seasers. I think they have about 65 million people already on Seasers' rewards. Think about how many more people are gonna go because they stop by for an hour or two while they're visiting New York. Yeah, and just from a real estate perspective, how I look at things, and you're looking at a vacancy rate in your 16% in Times Square, which is massive, and that of course is because the pandemic people have just not gone back. So there's a lot of fear from the traffic standpoint, you brought up a keyword, redevelopment. It's not a new construction, and that was key to that deal, even being even considered if it was new construction and non-element, but there's also a play, a win, combination over at Hudson Yards, which is in play for one of these new gaming licenses. So definitely, I think a home run at either one. My play is AAL, American Airlines. You'd think this sock is soaring on spectacular Q3 earnings, right? Well, not so much. American is the latest domestic airline, though, to report a very strong quarter beating expectation, seeing revenue surge 50% to 13.46 billion, there's CFO, Derek Kerr saying, and we've heard this from all of them. We currently see no signs of demand slowing, or that from United, we heard it from Delta. America expects power-sprays.",https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TFE9bMjrlhU,77,2022-10-20 19:30:27
3793," in their CFO Derek Kerr saying, we've heard this from all of them. We currently see no signs of demand slowing or that from United States or from Delta. American expects Q4 revenue 11 to 13% higher than the same period in 2019 with slower than planned aircraft deliveries and a shortage of regional pilots. Potentially the downside here, hampering growth a bit. But their CEO Robert Isom said the pilot shortage could take three years to resolve. That is a massive problem across all the domestics. Perhaps that or a buy the rumor sell the new situation. Why the stock is actually down about 4% today, shockingly and 28% year to date. One further note I want to discuss with you, Josh. International first class, they plan to drop it. They say no one is buying it, which is fascinating because we're seeing on the high end of luxury spending there's been no demand destruction, surprise, they're gonna replace it with all business. I'm very surprised by that. Every other company you look at, it seems like it's a trade-up environment. When it's high end, when we're talking high end goods, people are trading up. So interesting to see them cut that. I don't know, Sean, I don't know if I want to fly all the way to Europe in business class, right? But they still have the life, the life, wow, I didn't know that you are such a bougie child. You are so long-sled. Every day, I was that. But I think it is important to point out why they are doing this. They were saying that they simply just did not see the demand from customers. People weren't willing to pay up for that first class. So they're going to replace it with business class, which people seem to be much more willing to pay for. Obviously, because it's a little bit cheaper, so it's gonna cost you a lot. So if you're not willing to go on the coach, I think it's gonna be costing you quite a bit on your next trip. It is interesting though to see the stock react the way it is today, Dave. And it's hard to make sense of it. I think maybe it rose after we saw the strong results from Delta and United over the past week and a half. So now that maybe some of the excitement has already been baked into the stock, which is why we're seeing that 3.5% dip today, but the demand. Very, very strong. It's a reported strong top to bottom. It is a very strong gap. It's kind of unbelievable when you look at the strength there of a lot of the airlines in this quarter. Right, coming up next, the Texas Attorney General filing a lawsuit against Google over. It's over. How it collects biometric and data. Love the details for you after the break. This news is 30 minutes long.09",https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TFE9bMjrlhU,78,2022-10-20 19:34:52
3794," MUSIC Dexas Attorney General Ken Paxed is suing Google, accusing the tech giant of collecting biometric data from users without proper consent. Paxe and alleged Google has gathered millions of biometric identifiers, including fingerprints, voice prints, and records of face geometry through products and services like Google Photos, Google Assistant, and Nest Home Devices. In a statement, Google defends their products with spokesperson Jose Castaneda saying, in part, AG Paxed is once again mischaracterizing our products in another breathless lawsuit. We will set the record straight in court. Shares of Google parent, alphabet currently trading down just a bit, largely flat on the day. Okay, President Biden's student loan debt forgiveness plan facing a new legal challenge this time in the Supreme Court, Alexis Keenan, here with the details. What are we learning? Okay, so this is a Supreme Court challenge is the first time that one of these groups that is challenging President Biden's relief for student loan borrowers is showing up on the Supreme Court's desk, but it doesn't have the greatest chances of being granted because the court will probably never get to the merits. But let's kind of go through what's in this case. These are Wisconsin taxpayers. They're called the Brown County Taxpayers Association, their advocacy group. They want an emergency order to stop the debt relief, say no student debt relief at all. They say that President is unconstitutionally usurping the power of Congress, the power of the purse to spend the taxpayers' money. They have a big issue with the dollar amount on this, saying that up to a trillion dollars is estimated as a cost to taxpayers. So they really take issue with the president, unilaterally going in and spending that kind of money. Now, they also object to the fact that this relief is being granted under the 2003 Heroes Act, and that was a law that was invoked in 2003 to give relief for families that were serving in Iraq and Afghanistan to give them debt relief. And so they're saying that this isn't the law that should be used in order to do this. So I want to read just part of the application to you. This is what these taxpayers from Wisconsin are saying. They say the president has transformed a law designed to benefit military personnel and first responders into a warrant to transfer hundreds of billions or perhaps over a trillion dollars in debt onto taxpayers. They add that if this program goes forward as planned on Sunday, then the president will unilaterally spend roughly 4% of the nation's GDP. If you look at 2021 GDP for the year, that was approximately $23 trillion. So they may have a point there, and it is a little unsettling, right? So the estimated cost of relief has come from CBO at about 400 billion all the way up to over a trillion dollars coming from the University of Pennsylvania. Alex, is this how strong do you think this argument is? I mean, just the odds that the Supreme Court is going to be able or will give the taxpayer group what they're asking for? So the reason it's so slim is because they have a problem with what's called standing, and that means that any group that's going to come in and try to start a lawsuit, they have to have a particularized interest in the case. And what that means is they have to show that they have a concrete injury that could result if the debt relief goes through that is specific to them, that it doesn't apply to everybody. Problem here is if you're a taxpayer and you say all taxpayers are harmed, that's everybody. And you can't use the courts for that purpose. So that is the problem that all these groups are having and trying to challenge the debt relief is that they're coming in and they're not able to stand on footing that says, we're different from other groups and we're going to be harmed for a particular reason. The Supreme Court has long rejected the idea that you can come in and start a case on those grounds. So they probably will never get to the merits of this particular case. We'll be interesting to see, though, how it all plays out. Alexis, thanks so much.",https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TFE9bMjrlhU,79,2022-10-20 19:38:54
3795," that you can come in and start a case on those grounds. So they probably will never get to the merits of this particular case. We'll be interested to see how it all plays out. All right, Alexis, thanks so much. Let's stick with college. I guess into college enrollment, despite the Biden administration's push to reduce costs for students. College enrollment has declined once again. Now, data from the National Student Clearinghouse showing that college enrollment declined 1.1% this fall, which is less than 3.1% decline that we saw last fall. Graduate student enrollment also declining about 1%. Universities that are seeing upticks include historically black colleges and universities, the HBCUs, and online schools. And Dave, we talk about the high cost of school. Obviously, that's a huge, a barrier to entry to some people out there. Also, the fact that maybe the college degree, and this is up for debate, maybe it's not as valuable as it once was. People are still getting hired and getting paid very well when they don't have college degrees. And as a result of this, we're seeing people opt not to go to school and go another, maybe more untraditional around. Yeah, I think those are the two factors. And back to the cost. I mean, it's up 169%. The cost of a four-year college since 1980. That is massive far outpacing inflation needless to say. But anecdotally, you do hear more about that than you ever did prior to the pandemic. About people just weighing the overall factors and the benefits of going to these college. And maybe that's because of a cost analysis. You're just trying to figure out, does it make sense? I've heard it from my own children, which is quite frankly surprising. One interesting surprise in that report that highly selective colleges are down 5.6% the largest decline. And last year, those same colleges were up more than 10%. So that is a massive turn. And that upper tier of colleges can't exactly explain it. Maybe that is the cost. Maybe this will wear off as we do back out of the pandemic. But it is certainly a trend. Yeah, and I also thought it was interesting just in terms of the online schools, a Roman up overall, 3% from last fall. But for students aged 18 to 20, that enrollment figure was up 23.4% over the past two years since the start of the pandemic. So I think more traditionally, when people went back to school, if you were older, maybe not really in that 18 to 20 age group, and you would have maybe have opted for online just because it's easier. You have a family, you have a job. It makes more sense. And we're seeing more people in that age group 18 to 20 years old opt for that online option. So it's interesting. We should also follow just how much more competitive it could potentially be to get into some of those online programs. It is so brutal getting into college today, not like the application process we endured. All right, ahead. Existing home sales falling for the eighth, straight month to a 10 year low. We'll talk about what lies ahead for housing. Come on up. All right. All right. All right. All right. All right. All right. All right. All right.",https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TFE9bMjrlhU,80,2022-10-20 19:43:03
3796," All right. If there's one sector of the economy truly feeling the impact of dramatically higher rates from the Federal Reserve, it's housing. The mortgage rates today up to their highest level since 2002, also existing home sales at their 2012 levels. Darrell Fairweather is the chief economist at Redfin and insider contributor Darrell nice to see you. So first, how high do you think rates will climb and how do you really characterize what we're seeing right now? Because somebody just say it's kind of a cooling off, a normalization, but others feel like there's a crash coming. It's hard to say how high rates will get. They've already gone higher than I was expecting them to get. Inflation has proven to be a tougher problem for the Fed than anyone originally envisioned. And they've had to fight that with higher short-term rates, which translates to higher rates. If the Fed does send us into a recession, then rates will come down, mortgage rates will come back down. But it's hard to say like how much longer we can stay in this state with high inflation and high GDP growth and high interest rates. Darrell, when you take a look at some of the projections out there, some are saying that the national, we will see a national collapse in home values. That is very likely at this point. We have started to see the price growth come down, but we need to still compare it to the levels that we were seeing pre-pandemic. We're still substantially higher, right? So I guess in terms of the degree of this drop, what are you expecting? Well, prices have come down from how high they were earlier this year. Earlier this year, there was this mad dash to buy a home while rates still sat below 4%. And now that's gone. Activity is severely down. People aren't buying homes like they were a couple months ago because it's just not a good deal. The median mortgage payment on a home that's on the market right now is 50% higher than it would have been last year. And most people just don't have 50% extra in their housing budget. They either have to go to the rental market, or they have to figure out a situation where they're living in a much more affordable area or in a kind of home that they have to compromise on. Are you seeing Darrell things begin to level out? There's like Wells Fargo with you to note, yesterday suggesting they think things will get a lot worse in 23. So prices have stayed relatively high. They're still up about 6% from where they were last year. And they've been kind of stable over the last two months. But now the mortgage rates are close 7%. We had this extra increase in mortgage rates. I think that prices could come down to basically the same place they were last year. And as a chance that in 2023 prices will be 5% lower than they were in 2022. Now they'll still be a lot higher than they were in 2021, 2020 pre pandemic. So it's not like many homeowners are really going to feel that pain. They'll still be worth more than what they bought it for. But it is still a very different housing market than what we've been experiencing for the last couple of years where prices always go up. Darrell, what do you make of the news that we got this week from the home builder sentiment following for the 10th straight months, of course, right now in terms of I guess worry about supply, what that's going to look like when you square that off with demand. What we heard from them, I guess the fact that it hasn't been improving at all. How worrisome is that for the real estate market? The fundamental problem in the housing market is a lack of supply. And even though mortgage rates are up and demand is down, supply is down too. New listings are down about 18% from last year. New listings sales are down 30%.",https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TFE9bMjrlhU,81,2022-10-20 19:47:36
3797," Market is a lack of supply and even though mortgage rates are up and demand is down, supply is down to new listings are down about 18% from last year. Pending sales are down 30%. So there's still less demand than there is new listings with those new listings are not coming on the market. So there's still this fundamental lack of homes available if you actually are in the market right now. You're probably a bit disappointed looking around and thinking like as us all there is out there because there aren't these new homes coming from existing homeowners or from new construction builders are having to pay these higher interest rates and they're worried about demand to they don't have a lot of motivation to build right now. Although some positivity in a Bloomberg report 1.7 million housing units currently under construction that is an all time high so maybe there's a glimmer of hope on the horizon are there particular regions you see suffering a bigger decline in others and where are they? Well the Southwest is certainly off of its sugar high from the pandemic when everyone was moving there places like Austin and Phoenix they're having some of the biggest swings and prices and then Florida and it's been battling this hurricane so sales of decline even more there and it was also a previously hot market. The Midwest was pretty stable throughout the pandemic prices didn't go up all that much and as a result prices aren't really coming down very much there either and in the expensive areas demand is down because those high mortgage rates can translate to like a thousand extra dollars a month for a home in Los Angeles and Francisco or Washington DC so that's just too much costs for a lot of people in those markets to bear. When you're trying to figure out how much uglier it's going to get from here what's the number one thing that you're watching. This is just watching for what happens with inflation and our rental data we can see that for new rentals coming on the market rents rent growth is already slowed it's half of what it was earlier this year so that's a good sign that what the Fed is doing is working but it's going to take time for that really early data that we're seeing in terms of listings of translate into the cost that. Data day consumers are facing and the fed isn't going to reverse course make till they feel like they really squashed inflation out entirely so we'll see how long that takes and how high the standard the fed is going to set for when they feel like it's time to reverse course on these interest rate high. We'll write to all fair what they're always great to have you thanks so much. Coming up JP Morgan CEO Jamie Dimon describing Bitcoin as a Ponzi scheme but the bank is making a big bet on crypto we've got the details next.",https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TFE9bMjrlhU,82,2022-10-20 19:52:10
3798," So This fight Jamie Dimon's opinion on Bitcoin, JPMorgan Chase making a big hire to focus on crypto policy at the bank. And it's not the only company adding to its ranks. David Hallerith is here with the detail. We've seen two notable crypto hires in the last day or so. And it's a sign of the times, I guess, despite hiring slowdowns and major work for force cuts that we've seen from crypto companies earlier this year, there's still very much a premium to be paid for executives with a law, policy and regulation background. As you mentioned, JPMorgan Chase is hired a new head of regulation. The executive who certainly has some interesting work force or workplace stories to tell, formally came from the Celsius network and there he served as head of policy in regulatory affairs. Also Binance US, the smaller US subsidiary of the major exchange has hired former FBI agent BJ Kang. A decorated federal agent, Kang is known for having been involved in a number of high profile white collar crime cases involving insider trading and cybercrime, most notably leading to the arrests of Bernie Madoff. While JPMorgan wouldn't comment on the higher Binance US has said that this is a part of their larger effort to bolster compliance legal and regulatory affairs. And I think that speaks to what's been going on in the sector, although prices have declined. We did see a wave of financial contagion earlier over the summer and obviously we're still seeing a number of hacks this year getting to be a record. David, you're also following a court hearing around the bankruptcy of Celsius. What's the latest there? Yeah, so we didn't get a lot of takeaways today from the hearing, but the main thing going on is that the timeline for bidding procedures for the case has been set and that is hopefully going to be finalized before the end of December. So that being said, there's also sort of a dispute going on right now between whether investors and customers should be treated the same way in the case. A conclusion there remains to be seen. But the federal bankruptcy judge today did raise an interesting point, which is just the situation with the bankruptcy is that it's a bit of a melting ice cube. And there's concerns that Celsius might not have money to continue going through this chapter 11 process come January so there is definitely a timeline there and the case needs to sort of be settled before then. David Hallerith, good stuff. Appreciate that. All right, let's check out Tesla now, trading lower ahead of the clothes. The electric carmaker shares taking a hit after reporting a third quarter revenue miss Elon Musk remaining bullish despite the fact the company is saying it will miss its annual delivery target. You can see shares down more than 6% on the day. He also said the company putting the pedal to the metal come rain or shine and that they are not reducing production in any meaningful way recession or not recession. In China, we're beginning to see a few analysts come out and say quite frankly, the evaluation, the valuation just doesn't make sense. It doesn't add up. Talking, I'm on my favorite quote is Elon saying they imagine combined market cap more than Saudi ramco or Apple or combined more than four. Yeah. We get dollars. Yeah, I mean, he always has these lofty goals. Sometimes he meets them. Sometimes he doesn't.",https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TFE9bMjrlhU,83,2022-10-20 19:56:10
3799," And dogs. Yeah, I mean, he always has these lofty goals. Sometimes he meets them. Sometimes he does. It's hard to see at least right now, Tesla's surpassing that. But you mentioned some of the reaction that we've gotten from the street. Bernstein was out with the notes saying that their earnings call just simply did not sit well with them. I think there's lots of questions just about deliveries and production going forward. So many headwinds, also the fact that we're entering into a recession, certainly a time of a period of a slowdown. What that's going to do to consumer spending. And then of course, a Twitter deal. What that means for Elon Musk, how much time that's going to mean that he's a little bit distracted. And how many more shares he will have for himself as well. Yep. 48% year to date. Coming up, we're counting down to the closing bell on Wall Street. We'll see you on Yahoo Finance Law.ârannn. Tape Tape. Here. A And then. Here. We are just a few minutes so go ahead and get some of the best time to do this. Let's get to it from the closing bell. It's bringing you to the market action. A lot of red on the board once again. It's not too bad. I have to tell you something. Tomorrow is op-ex. We're talking about this over the break. Eight of the last nine Fridays have been in the red. We'll have to see what comes tomorrow. Op-ex, options expiration has had a negative seasonality to it. This happens once per month. We can check for a few days. We're doing it right now. We'll have to see how much it costs to go on the board. We're going to see how much the communication services tech and energy just barely in the green. No big gains there. Utilities, industrials and consumer discretionary. Those are the biggest losers utilities off by two and a half percent. That says that yield curve in the US continues to scream higher. Just looking at the board here. A little bit of a mix picture. Looks like we got 30 seconds to go. a head and shoulders top a massive one remains to be seen we'd have to break down a little bit more. But in the meantime want to leave you as I often.",https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TFE9bMjrlhU,84,2022-10-20 20:01:13
3800," Taking a look at this over the break as well, is this a head and shoulders top a massive one? Remains to be seen we'd have to break down a little bit more, but in the meantime, want to leave you, as I often do, with the travel setup here, we got Expedia down about 3% American down 3 and a half percent, and Carval, that is up 4% here's a closing down. That marks another down day here for the market, Dow closing off just around 91 points, SMB off around 8% of a percent NASDAQ off 6% of a percent. You're looking at the Dow and negative territory. We actually were up over 300 points at the highs of the day to look at the sector action, communication services, energy and technology, the only sectors to close in the green this afternoon. Come on, let's bring in Reese Williams, a sprouting rock asset management, chief strategist. We also have Teddy Parish, a parish capital CEO and CIO. Teddy, let me start with you, because we certainly got a number of strong earnings reports over the last several days. It looks like the market, though, largely shrugging that off, focused on more so on what we're hearing from Fed officials, but what's your takeaway of the action that we've seen today? Well, I think the market is anticipating some downgrades in earnings. We haven't gotten much of that lately, but even if we do have a great-hired season and not much in the way of downgrades to Eston, then I think the market's still, market action is still going to hinge on the fact that the Fed is still there, waiting to push rates up and to eventually push us into a recession. So that's a black cloud that is not going to go away because inflation is still there and it's excess. So the Fed's going to be vigilant and they're going to continue to be until they see signs of inflation actually subsiding. And no signs of it yet, Riz, thematically, what are you seeing generally speaking from earnings in your expectations as we head towards big tech earnings? So in general, I would say earnings have been maybe less bad than feared. I mean, I think there's a lot of uncomfortness about how things were going to be playing out. And in general, if you came in with pretty low expectations, no matter what you reported, the stocks have gone up. Similarly, actually, if people had high expectations for if you were in a other defensive sector, some of those stocks had actually sold off. So it's been a little contrarian in terms of stock performance. But in general, I don't see any huge downgrades, I would agree, in earnings estimates for the fourth quarter, relative to expectations. I think that's more likely to come into the first quarter as the economy continues to slow. Teddy, you mentioned the fact that you expect the Fed to remain hawkish and to keep raising rates. I guess, what extent is that going to push us into a recession? And how deep could that recession potentially be? Well, we would hope that the recession is shallow, but the Fed has never been on a path of increasing rates this far so fast and not push us into a recession. So the chances of probably pretty high that you're going to continue to push rates up. And the economy's pretty healthy. Consumers pretty healthy and corporations are pretty healthy. So with that backdrop, I think that it could be a shallow recession, but to the extent that rates are not just pushed up to a point of actually stalling the economy. One of the main things that has to happen is for money supply to actually decline and we haven't had a whole lot of that. But because it's not like they can go in and actually take money out of a consumer's check-in account. So there are a lot of moving parts and some other potential issues outside of just a Fed that could make the recession more deep. So we're hoping it's shallow, but we don't know. Teddy, do you think the Fed should pause? Do you think they're over tightening? No, I think it's necessary. OK, I think it's necessary. I think that inflation is embedded in the economy. And wage inflation is very sticky. And it's on the cost of becoming secular. So in the labor pool, it's such that it can't be expanded very fast. So I think they need the addressed issue. I mean, we take that.",https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TFE9bMjrlhU,85,2022-10-20 20:04:55
3801," So in the labor pool, it's such that it can't be expanded very fast. So I think they need the address to the issue. I mean, we've had a whole generation of easy money. I mean, out of the 10 years of very easy money, you know, we had to pay the price at some point and we reached that day. What do you think, Reese, do you agree? I'll take the other side of that with respect. I think the Fed should, if not pause, at least right raise more slowly than they are. I think the consensus is they're going to go 75 and then maybe another 75 in November and December. I just think that's too much. And I think everybody's very focused on the CPI numbers, which are alarmingly high. But a lot of that is in how they calculate rent and actually rents went way up more than the CPI reflected in 2021. And actually, they're starting to kind of roll over now. So I just think there's a lot of anecdotal evidence from modern prices to what's going on in the housing market, to auto sales, that things are starting to really slow. And then that doesn't even talk about what's going on overseas because the idea that Europe will be anything but a severe recession is super unlikely. And then China is its own little drummer. And that has been the engine of growth for the last 20 years. And frankly, that's missing an action right now. And Teddy, given all the macro conditions we've talked about, how do any sectors, any names you like? Well, we're a high value growth at a reasonable price, core managers, equity managers. So we like a lot of things now. We're overweight, staples, health care, industrials, and even financials at this point. We think that a lot of the images already been done, especially in some of the higher flying areas, and there are some great values. If you look inside and that's a wonder for instance, companies have gotten slaughtered over the past year. And I think that you can shift through those companies and find some great long-term holdings and technology as well. But we like names with high dividends, high end growing dividends, great balance seats which should flow down to a better cost of capital in this higher interest rate environment. Chris, given the uncertainty out there, where are you putting money to work and I guess where are you seeing the most opportunity? Well, I think sort of one country area and opportunity right now is REITs. And that is that they've done really poorly this year because bond market has done so poorly. And I think everybody's very consumed with the fact of how far the Fed's going to go. But no matter what the Fed does in November and December, I think long rates are close to peaking. And that should be good for REITs, which basically are priced off the 10 year. So I think there's a little bit more room on the upside for the 10 year yield. But I think it goes higher than this. A mild recession turns into something worse six months from now. So I definitely think the bond market is going to start sniffing out recession and start being your friend going forward. Good stuff there. Reese Williams, Teddy Parish, thank you both. Appreciate that.

3803," Miss Sun revenue they came in with 1.13 billion. We were expecting 1.14 billion, although adjusted EPS came in at 8 cents. We were expecting a loss of 2 cents, so not bad there. They also beat on active users. They have 363 million versus an expectation of 358.7. Now they also authorized a $500 million stock buyback. The bad news comes, though, because they're not giving us any guidance as to Q4. They say it's highly likely that year of year revenue growth will decelerate as we move through the fourth quarter, due in large part to the fact that the fourth quarter has historically been relatively more dependent on brand-oriented advertising revenue, excuse me, which declined slightly on a year of year basis in the most recent quarter. So that's probably why we're seeing the stock down. It was around 20% at one point, but now we're looking at it down 17%. Big problems for SNAP. They've been facing this downturn in their stock price. It was down 77% year to date as of today. And they're dealing with the same kind of advertising issues that Facebook is, meta, rather, and other social media companies where they're seeing a pullback in advertising spending, plus they have to contend with that change that Apple made to its privacy settings in iOS. And so this is the result of that. We have to see, I guess, what we'll get out of the other social media companies as we see them report later next week. But you could see already meta-reacting to this two-degree down 4% Twitter off just slightly in Pinterest down 7% a little more. So, you know, it remains to be seen how badly this will hit the likes of meta Pinterest Twitter. But for SNAP, a really not good look going forward. Yeah, certainly a reminiscent of what we've heard in previous quarter, snapping the first of report SNAP, citing this slower advertising spending as a huge headwind and that, of course, playing out as some of the other larger tech players that have followed. So something that we, of course, will continue to watch that slower growth number in terms of revenue, 1.13 billion, Dave. The slowest growth that we have seen here for the company, but they did add new users, daily active users, 363 million estimate out there, what sort of 358.7 million. I think a lot of us have been trying to figure out what exactly the future looks like for SNAP, given its size compared to a lot of its larger competitors out there. And the fact that the company simply hasn't been too innovative recently either, just in terms of trying to differentiate their business as well. That is entirely what I was going to ask Dan Halley about it. He mentioned the 77% year to date. They're down 85% in the last 12 months. Dan, the one thing we have heard in recent months is the SNAP plus subscription service. I'm not sure if you can evaluate how successful that has been or what the talk is in terms of Shana's point. What is the catalyst? What is the innovation in the pipeline? Have you heard about anything? Yeah, I mean, look, they canceled their drone. They were supposed to be working on trying to save cash there. They had laid off about 20% of its workforce. I don't think anything really is working too well for the company right now. They do have the subscription model. That gets users access to certain different types of filters, early access to some features. But as you said, it really doesn't feel as though we're seeing too much innovation coming out of SNAP. But again, this also comes down to the advertising issues that we're seeing across the board. And we could continue to see going forward. So advertising first company right here, they're trying to diversify with that. There's scripture model. I don't know how many people are actually wanting to jump in and pay for SNAP when there's other free services out there. And oh, yeah, the 800 pound gorilla in the room that's still chomping at the heels of the lights of meta is TikTok. And that's free. And you don't have to sign up to get any special filters or anything. So, you know, it doesn't look very good for SNAP. Younger users are flocking to TikTok still using Instagram, Meta's Facebook. I mean, that's basically the rear view mirror right now as far as younger users. So SNAP, it's kind of in the middle there. So how it kind of moves forward and how we start to see it potentially turn around. I think just comes down to when we start to see that turn around in the advertising market. Yeah, the high school kids really use SNAP as a texting service as the dead of two high school kids. One million users, a SNAP plus as of August. So not a huge revenue generator.",https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TFE9bMjrlhU,88,2022-10-20 20:18:01
3804," nap as a texting service as the dad of two high school kids. One million users a snap plus as of August. So not a huge revenue generator there. Dan Howley good stuff. Appreciate that. Yeah, not a whole lot of catalyst ahead. It looks like Shana. No, not. Everyone has a tick talk problem. Everyone has an ad environment problem. And especially if we go into a recession. Yeah, you know so they met you would have to think that this is indicative of maybe of what we'll see from some of those larger players out there. We saw a meta sliding on the news Pinterest off just over five percent. So be interesting sector to watch here in the weeks ahead. All right, new data revealing that if you want to advance in the workplace where you work matters a lot. We'll break down the findings after the break. Welcome back on today's labor market. You might not need a bachelor's degree to work your way up the ladder and land a strong job. A new index measures which companies are most likely to create economic mobility for workers without college degree joining us now. We want to bring in Matt Eagleman, he's president of the Burning Glass Institute for today's installment of career control, which is brought to you by straight talk wireless Matt. It's great to see you. So let's get into the index and what you found the American opportunity index you revealed which large companies are doing it best in terms of advancing workers in the workplace. What did you find? Well, Shana, we found is that where you work matters a lot for whether you move ahead in your career. We constructed a an index to be able to essentially create a yardstick for the American dream. A lot of us are concerned about about intergenerational mobility in the words, do you do better than your parents? If you're born in the 1940s about 90 plus percent of people were going to do better than their parents. If you're born in the 1980s that was down to the best even odds. And so what we",https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TFE9bMjrlhU,89,2022-10-20 20:22:27
3805," about 90 plus percent of people were going to do better than their parents if you're born in the 1980s that was down to at best even odds. And so what we wanted to look at is the role that companies play in facilitating mobility for their workers. We tracked three million workers of the Fortune 250 over five years in 19 sorry from 2017 to 2021 and we looked at how they progress both within their companies and beyond their company. And who are the companies that did best? Are they concentrated in particular sectors? So it was actually very interesting to see how broad spread good practices. If you look at the top companies you're looking at folks like AT&T and the one-hand AMX you're looking at Cisco but also companies like PG&E, Southwest Airlines, International Paper, across the top 50 companies in America in terms of their creating opportunity for workers. They represented 21 of the 27 industries that we tracked. Matt when you take a look at pay how critical that is transparency there what did you find in terms of that with the companies that ranked in your top 10? So we were pretty God's Mac at just how much difference there is for workers in pay. Now first of all I should say that we looked everything we looked at we looked at based upon what role you're in right you don't want to compare people who are software engineers with people who are working retail roles. But even for let's take an ad men an ad men working at a top quintile company where the company is doing best is making two and a half times an ad men at a company in the bottom quintile. Just put real dollars on that that's the difference between making $82,000 a year and $34,000 a year. Well of course your career that's a million and a half dollars. I'm just curious are those companies that are that that were employees have upward mobility are they finding more success? This matters a lot not just for workers but for companies as well. One of the metrics that we looked at was how much retention benefit there is. So ultimately for workers that matters because you got to be in it to win it if you don't stick around then it's hard to move ahead. But we found that companies that were in the top quintile of retention were twice as likely to keep workers of the span of five years. At a time when so many companies are scrambling for talent the ability to literally double the length of service that you have the length of relationship you have an employer with employee can make a profound difference from business impact. Madam curious do you see any difference or a theme at all just in terms of flexibility when it comes to work working from home versus working in the office or maybe having that hybrid schedule or did that at all play into maybe the success that some companies have in retaining that top talent? So worker flexibility is something that is really important in terms of in terms of worker opportunity and work from mobility. But I want to emphasize that it's not just something that you do because it's good for workers in the same way that helping people stick around longer is good for workers it's good for employers. When you provide flexibility it turns out that's a lot of the reason why workers stay particularly when we talk about industries like retail or industries that have big frontline workforces. Think about you know a lot of retailers have literally 150% staff turn over a year. It's just tremendous just amount of effort that it takes to feed that machine. A lot of workers at that level are leaving for reasons of schedule and they're leaving for reasons of convenience. So if you can address that upfront you can make a significant impact in terms of the kind of relationship you have with your workers on the one side and their ability to move up on the other. So when we talk about flexibility is the desire when they work or where they work? Well there's a little bit of both. Let's remember that we're talking here in the index. We focused on the kind of jobs that are open to those without college degrees. That doesn't just mean frontline workers it's also finance managers.",https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TFE9bMjrlhU,90,2022-10-20 20:26:36
3806," focused on the kind of jobs that are open to those without college degrees. That doesn't just mean frontline workers. It's also finance managers, a bunch of other jobs where some people have a degree, some people don't. But the further south you go along the level of educational attainment that someone has, the more likely they are to be working in a job where they don't have a choice. If you're stocking shelves at a big retailer, you can't work by them. If you're a philbotomist working at a big healthcare company, you can't work by Zoom. So location matters, but the ability to set shifts, the ability to have flexibility and other dimensions of work assignments makes a big difference. Alright, an important stuff right there. Matt Siegelman, thanks so much for joining us. We appreciate it. We want to follow some breaking news here from Snap. Now the stock continuing to plunge after reporting its latest quarterly results. Adjusted EPS actually coming in better than expected, eight cents, but revenue of slight mis there. It was the slowest quarterly sales growth for the company on record revenue growing just six percent. It is the first time that that has slipped into single digits since the company went public back in 2017. Also, we know, we know the fact that this that the tech sector really at large has been struggling with the fact that we have seen a slowdown in advertising, spending. So of course, that having a direct impact on Snap's business, you can see that as a big reason for that slower than expected, quarterly sales growth number. Now we're off 25 percent. Snap though far from the only tech tech player here in the red as a result you're seeing a drag. Meta off just nearly 5 percent Twitter just in the red Pinterest. So look at that off nearly eight percent. Alright, coming up liquid death, the boasting evaluation of 700 million dollars and as a partnership with Martha Stewart, how thinking outside the bottle is helping the company disrupt the water market when we come back.",https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TFE9bMjrlhU,91,2022-10-20 20:31:13
3807," Hi, I'm Martha Stewart. I recently heard about an interesting new beverage company called Liquid Death. Don't worry, it's just water. And together we teamed up to create an utterly delightful candle. Martha Stewart, just one of many celebrities endorsing this out of the box or in this case, bottle, water brand, joining me now to discuss what sets this business apart is Mike Cesario, Liquid Death Co. founder and CEO, also Yahoo Fanat's own Rook De Palma joining us as well. Mike, good to see you. This is a phenomenal story. Your latest raise values the company at $700 million. I can't help but think if you'd have walked into Shark Tank in 2019 trying to sell water in a can, how would they have reacted and what's the origin story? Yeah, I mean, I think people forget two things. One, how big the beverage industry really is. And two, how much brand actually plays a role in it. I think when you look at other industries like fashion, for example, people can understand somehow easier. Why does a Gucci t-shirt that's 100% cotton sell for $750 when the same exact t-shirt from the same exact material you can buy and target for $15.99? Same exact thing performs the same exact function, but people can clearly understand why brand can completely change the value story for a given product. It just doesn't happen as much in CPG. But yeah, essentially, we're building a brand that's bigger than just water in a can. And I think that's why we've sold last year, we did $3 million in Merch and a Perl as a beverage company, as a water company. We've got four million followers on TikTok and Instagram, which the only two brands ahead of us are basically Monster and Red Bull. So when you really are building a brand, it's a very different thing than when you're just a very functional, rational, transactional based approach to a product. So, Mike, let's break down some of those numbers there. In 2019, when you last spoke to us, you raised a $1.6 million seed funding. Recently, we raised a $70 million series day. Like Dave said, now valued at $700 million valuation here. What's the end goal and is it an IPO in the near future? Yeah, I mean, we don't have a specific goal in mind. I think we're open to all kinds of different paths for the company. I think IPO path is something we're definitely going to seriously explore and see what that looks like. There's no timeline for when that would be or if we would definitely do it or not, but something we're going to take a look at. Same thing for, you know, remaining private, same thing for potential M&A. I think where the company is just growing so fast and growth is just continuing to move even faster. And we're going to take that into consideration when we think of what the next, you know, kind of move is. And when you look at pricing, when you go to buy on your website, it actually takes you to Amazon. So we want to talk a little bit about that pricing there. It's $15 to $21 for 12 pack. The cost of non-alcoholic beverages up 0.6% month over month, 12.9% year over year. How are you keeping that price competitive to keep consumers coming back? Well, Amazon, I mean, Amazon is a tricky thing because Amazon, they, they are a wholesaler. So they buy product from liquid death. Amazon sells it and prices it. Just like they do with all the big brands, Coke Pepsi, you know, all the other brands, Amazon acts as a wholesaler. So they typically set a price that is in line with what you could buy it for in a store, which is 1499, 1599 sort of range. So that should stay intact. And yeah, at the end of the day, as long as we are.",https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TFE9bMjrlhU,92,2022-10-20 20:35:15
3808," Well, that should stay intact. And yeah, at the end of the day, as long as we are somewhere in the range of other premium products, we're gonna be fine. Is the dollar more is a dollar less. People aren't buying liquid debt because it's the best price thing. It's a brand play. And when you have a true brand, you have a little bit more pricing elasticity than when you're just a brand that's purely focused on, well, we're cheaper, so that's why we win. You mentioned the four million followers on TikTok and Instagram, two and a half million of those on TikTok. Are you able to quantify how that impacts the bottom line? And you said that's not why they're buying it. If you can, why are they buying liquid debt? You know, my question would be, why do people wear Nike instead of Adidas? Same shoe. Why do people decide to drink Jack Daniels over some other whiskey? When even in a blind taste test, there's no way they're picking it out. You know, it's like there's these emotional reasons that people do things. But I think with liquid debt, we're seeing that people appreciate a brand that feels authentic. And I think it doesn't matter what industry you're in, everybody's chasing authenticity. But people see liquid death and they know, oh, there's a real human being behind this. And in a category where people perceive everything is kind of the same. It's like, hey, I'd rather give my $1.89 to these guys and walk around with this cool can that's not a plastic bottle, aluminum's infinitely recyclable. So they feel good about that. And people get a kick out of walking around with something that looks like a beer. We have hundreds of parents who have reached out on socials saying, thank you. Finally, my nine-year-old is excited to drink water instead of soda just because of the format. And it feels like something cool or that he's not supposed to have. So I think there's a lot of different reasons why people are sort of really into the brand. We get it now. Mike Sissario, cheers to you. Brooke DiPolma, thanks for being here. Bravo on your success. Invest a look to you in the future, sir. Mike Sissario, liquid death, founder and CEO. All right, we are following now some breaking news from Snap, the stock plunging on an earnings report that wasn't overly terrible if I could describe it as such, but check out the stock as we sit right now down 25% now just plummeting on that earnings report.

3809," 2 12 Iconic NAPDress maker Hill House launching their holiday collection this week, the Director Consumer Brand, has taken the internet by storm after its hit product, the NAPDress, became something of a viral sensation, the success of that single dress, really put the company on the map, but it has quickly expanded recently closing a $20 million funding round for more and this we want to bring in Nell Diamond, Hill House founder and CEO. Now it's great to see you, so let's just first zoom out for a bit because I have to first admit I am a NAPDress where I love it. I like to say that I'm part of NAPDress Nation, but talk to us just about the explosive growth behind your brand which really started to take off during the pandemic. Absolutely, so we found at Hill House Home in 2016 and in 2019 we came out with a product called the NAPDress. And the NAPDress is a dress that's intended to be worn at any time, day or night, it's really comfortable, really pretty and it makes you feel great, I'm wearing one right now. Since our 2019 drop of our first NAPDress collection, our business has just grown significantly. We've had three consecutive years of 300% year over year growth, it's been a wild, wild ride and half of our senior executive team has had more than one baby in that time periods. It's been a busy couple of years for all of us. A very, very busy couple of years. I mentioned the fact that you guys just came out with a new line yesterday. I'm on the site right now. A number of styles have already been sold out or certainly sold out in specific sizes. When you take a look at this demand, when you're trying to plan for your future launches, I guess how much are you trying to meet that demand versus trying to fuel this sort of rush to your site? Yeah, it's super interesting. You know, when we first started selling out at our drops, I, somebody said to me, you guys are like millennial moms version of supreme. You're always very high-peed, you're constantly selling out and there are lines around the corner. It was really interesting because it had never been part of our strategy to sell out. It was truly over demand and under supply. That was just with the sheer volume of growth that we were experiencing. I think our, our kind of end goal has always been to get this product in the hands of anyone who wants it. Now that said, certain patterns, certain fabrics, certain colors, we just could never supply the level of demand that is there for those products. But we try to make sure that everybody gets something they like, even if it's not the exact pattern. So it's been an interesting couple drops for us. No, I want to talk to you about brick and mortar plans. I know you've had a couple of pop-up stores. You had a pop-up store near and tuck it over the summary of a pop-up store in New York City in the past. What do those plans look like as we approach this very critical holiday season? I'm incredibly bullish on brick and mortar. I think the past couple of years, people have been so focused on ordering online. We're all used to coming home from work or going from the living room to the bedroom and just having piles of cardboard boxes. And that unboxing experience doesn't feel very romantic anymore. It doesn't feel super exciting. I know personally I love going into stores and seeing what's new, touching, feeling it, and then trying it on. So it was amazing for us to be back in person over the summer. We popped up in NanTucket. We had over 1,000 customers in a day and it was over 70% new customers. So for a brand like us that's digitally native, direct to consumer, we don't have distribution outside of our website. That's just a huge opportunity to meet new people. We had a really great conversion rate.",https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TFE9bMjrlhU,94,2022-10-20 20:44:15
3810," that's digitally native, direct to consumer, you know, we don't have distribution outside of our website. That's just a huge opportunity to meet new people. And, you know, we had a really great conversion rate, significantly, you know, five or six points higher than we had been kind of planning for. And for us, it was just a real moment to say, how awesome that when we get this product in front of people, they love it, even if they've never heard of us before. So I'm hoping for more stories, really excited about expanding and meeting people in person. Now, you mentioned the fact that people can only get it from your site right now. They're strictly direct to consumer. Any thoughts and you plans to partner with some of those larger names out there? Yeah, absolutely. I think we'd love to have one great distribution partner on the wholesale side. I think for the first couple of years of the business, as I mentioned, we've been around since 2016. It's been all about focus, all about our direct channel. We've really benefited from having a direct line of conversation with our customers. But now that we've really built up that strong solid foundation and want to meet new people and that we're at the scale, kind of revenue wise. I think the distribution from a wholesale perspective makes a ton of sense. And it's all about finding the right partner. No, and the intro there, I mentioned the 20 million in funding that you recently announced. I'm sure some of that will be used for your brick and mortar plants. How else, though, do you plan to deploy that capital? Yeah, absolutely. So in those three consecutive years of 300% growth, for many of them, we were a team of five people. So it's been a ton of hiring has gone on in the past couple of years. I like to keep the focus on profitability. I like to keep us physically responsible, financially sustainable. So no plans to go too crazy with team building. We're now a team of 30 based in New York City. I'm coming live from our office. But build up a team, build out our vertical to a couple more categories coming and then stores. It's all about stores. Now, it's certainly a very, very competitive market that you're in. A lot of your competitors are larger. They have more capital than you do at least today. What do you attribute just the success of your brand at such an early stage and your ability to capture such a wide audience on social media? You know, I think in some of our biggest growth years, we have spent less than 5% on marketing. And I think for us, that's the greatest compliment we could ever have because it's all about the product. We call it the group chat effect. It's where a group chat, somebody's wearing an app dress and she tells her other friend on the chat, you've got to get this dress. It was so comfortable. I felt so good for this presentation. I felt so good on my first day. And then all of a sudden, we see like an influx of people to the site. And in the early days, we would say, oh, there's some group chat popping off about us right now. So we want to really keep that spirit alive despite the fact that we're a much bigger company now. Really focus on the product first, the quality, the pricing, keep the pricing super competitive and keep me think that people feel comfortable in but also great about themselves at the first time. Because that's the spirit of an app dress that it's core is about feeling comfortable but feeling good. And that's certainly how I learned about it the first time is from a group of friends and they all said, you had to try it out. And I'm very, very happy that I did know. Before we go, I want to talk to you just about supply chain issues. Number of retailers have come out saying that that has been a huge challenge for them, not only during the pandemic, but certainly heading in to the critical holiday season. Have you dealt with any challenges like that? And how are you navigating that? Absolutely. I think in the past three or four years, there hasn't been a season or a new shipment that hasn't had supply chain challenges. So for us, it's just about expecting the unexpected. I think for us, we've built these very strong relationships with our suppliers. And it's never been more clear to me that relationships are everything. And some of our factories have been with us since day one in 2016. And we really partner together. We say we hold hands at every step of the process. So in the early days of the pandemic, when they had COVID closures there, we were flexible with them about delivery dates and vice versa. I think that for us, the focus is to insulate our customers as much as possible from those shifts, really trying to understand that people have enough to worry about right now. Let's just try and focus on getting the product in their hands. If we have to shelter a little extra cost to make it happen, that's okay for now, because we have a long-term view on the happiness of our customers. Now, Diamond, we wish you all the best. Thanks so much for taking the time to see us. We really appreciate it. All right, coming up next, shares of Snap, they are plunging after I was a good dad.

The disappointment really came on the average revenue per user side of things. The RQ number down 11%, we were looking for about to down 8%, 9%. And there's a number of reasons that we can kind of go into. But as far as the reaction in terms of the stock price, I'm a little bit shocked by the magnitude of the move. Although I probably shouldn't given what we've seen in terms of the stock movement here in recent quarters. But that said, I mean, overall, I think the biggest disappointment here is kind of the trajectory of the revenue outlook. As you look into the fourth quarter, which the guy at that company did provide some guidance into, and likely indicates that going into the first quarter of 2023, you're starting at kind of a lower footprint. Angel, let's go a little bit deeper into the RQ number. The average",https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TFE9bMjrlhU,96,2022-10-20 20:52:47
3812," and likely indicates that going into the first quarter of 2023, you're starting at kind of a lower footprint. Angela, let's go a little bit deeper into the ARPOO number, the average revenue per user number that you just mentioned. They're obviously coming in a bit light in terms of forecast. How, I guess, what was the biggest factor in that? And I guess, how do you see that playing out as we look at it to this current quarter and then into 2023? Yeah, I mean, so, you know, if you kind of take a step back, actually look at the second quarter. That was actually the first quarter since the company went public back in 2017 that we actually saw a year of a year decline in ARPOO. And you kind of look at, you know, the declines kind of only intensified here in the third quarter. And we think probably we'll again into the fourth quarter. And, you know, there's a number of reasons for that one. I mean, there's going to be a less favorable mix as you kind of see outsized growth, at least on a relative basis on the VAU side of the things on the international side of things would have lower ARPOO type number. But again, you know, also probably more importantly, is the fact that listen, the ad space is clearly struggling right now, budgets are getting a lot tighter. And you are seeing kind of, you know, lower fits per action overall. And that's that's driving me kind of the lower ARPOO number specifically. Also, the first time that revenue grew in single digits since their IPO in 2017. But, Angela, when you look at the daily active users, which maybe this is just like Netflix, when we used to focus more on subs, but you're talking about a 19% year-over-year increase to $363 million. And that sense was it not so bad. So, you know, again, I think when you kind of look at the daily active users, you know, it's great to grow the installed base this much, right? And the fact that the matter is, they cater to a great installed base. And the fact that it's largely kind of a younger audience, right? I mean, 80% of their installed base is essentially kind of 35 and under. And that's a great kind of prompt to have when you kind of look at relative to, you know, the metas of the world, which kind of are struggling with a much older installed base. But when you kind of look at the DAU growth here, who are about 4% in North America, the outsized growth, about 11% in Europe, and then the real outsized performance was kind of the rest of the world, which grew 34%. And again, you're talking considerably lower R2 type numbers in those regions. They haven't been able to kind of monetize that audience yet. And that's kind of been the problem here, whereas maybe other platforms out there are actually doing a better job monetizing the platform internationally. And so when you take a look though at the advertisers cutting their spending, and this audience report, the company is saying that we expect the operating environment is going to continue to be challenging in the months ahead. You mentioned the fact that maybe some of the competitors out there do have an advantage, at least when it comes to their competition in regards to SNAP. But is this indicative, do you think, of what we would likely hear over the next couple of weeks as we do start to hear from some of those other social media companies? I think it's going to depend. I mean, listen, I think overall the space is definitely struggling right now. It's the first area to get hit when we're talking about softer macro conditions. And we clearly started seeing things rolling over in the second quarter. And it's only gotten more pronounced here and in Q3 and Q4. And we do think it likely bottoms probably sometime in the first half of the year. So it likely gets uglier before it gets better. I mean, I'd say that the news person that probably worse for meta, just given kind of the audience that they cater to and how they're kind of more exposed to the iOS ecosystem in a mobile platform, say, you know, when you think about a company like Pinterest, you know, they were able to buck the trend last quarter relative to SNAP. If you recall, they kind of pop significantly on the results. And the reason for that is because they're actually finding ways to better monetize the platform. They're actually growing our pool while a company like SNAP is seeing our pool declined because of what they're doing in areas like shopping experiences and stuff like that. So I think it's going to depend on these individual companies. And this definitely kind of drops the sentiment as we kind of go into the rest of the numbers next week. But on a case by case basis, it's going to hit. We think meta from a fundamental perspective.",https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TFE9bMjrlhU,97,2022-10-20 20:57:04
3813," sentiment as we kind of go into the rest of the numbers next week. But on a case by case basis, it's going to hit. We think meta from a fundamental perspective more than the others. Twitter obviously protected by the 5420 that Elon Musk is going to pay. And that's probably why you see that not moving much at the moment. So the question is for Snap, what is the catalyst? What does the comeback story, Evan Speagles saying today we're going to focus on three things growing our community, deepening their engagement, re-accelerating and diversifying our revenue growth. And here's my question, investing in augmented reality, how significant might that be for Snap or where else might lie the comeback story? Yeah, I mean, Atlas, and I think augmented reality is the right place for them to be and to invest in. And the reason being, I mean, is there a mobile dependent platform you kind of look at where a company like Apple is going to write? I mean, we know they're migrating towards augmented reality, what they're doing, developers out there. And what we product wise, what we expect for them to come out over the next two to three years, whether it be mid-reality, headsets, eventual AR glasses, and what have you. So Snap is trying to prepare for that evolution. But that's going to take a couple of years. I think kind of when you think about potential catalyst ahead, in our view, I think at this point in time, we're just kind of looking for some sort of signs of a bottoming process, which is really too early to be talking about, because we're probably at least two quarters away from that happening. And, you know, sentiment, you know, just completely getting washed out, which, you know, you're probably starting to get close to what we've been saying that, I think, for a couple of months now. Yeah, look at that. Shares off just around 25% after hours. Angel Azino, great to have you. Thanks so much for having on the phone for us.

3817," Within that answer, however, Connor, you did remind me of my second reason that I upgraded my couch, which is because I'm not getting on a cruise. Connor, cunning him. Morius research director. Thanks so much. Joining us here today, appreciate it. Guys, coming up on the other side of this short break, the turning tide, question mark, a mega market cat behemoth, corded by retail and institutional investors alike. But, what could it take for Apple to turn Rotten? Maybe just one report. Sizey State is up next. Well, can Apple do anything wrong? That's the question. As the tech giant Reddy's a new update to iOS devices that promises everything from more accessible fitness to clean energy charging investors, they're waiting for an update of their own. The company is set to release earnings next week. For a closer look, let's turn to Sizey State. Size is what we find you do today. Alright, what's clean energy charging? I know. Is that mean my phone is going to charge magically? I thought it was an EV term, honestly. You might be right. Alright, let's run this down because Apple earnings are in fact coming up. So here's my little preview for your folks. Overarching theme I think of this preview is the street is really expecting some good things from Apple. First up, what Wall Street is saying into earnings. One, this quarter may not stop out concerns of a hardware slowdown. We've seen a big PC slowdown that has impacted the likes of AMD Intel Unaming in the chip space. There is some concern on that hardware slowing down. Notably as it pertains to iPad, potentially hitting Apple in this quarter. Next, the street is expecting a slight earnings beat by Apple. So maybe one to two cents. I've seen some whisper numbers out there on the street looking for a beat by Apple of about five cents. So something to keep in mind. Also to iPhone, iPad demand will help offset FX challenges. That's the vibe on the street. Maybe I would be a little concerned with the iPad just given the slowdown we have seen in the PC market. But by and large, the new iPhones have launched very, very well.",https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XTJjX90THDQ,1,2022-10-21 13:57:10
3818," FX challenges, that's the vibe on the street. Maybe I would be a little concerned with the iPad, just given the slowdown we have seen in the PC market. But by and large, the new iPhones have launched very, very well. Next up here, potential red flags, areas of concern you should be on the lookout for. And there I am holding or flying that Apple flag right there. One, December quarter guidance. It is universally the vibe out there on the street is even though Apple may have had a good quarter here, that guidance for the holiday quarter may come in pretty conservative relative to estimates, given what you see on FX, given what you see about pressure, and the Chinese economy, and of course, our own slowdown here in the US, economics slowdown, that is. Number two, China, as I just mentioned, a concern by analysts. And lastly, work from home impact on various Apple devices, notably that iPad. And I do want to call out to give a little analyst shot out here to Barclays, Claudia Gilbert Tallinn. She's noting here this, looking out to December quarter, we are unsure what guidance management will give. But we expect some conservatism, like I just mentioned, given the macro backdrop despite the extra weeks, since the December quarter has 14 weeks. So it's this district's overall, I would say, expecting for Apple to do it, have a good quarter, beat on earnings, have a conservative guidance. It might take, if Netflix positively surprised the market, dot, dot, dot, you would think Apple would step up here and post a good quarter of its own. It's just a matter of how will the stock react? If you do get, let's say, five-cent earnings be in conservative guidance. Now the argument could be made, that is priced into the stock here, which sets it up for a positive reaction on earnings day, but again, that's just like throwing darts. Yeah, I think services will outperform. Services is seen as one of those little luxuries that consumers will lean into, even as they kind of bat in the hatches on their own spending. But then on the other side, there is this question. And it could already be priced in very well to the stock, is on the demand side that they're seeing for the iPhones, where they've already, according to reports, pulled back some of the kind of iPhone Pro, or the iPhone, yeah, the iPhone Pro model pulled back some of the production on that in response to what they had been seeing on the demand front and reading through to see exactly where they were looking at a consumer that was more affluent, had more of the appetite to spend up to get the iPhone Pro Max. And so with that, you've got the higher tier that's selling better, the question that I would have going into this report though, is on what volume? And that is something why I've been paying close attention to the telecom companies this quarter, is especially what they're saying around, whether or not customers are actually trading up or trading down, and they're saying that they're trading up right now. So it leads you to believe that maybe they're opting in to that higher tier phone, it's just a question of how many of them? Right, and one, I think what we could agree on here, this will be a market-rooting report, especially in this environment, where there's a lot of macroeconomic concerns here, Apple's report next week will very much set the tone. Absolutely, we're also keeping an eye on another tech company here coming up on the other side of the short break. Snapshares, yeah, they are getting hammered to the tune of 30% lower on the back of its third quarter report. We're going to speak to Jeffrey's Brent Dale, next. [#FçoRESA I'm going to do a little bit of the same. I'm going to do a little bit of the same. I'm going to do a little bit of the same. I'm going to do a little bit of the same.

3819," [♪ Nice guitar musicㅎㅎ?] Welcome back to Yowl Finance. I'm Brian Saazi here with Brad Smith, Julie Heimann as the day off. This is our tiptoeing into the weekend as traders gear up for a big wave of earnings next week. Right now you're seeing all three major indices. I would say maybe a little bit more than tiptoeing. We're seeing the Dow up almost 335 points. Here's what else we're watching at this moment. No recession. American Express shares are under. We're under a little pressure after the company didn't raise its full year earnings guidance range. The stock is still under pressure. CO Steven's square, he tells me concerns of a recession are overblown. The dialing up in earnings beat Verizon shares are in focus after the company beat on earnings but posted weak subscriber gains. Brad Chaat with Ryzen Seal Hans Vesberg who noted that there are points of weakness in that earnings report more on that one on the Yowl Finance homepage right now. And it's time to travel. Spotlight the theme park sector following much better than expected earnings from airlines. Brad, over to you. Let's kick things off with a check of the major averages here. 32 minutes into trading on this Friday and the Dow Jones industrial average right now. We're seeing that hold on to some slight gains right now. It's up by about 1.1%. All right, so a little bit more than slight gains here on the day than that is that composite as I bring this into an intraday view just to give us a better perspective of what's taken place. Look at that sharp move higher that we've seen within the first 30 minutes of trade. We're up by about half a percent right now as clearly investors, some of the sentiment right now is saying, hey, you know what, hold my beer. We could rally into this Friday and that's what we're seeing right now is a little bit of an early session rally. The S&P 500, you're seeing that up by about 1% here. And so you take a look at the broader week that we've been watching as well. This could potentially add on to some of the net gains that we had seen, even with the declines earlier in the day. We were still up on the week by about 2% as of right now with this move. We're up by about 3% 3.3% on the S&P 500. Also want to take a look at some of the trending stocks on the Yahoo Finance homepage as well here. Yeah, it's none other than Snap, the brand of Ghost Face Chilla. Yeah, it's chilling on the day to the tune of about 30% chilling lower in a bad way here. So we're continuing to watch that as well as Twitter. You're also seeing shares of Pinterest move in constant lower by about 6.3%. So for more on this move that we've been tracking with Snap as I put that back in focus on the day down 30%. We've got Jeffrey's senior research analyst, Brent Thill Brent. Just take us into your reaction after you saw the numbers cross from Snap and what the executives had to say on the call last night. Yeah, good morning. The quarter itself was okay. It was the guy and they have obviously been experiencing decelerating growth just over a year ago. They said they could grow indefinitely for 50% and then the growth rate came into the 30s, into the teens, into the single digits and they exited at high single digit growth and then said the quarter was growing at 9% and then said the quarter would end flat because advertisers would fall off a cliff in the back half of the quarter. So I think it's more about the guide and more about it.",https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XTJjX90THDQ,3,2022-10-21 14:05:50
3820," and said the quarter would end flat because advertisers would fall off a cliff and in the back half of the quarter. So I think it's more about the guide and more about the lack of visibility. There's clearly been a lot of departures, their senior leaders and sales have left to go to Netflix. You have a concern around advertisers moving to where the wallets are, meaning, the younger audience and staff don't have the dollars. The parents have the dollars. The older generation has the dollars. So you're seeing advertisers shift up from the lower end to the higher end, which makes sense. So we're still gonna be influenced to buy household goods and items for to run our life. But that's not where we make the decisions on SNAP, right? We may make a decision on SNAP to buy the new Hawaiian shirt or buy concert ticket, but we're not gonna be influenced to go again, make some of the bigger ticket purchases. So dollars for advertisers are shifting to Google, to Amazon, to prove and spend where the wallets are and that's where the advertisers are at. We also have a competitive issue with TikTok, which is anyone that's fired up TikTok and spend five minutes with it, spends a half hour with it, it engages you, it brings you in. So advertisers naturally in them or experimental and younger audience are shifting away from SNAP over to the TikTok platform. So there's a handful of forces, changes in the team, changes in advertisers. I think overall the bigger picture too is the macro, which is we have a macro picture that's dimming. We are going into a recession in 23 per hour economists. This will start later than most economists have believed our team internally continues to believe that we are going to go into it more of a tailspin in next year that this takes time to come out into the economy. So if you think about that, if we do go into that tailspin, we advertisers naturally, the first thing they're gonna say is we're not spending, right? Adversizing can be tuned up and tuned down in a nanosecond. We described as the stereo knob in your car or at home. You can go up and down really quick. You can't do that and software, you can't do that in semis, you can't do that in other areas of technology. So right now I think investors are just like, I don't want to be in advertising if we're going into a prolonged downturn. I will be back to advertising names when we go back in the upturn. And there's safer names outside of tech. And that's what we continue to hear from our clients is just our clients want to be outside of technology. Right now they want to be in energy. If you look at the XLE, you know, up over 50% year to date, right? So the popular trade beginning of the year was short technology belong, the XLE. And you know, we've got the XLE up again today and up 54% year to date. So I don't think that the tone of technology overall and advertising and many of the other tech names that we cover is going to shift until we get into 2023. We get a lot of these companies to really reset the numbers. So I expect a tougher earnings season for the rest of tech. Brent, does the snap have to cut its expenses even further? Yes, I mean, they do. I mean, they just restructured the company. They obviously are in the process of still reducing the workforce by 20%. They may have to go deeper. And again, I think the thing we don't know is how long is this economic pullback going to last? It could last all next year. Again, our Jeffery's own economists have said this really starts later in the year versus early because it takes time for all these changes that the Fed is putting into place is going to be a way that comes in slowly. It doesn't come crashing in on you. And so the scary part of what's happening is we don't know exactly that this can be prolonged. A lot of companies are saying, oh, we're not seeing it. Some companies are saying we're seeing it.",https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XTJjX90THDQ,4,2022-10-21 14:09:58
3821," What's happening is we don't know exactly that this can be prolonged. A lot of companies are saying, oh, we're not seeing it. Some companies are saying we're seeing it. I think everyone's going to see it. I think this is going to be again, the concern, which is this could get a lot darker than we all think. That is a potential. Now, I would highlight that, look, if Elon Musk thinks that Twitter's worth $44 billion, and Snap now has a roughly $12 billion market cap, you start to ask yourself, he's trying to build the X app, which is all these things you can do. Snap has a closer version of an X app than anyone. It has the map, it has the information page, it has a messaging service, it has an ARVR, it has a gaming interface. I mean, there's many elements that investors have come back to me and said, if he wants to create an X app, which is all these things that Twitter isn't today and fire 75% of the workforce, doesn't snap how all the foundational makings of what an X app would look like. I'm like, yeah, absolutely. So at some point, you go, look, we understand they've had execution issues. Again, the visibility on the advertising industry, that's across the board. I mean, it's not like meta and Google and Amazon's ad business are accelerating. They're all decelerating, right? So they're all facing the same headwinds now. Obviously, Snap's had stronger headwinds. But at some point, you go back to everyone is so negative that ultimately, if you have a long-term horizon and you sit and look at this, and you believe, these are typically some of the best opportunities for tech investors over a three-year period, not the next three months. So depending on your duration, I think there's some credible opportunities that are being borne in this downturn that clearly, we're going to have some hazy, overcast foggy skies in the short term. But you're getting some interesting opportunities if you are a longer-term investor. Do you think there's some consolidation to be expected, given the valuations right now? 100%. M&A is going to massively spike. In M&A, there is no IPO window right now. So we have given birth to a lot of great technology companies. Many of these subsectors are overcrowded. You've already seen that. You're to date Tom O'Braw, who's one of the best software investors on the planet, is spent over $20 billion acquiring multiple companies outside in the security and technology landscape. So if you look out even outside of social media, you've seen incredible consolidation. You've seen strategic deals like Adobe buying Figma for $20 billion. No one thought any company in the beginning of a recession would pay 50 times revenue, 50, not 50. So we are going to see an incredible amount of strategic M&A, an incredible amount of private equity, led M&A. You're already seeing it. You're seeing the number of skyrocket, you're to date. You're seeing some of the best technology investors for the long haul, like Tom O'Braw will say, this is go time for software consolidation. There's no question. And this is what we need to restore the health, because we're in that cycle of we expanded dramatically. We had so many IPOs. We've had no IPOs intact this year. And so if you think about what's happening, you're going to go back to that natural consolidation phase of M&A. And we firmly believe we're seeing the signals already. We're seeing the best investors in the space talk about it. We're seeing the strategic step up and make acquisitions. You saw Adobe, you saw Microsoft in Activision. You've seen Salesforce go a little quiet. They have to go quiet in the short term. Intuitant that did MailChimp for 12 billion. You've seen an incredible amount. And so I think ultimately these valuations are going to get cheaper. This is when you want to be a choir. And if you're a strategic hero, private equity. Great perspective as always.

However that Of course Fed whisperer that Nick Timrose has become that quote saying we will have a very thoughtful discussion about the pace of tightening at our next meeting here And that is really leaning further to some of this signaling even in a dendom to the Fed speak that we've gotten the signaling now That there may be some type of pivot in the markets certainly latching on to that here even that polar story can't turn around snap We'll leave it there we'll be right back You Walmart agreed to pay 215 million dollars to the state of Florida over claims that its pharmacies helped fuel the opioid epidemic in that state The retailer also agreed to give out 672,000 treatment kits to Florida first responders according to moody's Florida has now secured $3.2 billion to help fight the opioid crisis And a new report by doich bank sir says doich bank rather is laying off dozens of employees including some out of the UK That's according to voters. No concrete number was given but a person close to the matter says most of the cuts are in origination and advisory segments of its investment banking unit this as a pullback and financing deals prompted lenders to cut back on the call",https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XTJjX90THDQ,6,2022-10-21 14:18:46
3823," Most of the cuts are in origination and advisory segments of its investment banking unit. This as a pullback in financing deals prompted lenders to cut back on costs. And Pfizer says it's hiking its US COVID vaccine price to over $100 per dose. Dosis could be costing between $110 to $130 per dose before insurance. Now this will take place after the US government's current purchase program expires. Right now the government pays around $30 per dose. And Adidas is cutting its full-year guidance following weaker demand in Western markets and its exits from Russia. The company cut currency, neutral revenue expectations, and lowered its expected operating margin to 4%. Adidas also blamed slowdowns in China and inventory buildups for the cuts. Despite the sour outlook, Adidas did see sales grow. 11% in Q3. All right from record home prices to record mortgage rates. 2022 has been a wild ride for the now ice cold housing market. But could this pain be good for prospective home buyers down the road? You'll find Ceeacombs, Rig Newman is here with more so. Rick, I should be cheering these declines because maybe at some point I'll be able to buy home. Maybe a year from now or something like that, but it's getting ugly in the housing market and it's probably going to get uglier. So we just saw the eighth consecutive month of declining existing home sales. That's the worst stretch since 2007 and what was happening in 2007. That was when the housing bubble was exploding. We got the home builders index this week. That has been going down. That's now at the lowest level since the bottom of the COVID downturn. And if you don't count that, it's the lowest level since 2012. Again, close to the bottom of the housing bust back then. So we have a long way to go to get through housing. Everybody has kind of seen this coming. I mean, this has almost everything to do with rising interest rates and mortgage rates now up around 7%. But we haven't seen prices really fall over yet. They've just started to turn and they will come down for sure. But we're at the beginning of a major correction and we probably have months to go. Rick, I like Saasie. Also just want to know when it's possible to buy a house. But I guess further out down the line, what kind of changes are we really expecting for the consumer environment to look like, especially given the fact that if you have an absence of those buyers because of rates in the near term that sellers as well are going to be impacted as well. And they're going to be less listings of existing homes. Yeah, this impacts everything on both the buyer and the seller side and the builder side I should add. So we're so builders are reluctant to build. We're seeing that decline. There's a long standing problem for builders getting permits. And you're right, there's this lock-in effect. So if you happen to be a homeowner and I'm lucky enough to be one, I'm older than you guys, of course. Then you probably locked in a mortgage rate of around 3%. And you're looking at this market in St. yourself. I'm not going to sell. I'm going to go out of my way to stay where I am and keep that to keep that where it is. So as with many other things we talk about on our area every day, we need to get to the other side of the Fed's tightening cycle. I think we need to see when that the Fed is finally feels like it's gone far enough. And then we can get through this difficult period. And you know, at some point, it's reasonable to think interest rates are going to come back down again. It might take a recession to do that. I mean, I've seen some economists saying, yeah, we think the Fed will basically finish up by late this year or early next year. And then it could be cutting rates again if we actually get into a recession in 2023. So, you know, things do change in the housing market, but these are long shifts. This is not like stocks. These are long shifts. We're talking six, nine, twelve months to we get to the other side of this. Congrats here, home ownership, Rick Newman. Always good to see you. We'll talk to you soon. Hi guys. It has been a year to forget and tech. As you can see by the unfolding nest, it's snappled.

The tech landscape and global economic picture is six street partners. We've been talking all morning about this. The average investor understand what is happening and when will it end? I found it helpful as an investor and just for my own peace of mind to keep my eyes on the long term trends. There's a lot going on. I don't think I can add to it. There's certainly a lot of macroeconomic news. There's the announcement that we all read yesterday. I would just say this is the nature of tech. It is risky. It is growth. It is volatile. It has been on a very long trend and it was easy and fun to get used to that trend. Who knows where that's going to go in the future. But if you step way back and just look at the long term trend, I think there's very few predictions that I will make with absolute rock solid confidence. One of them is that there's going to be more software in the future than there is in the present. So long term is the same and there's a lot of ups and downs on the way. That prediction tracks Marty. Appreciate that here this morning. You also have a unique position of sitting on the board at alphabet as well. With that in mind, I just wonder what is the next transformative technology that's really going to be the changing factor for consumers and as well for some of the companies that we cover on a daily basis. So one thing that you get to say if you've been at the same thing for a long time is you live long enough to get to be considered a pioneer and so a long time ago. I was working on AI in medicine. This is back in the late 80s and the early 90s. The compute power was just way too low. And I remember back then there were people working on neural networks and we used to think, OK, that doesn't seem like that's ever going to work. Well, that has worked unbelievably well. So I many other people were just dead wrong about neural networks and what we are able to do we've all seen with neural networks is amazing. And we are just at the very, very beginning of an incredibly exciting up.",https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XTJjX90THDQ,8,2022-10-21 14:27:36
3825," And what we are able to do, we've all seen, with neural networks is amazing. We are just at the very, very beginning of an incredibly exciting upswing and what we're gonna be able to do with AI across the board, whether it's drug discovery, climate change, or at the beginning of actually being able to do amazing, really miraculous things with AI. So that's the future, but right now, you're also kind of looking at this environment where even as we were looking at snaps, earnings and really reading through where they're impacted as a result of operating system privacy changes that many social media companies have been hit by because of the changes that Apple had put forward. There is another OS that's out there, in fact there are a few other ones and one of the other major competing ones is the Android OS. Why is it that there has been more of an impact to the social media companies derivative of privacy changes from the Apple operating system than from any privacy changes because there's also a privacy push within the Android OS as well? Well, I think all companies need to step back and the regulators doing this as well and look at what privacy means, how to define it and what we actually want and to get ready for it. And there's just a whole range of outcomes. This is a huge global social, political decision that we all have to make. And there's so many moving cards I'd love to predict it but I would just say to all companies, you have to ready yourself for a large number of different regulatory outcomes. Really, the question is, and we know what is possible with AI, what does society want us to do with it? And that is a very big decision that's happening right now. There's no one route. It depends on operating systems. It depends on policies. It depends on choices that consumers and companies make and nobody knows what's going to happen. So you just have to be ready for a variety of outcomes. Already, when the market gets a sense, the Fed is done raising rates for this cycle. What will that mean for the M&A market? Well, so I have somewhat infamous for not making timing predictions and I think I don't make them because I'm terrible at them, right? So, and also causality is hard like knowing this happens and that's going to happen next and predicting the timing of it. So right there is M&A happening. There are in every economy, including the one that we currently have, there are difficult spots and there are bright spots. Again, back to AI, if you're looking at financing and in acquisitions and combinations of all kinds, in that area of AI, that is booming just like probably better than ever. Right? And so there are bright spots, green shoots even now in certain sectors and AI is certainly wonderful. Marty, we only got about 30 seconds left, but I'd love to know, especially as so many companies are making changes when it comes to diversity, equity, and inclusion, whether that be at the entry level, mid management, all the way up to the board. What is the step that a company can take right now in order to ensure that even in the midst of macroeconomic uncertainty, that they are retaining those values? Well, so the companies have the right values in that general, I don't know, I'm not gonna make a blanket statement, but really it comes down to what are you actually doing day to day in your recruitment and you're filling the pipeline in understanding connected to managing your people. And so companies are doing a much better job at the entry level, though it's still hard in reflecting the demographics of the cities and environments where they operate. Really the hard part is as people to become more senior in their careers, how do we continue to make them want to be here as opposed to some other place and how we actively manage their careers to mentorship and sponsorship? Those are the things that all companies need to be doing in a disciplined process oriented way every day through every market cycle. Sixth Street's partner and vice chairman, thanks so much for joining us. Marty Shavez, appreciate the time this morning. Pleasure, do well. Thanks. Guys, coming up, we're gonna share the full interview with Verizon Wireless CEO, Hans Vesberg on the other side of this short break-in on the back of these companies. Thank you, everybody.",https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XTJjX90THDQ,9,2022-10-21 14:31:46
3826," Here, the full interview with Verizon Wireless CEO, Hans Vesburg, on the other side of this short break-in on the back of his company's company's support. Verizon closing the books on its third quarter. It reported results before the bell and its stock currently moving lower by about 5.6% as investing in the company's support. Verizon closing the books on its third quarter. It reported results before the bell and its stock currently moving lower by about 5.6% as investors mold the report and weigh the impact of inflation on the wireless providers consumer business. I spoke to Verizon CEO Hans Vesburg earlier about the quarter. Take a listen. I think we came out from the second quarter. We had some softness in our consumer business, especially on the wireless. We took a lot of actions in the second quarter, especially around new plants, new products, but we also did some price adjustments. Coming into the third quarter and now reporting that, we can see some of that is really getting good effect. We're growing 10% or wireless revenue. Our EBITDA grew almost 3% to 12.2 billion dollars. So definitely the progress we put in place was actually working, but it's a lot more to do. We're a large company and we need to continue the hard work we're doing right now to continue to do the great cash generation we're doing. That was the highlight of the quarter. So we saw also the pre-paid market. We acquired a track fund last year, which added a really good asset when it comes to being in the value segment. We had a new product in there, a new product called Total Wireless, but Verizon. We also added home broadband to the pre-paid market. And overall our broadband had a really good quarter. 377,000 new broadband customers in the quarter across business and consumer. So that fixed wireless access business we're doing is really working. So a lot of things was working for us. We still are working on the consumer segment to be even stronger. And we're going to take more actions. It's a very agile market when it comes to consumer segment at the moment. We're going to talk a little bit more about that consumer segment as well, Hans. And from your perspective, when you think about what you had said at the end of the second quarter, mid-summer, second half challenges, you were kind of looking out into the future and saying that second half challenges, you see them as short term. Is that still the case? Or do you believe that there's some facets of the softness in the consumer, especially as they're paying more?",https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XTJjX90THDQ,10,2022-10-21 14:36:27
3827," and saying that second half challenges, you see them as short-term. Is that still the case? Or do you believe that there's some facets of the softness in the consumer, especially as they're paying more for necessities right now? And the macroeconomic climate that you believe might protrude into 2023 or even beyond? It's a little bit mixed feelings, actually. Evan, we have the highest quality custom base and the largest consumer base in the country. We see really good payment from our customers, consumers, where we are actually better than pre-COVID. So we don't see anything there. We actually see the roaming when people are traveling abroad. That movement are equally big or higher than pre-COVID. So a lot of things are moving as normal and our store traffic between Q2 to Q3, that increased with double digits. So people are actually doing movement. And then of course, we all read what's happening in the macroeconomy with higher inflation and the interest rates coming up. So it's a little bit mixed, but clearly, we are in the fundamental product. Everybody needs mobility. Everybody needs to be connected. That's so important for us. And even more important these days. So clearly, there are mixed feelings. We think we have a great product, we have a great network, and we are spanning all the consumer segment. And then don't forget our business side. That has a really good quarter with both growth. There are almost 6% in a wireless business in the business group. But not only that, I did 200,000 new, almost 200,000 new net-dads, full net-dads in the business segment. So it's a little bit mixed when you read in the market and what we're seeing in our customer base. Certainly. I want to talk a little bit more about those network investments in a moment, but before that, we know that you're one of the largest partners with Apple in terms of the iPhone, the latest edition of this consumer device and the smartphone that comes out year after year. And within that, there's even been some of the reports around where the demand might be pulling back. Are you seeing that show up in your business at all right now? Now, when we come to the iPhone 14, the ones we have seen very normal volumes, but moreover, we actually made an exclusive deal with Apple, which we have done over a long time. We're Apple 1 for only limited. It's a new offering where you have all the Apple services, Apple Plus, the gaming, et cetera. In one package together, we are only limited. Very good for us to get it with Apple. So now we're very normal. There's a little bit of mix, of course, which type of products our customers are taking, but in general, very normal levels of a launch of an iPhone. If you were coming back to the network infrastructure investments that you're making as well, if we were to see any kind of recessionary concerns really permeate over into the next year, what would that mean in terms of the moderation of the level of network investments that you might be making? And perhaps on the other end, where are you full steam ahead? I think that the last six, seven years, we have the plan exactly how we're going to invest in the network. This is our peak year. We're going to do some somewhere between around 22 billion in Capex, that's our guidance. And that's one portion is our business as usual. And then the other is that the new spectrum we bought last year is actually coming to execution right now. And we're doing that as fast as we can. And next year, that will come down. But we have invested in fiber. We're investing in the C band, the spectrum we bought. We're going to pass 200 million pop in the first quarter on our C band. And the important with the C band, that's a five-d spectrum that we're using. We see good growth on that. So where we launch a market with the C band, we see mobility, business growing, we see fixed-wise access growing. And for the viewers, important, we bought that spectrum. But we get it all the time as those satellite companies are releasing it. And the last piece of that spectrum, we will get at the end of 2023. But basically, it's nationwide 160 megahertz, which is a lot of spectrum. And we're only deploying pieces of it right now. But by year and 2023, we'll have all. So we have a clear process of how we implement and execute in our network. And that's our number one capital priority as well. So we will do what is needed for a network. We already have the best network. And it's just getting back.",https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XTJjX90THDQ,11,2022-10-21 14:40:23
3828," implement and execute in our network. And that's on number one capital priority as well. So we will do what is needed for the network. We already have the best network. And it's just getting better. So just lastly, while we have you here, I got a hustle to my finish here. But I'm taking a look at the stock price. Investors clearly reaction to this morning's earnings report. And perhaps they may be paying attention to some of the churn in end users or subscribers. But they also may be paying close attention to the margins as related to some of the capex that's going to be set forth and continues to be earmarked to the tune of $22 billion that you just mentioned. When do you believe either some of the churn will start to alleviate? And then on the other side, when you can start to adequately wind down perhaps some of the spending so that the margins aren't as compressed. So when it comes to our churn in the third quarter, that was expected. We took a deliberate decision in the second quarter to do price adjustment in certain consumer segments. And we knew that we would have a churn bubble. So that was sort of an expected and very deliberate decision we took. And it was important for us to also do that because our industry has not done price adjustments on wireless ever. So this was the time to do it. We did it for certain segments. So that will ease over over time. So I think that's a very important message. And when it comes to the capex, we have a clear plan. We will come back, of course, with exact guidance for 23. But we have a very clear plan how we are on the peak level of spending right now. And then it will come down as we are spending as fast as we can and deploying the C band spectrum that we bought a year ago. All right. The Supreme Court has rejected a request made to block the Biden administration's program for student debt relief as has a district court. Yowell, fine, says legal correspondent Lexus Keenan has the latest Lexus. Hi, Brian. Yes. So two courts yesterday rejecting the request for emergency relief that would cancel the implementation of Biden's student loan forgiveness plan. Now, one was the Supreme Court request showed up there from a group of Wisconsin taxpayers. Associate Justice Amy Coney Barrett, she denied that request, not even taking up the matter on the merits at all. The other one came from a district court in Missouri. The Missouri case was brought by six Republican led states. They argued that Biden used Serpent Congress's authority to spend the taxpayers money. They also said that the relief plan jeopardizes the state's tax revenues, particularly revenue from the state run loan servicers that a lot of different states have across the country. The Wisconsin case for its taxpayers, it was brought by Brown County taxpayers near Green Bay, Wisconsin. That's the area. They made similar argument about Congress's spending power saying that Biden overstepped his bounds here. They also said that the president improperly invoked the 2003 Heroes Act that's really meant to give student debt relief to military members and their families. Now, the reason, though, that the state plaintiffs were denied this relief is because the court said they lacked standing as for the Wisconsin taxpayers and the Supreme Court's decision, we don't know the basis on which they denied this relief. It's because it's part of the Supreme Court's so-called shadow docket where it doesn't really go through the full briefing and hearing process that's given to those formal opinions that we've all been accustomed to. Now, there's a good chance, though, that standing was lurking behind the Supreme Court's decision. It's been a problem for all of the litigants that have tried to come forward to block this student loan relief. But I just want to give you a little lesson in what standing is. I think we have a full screen to show you what the plaintiffs have to the come to the table with in court is. They have to have a concrete injury. They have to have a injury that's very particular to them. It can't be an injury that's general to all. It can't be all taxpayers, for example. Also, that injury has to be an actual or imminent injury. It has to be happening right now. It can't be one that's hypothetical out in the future. Also, the injury has to be traceable to the action of the defendant named in the lawsuit. And also, it has to be something that the court can actually address, give redress to these so-called grieved plaintiffs. So the court saying here, both of these courts, all of the courts at this point saying, no plaintiffs, you do not have standing. We do not even have jurisdiction to hear this case. So what's next for the Republican states, they say that they're going to appeal the district court's decision for the-",https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XTJjX90THDQ,12,2022-10-21 14:44:43
3829," do not even have jurisdiction to hear this case. So what's next? For the Republican states, they say that they're going to appeal the district court's decision for the Wisconsin taxpayers. They too are trying to appeal the seventh circuits, toss out of their lawsuit. So we'll be watching for that. Alexis King, thanks for breaking it all down for us. Appreciate it. All right, with airline earnings coming in hot, the theme park space may be worth another both fine investors more on this straight ahead. Yeah. The theme parks have had a rocky year as they look to bounce back from the lows of COVID-19. And our next guest says, estimate need to come down to a better reflect the challenges ahead. City Research Director James Hartman joins us now. James, good to see you again. We're right in the middle of a fright fest for six flags. And it's been a very frightful year for that company. They have really been struggling. How do you think this quarter shaped up? Yeah, I mean, and you're right. It has been a tough year for these guys. They had a new strategy where they're essentially aiming to have fewer customers, right? But the strategy that we know. That's not a good strategy. Here, please. We don't want to let you in. But take less business. We're okay with that. That's right. Well, we dubbed the Jerry McGuire strategy. You were customers more profits, better service. That may have made more sense come into this year. It's been a tough sell as some of these macro pressures have mounted. And so to answer your question, I do think it's a tough third. It was a tough third quarter for these guys. I think estimates probably are too high. I think attendance of anything. It was pretty bad in the second quarter. Anything there's a good chance that that got worse here in 3Q. James, for the lay person following this six-fledged story. And the CEO made some bizarre comments on that last earnings call. Push that aside. What is wrong with six flags? Is it the stands where they get the food? Are the rides not cool enough? Is it a combination of all that? Or is it just too expensive to go to these parks? Yeah, I think it's a combination of all of those things relative to other theme parks. Six flags has historically not been able to get the pricing that those others have and that they would hope to, particularly since they cater to some of the biggest cities in the US with some of the best disposable income. It tends to be a lot more teenager oriented as opposed to.",https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XTJjX90THDQ,13,2022-10-21 14:49:16
3830," You know, some of the biggest cities in the US with some of the best disposable income. It tends to be a lot more teenager oriented as opposed to family oriented. And I think that plays a role in terms of the pricing that they're able to get. You know, there's an argument to be made that they haven't invested enough in their parks over the years. And that has also led to this sort of lower quality experience, at least that being the perception. And so I think that's all what predated this new concept that they ultimately had. They didn't put it this way, but that they fired their customers in a lot of ways. And you got to be real careful with that suffice at the second. That's bad news for the Dippin' Dot Barometer, James. When we think about some of the other major theme parks that are out there, I mean, what is going to be vastly different between this year and next year? This was supposed to be that travel demand boom year, that revenge experiential economy year. If not this year, then what does that shape up for next year for the theme parks? Yeah, it's such a great point. I mean, we were believers that there was this pent-up demand as we exited the pandemic for exactly these types of experiences. Unfortunately, there isn't a whole lot of daylight between the post-pandemic phase or story and the pre-recession or recession story. And I think that's those two things ultimately, but it up against each other here in the summer of 22. I've got numbers lower for next year. We have seen pretty consistently over the course of the summer, slowing demand trends for the theme parks. Now, the good news is I do think that these companies, these businesses tend to hold in better, better than some of the other discretionary names that I follow. Right? And so they're going to feel it. I think attendance is likely to be down. Sales are likely to be down. But they generally hold in pretty well. And the reason for that is they tend to be trained down beneficiaries. Right? As opposed, once travel turns over, if in fact it does, these tend to be cheaper alternatives than going to Orlando or Mexico or Europe. James, what you often see in a lot of these theme park parking lots is when a Begos family take these when a Begos and they go to the theme parks. Now, that is the stock you cover. This company just reported earnings. Take us through their inventory situation. Are they able to get the semiconductors and the supplies they need to get these trucks or these mobile homes out of the showrooms and into the front porches or the dryways of customers? Yeah, I mean, so that was the narrative for so much of 2021 in the early part of 2022. Could they get this supply out there because there was very much to believe that true demand was better than these reported retail numbers? IE, if you had more product, you could sell more product. I think that narrative has changed over the past three months and, and oh, by the way, I don't think it's just for Arby's. I think the ability to stock showroom floors has improved dramatically. And if you want to get one of these, you can get one of these right now. I think that the it's a double head sword now though. The concern is that these manufacturers will pump up the channel too much with some of these inventories. And that would ultimately turn make a bad situation worse as we think about a potential recession. And again, it's not just Arby's. I think this whole debate as to are we are aren't we heading towards a recession? In what I cover, right, big ticket discretionary. In a lot of ways, it feels like we're there or or fastly quickly approaching that place. It does seem like over the past few months. Supply has improved, but the man has not. All right. Well, for those of us brining myself included who are priced out of the housing market. The RVs are looking to be good. I'm Neil Baby. City Research Director James Hardman, thanks for taking the time here today. Have a great weekend. Thanks, guys. Guys, coming up, we're going to do a roundup of the top things that we've heard this week from some key business leaders, from everything from our all-market summit to kick off the week through to, yeah, today's conversations with some big CEOs as well. That's next.",https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XTJjX90THDQ,14,2022-10-21 14:53:19
3831," We will begin the beetle method. Welcome back to Yahoo Finance, everyone. It was an energizer bunny type of week here for us here on the morning show as we spoke with a numerous amount of executives, including CEOs from Bank of America. We had proctor and gamble, target or tarjet, and Hilton all seeming to be optimistic surrounding recession chances, and the current state of the consumer here's what they had to say. They have pushed that projection for recession out a little bit into 23, but their core belief is a mild recession. So purely from a consumer demand and willingness to span the standpoint, we wouldn't predict a recession. The hope is, it allows the Fed, at some point over the next six or 12 months, to sort of stabilize having done their job with inflation, more in a control, and allow the economy to get its footing again and start a process of re-acceleration. They continue to say they want to celebrate the holidays, and we know they're out on the streets of New York, they're in restaurants, they're in our stores, so right now we're seeing a stable environment. So there was a ton to really be extrapolated from those conversations, whether it was during our all market summit to kick off the week, or even later on as we moved through Ernie season, but particularly one of the threads was where the Fed policy is going to continue to actually impact the consumer in this near term, and what that actually does for the economy to change the demand profile or the demand cycle that we find ourselves in as relates to these companies' financial performance. Yeah, we talked about it earlier, Brad. I think we got a taste to that in that really major profit warming for a whirlpool. Again, those are big ticket purchases that you put on credit cards, heard it from Generak earlier in the week, but what is interesting, I'll just call up Target as well, Brian Cornell, Chairman and CEO, telling us he's a stable business, but how stable is it next year? Let's say there's a Target store next to Snap headquarters or where Snap employees work. They just missed their quarter because of pressure on online spending because the economy is slowing down. That person now lost their job. Are they still spending at the same rate after this holiday season at a target that they were this year? Unclear, which speaks to the bigger thing, this is a very challenging Ernie season. It is really hard to truly understand what is going on inside corporate America. It's a hard Ernie season, but at the same time for us and the conversations, I mean, the questions that we're asking are definitely trying to just get a different sense of...",https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XTJjX90THDQ,15,2022-10-21 14:57:58
3832," It's a hard earnings season, but at the same time for us and the conversations, I mean, the questions that we're asking are definitely trying to just get a different sense of where there actually is some of that vulnerability, how they're managing through that, and then on the other side of that, what kind of company is emerging on the other side of that economic downturn or macroeconomic challenge that continues to be cited here? More big convose to come next week. Well, that is it for myself and Brad. Coming up, Akiko Pajito will speak with two analysts about the state of the semiconductor sector. You won't want to miss it. Thank you. Welcome to Yahoo Finance Live. And happy Friday to all of you. It's 11am here in New York City. I'm Akiko Fujita. Here's what I'm watching at this hour. Snap, crackle, flop. Shares of the social media company plummet. As declining ad revenue and widening losses weigh on investors, we're going to discuss the numbers and implications for wider tech. Musk underscrew me. The Biden administration reportedly considers national security reviews for the Tesla CEO as questions swirl around foreign investors involved with the Twitter buyout. Ship disruption, new US tech controls threatened to shake up the global semiconductor industry. As companies scramble to be in compliance, we've got a paddle standing by for you to discuss the implications. First though, let's check in on the market action. We are 90 minutes into the trading day, of course, trying to round out the week here on a positive note. We've got the Dow up 151 points. The S&P 500 up nine. The Nasak, the only one in the red. The yield on the 10 year treasury note, one to really note today, climbing to a level we have not seen in 14 years.",https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XTJjX90THDQ,16,2022-10-21 15:02:14
3833, 100 up 9 the Nasdaq the only one in the red the yield on the T tenure treasury note want to really note today climbing to a level we have not seen in 14 years we also saw a big jump in the 30 year yield but we've seen a bit of a pullback off the highs in part because of some of the comments that we have gotten from Fed officials there's that Wall Street Journal report that came out that pointed to potential concerns within our monk Fed officials about over tightening and how aggressively they're moving that could be partly what we're seeing the levels right now but the tenure yield still at 4.24% moving on to our top story of the hour it is all about snap and take a look at where shares are trading right now down more than 30% following its miss on revenue estimates for the third quarter the social media company citing continued deceleration of revenue growth as a result of ongoing challenges that include platform policy changes macro economic had wins and increased competition joining us now for a snapshot of the path ahead for staff we got Jason healthstein up in high-mer managing director and head of internet research Jason you know this certainly was not a great quarter but this is a steep fall for this company shares are down more than 30% how much of this you think is overdone I think the challenges investors are kind of estimates I'll do they want to support this company longer term I think one of the questions we get from investors is you know will they ever put ads in messaging I think it's pretty well known we all know we use all of us use messaging products right and we generally don't see ads and messaging products and so and a lot of this company's use case is at the messaging tool right when they do then try to take that activity and get you to spend time using spotlight and using discover but they're also seeing a kind of competition there from TikTok and others and so when you couple together the 5% decline in U.S. time spent with kind of revenue that was below expectations and and currently trend that investors are having a really hard time to cybery you know I think you're having investors trying to decide do they want to underwrite the stock longer the company longer term Jason there are two key issues that have really persisted from quarter to quarter this year one is of course that the slowdown that we've seen in ad spending to the point you just made also the other one is about this company being able to navigate these changes that have taken part as a new as a result of the privacy guardrails that are now in place through apples I.O.S. I mean this is not these are not new problems that came up during this quarter and I wonder if you think we've taken away anything more based on that earnings call yesterday about how much worse things are about to get particularly for snap yeah we think kind of the apple privacy is is is a good excuse but not the main reason that really only affects for the most part app downloads or advertisers trying to drop downloads the bulk of snapchats advertising is brand advertising and and that's what's been bouncing around kind of month a month in kind of an unpredictable way so and they're telling you that they they expect their brand advertising to slow as they move through the quarter right and so I just that is that is the kind of the issue and then they're also telling you that effectively competition is still a threat to time spent and so this quarter you saw impressions slowed not a ton they were up 8% item of ads sold versus nine for the last quarter but then price brand was down three versus up four in the second quarter and they're kind of telling you that they think those metrics will slow right expecting basically flat revenue growth in the back half and you know it's not the fourth quarter and it's not all currency currency was about two points of headwind so there's definitely you know I'd say more companies specific factors obviously will know more next week when alphabet and metta report but we don't expect kind of as bad of an outlook from metta because they will be comparing against what was a challenging period last year well and let's pick about that point because when you look at the other social media stocks they are following today in tandem with snap not to the levels that we're seeing,https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XTJjX90THDQ,17,2022-10-21 15:06:20
3834," Following today in tandem with snap not to the levels that we're seeing in terms of declines in the snap stock But alphabet you mentioned meta Pinterest another one that's been coming down as well We've learned in the last quarter that you know it this is this isn't snap isn't always a bellweather partly because these other names Are a little more diversified. I mean what's your expectation when you look at some of these names on the screen? Who's best position to write out the macro headwinds? Yeah, I mean to to your point, you know, we do think that the whole sector is getting penalized Obviously not not as bad as a snap is but kind of down, you know four or five six percent depending on the company We actually do like meta the best right now For playing digital advertising within large cap in front of the quarter Mostly because they already took their longs a year ago, right? So they were the most impacted by Apple privacy changes They call that a 10 percentage point kind of impact to them They also benefited the most during the pandemic from the poll forward in e-commerce spending and e-commerce advertising and that has unwound as we As the economy is reopened if you look at the monthly data on retail sales e-commerce isn't growing any faster than overall retail sales So that's kind of telling you that they're still kind of like a hangover there And so we think as that starts to obey and you've easier calms we think the setup is is pretty good for meta And then the last thing is we are waiting for Apple to kind of update. It's called SCAD Network 4.0. It's the next technology tool to improve Tracking of ads and and performance data and we think meta is the best position company to take advantage of that for their advertiser So we are optimistic on meta in front of the quarter Okay, well, we're watching for those numbers when they come out next week Jason healthstein Oppenheimer managing director and head of internet research appreciate the time Thank you Well, let's not turn to the broader markets. We've got fed officials now moving forward towards another rate hike of point 75 percentage points at the November meeting We've got Yahoo Finance as Jared liqueur is always on top of this and yield certainly been the focus of the week But yet again today we're talking about a level we haven't seen in 14 years Yes, and let's go to the Wi-Fi interactive. I'm plotting the US dollar index We're going to circle around the currencies in a second because what we're talking about in terms of bonds very closely link with currencies And there are spillover effects into equities everything is linked here So here's a US dollar index appreciated 17% versus this basket of currencies Mainly weighted towards a euro, but very illustrative of what's been going on here Here's a 10 year Tino yield it looks very similar to that US dollar chart In fact, they're very correlated hitting 4.22 percent now it has backed off a little bit higher number than that But as you said at Keiko most of these bond yields we have not seen since 2007 through 2011 I can put you I can show the five year That's down nine basis points a 30 year that is up base eight basis points So we have a lot that's happening with the yield curve right now and essentially it has been flattening And let me just point you I'm going to put up the US dollar one more time here and I have some comments from Nordia that I want to go over because we are caught in an effects Loop here and this has to do with respect This has to do with the Bank of Japan now Nordia is taking a look at this countries are saying do not have an endless amount of US dollars at disposal to sell Meaning that effects intervention will fail when the US dollar coffers run dry This is from the perspective of these central bankers over in Japan They have amassed a war chest of US dollars. They also hold 1.2 trillion dollars in US treasuries very important here So Nordia going on to say more over effects intervention involves selling US treasuries That's to get US dollars which adds upward pressure on US rates That's because rates are inverse to bond prices stick with me one more second here This leads to a stronger US dollar in isolation this affects intervention intervention US US dollar doom loop doom loop illustrated here I'll show you the picture in a second could lead to dollar overshooting especially when central banks are enforcing the loop So here we go weaker yen sales of US treasuries higher US dollar rates weaker yen and the cycle continues And that's what we've been seeing here And this the spillover effects as I mentioned with respect to equities These de leveraging actions right here. We're not going to see a bit on equities until all of this is done",https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XTJjX90THDQ,18,2022-10-21 15:10:42
3835," And this, the spillover effects, as I mentioned with respect to equities, these leveraging actions right here, we're not going to see a bit on equities until all of this is done. And the central bankers have been very flat-footed about the response so far. Yeah, the BOJ in even tougher position given the data we got today, right? Eight-year high inflation, not at the level that we're seeing in the US, but still, they've got a very dovish policy in place. They've got the yen continuing to weaken against the dollar, and then now that they're looking at we didn't get to it, but the yen very volatile today, maybe an intervention that we don't know about going on right now. Okay, something to watch, thanks so much for that, Jared. Well, at the time now for our trending ticker, and we are seeing weaker than expected subscriber numbers weighing on shares of Verizon. That stock is down more than 6% hitting a 52-week low today. The largest wireless carrier added just 8,000 monthly subscribers in the most recent quarter. As competitors offered aggressive promotions to take away market share, that prompted Verizon to offer its own discount and introduce low-cost mobile phone service and internet plans. There's what CEO Hans Westberg had to say on customer terms this morning. We took a deliberate decision in a second quarter to do price adjustment in certain consumer segments, and we knew that we would have a show in Bobbill. So that was sort of an expected and very deliberate decision we took, and it was important for us to also do that because our industry has not done price adjustments on wireless ever. So this was the time to do it. We did it for certain segments, so that will ease over all the time. So I think that's a very important message. Broadband proved to be a bright spot for the quarter for Verizon. The company added another 342,000 wireless home internet customers in the quarter. Well, coming up, the result season is stealing the headlines this week, but investors keeping a very close watch on the bond market as the 10-year treasury yield hits levels we haven't seen in 14 years. We're going to talk to market strategy on the other side.",https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XTJjX90THDQ,19,2022-10-21 15:15:22
3836," [♪ OUTRO MUSIC PLAYING [♪ Philadelphia Fed President Patrick Carker says the Central Bank is not quite finished raising its target rate as inflation remains stubbornly high. Meanwhile, a fresh report in the Wall Street Journal this morning suggests some Fed officials are signaling unease with big rate rises. So is this the first sign of the long-awaited pivot? Do you want to guess the discusses Emily Roland Co. Chief Investments for as just a John Hancock investment management? Emily, I'd be curious to get your thoughts on this report that came out from the journal today about the debate that's happening in whether you in fact think that the data that we have gotten, the latest data points to the need for at least a pause in the hikes. Yeah, the volatility in the rate market today has been nothing short of astonishing. You know, we woke up to this continued backup and interest rates have been playing out over the last few days and then this, you know, journal article comes out suggesting that potentially the Fed is going to be leaning towards 50 basis points in December instead of 75 or at least discussing that at the November Fed meeting here. So, you know, we think that that it's right to consider a pause and you even heard Lail Brainerd earlier about a week ago talking about the fact that, you know, maybe we are a pause is potentially warranted here as some of the monetary policy decisions start to really work their way into the economy and it's important to recognize that Fed policy works the long and variable lag. The Fed just started tightening in March of this year and they've implemented the most aggressive amount of tightening that we've seen in the generation in a really, really short amount of time. We want to watch to see how that actually filters into the economy before the Fed just continues down this path of aggressive tightening. How much of that have we actually seen filter through the economy based on what you've seen? Well, we look at the leading economic indicators and we just saw another negative readings. We've had three negative readings in a row here for the leading indicators and that's the gest that we are in a significantly decelerating economic growth climate. The challenges is that the Fed uses by nature of their mandates lagging economic data. So, they're looking at the fact that the unemployment rate is at 3.5 percent near a 50 or low. They're looking at CPI data which just continues to be and they're a big component of that of course is the housing market shelter which tends to be a very sticky component of inflation. It takes time to show up in the data and the Fed is marching down this path of dampening inflation really at any cost but that's the key question at what cost and they're looking like they're going to keep going until something breaks. I mean the other big challenge of course comes down to messaging and that's been a bit tricky when you think about how things played out over the summer. Now we know that the Fed officials didn't feel like the markets were simply getting the message. We got that very strong message at Jackson Hole. Since then it's sort of been we're going to continue to hike rates until inflation comes down. How do you think they told the line here? If in fact there is some kind of pause to at least message to the markets this doesn't mean a pivot. This is just a slowdown. It's such a great question because the messaging and the forward guidance is so critical and one of the things we learned from the journal article this morning was that the Fed wants to be careful in avoiding a big upside move in markets based on this perceived Fed pivot. So I think if they do decide to go with 50 in December it's going to be well telegraphed whether it's through the Wall Street Journal or some other mechanism because we saw that incredible rallying soft to play it out from mid-June to mid-August for your point there and it was based on this false hope that the Fed was going to reverse course in quick fashion and clearly that's not the case and they've made it quite clear that they're going to keep the gloves off and the fight against inflation until the fight is done. Bottom line Emily as we look ahead to the next few months and what does that mean from an investment standpoint does this change at all in terms of your thesis on",https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XTJjX90THDQ,20,2022-10-21 15:19:21
3837," Emily, as we look ahead to the next few months, and what does that mean from an investment standpoint? Does this change at all in terms of your thesis on where things are headed? Or is this also a time to maybe pause and wait to see where the economic debt elites? Yeah, I mean, investors are feeling really specific right now as this volatility picked up, and we're suggesting to them that they should focus on the horizon, which to us really means looking at the income on high-quality bonds as something that's pretty competitive versus the other alternatives out there. We used to talk about China. There's no alternative. And what we meant a couple years ago that given the fact that bond yields were so low, there was no other alternative but to buy stocks. And we would argue today that there is no alternative to bond. Yes, price pressures are there, but the fact that you can get five, six percent income on high-quality bonds right now, we think it's awfully competitive. You look at the dividend yield on the S&T 500, which is less than 2%. So we want to move up the capital structure. We want to get paid income as we wait out this more challenging macro backdrop. Some good takeaways there. Emily Roland, Co-Chief Investment Stragist at John Hancock Investment Management. Good to talk to you today. Thank you. Well, there's even more trouble for Elon Musk ahead. The US government reportedly considering whether it should review Musk's newfound empire. That includes his ongoing deal for social media site Twitter and SpaceX's satellite network. Let's bring, we should report, is according to Bloomberg. Let's bring in Yahoo Finance, is Alexis Keenan, who's tracking this. Alexis, let's start with what's happening with Twitter because this is an interesting one given that the concern is really about who's part of this investment group for Twitter, that there are foreign players in here that could potentially signal a conflict. Right. So what Bloomberg is reporting is that US officials in the Abadan administration are concerned about the Twitter deal to the extent that it has foreign investors, including the Saudi Arabian prince Al Wali Bintalal, as well as Binance, which has a Chinese founder and has backing from Cutters' sovereign wealth fund. So that's where they're saying that according to sources, there are maybe some concerns. Now, they also go on to say that it's not really clear which agency would originate this kind of inquiry, but one of the usual suspects is CIFIAS, that's the Committee on Foreign Investment in the United States. That committee in 2018 was given a lot of expanded authority to conduct these types of threat assessments over possible security concerns that arise from foreign investment in US companies. And they even got expanded authority to look at those multi-national deals that result in less than foreign control, which was the former case for the agency, especially they got some authority to look at investments that involve companies that are engaged in technology and personal data. Of course, the Twitter deal would qualify, I would think, perhaps, under that standard. Now, the idea that the security review of a security review at all based on national security concerns, it's been raised previously with respect to Tesla, with respect to SpaceX's Starlink satellite network. But it's the first time we're hearing about it, raised with respect to the Twitter deal, that's certainly sparking a lot of questions about the, whether the government could end up derailing this deal and certainly part of that contract for the merger between the two companies. It does require that it surpass any regulatory and government review. So that's getting a lot of talk here. Elon Musk already tweeting that in response to this Bloomberg piece saying commenting on a Twitter post that said it would be hilarious if the government ended being the one to derail this tie up between Twitter and Musk's companies that he's formed in order to effectuate this merger. Really quickly, Alexis, any of us who've followed these syphias reviews in the past know that this is never a quick turnaround. And we are talking months and months and months of review. If in fact that's triggered, what does that mean for the deal? Well, Akiko, syphias can take a look at transactions that are already, that are.",https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XTJjX90THDQ,21,2022-10-21 15:23:42
3838," view. If in fact that's triggered, what does that mean for the deal? Well, Akiko Sifius can take a look at transactions that are already that have already happened. So they can go back and try to get some agreements from companies that have already done the deal. So it doesn't necessarily stop the deal from going forward, but the government could also intervene and say we would like to have some things ironed out before it does commence. So we'll certainly be watching the deadline that the court has put on the deal, which is October 28th next Friday, one week from today. But look, yes, it could go on for a very long time, these types of inquiries, but it doesn't mean that it just stops the deal and it's tracks. Okay, thanks getting a little more complicated there. Alexis Keenan, thanks so much for that. Well, coming up, upscale electricity. If you like trucks and want something like a hummer, then not exactly a hummerable GMC might have the thing for you. Yacht Finance is probably supermanium is going to have the story for us on the other side. The competition in the EV space is revving up. General Motors unveiled its latest electric truck yesterday, the 2024 GMC Sierra EV. It's now taking reservations for the $107,000 fully loaded version called the Sierra EV Denali Edition. Thankfully, we've got a supermanium to break down all the details for us. That is a hefty price tag, but it's not the only truck on the market. That's an EV. How does it compare? Well, you know, it's, it's twin is basically the silver auto, the Chevy Silverado, which I find to have a design that's more adventure lifestyle truck. Whereas if you look at the the new Sierra EV over here, it's more traditional truck like, looks like a work truck. I think it might have peeled to a broader set of people. Power.",https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XTJjX90THDQ,22,2022-10-21 15:28:15
3839," or lifestyle truck whereas if you look at the new Sierra EV over here it's more traditional truck like, looks like a work truck, I think it might have peeled to a broader set of people. Power wise it actually has more power than the top of Lancelot Brado, it has around 750 horsepower, 400 miles of range in that top trim, so that's pretty competitive. But you did mention that price, $107,000 for that top tier, it's very pricey, very high and very premium I would say. But I did get a chance to speak to the chief engineer, Nicole Crats about lower trim levels that are actually going to compete against the Ford Lightning Pro. Here's what you'd say. $2000 model for the Sierra EV is an elevation, it's an elevation trim so it's not a work truck in the in the standpoint of a model named a work truck or a fleet truck if you will. We're bringing some really compelling capability from a basic perspective on the Sierra EV into all price points. The trucks are capable of different ranges and different option contents. So the Sierra EV Denali that we're talking about for 2024 with our edition one is a fully loaded full all of the technology that we can possibly imagine. And then in the future, you know, many of these things become options and then various range picks as well available. So it really brings an EV pickup for everyone. I mean, we talk about that and people kind of think that's a little cliche perhaps, but we are really committed to bringing folks into our EVs, specifically in the EV pickup truck segment. And by offering them, you know, all of the capability and all of the technology that they desire, we can, you know, establish to these various ranges of our price points as well. So we don't have the spexy up for that elevation from that base model, but we do know that the Sierra Denali EV one that high end one is going to come out in 2024 with the lower terms coming out in 2025. So how does this compare to the gas powered Sears? And is that the exact target they're going for in terms of who's likely to switch over? Well, I think with the lower terms, they're going to know if they do stick with that $50,000 price set, which is, as you know, these things have been changing, that would be comparable to a Sierra work, elevation work truck at that, I shouldn't say, workshop at that trim level, it would be comparable price wise, and even have a bit more power. But the question is, are you going to be able to convince these guys who drive traditional trucks? I want to, I want to EV with potentially less than 400 miles of range. And then I'm going to take the job site, is that going to be as, as capable and sturdy as my traditional gas power can go anywhere sort of thing. So I think that's the big sort of question that GM is trying to answer or how their clients or customers answer. Yeah, still a lot of concerns about range, about infrastructure, charging stations, making sure that's all in place. Right, right. So they can drive it just like they would know normal. Right. I do want to add one thing that it does have the GM, kind of like the ability to power a work site, power your home, and also power the grid, potentially with their GM energy products. So that will work with that with the ultimate battery pack. So they do have that additional capability that you might not find in like a ravine, for example. Yeah, and that would benefit there. All right. Thanks so much for that, Pras. Well, coming up the eternal push and pull, it's been another choppy week for crude oil, prices, which in higher now is recession fear, take a back seat to hope over renewed finance demand that conversation is going up next. So tools now",https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XTJjX90THDQ,23,2022-10-21 15:32:36
3840," Nothing. What we are seeing crude setting to finish off what has been a very choppy week. His investors look ahead to earnings from the oil majors, given growing suppliers in places like Libyan recession fears, though, question is where prices headed. For more on that, let's bring in Mohammad Darwazah. He's senior analyst of macro energy at energy aspects. I'm Mohammad, good to talk to you today. I want to start with the demand that we've been looking at over in China. Of course, we started off the week at the party congress that's now wrapping up and the expectation was maybe we'd get some signaling on whether in fact China would sort of back off on the zero-COVID policy, which has led to a lot of concerns about the demand coming out of there. What do you see in terms of how things are likely to shape up in the next few months? Yeah, thank you for having me. I think you're absolutely right. There may be had been some expectations building up that post party congress, China would start moving away from zero-COVID. I think what has been clear is that actually a lot of these lockdowns have come into effect ahead of the party congress in anticipation or sort of expectation that policy will begin to shift over the next sort of three to six months. I think the market has now kind of caught up with the view that this is unlikely to change imminently, but I think going forward, there is an expectation that COVID rules are going to begin to be relaxed. China has been somewhat absent from the buying cycle, include markets over the past year or so, and I think once China does come back, this is going to be certainly a bullish factor. The next marker, a lot of investors certainly looking ahead to, is in December when we see those sanctions come down on Russian oil, we're looking at where prices are tracking today. It certainly looks like at least some of those recession fears have subsided a little. How are you looking at where things are right now for talking Brent Critt at 92.88 in the context of what's to come? Yeah, absolutely. I think obviously a lot of uncertainty going into your end, and this is kind of cast sort of a cloud over the market. The EU embargo on Russian crude and products that set to come in in December of this year and in February of next year, I think ultimately will have a significant impact on Russian production. We expect Russian production to drop by an average of about a million barrels a day, sort of by the end of Q1 of next year. More generally, I think prices will be kept going forward because of demand fears, because of concerns around recession. We are expecting quite a deep recession in Europe, a much shorter and a shallow one in the United States. And I think ultimately, the X factor here is really China. So much of the concern in the oil markets have been shaped around the supply concern. You mentioned demand concern. Is that what's going to be driving prices going into your end?",https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XTJjX90THDQ,24,2022-10-21 15:36:55
3841," So much of the concern in the oil markets have been shaped around the supply concern. You mentioned demand concern. Is that what's going to be driving prices going into year end? And what are some of those risks that we're overlooking? Yeah, I mean supply, I think the market does spend a lot of time looking at supply. Supply is constrained. This is a structural issue. I think people are coming around to that view. And I would say it's a lot more sort of divergence in the market in terms of expectations. And in times of recession, we tend to see commodities and late cycle sort of sell off. And this is no different. But when we look at sort of the highs of the year, we have come off and we're about 20 ish percent from this year's highs. Okay. We'll be watching a lot of people watching to see where those prices track. Mohammed Darwaza, senior analyst of macro energy at energy aspects. Thanks so much. Thank you for your time. Well, the cost of Pfizer's COVID vaccine is going to quadruple after the current purchase program expires in the U.S. Earlier this week, Julie Heimins spoke to the company CEO Albert Borla about pricing. Here's what we have to say. The vaccines will be priced based on their cost effectiveness. And the cost effectiveness is multiple of what it is right now. The price when we give to the governments in the pandemic. We have the finance senior health reporter, Anjali Kamlani here, to break it all down for us. How big of a surprise is this sort of an expected thing? This is an expected thing. The number is the part that's new. So 110 to 130. That's what the news that we just found out. And that's from an analyst call yesterday that Pfizer had. And I want to dig down into the details because it is important to understand what's baked in to this pricing. It's things like the cost of a single dose vaccine packaging. It's the fact that they're now going to be distributing through multiple sources rather than just through the government and through that single channel of the distributor and the mailing and delivery service and transportation. That all goes away once the government contract ends. And so what they're looking at is early Q1, or sorry, late Q1, a so earlier next year is when they're looking to really transition more into this commercial environment that also includes, by the way, the discussion about the cost and whose paying for it. It's going to be borne by insurers. And so most Americans won't really be impacted by this price shift. But it's important to point out that Pfizer did note that the uninsured are going to be taken care of in a quote. They said, eligible UL residents without insurance will be able to access the COVID-19 vaccine for free. So that stays in place as well through their current programs, that assistance programs for patients. So all that put together really, you know, paints a picture of an expected commercial market, the price itself is not outrageous. We do know that there are vaccines within that price range over $100. So like you said, not really unexpected. Okay. Speaking of COVID, there are reports of more lockdowns in China. I'm just looking at this number here in terms of where things have stood since March. China is partially or fully locked down 152 cities. Yes. Since March. Effecting 280 million people. So what's the very latest? Taking down even further, 114 of those have been since August alone. So let's talk about what we've really talked about this week. We know that Beijing announced select lockdowns in the major city Thursday, Genjo on Monday. And then we also know, Shionn, today, got some more lockdowns in those areas. So really some key metropolis that are being affected right now. That's why we're hearing a little bit more about this. But it's important to note that it's not entire lockdowns for the most part. And that's what's different this time around. We know that previously we'd seen really major district wide, city wide lockdowns. But the impact has been, you know, that we've seen a struggle for the country in terms of being able to plan. They've been switching announcements. So for example, in the Genjo area, they didn't necessarily impact the Foxconn plan or that Apple plan, the iPhone manufacturing plan. But the company itself did put in restrictions for a dining area. So we're seeing some of that movement, Macau, for example. That's another thing that's being hit, right? We know that there has been some impact from what the overall China lockdowns have had. So Macau has seen a decline almost 50% slow gaming revenue in September. So all of this like broader impacts of just these.",https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XTJjX90THDQ,25,2022-10-21 15:41:06
3842," China lockdowns have had. So Macau has seen a decline, almost 50 percent slow gaming revenue in September. So all of this, like broader impacts of just these select targeted lockdowns. And I mean, you know better than I do about what this means for the party and just what the future means for what it means for. I mean, you wonder if China is now sort of taking this approach of being a little more selective on how or where aggressively they move largely because the impact it's had on the economy. We're talking about what anywhere from high to 3 percent growth this year, as well below the target. You get the sense from the party congress, they sort of accepted the slow growth, but any further slowdown, you'd imagine would still be a big concern. It would be, I mean, this is impacting poor cities, this is impacting transportation. It's all going back to the question of where does the world's maker, right, manufacturing hub, stand when it comes to continuing this many years later. We've seen, you know, here in the US, of course, is a bad comparison, but complete opposite, right? We've let go of so many mitigation measures. And by comparison to what they had early on in the strict lockdowns, this is definitely more targeted and that requires more focus on the local government. So the party has really left it up to the local governments to decide, but it is still part of that zero-covid policy or dynamic zero policy. Well, into your point worth noting because there is a trickle effect, whether it's in, you know, devices being manufactured, they're a pair of makers. I mean, it really is the hub, and that has an impact in the US, in Europe all over. So, story that I know you're going to see on top of coming up on the other side, the next battleground. Semmy conductors have been described as the new oil, but we'll have the firmest grip on the market. I'm going to go in fight to secure production. Our panel is going to take a look at it from all sides after this short break.",https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XTJjX90THDQ,26,2022-10-21 15:45:41
3843," What is time now for today's chart of the day and we're focusing on semi-conductors as a key indicator of economic trouble ahead. This chart from Bloomberg compares the performance of the beaten down semi-conductor sector with another one on a downward trend and that's ISM new orders. The analyst behind the chart suggests the correlation doesn't necessarily mean a deep recession is imminent but the two trending in the same direction makes the compelling case for a downtrend. The semi-sector is down more than 40% this year outpacing the S&P's 20% decline. Well, China's Ministry of Industry and Information Technology reportedly met with leading semi-conductor companies over the past week seeking to assess the fallout for the Biden administration's chip restrictions on China. The administration now also reportedly exploring the possibility of new export controls to limit China's access to emerging computing technologies. What could all this mean for the path forward in the semi-sector? Let's bring in Daniel Newman, his future on research principle analyst. We both have got Edith Young, race capital general partner here to break it all down for us. Edith, I want to start with you because I think it's worth noting an interesting set that you have put out here in terms of what this exactly means. When you look at it, China consumes more than 75% of the semi-conductors globally but produces only about 15%. We have heard so many reports since the administration came down with these tech controls about not just panic but just full-on reassessment happening. What are you hearing from those on the ground? I think right now what China is trying to ask sex is if the intent from the US government is to make sure that China cannot even buy or produce or even maintain what does that mean and this actually could impact many, many industry. We're not just talking about computer or smartphone, EV. There's all sort of industry actually really need this chipset to continue to run. I don't think there is a conclusion yet but what I'm worried about that if China really wants to be as aggressive as the US and retaliate, there could be a lot of impact for all the other companies in the US and I think this is beyond just impact in terms of revenue for Intel or Qualcomm or Nvidia or of course we need to watch out for TSMC but if they retaliate in other industries this is going to be disastrous. And we'll get to the impact on some of those companies in just a bit but really follow up here, Eda, what's the capability of these Chinese companies to be able to be self-sufficient when you're talking about advanced chips? So for the fast few years President Xi is trying very hard to make sure that China as a country can be independent from buying from Nvidia, Intel or Qualcomm but I think personally I think it's still very far away to get to that level. I don't think China is self-sufficient yet even though the TSMC, SMIC is sort of the TSMC for China but they're still far ahead in terms of what is being produced locally. Daniel Zediff highlighted, I mean these as in the companies in China are major customers for American chip designers, chip makers too. There's an interesting report that BCG put out a few years ago that said that full tech control as in a complete ban could lead to upwards of 40% drop in revenue for some of these big names in the US. How are you assessing that impact right now? Yeah I think we got to look at the more broad economic story of what's going on here. I think President Xi Jinping has been very declarative about the intention of China to be the leading designer and manufacturer of leading edge semiconductors. The US has put a massive investments with the CHIPS Act to take more control of its own fate and its supply chain. We have a lot of microaggressions.",https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XTJjX90THDQ,27,2022-10-21 15:49:39
3844," US has put a massive investments with the CHIP's act to take more control of its own fate and its supply chain. We have a lot of micro-aggressions going on in the South China Sea. And right now, this is one of the things China is very dependent on US intellectual property and engineering capabilities in order to manufacture these leading edge chips. So a lot of this is focused on things like AI, high performance computing, which are going to not only enable innovation in, as our other guests said, in smartphones and EVs, but in biotechnology and financial services and money laundering and fraud and things that need a lot of compute power. And so the US right now is looking at the opportunity to sort of control the fate of the development of leading edge technologies, chipsets. And of course, this puts strain on both sides. It puts strains on US manufacturers and designers of semiconductors. It also puts strain on equipment makers, because part of this ban is also the shipping of equipment, the export of equipment that China needs in order to build more leading edge capacity. So as I see it, it's a very interesting moment because it's not only macroeconomic, it's also about their economic policy and national defense and security. But if we're talking strictly, Daniel, what it means for businesses, I mean, if China consumes more than 75% of this, and that market is effectively blocked off, you know, it's the Biden administration really does put these controls in place and cracks down. What does that mean for these companies in terms of revenue? Well, right now it's only very specific chips and everybody's been assessing this. It's not the whole portfolio of semiconductors. Folks, I've listened to, you know, Justin Wong and Nvidia, they're already accounting for what they think are going to be components of their portfolio and the impact that it might have on revenue. And of course, we've seen the early warnings coming out from these companies. There's certainly a chance that this could have a much bigger waterfall effect. But I think these companies have already looked at the situation they're assessing it. And in this sort of tough macro and tough economic period, they're starting to put those warnings out about what it could mean. I'm not overly alarmed that it's going to be the whole portfolio of all chips, lagging edge that are used to manufacture our frigerators and air conditioning systems. I think this is about leading the arms race for the next generation of technology in areas like supercomputing, high performance compute and artificial intelligence.

The social media giant saying on Twitter that its app has never been used to target American government, activists, public figures, or journalists. This is a response to a report in Forbes that data would have been accessed without users knowledge or consent. Forbes reporting that Tiktok's parent company started a monitoring project to investigate misconduct by employees. It's unclear whether American citizens' data was ever collected, but the report says there had been a plan to obtain location data from U.S. users' devices. Well, Tiktok is also out with some other news this week on its plan to grow with its consumers and thus making the move to introduce an adult's only option for live streamers on the platform. Let me want to restrict their viewership to those 18 and older. Let's bring in Yahoo Finance's Kelsey Barbario who is following this for us. Let's define adults only. People heard this and thought, whoa, where is Tiktok going? I know they're like, is this going to be the new only fans? I don't think that that is the intention whatsoever. Tiktok is actually quite buttoned up with what they allow on their platform. What I think that the big takeaway here is that they are moving their live streams from right now, 16-year-olds and older. With a minimum of 1,000 followers, they're the ones that are eligible to live stream. They're just bumping that up to 18. That's going to be on November 23rd. But outside of that, people are going to be allowed to kind of clarify what audience might be the best suited for their live stream. So say you've got like a comedy show that you're going to do on a live show or live stream, excuse me. And it's a little inappropriate for younger people, you could mark that in flag it as being for adults. So that way the people under 18 are not seeing it. So part of this is about the maturation of their users that they are going to be 18 and older when you think about sort of the demographic. Tiktok also implementing further restrictions to the type of content they're going to be allowing there. What more do we know about that? Yeah, so outside of the live streams, I think that they're looking into more safety practices overall. So for example, they have three different things that they're specifically honing in on. That's going to be hateful ideology is eating disorders, endangering acts and challenges. And I think that last one is most specifically targeted for children. Because think about things like the tide pod challenge from a million years ago or most specifically recently the cooking chicken and naikwool. That's the sort of stuff that they do not want to be affiliated with Tiktok. And so they're really working on making sure that those practices absolutely are not allowed on the platform. How much of this is about what they've seen with the other platforms and getting out on the head with competitors like Instagram. I feel like there is a whole lot to do with that. I mean, you know, Congress has really been cracking down on social media platforms recently. And I think that they're just trying to get ahead of things before something might come on for them as well. Okay. Kelsey is always not just on Tiktok, but our Tiktok expert. Thanks so much for that. And let's do a final market check before we let you go. And we are so agree across the board here. The game's sort of accelerating as we count down to the weekend, the Dow is up nearly 400 points, the S&P 500, up about 40 points and the NASDAQ up 82 points there. Certainly earnings and focused yet again today. The one big mover we've been tracking very closely is SNAP along with some of these other social media stocks as concerns about declining ad revenue there, take hold as well. And yield also in focus we should point out as we look ahead to that next FOMC meeting. And those reports out today that potentially fed officials are considering slowing down some of those rate hikes because of the concerns of how they've taken hold in the economy. And that does it for me in this hour. We've got much more to come here in the Yakku finance live. We're out there right here.",https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XTJjX90THDQ,29,2022-10-21 15:58:41

3847," would actually perhaps dampen demand because of the interest rates also impacting the way that consumers or customers might be able to finance these vehicles in the futures too. That's another major consideration for a company in Tesla. And that particularly directly correlates with some of the demand or some of the forecasts that they're even talking about here. 50% a year in terms of production sales deliveries that they're trying to grow towards in the near future. Yeah, I mean, he sort of acknowledged maybe a softening in demand, right? But overall, the narrative continues to be at Tesla. Demands fine. Demands okay. We are not able to get as many cars as we produce into people's hands. And that really accounts for the gap here that we're seeing that the company is not going to necessarily meet its production and delivery targets for 2022. So, the other deliveries should be 50%. That's the long-term annual target. They're not going to make that this year. And that was the big news that came out last night. But even in the meantime, because of supply chain issues affecting that, supply chain and delivery issues are also affecting the cars they can make, getting to people, shipping costs are going up, having trouble getting space. And then, when ships, for example, that they need, that's what they're talking about. All of this affecting the automotive gross margin, the quarter 27.9%, which is short of estimate. So, that's why we're seeing the shares down this morning. Maybe a little bit of feed-through in concerns about demand. But the company's line continues to be blaming it on supply chain, blaming it on shipping, et cetera. So, like before we bring our guests here on this one, a lot of chatter out there on the street this morning about a potential China slowdown over on Tesla. I'm looking at a good note by the Guggenheim team, noting potential price cuts on Tesla vehicles. One of you heard that before coming out of China potentially, this fourth quarter, they're calling out rising competition. Look, we've talked to X-Pung, Leonardo, a lot of folks. There's a lot more EVs, players in that key market. And Tesla might be losing market share in its second most important market. Yeah, China, of course, and the Shanghai Gigafactory and ramping up production deliveries. They talked about that on the call, experiencing a reverse recession of sorts, which was interesting to hear. Property market related, property market mostly is what Elon said there. And then Europe, especially with Gigafactory Berlin, they address that on the call too. We've got much more on Tesla here. Let's bring in Wells Fargo equity analyst Colin Langen and New Street Research Managing Partner Pierre Fargo. Great to have you here with us this morning. Colin, first, I want to go to you because you had actually been able to get a question in on the call yesterday. And particularly as we think through full self driving some of what Tesla is selling potential buyers on in the future, do you believe that the demand is going to be able to sustain itself to some of the targets that Tesla is putting forward? In terms of full self driving, I think their timeline is a bit optimistic. I mean, I think particularly when you define full self driving and I think on the call of the question, my question. He described really isn't what most experts would call level four level five full self driving. It's so it still has to monitor the vehicle. That would be an advanced like level two plus type system, which could be very impressive, but not the definition where you could actually remove the person from the car. And San Francisco and the cruise vehicle that's full self driving. There's no one in the driver's seat in the car was driving itself. I think that's kind of what he has promised in the past. And so it seems like it'll be falling short of that. And from the experts that I talked to quite frankly, I don't know without a LiDAR without all the sensors. It's possible. It's going to take I think a very, very long time to get to true level four. So I'm bit skeptical about what full self driving really piece. I'm sure you just heard us talking or highlighting some concerns out of China. What are you seeing in that China market for Tesla? Are they losing market share and how much might they cut prices this quarter? So yeah, it's a good question. What's happening in China today is the way I would characterize it is that we are entering into a phase of like slowing, sustaining and demand. And of course, everybody in China is adapting to that to that circumstances, but you have to keep in mind the context, which is that broadly overall for electric cars in China and everywhere in the world. And supply is still below demand. Jim and still exceeding supply. When you see market share movements, most of the time it's.",https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XTJjX90THDQ,31,2022-10-21 16:07:09
3848," China and everywhere in the world supply is still below demand, demand is still exceeding supply. When you see market share movements, most of the time it's just going to be about who is capable of bringing in cars to the markets. So what is going to drive market share going forward and what has been driving market share so far is much more and I'm talking about cars that can be compared like not like a 15,000 of cars with a 50,000 car of course. What is going to drive market share is actually supply. How many cars can you produce is going to drive your market share? That's what has been driving market share so far. When you look at price cuts, don't necessarily look at it as a reaction to the local market. Think about it more as for Tesla a way to manage the delivery of their cars. At a moment they are shipping a lot of cars outside of China towards other markets. You'll see prices in China holding very high and if at some point Tesla is producing a lot of cars and needs to get these cars into the hand of drivers fast in the Chinese market, they're going to lower their prices. So these movements are actually very tactical. They're always interpreted as more like strategic and long term reaction to a softening of demand. I think it's a mistake. My experience of that surprising price in strategy is actually to be very tactical and play on where they want the gas to be delivered. So let's play off of that a little bit Colin. So do you think there are any longer term implications of what we heard from Tesla in terms of the overall demand picture? I do think as we go into next year's demand is just going to be mathematically tough to do. So if you go back historically and you look at the best selling ever sedan, best selling ever SUV, it's the RAV4 and the Corolla back in 2019 both happened to be the same year. They sold 2.3 million units. The 50% Kager would put you at 2 million units which would be needed almost all would be Model 3 and Model Y. It would probably be almost twice, you know, not quite twice the price point of those vehicles. So that's a very very high threshold at the price point we're talking about. So I do think something has to happen into next year. I think, you know, Q4 is probably okay. I mean they already have orders. They're going to deliver those orders. They've taken good pricing on those orders. I think as you get into next year and you have this very high target and a very high price point, I think something's going to have to give. I don't know that that's even special to Tesla to be honest with you. I think the whole industry is going to have pricing issues but I do think those are some concerns as I go into next year. Pierre, on the call, they were talking about an Elon specifically. What was talking about China, was talking about Europe and the US and all of those with regard to where they may sit within a recession going into one or staring down one in the future or actually actively in one. And so from your perspective, how much might that actually impact some of the demand that Tesla is hoping to lock in? Yeah, it's a great good question, Brad. Look at it from two separate angles. One is a secular angle. One is a specific angle. On a secular angle, as I said, everything indicates there is more demand for electric cars than they supply. It's probably going to remain so the same way. I know it's kind of disturbing for if you look at the industry, the kind industry in your career mirror, you've never seen cars that have had the success of the Tesla car, but look at these cars, they sell for 30 percent growth margins. They've gone through an exceptional unprecedented ramp in terms of manufacturing and they've been accepted in the markets that way. So they are probably going to blow away the kind of demand being by model in the history of the industry. That being said, next year, you have interest rates going up, you have an economic slowdown. Biden's a big deal, and it's very easy for consumers to enter into a mood of postponing the acquisition of a car because interest rates are too high because the economic environment is not good, not good, because the job is at risk. So if there is an economic slowdown, Tesla is going to be heard exactly the same way as other car manufacturers. And as Pauline mentioned, the first impact really is pricing, because when you're manufacturing, you need to get rid of that. They get out of your factory, you need to say that. So the first thing, car manufacturers we do.",https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XTJjX90THDQ,32,2022-10-21 16:11:27
3849, mention the first impact really is pricing because when you're manufacturing guy you need to get rid of that they get out of your factory you need to say that so the first thing how many factors we do in an economic slowdown is lowering prices everybody will do that it's going to be very painful for everybody of course they slept with 30 person gross margins has a lot of room for man over to lower their pricey that's the reason why the team's like an Elon yesterday I said we can go very very very deep before we bear money before we start thinking so in our expansion plan so they are not worried about a recession not because they are not worried about demand they see that demand is at risk next year but if demand is at risk next year they're going to get prices they're going to keep growing the business and they're going to do fine the panel might look very very bad very very challenged no doubt that is but the trajectory of the side I think is not at risk you can we have to ask you this because we get questions like this on Twitter you know musk floating out there potential four trillion dollar valuation some would say he's joking around but still it's a number that he put out there yesterday is there anything in your modeling when you think about the next 10 to 15 years for this company that that might be the valuation they can get to I mean that seems quite a bit of a stretch I think it's comments you've been said there's a narrow path to that you'd have to give them full credit for all of these you know factors that I consider more like long-term optionality issues things like whether you could get true level for full self-driving whether there's actually some value in the Optimus spot and and Dojo and these sort of future projects I think from a pure auto-paker side that's going to be extremely difficult to do and Collin just quickly here must talking about the company board things generally good idea to buy back stock there's also the specter of him potentially personally selling more stock to continue to fund his Twitter purchase do you think one or both of those things does end up happening I think it's almost very likely that both will happen I mean you didn't say that the board was in support of the five to ten billion so I feel like that's almost a soft announcement of the buyback that would still only be one percent of the market cap so it's still fairly small despite the size yeah and I think from the stock sale I mean in the math is you know I think the original deal was that he had 21 billion of financial commitments with equity partners I think the the margin loan for my understanding of 13 to 12.5 is gone so there could be up to 33.5 of total equity commitments needed between him and whatever equity partners he has 15 billion of stock has been sold so there's still multiples of billions of potential of stock that might you might need to sell in order to close the Twitter deal all right we'll be on the lookout for both of those announcements potentially thanks guys appreciate it Collin Langan of Wells Bargo and Pierre-Fierreux Guru of New Street Research thanks to you both appreciate it,https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XTJjX90THDQ,33,2022-10-21 16:15:57
3850," you Think by 2025. What is that market opportunity? Well, good morning, Brian. Thank you for having me today. It's a big market opportunity because not only the market is expanding, but we are entering new segments of the market with new offers as a part of our age-to-class strategy. And those new offers are in the private 5G, in the IoT, and in the data switching portfolio in the connectivity space as well as security in the sassy space together with our flagship product, the SD1, and as well, increasing number of offers as a part of our HP Green Lake platform and new data services. So a combination of cable growth of the time and new segments that give us the opportunity to play over the next three years in that 250-plus billion dollar market. And Tony, that shift to software as a service which ultimately drives to annual recurring revenue, where are you at in that journey? Well, we have made a tremendous progress, if you recall, in 2019, I committed to make available all our offers from age-to-cloud as a service. And at the HP Discovery in June, we achieve a major milestone because not only are age solutions are now part of our HP Green Lake platform, but as well as workload optimization, infrastructure as a services, as a service, and as well as data services. So we made tremendous progress, but now we are operating as a company in a cloud-operating environment, where all our new offers are designed and delivered to HP Green Lake. So now is the journey on continuous adding and renewing those offers as we go forward. And that AIR, as we guided for the next three years, is going to grow between 35 and 45 percent, also not only on the back of a significant growth, which this year alone, we are growing a bookings in excess of 86 percent year to date. But the fact that we already have $7.7 billion of total control value in the Azure Service business in our balance sheet. Are you seeing any red flags or areas of concern in your business? Are customers cancelling orders, are they delaying decisions at all? Well, what is fascinating to me, Brian, is that we continue to see enduring demand for our products and our services. And Green Lake is at the top of that demand. Well, customers love about HP Green Lake. It's the fact that they get a unified cloud experience, inclusive of the public cloud, and all the services and applications they have on premises. And now they get the opportunity to extend not only into the public cloud, with the same experience, but also at the edge. And that's the next big opportunity for us, because we live in a much more distributed enterprise than ever before. And also new use cases are being developed and deployed at the edge. So that's for us is a point of differentiation in my mind. And then when it comes down to momentum, again, enduring demand, but we have not seen any major of the cancellations at all. And that to us is a very positive sign that digital transformation and a key top priority for our customers, and IT plays now a bigger role than ever before. Antonio, some of the analysts commentary I saw this morning. A lot of them see it be flagging the outlook for next year. A little cautious, a little below some of the estimates that were out there. Does that outlook okay?",https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XTJjX90THDQ,34,2022-10-21 16:20:11
3851," So this morning, a lot of them see it be flagging the outlook for next year. A little cautious, a little below some of the estimates that were out there. Does that outlook account for a potential recession in the US? Well, that outlook as Tarek and I stated yesterday includes what we see as a potential disruption that made the market creates because of the inflation and the foreign current exchange, you know, kind of trends we see. So we have comprehended all of that in our outlook. But we are very confident about our outlook because obviously we have a record breaking backlog with again, enduring the amount continued to be in the market. Second is that also we continue to make a significant shift in not only in our product and portfolio mix, but in a way with the liver that makes. And third also, this company generates a lot of cash. And so from my vantage point, we are very well positioned to meet or exceed that outlook. Understanding that the biggest issue unknown today is actually in my mind not so much the macro environment, but more the volatility of the foreign exchange. Antonio, I'm on the the Hula Packard Enterprise stats page on Yahoo Finance and I see your stock trading at under six times four earnings. That is more than half of the broader market. Just given the performance of the business, I mean, that is shocking how you guys performed compared to the past year. You mentioned you have a lot of cash. How are you going to deploy cash over the next 12 months to get that multiple up? Yeah, I think you just said that really well. I mean, our disappointment is on the multiple because not only we're growing revenues, we are also growing recurrent revenues, which they represent more than one third over total revenues. And by the way, almost 80% of our profits are recurring. Okay. I think the market still want to see ongoing what I call performance on a free cash flow, which obviously has been a little bit losing through the separation and spin-offs and the restriction we had to do to rise size the company, which we are now. And our guidance on free cash flow now is at the midpoint two billion dollars. What you're going to see is the convergence of our non-GAP EPS to free cash flow. And that free cash flow is deploying in a balance way. Obviously, we are super committed to dividends, which today at the current stock price are represented almost at 4% yield, probably one of the highest in my mind in the tech sector. So we're going to continue to aggressively buy shares back obviously because the share price is depressed. But at the same time, we have to continue to invest in the business. Because ultimately, we've got to bring breakthrough innovation for our customers. But that investment in the business has a significant discipline around it, or return to invest the capital. And obviously, gear to higher margins and higher areas of growth, but all delivered through HP Green Lake, which drives that record and revenue. And obviously, over time, that will help our multiples as well. All right, we'll get some rest. I know it's been a long week for you. Antonio and Ari, he'll pack an enterprise CEO. Always good to get some time with you. I'll talk to you soon. Catch you on Twitter. Thank you, Brian.",https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XTJjX90THDQ,35,2022-10-21 16:24:42
3852," you Yeah. They're moving higher this morning after the tight reduction into the same, okay? Audio reopening. of AT&T are moving higher this morning after the telecom company reported third quarter earnings showing 708,000 post paid phone net ads and a 6% rise in mobility revenue year over year. AT&T CFO Pescao, Deroch joins us now discuss Pescao. Good to see you again. Three months ago we were here having a conversation at a time your stock was down double digits and you weren't worn on free cash flow. Now today the stock is up and there seems to be a different tone on this earnings release. Why is that the case? Look, first good morning Brian. Good morning everybody. You know, maybe let me just start. I think this journey dates back to a couple of years ago. What we've said is we we were going to invest to reaneritize growth in this business with a priority towards reaneritizing wireless and fiber growth. And for a long time we said that that investment initially would reduce earnings but over time would produce significant returns. And as late last year we said at the second half of this year earnings would start to see the benefits of all the work that's been done. So things are playing out exactly as we said. And look, overall I'd be remiss if I didn't thank my colleagues across the company for all their hard work and getting us to this point. In terms of what's different now I think last quarter there was a there was a bit of an overreaction by I think the marketplace and some of the media. In the end what we flagged and we tried to we tried to every quarter to be really transparent what we were seeing in the marketplace. What did we see? We saw that there was a normalization of collection patterns back to pre pandemic norms. That hasn't gotten any worse. It's pretty much the same. And you know in terms of overall delinquencies I've been saying this since the spring we are probably slightly worse than pre pandemic norms. But all of all really strong fundamentals. The thing to keep in mind is our business has a history of performing well even in challenging economic times. And we don't expect this time to be any different. You know that's an amazing acknowledgement here especially as we think about the fact that within the market consumers are paying more in some of their other necessities that they have to account for as well. And so when it comes down to their telecommunications service provider like an AT&T and the delinquencies that you are seeing where are you also seeing perhaps the either type of device that customers that are net ads may be opting in for is it on the higher tier is it on a mid tier and what type of service for those devices as well. Yeah and I would say it's a bit across the board. First and foremost consumers as a general matter more and more people are signing up to higher price plans because of the value that those plans provide in terms of additional bandwidth. But not everyone is taking the device promotions. In fact a meaningful portion of our subscriber additions in wireless come through our business relationships and that channel it has been and continues to be really efficient source of generating new subscribers and so we're benefiting from that and we're seeing just the consistency of our offer quarter after quarter resonating with customers and our sales team know how to execute it and all those.",https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XTJjX90THDQ,36,2022-10-21 16:29:02
3853," And we're seeing just the consistency of our offer quarter after quarter, resonating with customers. And our sales team know how to execute it. And all those things are contributing to continued improvement in subscribers, as well as higher R-POOs. You layer on top of that a better international, more international travel also contributing to higher roaming revenues. All those things are driving improvements in R-POO. And we've been doing a lot of work in our cost structure, and you're starting to see some of that benefit come through to the bottom line. So we feel really good about how we're performing. Pascal, it's Julie here. So obviously a lot of attention being paid to your networking investments as you pointed out. And there have been some reports that you are in discussions to spend a lot more on the network. There was a report recently that you're working with one of the big banks to increase your fiber optic cable investment, a $10 to $15 billion investment potentially. Is there anything you can tell us about that and what it would mean for your customers and for your network? As a matter of policy, we don't talk about rumors in the press, but let me tell you overall how we think about fiber. Fiber right now is the best technology, and as we look out the next decade or two, there is nothing under horizon that will match the effectiveness of fiber, especially in terms of the speed, the bandwidth, and importantly symmetrical speed. And we don't see anything changing that. We are the largest provider in the US. We know how to do it very well. We can do it more efficiently than others. And we are prioritizing investment fiber. If there are opportunities for us to accelerate that through different partnerships, well, of course we'll look at that. As John Stake said on the call this morning, his job is to make sure we are looking at all opportunities to potentially accelerate returns to our owners. Pascal, as pertains to your planning for 2023, two part question. One, are you planning for a recession? And the number two, are you planning for a pickup in promotions to consumers? Given the slowdown we might see. Here is what I would tell you. You will hear more about how we're thinking about 2023 when we report our fourth quarter earnings. Overall, what I did say on this morning's call is that, we understand, we're more than three quarters of the way through the year, and we understand what sort of macro-environment we're operating in now. And even considering all the challenges that we read about, we expect to grow earnings of free cash flow next year. What we'll do, but we want to make sure we wait till the fourth quarter and have the best possible information. And at that point, we will tell you how we are thinking about more precisely, how we expect the magnitude of earnings of free cash flow growth. Within that, though, and as you start to think about what a potential recession might look like, for the business, what does that real margin run rate actually sustain at over that period of time, given the delinquencies that you were talking about a moment ago? When you look back at history, even in downturns, the telecommunications sector tends to be more resilient than most. Clearly, we would be impacted like others, but not nearly to the same extent. And right now, when you look at the criticality of telecommunications, whether wireless or broadband connectivity, that's one of the last things the consumer will turn off, even in a challenging economic environment. With that said, look, they pay me to make sure that we have the opportunity in the event that we encounter difficult and operating environments to identify potential offsets and things we would look to or things like, do we moderate the pace of our investments then in capital, but all in all, the good news about where we are today is that we believe we can continue to invest meaningfully in our business, comfortably pay our dividend.",https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XTJjX90THDQ,37,2022-10-21 16:33:08
3854," Our today is that we believe we can continue to invest meaningfully in our business, comfortably pay our dividend and still continue to deliver over the next several years. But look, if they are really challenging economics environment that we're operating in, we will look for all the ways to offset that. They may not turn it off, but would they trade down in terms of the service that they are receiving from AT&T? And have you seen that show up in anywhere in the business? It hasn't shown up. In fact, more consumers are opting for the higher price plan. That's part of what's driving the growth in our article that we reported. All right, we'll leave it there. AT&T, CFO, Pascal DeRroge. Good to see you again. We'll talk to you soon. Good seeing you. Thank you, everyone. Bye. Hi, everyone. We're going to make a great start to the $2,030 Let's just bring in another guest into the hour here. We've got George, a Kennacore genuity, managing director. George, let's just build on those comments from Praz. What's your sense right now on why the stock is pulled back so significantly? Is this about the street just simply saying, we don't necessarily buy this story that demand's going to stay strong in Q4. Well, first thanks for having me. I can't remember and I've been looking at the stock for a long time. Elon Musk acknowledged that there was a demand issue, particularly in China. And if you guys remember several years ago and someone asked about demand, he called it a boring question, right? So this might be the first time we actually acknowledge a little bit of a of a down tick. But at the same time, he said the company would grow significantly in Q4 and we think they could do about 450,000 deliveries. And then they're going to sell as many cars as they can build for the foreseeable future, which is about 50% year of year growth as far as the I can see. And so what we did is, you know, we thought about how we can square that circle. And for us, it came up to a couple of things. First, the company has had backlog for a really long period of time and they're probably going to drain a little bit of that Q4. There are some fleet sales to companies like hurts that they could maybe sell in Q4 that help. And then when you look into 2023 specifically, the cyber truck comes online and that really helps, they start producing more in Austin, they have Tesla, send me sales and then beyond that, hopefully we're out of this.",https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XTJjX90THDQ,38,2022-10-21 16:37:42
3855," truck comes online and that really helps. They start producing more in Austin. They have Tesla semi sales and then beyond that, hopefully we're out of this economic bump that they were in currently and EVs, if you remember, are really, really, really small percentage of overall sales. And so that will start to help. So we think there's some, there's method to the madness and there's logic as to why he guided them to grow significantly this year and continue their growth into next year. But I completely agree and understand there's too many bread crumbs that indicate that there's been a slowdown in the man and even acknowledge it when the yesterday's fall. Hey, Georgia, pros again. So I just wanted to talk to you about a couple of things that I sort of struck me last time the call. You mentioned the cyber truck, how they're going in the tooling phase and put for potential sort of, I guess, production start in mid 2023. But also you mentioned the cheaper Tesla, the kind of entry-level car that would potentially be half the cost or something like that versus the mile three. What did you think about that? Because they actually kind of sort of confirm that this is actually in the works. Yeah, so on the cyber truck, it's one of the things that may give the company a lot of confidence in growth in 23 and beyond. Because look, I'm pretty confident that the company won't keep the pricing that had discussed last time when they first introduced it. But remember, they had millions according to the press, millions of orders for the cyber truck, starting in 2023. And so even if they had a lot of cancellations, that's a lot of demand. I personally would get one if my wife let me, but she told me she would be content driving it. So it's clearly an acquired taste and a lot of people really like it. On the Robotaxi platform, it's a really interesting question. So basically, you think about the company's ability to bring down the cost of production for a vehicle. They've done a really, really marvelous job with the Model 3 slash Model Y platform, which costs about somewhere in the mid $30,000 range to make. And when it comes to Robotaxi, that's another step down in production. Cost out branded. It won't be as a big of a vehicle. It'll be a lot of nuances to it. Probably won't have a steering wheel and some odd stuff like that that will enable autonomous driving. But it's another platform through which the company can reduce costs and help e.d.s proliferate the gold. George, in terms of potential for buybacks, it sort of felt like Elon Musk dangled that carrot for investors who have been a little jittery around the stock. He said $5 to $10 billion is certainly possible. These were his words for next year. I wonder what you make of that. How much of this is about trying to get those investors to stick it out, those who have been concerned about his distractions with Twitter? And is this really the best use of capital for a company? Should that be used towards more CapEx? Just to be blunt, we don't like it. You know, buybacks are things that companies like Newspaper Company do not Tesla that has significant opportunity in front of it. We think there's better use of capital to accelerate CapEx plans, to build cars, to build the robot army that Elon Musk wants to build. It's just, in our opinion, there are just better ways to accelerate their plans around having EVs proliferate the globe. And other opportunities, including battery factories and robots. So look, I'm sure that they've done a lot of math behind it. And they want to see the support to stock down here in the 200s. But we think ultimately long term the best way to support the stock is to grow for as long as you can. George, we didn't even get to ask you about the valuation. And Elon Musk calling for a valuation for a Tesla could equal Apple and Saudi Aramco combined. But that's for another conversation around a time here. George, you know, because Ken Accord, Genuity, Managing Director are thanks to you and our thanks to Yahoo Finance's Pros Supermanion.",https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XTJjX90THDQ,39,2022-10-21 16:41:53
3856, you you you you you you you you you,https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XTJjX90THDQ,40,2022-10-21 16:45:46
3857," And so that was a lot of the conversation this morning. Yeah, talk to me a bit more about that where you're seeing the pullback and volume and where are the biggest biggest headwinds for you right now. Yeah, it's mostly related to the consumer. So consumer oriented shipments on our railroad that tends to be domestic intermodal parcel. You know, a few things driven by the consumer. Those are those are looking like they're cooling off. The consumer has already been shifting from goods back to services, not all the way back. You recall there was a real fundamental shift towards goods during the pandemic. So it hasn't gone all the way back, but at the same time, it does appear that they're buying less and you can see that in international intermodal boxes hitting the west coast ports. And you can also see it in demand for truck and demand for domestic intermodal on our railroad. There are some markets though that where we're seeing strong demand and it's not going away. Things like coal, some of the other things like that. The amount of gas that we're looking at right now is like, we're looking at the spot, we're looking at the properties. We're looking at the amount of the robot utilities, grain, rock and then a handful of our industrial segments as well. But the total picture says we're going to grow year-over-year in the fourth quarter. It's just not going to be as much as we thought it would. Lans, last time we spoke, we were talking about the labor agreements ongoing. And I saw the number here in your quarter, $140 million Now, you know, I'm less comfortable than I was before the B&W E are maintenance of way employees failed ratification, but I'm not concerned. We've got six unions having ratified. We've got five in the ratification vote, and we've got more work to do now with the BMW EED. I think that vote failed to ratify for a very specific reason, the PEP, in addition to proposing wage levels, which are very attractive to our employees. They also said for about half, about 40% of that craft that does maintenance of way, we needed to adjust the travel that we would pay them to go from home to their away from home work location, and the per dime we'd pay while they were working away from home. That negotiation happened on property, and it just closed up on UP about a week ago, a couple of weeks ago. And that was at the very tail end of the ratification vote for that contract. So I think those were connected. We're back out now working with the BMW EED to try to figure out a temporary agreement that can be or a tentative agreement that can be taken back out for ratification. I anticipate we're going to be able to do that. We've got status quo in place there. Other than that, we need to get through the ratification on these other five unions, and get this baby closed out by the end of the year. And I think that's still the probable outcome. So end of the year, still the timeline that you're looking at, despite some of the snacks that you've hit. Yeah, I am. I guess the maintenance away employees could drag over into next year. I don't anticipate that. I think there's a path forward for us to get another tentative agreement, get it back out for vote. Lance, it's always great to have you on the show, Union Pacific CEO Lance Fritz. Appreciate your time today.",https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XTJjX90THDQ,41,2022-10-21 16:50:47
3858," you you you you talking it wage growth moving lower to help quell the inflation. On the inflation expectations objective, they've succeeded. If you look at one year, five year forwards, that's inflation a year from now and the subsequent five year period this comes out of the bond market. These are investors putting the money where their mouth is. It's very consistent with the Fed's target of two to two and a half percent on the consumer price index. And with regard to growth on jobs, same progress. If you go back say six months ago, average monthly job growth was about 500,000. Now it feels like it's about 300,000. Still a lot more work to be done here. We need to get down below 100K to get unemployment from stop to stop falling and start moving a little bit north and slowing the wage growth and quelling the inflation. So still more work to be done, but I think they've made progress. It's a pretty good progress since the beginning of the year. Will they need a recession to get things back to 2 percent? I don't think so. I mean, I don't say that with a lot of confidence. Recession risks obviously are very high and this is going to be very difficult. But my sense is that there is a path forward that will allow them to solve land in the economy. And I do think they've laid out a script for us. The federal funds rate target, which is three to three and a quarter percent. It's headed to more than half to four and three quarters by early next year. And I think that should be sufficient given the tightening and financial conditions that to kind of stock market the increase in the value of the dollar, the increase in mortgage rates, the tightening and bank underwriting standards, to slow the economy sufficiently to get inflation moving in the right direction. But it is a path, but it's a narrow path. And it is getting narrower as we get these inflation statistics that are definitely a disappointment. Mark, when do you expect us to start seeing in the data that CPI, that inflation has significantly cooled? Are we talking two months from now, four months from now? I guess what's your best prediction on that? Yeah, I think over the next six months, we should see inflation.",https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XTJjX90THDQ,42,2022-10-21 16:54:51
3859," CPI that inflation has significantly cooled. Are we talking two months from now, four months from now? I guess what's your best prediction on that? Yeah, I think over the next six months we should see inflation CPI inflation. Let's say rounding is 8% ish. I think by next spring we should be 4% ish and that assumes the main assumption there is that oil prices stay 90 95 bucks a barrel right now there are 85 bucks that would be consistent with you know $4 for a gallon of regular and let it if we if we can manage that if oil prices can stay roughly in that range then The arithmetic here is in our favor because of the this is all year over year and we saw some big increases in oil energy prices a year ago So that should bring in inflation to 8 to 4 The hard part is going to be though getting from 4 to 2 2 and a half That's going to be more difficult that goes to Rent growth and the cost of housing we're getting some better news there But that'll take a while in the most difficult part of this will be getting the job market to slow Get wage growth moderating because that's key to service price inflation And that's the last mile and that's going to take a while probably not until early 2024 and because of that do you think at some point the Fed calls it a win with inflation around 4% Yeah, so what I think they'll do is they'll follow the script they'll go to 4 and a half 4 and 3 quarters by By end of January that's the the meeting in early early next year They stop they take a look around they know that the impact of the rate hikes will filter through The financial system in economy with a long lag so they want to take a look around I want to make sure job growth is slowing as I anticipate that wage growth is rolling as I anticipate that inflation has moderated as I Just articulated and moving in the right direction And if if it is then that's the end of the story The 4.5% of underrated is the so-called terminal rate the highest rate in cycle and well keep it there Until for a while into 2024 until it's obvious that we're headed back to target or close to But that would be a scenario where we kind of sort of squeak our way through avoid a recession Although I don't want to sound too polyannish under any scenario Uh the next year 18 months are going to feel pretty uncomfortable. It's just a matter of how much discomfort we're going to feel Mark I guess when we're also trying to figure out whether or not the risk here that the Fed is going to overshoot I know you're saying that you expect them to pause But what do you think the risk is though that they front load too much if we get a more aggressive Rate hikes in the next two meetings before the end of the year? Are you concerned at all just about the spillover effect looking ahead to 2023? Well the risk here are two-sided They certainly could overshoot. You know, they may not pause as I anticipate early next year they keep on going Uh, and something breaks, you know in the financial system I you know The higher rates go the faster they go the longer they stay up Something in the financial system is not going to work as anticipated. We got a taste of that over in the UK a couple three weeks ago Oh when the British pension funds choked on the former prime minister's plan saw interest rates rise and it exposed some problems and their derivatives Product that they've been using to match their assets and liabilities. That's very esoteric But that's the kind of thing that you know will happen in a you know highly stressed environment with interest rates At high levels for an extended period But you know there is also the other risk that they Uh, misjudge they they should continue to tighten because inflation isn't moderating sufficiently They keep rates too low at 4.5% for too long the inflation gets entrenched and that's a stack flation scenario Which is pretty ugly particularly because we will ultimately experience recession But just later and it'll be more deep and severe. So the risks on either side that which you know Obviously makes it's you know really tricky going forward. Hopefully they can kind of calibrate things and get it roughly right But a lot of obviously a lot of risk around that mark that something many fear might break is the housing sector where we are seeing some fed success If you want to see it that way how much pain is it head in housing? How do you quantify it? Yeah, well housing's the most race-sensitive sector of the economy So it's not surprising. It's taking it on the chin. I mean this is this is by design the Federal Reserve is raising race to slow the Economies growth rate the job market to Quell inflation and so housing is going to suffer and it really is you know, it's taking it's getting nailed You know you saw today's existing home sales numbers that gives you",https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XTJjX90THDQ,43,2022-10-21 16:59:12
3860," and so housing is gonna suffer and it really is. You know, it's getting nailed. You saw today's existing home sales numbers that gives you a sense of the hit to the man. The net goes to high rates, 30 year fixed mortgage rates over 700%. You multiply that by the house prices and it's just unaffordable for most people, potential for some of buyers just can't afford that. And then people will own their home with a mortgage. They're kind of locked in because if they have to sell their home and get a new mortgage to buy another home at a much higher rate, that's just not gonna work economically. So it does mean that house prices are gonna come in. They have to come in. They are coming in pretty fast. I've been surprised at how fast they started to fall, particularly in places like California where we're already seeing kind of five, six, seven percent declines from the peak. So we should buckle in. This is gonna happen to me. I do expect even with no recession, we'll probably get a double digit kind of decline in house prices nationwide peak to trough. I am hopeful though that that's not the place anything where anything breaks because in the sense of what's going on in the system because the underlying quality of the mortgages, the underwriting, the bars has been excellent since the financial crisis. And of course, even with these house price declines, that's after a period of very strong house price growth. So all you're doing is retracing part of the increase that we've experienced since the pandemic hit. So I'm hopeful we will see some increase in mortgage defaults and foreclosure and distress sales, but I am hopeful that that's modest. And so that's not, I don't think that's the place where the system will break. Moody's chief economist, Mark Zandee, good to see you, sir. Thank you. In this episode of influencers, data scientist and Facebook whistleblower, Francis Hogan. I think unless Facebook changes a lot of people are going to die. And the reality is a lot of people do get wiped out by the stock slide. Facebook has a series of whistleblowers. Like, I am not the only whistleblower. There's like a new one every two weeks. And when Facebook misleads people about the value of the company, and when you lie about material issues, you are lying about the value of the company. Hello, everyone, and welcome to influencers I'm Andy Sherwer. And welcome to our guest, Francis Hogan, former product manager at Facebook, Metta, who recently blew the whistle about companies practices by leaking thousands of internal documents. Francis, great to see you. Thank you for inviting me. So first of all, why did you do it? And what is your life like now? I came forward because I saw that the information that Facebook was withholding from the public was critical to the public safety, that people needed to know in order to make responsible choices. And that Facebook was consistently resolving tradeoffs in a way that was in their own interests and not in the interests of public safety. They were putting profits over people. More so than say any other company, like an oil company or a retailer. I think an oil company is a great company to contrast Facebook with, which is oil companies are radically more transparent, because we can literally go and put sensors around an oil fill. You can measure the pollution. They satellites to see, are they capping the methane leaks? There are all these things where we can be accountable, or that company knows it is accountable in some way. Facebook knows that no matter what activists bring forward, they can just deny that it exists. And one of the things that happened over and over again after I came out was activists would reach out to me and say, I brought this up five years ago. I've been giving the evidence of human trafficking on the platform for years, and they always tell me, this is just anecdotal. It's not a real trend. It's not actually a big problem. But the documents show they knew it was a big problem. Was that was the difference because people have been complaining and pointing fingers to this company for a long time, but it's the actual physical proof of those documents, right? Exactly. That's what changed. We now have evidence that these things that have been raised for years, like people who have been laying the groundwork, activists have been doing tons of work, and now we have the proof.",https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XTJjX90THDQ,44,2022-10-21 17:03:31
3861," Okay, that's right. Exactly. That's what changed. We now have evidence that these things that have been raised for years, like people have been laying the groundwork activists have been doing tons of work. And now we have the proof that Facebook knew and didn't resolve these problems. And what about this point of your life and how that's changed? I was in Portugal at the Web Summit. There were thousands of people who are hanging on your every word. I have to say like so my life in general has not changed that much. So one of the few blessings of COVID is like we didn't go out and socialize a lot before. And after I came out we didn't go on socialize again. Like I have I have I have silly acts so we most of our meals at home. And so the day-to-day life is not really changed. But things like Web Summit, I really don't like being the center of attention. Like it gives me a huge amount of anxiety. And I remember going in Web Summit and thinking to myself, I am so grateful that I am not someone who like gets buzzed off of being the center of attention. Because I could totally imagine that experience being addictive. And instead it was just terrifying. Because like there are like 12,000 people there. It's a lot of people. What about Washington DC, Francis? This is a big question. And you've got both sides of the aisle that are concerned about big tech and Facebook in particular. And yet they disagree about what the problem is, never mind what the solution is. One of the things I've been trying to do is kind of shift the conversation. Because Facebook knows that as long as we think the argument is about censorship, you know, is it too much censorship? Is it not enough censorship? As long as we focus on that as the conflict we will never resolve it. But what Facebook knows is that there's lots of solutions that don't involve content. Right? They involve the dynamics of the algorithm. They involve product choices. Like should you have a multi-picker that lets you spam out to 10 groups at the same time, the same piece of content. Facebook knows they have all these solutions that aren't about content. And as long as we're arguing about censorship, we're not going to hold them accountable on these other things. And so the main thing that I think there's a point of common ground is, you know, people on the left on the right believe that people have the right to make informed choices. Right? That you only really can consent or like voluntarily choose to do something if you have enough information to make that choice. And so I've been pushing for what I call like nutrition labels. So like, you know, the government doesn't tell us what to put in our mouths. But it does say, hey, if you claim this is in your food and used to be in your food. And you need to listen to much trans fats in it. And if you'll notice, the government never banned trans fats. But as soon as it couldn't consumers had that information, it disappeared from all of our products. We don't have a nutritional label for TikTok. We don't have a nutritional label for Facebook. But the public has a right to have real data, not Facebook or artistic data, but like real data on how these platforms work so they can make choices. We're calling it Facebook, but the companies renamed itself meta. So should we be calling it meta or Facebook Francis? I am trying to train myself to say meta because I know a big part about why they made this shift is they want to run away from the conflict. And the reality is that people are dying. Children are dying, right? They're going to be women walking around this country of brittle bones in 60 years because Facebook made choices to not stop its algorithms from driving women towards the inter-executive content. Right? This is a crisis and Facebook thinks they can change its name and just focus on video games and that it will all go away. And so I that's one of my goals in 2022. It's to be able to say meta and Facebook in the same sentence because we can't let them run away from the damage that they're doing. How would you say that in the same sense? Like you could say meta's Facebook or I could say meta Facebook, but we need to make sure that you know one of the reasons they did it was they know their employees feel ashamed to admit they work at Facebook and now they can say they work at meta. I have a backpack from when I worked there and in tech, tech companies love giving you swag. You know a t-shirt this is Google, a backpack that says snapchat. My Facebook backpack had the Facebook logo on the inside. I never received a single shirt hoodie whatever a Facebook that said Facebook. You mean they were concerned even at that point.",https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XTJjX90THDQ,45,2022-10-21 17:07:52
3862," Inside. I never received a single shirt hoodie, whatever, a Facebook that said Facebook. You mean they were concerned even at that point about their branding and the backlash that it might produce if you were wearing a public? Yeah, exactly. And I think that's a giant red flag. Like, part of my mission and what motivates me every day is I know that people are suffering inside the company. Right? Like, not being willing to admit reality and the present is really hard. That cognitive dissonance is really hard. And I know that Mark Zuckerberg is suffering and that like every time you go in a restaurant and having people give you dirty looks, it has to be hard. And so we need to hold the company accountable and help it grow towards long-term success because the current impasse in hurts everyone. So what about Mark Zuckerberg, Francis? Is he a bad guy? Does he have evil intentions? How would you characterize him? So I never, in willing to call Mark, evil, it's funny. When I appeared in front of the UK parliament, there was a member of parliament that was very insistent. They're like, but is this evil? Is this evil? And I think it's really important to remember that Facebook is full of very well-intentioned people. And I think it is a problem about incentives. And some of those incentives, you know, Facebook has a fiduciary duty to act in the interests of shareholders. And I think it's a lot harder to prove long-term harms and short-term harms. And so Facebook has been stuck in the cycle where when they are faced with these conflicts where it's like, you know, you have to be 0.1% less profitable, where you have 10% less misinformation. Because there is no mandated transparency, it's very hard to make the business case that you don't choose that 0.1% of profit. So mandated transparency gives another center of mass that gives space for people inside the company to do the right quo. you you you you",https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XTJjX90THDQ,46,2022-10-21 17:12:01
3863," you You How close were you to Mark Zuckerberg? Did you have any direct contact with them? As they like to say, I was a low-level employee that I never sat in a seat meeting. I'm a data scientist. I worked on civic misinformation and later counter-espionage. You don't become an algorithmic expert if you like being the center of attention. It's an invisible thing behind the scenes. But the reality is, in Facebook's own documents, I saw the magnitude of the problem. And just surveying, operationally and organizationally, how Facebook worked. I have an MBA from Harvard. There's a lot of things where in Silicon Valley, we undervalue the role of leadership. And we undervalue the role of organizational health. And I think I had an opportunity to assess, like, what was the feasibility of change in a way that was different than a lot of people because I had had that opportunity for that education. And I don't think there's a path to change inside of Facebook without the help of the public. You wouldn't necessarily need to have access to those people to understand that there were problems there. In fact, my experience there is when you get close to that, there's an echo channel there. Oh, yeah. So I want to ask, I've spent a bunch of time in Menlo Park, obviously, not as much as you have on the campus. What was it like? Oh, the Facebook campus is so fascinating to me as an architectural object. So mostly, I'm unaware, but Facebook has the largest open floor plan office in the world. It is a quarter of a mile long. It's 5,000 people. It is such an amazing, you know, medieval societies built cathedrals because they were societies that were oriented around God. Right, like you have these gothic arches that lead your eye upwards like to the heavens, right? Facebook's campus is a physical manifestation of their obsession with flatness. Like the idea that we are all on the same level that, you know, their leadership style is we have metrics. And people can do whatever they want to move those metrics, like we embrace the freedom of individual employees. But when you don't acknowledge that power differentials exist, you actually reinforce those powered dynamics. And I think there are things around, you know, a situation where flatness is obsessed over means there's actually not a lot of space for single leaders to come forward to say there is a problem. Or we need to make a short term sacrifice for a long term gain. I think it was Orwell who said everyone's equal except some are more equal than others. And then that's not even acknowledged. Yeah. That's a fascinating, fascinating point. I want to ask you about this question about whether Facebook... Actually, can I give you a little bit more of a little bit of this one? Sure, please. To give you a sense of how absurd this space is. So Facebook is obsessed with 15 and 30 minute meetings. So like they're very efficient. They're obsessed with the word crisp, like are your documents crisp? Is your explanation crisp? The space is so large that I would regularly walk 15 minutes, 10, 15 minutes to go to a 30 minute meeting. And so even that level of absurdity that is more important for the building to be flat than to be functional for us to go to our meetings. It just kind of shows you the blindness of that religion. And you've worked at other big tech companies. You've mentioned Google, for instance.",https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XTJjX90THDQ,47,2022-10-21 17:16:28
3864," or meetings. That it just kind of shows you the blindness of that religion. And you've worked at other big tech companies. You've mentioned Google, for instance. How is Facebook different from these other companies? And is it better or worse? Yeah. So I feel like there was more of an acknowledgement of users as equal stakeholders at other companies I worked at. So like Google, I don't know if people are aware of this. But Google is able to support thousands of languages, partially because they built tools that allowed individual communities to move Google into their language. But they said linguistic diversity matters at that level. And even back in the mid-2000s, I worked on internationalization on Google Books. And there was a real authentic commitment to how do we get into the most languages and adequately support them. Imagine if Facebook took the same attitude on safety. Right? If they came in and said, do we live in a linguistic diverse world? Let's make sure all of the dialects in Ethiopia are covered. There's 100 million people in Ethiopia. They're having a civil war right now that is being amplified by Facebook. They have 100 dialects, six major language families. Imagine if Facebook instead of being so closed. So Facebook has full control of their platform. The only one that you can see inside is full closed. Imagine if they said, we're going to take a page from the Google Playbook. And I, and make tools that allow Ethiopians to actually make all the safety systems working all their languages. They'd be a very different world. And so there's little details like that where I think there's an opportunity to open up Facebook and say, you are the internet in most countries. 80 or 90% of the content in most languages in the world is on Facebook. Imagine if they came and said, we actually acknowledge that power that we have. And we invite you to collaborate with us. We'd have a very different conversation right now. Do you think this company meta Facebook is in decline? I mean, part of the reason why the stock went down is because they had a decline in DEA use. First time. They've never had one. So what does that tell you about the future of this company? Yeah. So I've said repeatedly, I view the work that I'm doing as in the best interests of Facebook. Like, it might not feel that way today. But Facebook needs help to make long-term successful choices instead of optimizing so hard on the short term. And like having an environment where people like being on the platform, where they feel safe, where they feel like they're getting high quality information, that is a path to long-term success. Until Facebook takes responsibility and is just honest with people until they change their relationship with the public, I think they're going to keep seeing users live. Have you been in contact or have top executives at Facebook been in contact with you or have any executives been in contact with you? A director level, but not above that. There's a lot of really good people inside of Facebook. And one of the things that I hope comes out of the work I'm doing is that they have more space to be able to act. The company has already said that they are going to invest some more money. I don't think it's enough. Did you know that they're doing $75 billion of buybacks? Is that crazy? Crazy. And when they say they're going to invest $5 billion in safety in the next year, it's like, yeah, but you little on fire $75 billion. I mean, could you have done $10 billion in safety? But my actions do open up space inside the company for those good people to be able to make progress. And so that's always my hope. And what about the future of the internet? Francis, big question. I love that question. It looks right now. For instance, simplistically, the United States, China, Europe. Is that going to be the future going forward that there are at least three sort of geographies and distinct internet increasingly? So I think you're totally right that Europe is taking a different regulatory perspective. But in terms of networks, I believe if you look at it, I don't think Europe and the United States are going to isolate. So when you say China, China does have a closed internet. And the thing that I'm scared about is Russia.",https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XTJjX90THDQ,48,2022-10-21 17:20:51
3865," I don't think Europe and the United States are going to isolate. So when you say China, China does have a closed internet. And the thing that I'm scared about is Russia and China have made indications that they may kind of merge their closed internet. Like they're talking about building their own closed financial system. They're talking about having their own closed internet. And I think once you start separating the internet and separating the financial systems, that's where things start to get dangerous. Because once you begin operating so independently, then you have opportunities for conflict. I think there's some really interesting conversations happening right now around the role of decentralization. So you might have heard of DeFi. You might have heard of Web3 or like crypto-based networks. And those are going to open some really interesting conversations. Because this is software that doesn't run in the United States or run in Europe or run in Africa. It runs everywhere simultaneously. It's applications. Then instead of running in a data center, they're all running in little kind of pockets everywhere on these decentralized networks. And so I think there's going to be unquestionably sometime in the next five years, probably, a social network where no one is responsible for it. Is that good or bad? It's a really interesting conversation, depends how it's designed. There's ways of designing these networks where you do safety not based on content, but you do it based on the dynamics of the network. And if they make those kinds of decisions, whether or like, oh, interesting, we're going to cut reshare chains at two. So that means allisrate something. Bob reshairs it. Carol reshairs it. And lands and dance moves. Imagine if Dan had a copy and paste that content in order to share it. So he had to hit a button. He has to copy and paste it. That change has the same impact as the whole third party fact checking program today.",https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XTJjX90THDQ,49,2022-10-21 17:25:26
3866, you you so it sounds sort of like a social network kind of based on blockchain in a way it could be yeah I think there's going to be a one at some point I mean I know you're a big if correct me if I'm wrong crypto fan or I do believe in in the power of crypto right right yeah talk about I mean I don't want to go way down that rabbit hole we don't have too much time but tell us why you're a collaborative crypto and so I'm a big proponent of I'm not I always try not to give investment advice because people do ask this question I do think there are interesting opportunities though around you know we're getting new models of how to run finance systems like the defy networks you know the rules are transparent we all see exactly how they operate and I think they're interesting conversations are on governance that a lot of these crypto projects are experimenting with new ways of doing corporate governance right in terms of who gets to influence what decisions and how and as someone who really values organizational design and organizational health I'm intrigued to see where they go but beyond that I don't think I have an effects for teased to envision the future I want to ask you about your background you said you went to Harvard I knew you went to all and undergraduate grew up in Iowa City is there anything about your background upbringing you think that informed you in terms of decisions you made so I'm extremely grateful so I attended the Franklin W. Olin College of Engineering it's in the Western suburbs in Massachusetts near Wellesley and it's a very small college you know it's 75 students a year but they believe that in order to be an impactful engineer and a responsible engineer you have to have more context and so all in intentionally incorporates more humanities into their curriculum than most engineering programs and they also incorporate design and entrepreneurship and it's based on the idea that engineers that can go found successful companies are ones both understand that dynamics of entrepreneurship but they also understand people because really good leaders are people who understand what drives human beings and so I think the fact that I had the opportunity to go to Olin gave me more context I think the fact that I did high school debate and I coached high school debate you know like I've I've had to sit there and and you know wrestle with 14 year olds on like how should society be structured so like think of think of your 14 year old being like that's not fair and imagine having to teach them how to unpack that and be like how do I have a conversation about why is it not fair tell me more I think those things made me care more about democracy and like what is the role of a technology just in a democracy and so I don't know I think all those things influence me and final question Francis what's next for you and what do you see as your legacy if it's not too really asked that I love five months into my whistle blow so I what's your legacy so I'm my big focus in 2022 is around helping to plant a decentralized youth led movement around social media a decentralized I'm sorry a decentralized youth led movement around transparency and accountability for technology and so we have started college tour the spring and the goals are on giving tools to young people,https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XTJjX90THDQ,50,2022-10-21 17:29:23
3867," transparency and accountability for technology. And so we started a college tour this spring, and the goals are on giving tools to young people, like basically education on saying like, here are levers that we believe exists to either put pressure on Facebook, or ways that you can build networks of resiliency. Because young people are dying, right? And until we can get Facebook to do the responsible thing, young people can make a difference by caring for each other. And so that's my big focus that I'm working right now. And that is going to live under a nonprofit that we're in the process of founding. And the nonprofit is going to have two main focuses initially. One is plant that movement, which will eventually get spun off. And the second is something called open source integrity. So open source integrity is the idea that we the public need tools, assets, that allow us to hold Facebook accountable. So that means our own data, right? Our own ways of analyzing these things, simulated social networks. Because right now you can't get a master's degree in these safety systems, right? And we as a civilization need 10,000 more of these people minted every year. And so I want to figure out the tooling where we can have that feature. Francis Hagen, thank you so much for your time. Thank you so much for inviting me. This is great. You've been watching the influencers. I'm Andy Surwer. We'll see you next time. Welcome back to Yowl Finance. I'm Brian Saazi here with Brad Smith, Julie Heimann as the day off. Markets are tiptoeing into the weekend as traders gear up for a big wave of earnings next week. Right now you're seeing all three major indices. I would say maybe a little bit more than tiptoeing. We're seeing the Dow up almost 335 points. Here's what else we're watching at this moment. No recession. American Express shares are under. We're under a little pressure after the company. It didn't raise its full year earnings guidance range. The stock is still under pressure. CEO Steven Squarry tells me concerns of a recession are overblown and dialing up in earnings. Be Verizon shares are in focus after the company. Be it on earnings, the posted week, subscriber gains, Brad Chaat, Verizon, CEO Hans Vesberg who noted that there are points of a couple points of weakness in that earnings report. More on that one on the Yowl Finance homepage right now. And it's time to travel. Spotlight the theme park sector following much better than expected earnings from airlines. Brad, over to you. All right, let's kick things off with a check of the major averages here. 32 minutes into trading on this Friday. And the Dow Jones industrial average right now. You're seeing that hold on to some slight gains right now. It's up by about 1.1%. All right, so a little bit more than slight gains here on the day. The NASDAQ composite as I bring this into an intraday view just to give us a better perspective of what's taking place. Look at that sharp move higher that we've seen within the first.",https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XTJjX90THDQ,51,2022-10-21 17:33:57
3868," like gains here on the day, the Nasdaq composite, as I bring this into an intra-day view just to give us a better perspective of what's taking place. Look at that sharp move higher that we've seen within the first 30 minutes of trade. We're up by about half a percent right now. As clearly investors, some of the sentiment right now is saying, hey, you know what, hold my beer. We could rally into this Friday, and that's what we're seeing right now is a little bit of an early session rally. The S&P 500, you're seeing that up by about 1% here. And so you take a look at the broader week that we've been watching as well. This could potentially add on to some of the net gains that we had seen, even with the declines earlier in the day, we were still up on the week by about 2% as of right now with this move. We're up by about 3%, 3.3% on the S&P 500. Also, I want to take a look at some of the trending stocks on the Yahoo Finance homepage as well here. And yeah, it's none other than snapped. The brand of Ghost Face Chilla. Yeah, it's chilling on the day to the tune of about 30% of Chillin Lower in a bad way here. So we're continuing to watch that as well as Twitter. You're also seeing shares of Pinterest move in concert lower by about 6.3%. So for more on this move that we've been tracking with Snap as I put that back in focus on the day, down 30%. We've got Jeffrey's Senior Research Analyst, Brent Thill. Brent, just take us into your reaction after you saw the numbers cross from Snap and what the executives had to say on the call last night. Yeah, good morning. The quarter itself was OK. It was the guy. And they have obviously been experiencing decelerating growth just over a year ago. They said they could grow indefinitely for 50% and then the growth rate came into the 30s, into the teens, into the single digits. And they exited at high single digit growth and then said the quarter was growing at 9%. And then said the quarter would end flat because advertisers would fall off a cliff in the back half of the quarter. So I think it's more about the guide and more about the lack of visibility. There's clearly been a lot of departures there, senior leaders and sales have left to go to Netflix. You have a concern around advertisers moving to where the wallets are, meaning the younger audience and Snap don't have the dollars. The parents have the dollars. The older generation has the dollars. So you're seeing advertisers shift up from the lower end to the higher end, which makes sense. So we're still going to be influenced to buy household goods and items for to run our life. But that's not where we make the decisions on Snap, right? We may make a decision on Snap to buy the new Hawaiian shirt or buy concert ticket, but we're not going to be influenced to go. Again, make some of the bigger ticket purchases. So dollars for advertisers are shifting to Google, to Amazon, to prove and spend where the wallets are. And that's where the advertisers are at. We also have a competitive issue with TikTok, which is anyone that's fired up TikTok and spend five minutes with it, spends a half hour with it. It engages you. It brings you in. So advertisers naturally in the more experimental and younger audience are shifting away from Snap over to the TikTok platform. So there's a handful of forces. Change is in the team. Change is in advertisers. I think overall, the bigger picture, too, is the macro, which is we have a macro picture that's dimming. We are going into a recession in 23 per hour economists. This will start later than most economists have believed our team internally continues to believe that we are going to go into it more of a tailspin in next year that this takes time to come out into the economy. So if you think about that, if we do go into that tailspin, we advertisers naturally, the first thing they're going to say is we're not spending. Advertising can be tuned up and tuned down in a nanosecond. We described as the stereo knob in your car or at home. You can go up and down really quick. You can't do that in software. You can't do that in semis. You can't do that in other areas of technology. So right now, I think investors are just like, I don't want to be in advertising if we're going into a pro long in from 0.80% to 0. volunteerization. worse for working for our journey.",https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XTJjX90THDQ,52,2022-10-21 17:38:22
3869," for you can't do that in semis, you can't do that in other areas of technology. So right now, I think investors are just like, I don't want to be in advertising if we're going into a prolonged downturn. I will be back to advertising names when we go back in the upturn. And there's, you know, safer names outside of tech. And that's what we continue to hear from our clients. It's just our clients want to be outside of technology. Right now, they want to be in energy. If you look at the the XLE, you know, up over 50% year to date, right? So the popular trade beginning of the year was short technology belong the XLE. And, you know, we've got the XLE up again today and up 54% year to date. So I don't think that the tone of technology overall and advertising and many of the other tech names that we cover is going to shift until we get into 2023 and we get a lot of these companies to really reset the numbers. So I expect a tougher, a tougher earnings season for the rest of tech. Brent, does the snap have to cut its expenses even further? Yes. I mean, they do. I mean, they just restructured the company. They obviously are in the process of still reducing the workforce by 20%. They may have to go deeper. And again, I think the thing we don't know is how long is this, this economic, you know, pullback going to last. It could last all next year. Again, our Jeffery's own economists have said this really starts later in the year versus early because it takes time for all these changes that the Fed is putting into place is going to be a way that comes in slowly. It doesn't come crashing in on you. And so the scary part of what's happening is we don't know exactly that this can be prolonged. A lot of companies are saying, oh, we're not seeing it. Some companies are saying we're seeing it. I think everyone's going to see it. And I think this is going to be, again, the concern, which is, you know, this could, this could get a lot darker than we all think. And that is a potential. Now, I would highlight that, look, if Elon Musk thinks that Twitter's worth $44 billion and Snap now has a, you know, roughly $12 billion market cap, you start to ask yourself, he's trying to build the X app, which is all these things you can do. Snap has a closer version of an X app than anyone. It has the map. It has the information page. It has a messaging service. It has ARVR. It has a gaming interface. I mean, there's, there's, there's many elements that investors have come back to me and said, well, Bren, if you want to create an X app, which is all these things that Twitter isn't today and fire 75% of the workforce, doesn't snap have all the, the foundational makings of what an X app would look like. And I'm like, yeah, absolutely. So at some point, you kind of go, look, we understand they've had execution issues. Again, the visibility on the advertising industry, that's across the board. I mean, it's not like meta and Google and Amazon's ad business or accelerating. They're all decelerating, right? So they're all facing the same headwinds now. Obviously, Snap's had stronger headwinds. But at some point, you go back to everyone is so negative that ultimately, if you have a long-term horizon and you sit and look at this and you believe, you know, these are typically some of the best opportunities for tech investors over a three-year period, not the next three months. So depending on your duration, I think there's some credible opportunities that are being born in this downturn that clearly, you know, we're going to have some hazy, overcast, foggy skies in the short term. But you're getting some interesting opportunities if you are a longer-term investor. Do you think there's some consolidation to be expected given the valuations right now? 100%. M&A is going to get a massively spike. M&A, there is no IPO window right now. So we have given birth to a lot of great technology companies. Many of these subsectors are overcrowded. You've already seen that.",https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XTJjX90THDQ,53,2022-10-21 17:42:31
3870," Many of these sub-sectors are overcrowded. You've already seen that your to date, Tomo Verado, who's one of the best software investors in the planet, has spent over $20 billion acquiring multiple companies outside in the security and technology landscape. So if you look out even outside of social media, you've seen incredible consolidation. You've seen strategic deals like Adobe buying Figma for $20 billion. No one thought any company in the beginning of a recession would pay 50 times revenue, 5.0, and not 5.50. So we are going to see an incredible amount of strategic M&A, an incredible amount of private equity, let M&A. You're already seeing it. You're seeing the number of skyrocket, you're to date. You're seeing some of the best technology investors for the long haul. Like Tomo Verado, we'll say, this is go time for software consolidation. There's no question. And this is what we need to restore the health, because we're in that cycle of we expanded dramatically. We had so many IPOs. We've had no IPOs in tech this year. And so if you think about what's happening, you're going to go back to that natural consolidation phase of M&A. And we firmly believe we're seeing the signals already. We're seeing the best investors in the space talk about it. We're seeing the strategic step up and make acquisitions. You saw Adobe, you saw Microsoft in Activision. You've seen Salesforce go a little quiet. They have to go quiet in the short term, into it that did MailChimp for 12 billion. You've seen an incredible amount. And so I think ultimately these valuations are going to get cheaper. This is when you want to be acquiring if you're a strategic hero private equity. Great perspective, as always. Jeffrey, senior research analyst Brent, they'll have a great weekend. We'll talk to you soon. You do. Thanks. All right, before we head to break, let's take a look at some upbeat comments. On Uber and Lyft out of Deutsche Bank, before each company reports earnings, analyst Benjamin Black says, ride share demand backdrop for both Uber and Lyft remain strong, explains Black. Our data comports with recent Uber management commentary suggesting that ride share demand is beginning to follow typical seasonality. Therefore, we think the downside risk to ride share gross bookings for both companies is limited. Before we go to break, though, I will add this. Let's do a quick check of the markets here. You're seeing the stocks really come out of the gate. Strengthened, relative to the opening bell. And Brad, you flag this, and it seems to be moving off of this. The latest Nick Timmeros market moving, Wall Street Journal story. Really, I think for the first time, signaling that the Fed pivot or that time, or that point where the Fed pulls back a little bit on raising rates by 75 basis points, that might come in early 2023, perhaps quicker than some of the market expected. Yeah, within this reporting, a quote from Fed Governor Christopher Waller. From a speech earlier this month, however, that, of course, Fed whisperer that Nick Timmeros has become, that quote saying, we will have a very thoughtful discussion about the pace of tightening at our next meeting here. And that is really leaning further to some of this signaling, even in addendum to the Fed speak that we've gotten, the signaling now that there may be some type of pivot in the markets, certainly latching onto that here. Even that polar story can't turn around snap. We'll leave it there. I'll talk to you later.",https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XTJjX90THDQ,54,2022-10-21 17:47:03
3871," Merit The Walmart agreed to pay $215 million to the state of Florida over claims that its pharmacies helped fuel the opioid epidemic in that state. The retailer also agreed to give out $672,000 treatment kits to Florida first responders. According to Moody's, Florida has now secured $3.2 billion to help fight the opioid crisis. In a new report by Doach Bank, says Doach Bank is laying off dozens of employees, including some out of the UK, that's according to voters. No concrete number was given, but a person close to the matter says most of the cuts are in origination and advisory segments of its investment banking unit. This says a pullback in financing deals prompted lenders to cut back on costs. And Pfizer says it's hiking its US COVID vaccine price to over $100 per dose. Doach's could be costing between $110 to $130 per dose before insurance. Now this will take place after the US government's current purchase program expires. Right now the government pays around $30 per dose. And Adidas is cutting its full year guidance following weaker demand in Western markets and its exits from Russia. The company cut currency, neutral revenue expectations and lowered its expected operating margin to 4%. Adidas also blamed slowdowns in China and inventory buildups for the cuts. Despite the sour outlook, Adidas did see sales grow. 11% in Q3. Sawas? All right, from record home prices to record mortgage rates, 2022 has been a wild ride for the now ice cold housing market. But could this pain be good for prospective home buyers down the road? Y'all find it's a commoners for Newman is here with more so Rick, I should be cheering these declines because maybe at some point I'll be able to buy home. Maybe a year from now or something like that, but it's getting ugly in the housing market and it's probably going to get uglier. So we just saw the eighth consecutive month of declining existing home sales. That's the worst stretch since 2007 and what was happening in 2007. That was when the housing bubble was exploding. We got the home builders index this week. That has been going down. That's now at the lowest level since the bottom of the COVID downturn. And if you don't count that, it's the lowest level since 2012 again close to the bottom of the housing bust back then. So we have a long way to go to get through housing. Everybody has kind of seen this coming. I mean, this has almost everything to do with rising interest rates and mortgage rates now up around 7%. But we haven't seen prices really fall over yet. They've just started to turn and they will come down for sure. But we're at the beginning of a major correction and we probably have months to go. Rick, I like Sausie. Also just want to know when it's possible to buy a house. I guess further out down the line, what kind of changes are we really expecting for the consumer environment to look like, especially given the fact that if you have an absence of those buyers because of rates in the near term that sellers as well are going to be impacted as well and they're going to be less listings of existing homes. Yeah, this impacts everything on both the buyer and the seller side and the builders.",https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XTJjX90THDQ,55,2022-10-21 17:51:21
3872," Sellers as well are going to be impacted as well and they're going to be less listings of existing homes. Yeah, this impacts everything on both the buyer and the seller side and the builder side I should add. So we're so builders are reluctant to build. We're seeing that decline. There's a long standing problem for builders getting permits. And you're right. There's this lock-in effect. So if you happen to be a homeowner and I'm lucky enough to be one, I'm older than you guys, of course. Then you probably locked in a mortgage rate of around 3% and you're looking at this market and saying yourself, I'm not going to sell. I'm going to go out of my way to stay where I am and keep that keep that where it is. So as with many other things we talk about on our area every day, we need to get to the other side of the feds tightening cycle. I think we need to see when that the fed is finally feels like it's it's gone far enough. And then we can get through through this difficult period. And you know, at some point it's reasonable to think interest rates are going to come back down again. It might take a recession to do that. I mean, I've seen some economists saying, yeah, we think the fed will basically finish up by late this year or early next year. And then it could be cutting rates again if we actually get into a recession in 2023. So, you know, things do change in the housing market, but these are long shifts. This is not like stocks. These are long shifts. We're talking six, nine, 12 months to get to the other side of this. Congrats here at Home Ownership, Rick Newman. Always good to see you. We'll talk to you soon. Hi guys. It has been a year to forget and tech as you can see by the unfolding nest. It's snap. We'll dive more into the space with Alphabet Board Member and former Goldman Sachs top executive Marty Schveznext. The tech sector is firmly in the red and fraught regulation issues layoffs and hiring freezes as inflation and market uncertainty take their toll on the sector. Here to make sense of the tech landscape and the surrounding global economic picture is six street partners vice chairman Marty Chavez. Marty, good to see you again. Look, we've been talking all morning long about this sell off in social media stocks. Of course, snap top of mind there. Help the average investor understand what is happening and when am I at end? Well, I found it helpful as an investor and just around peace of mind to keep my eyes on the long term trends. There's a lot going on. I don't think I can add to it. There's certainly a lot of macroeconomic issues.",https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XTJjX90THDQ,56,2022-10-21 17:55:45
3873," as an investor and just for my own peace of mind to keep my eyes on the long-term trends. And there's a lot going on. I don't think I can add to it. There's certainly a lot of macroeconomic news. And there's the announcement that we all read yesterday. I would just say this is the nature of tech. It is risky. It is growth. It is volatile. It has been on a very long trend. And it was easy and fun to get used to that trend. Who knows where that's going to go in the future. But if you step way back and just look at the long-term trend, I think there's very few predictions that I will make with absolute rock solid confidence. And one of them is that there's going to be more software in the future than there is in the present. And so long-term, it's the same. And there's a lot of ups and downs on the way. That prediction tracks Marty. I appreciate that here this morning. You also have a unique position of sitting on the board at alphabet as well. With that in mind, I just wonder what is the next transformative technology that's really going to be the changing factor for consumers as well for some of the companies that we cover on a daily basis. So one thing that you get to say if you've been at the same thing for a long time is you live long enough to get to be considered a pioneer. And so a long time ago, I was working on AI in medicine. This is back in the late 80s and the early 90s. The compute power was just way too low. And I remember back then there were people working on neural networks. And we used to think, okay, that doesn't seem like that's ever going to work. Well, that has worked unbelievably well. So I, many other people were just dead wrong about neural networks. And what we are able to do, we've all seen with neural networks is amazing. We are just at the very, very beginning of an incredibly exciting upsling. And what we're going to be able to do with AI across the board, whether it's drug discovery, climate change, or at the beginning of actually being able to do amazing, really miraculous things with AI. So that's the future. But right now, you're also kind of looking at this environment where even as we were looking at snaps, earnings, and really reading through where they're impacted as a result of operating system privacy changes that many social media companies have been hit by because of the changes that Apple had put forward. There is another OS that's out there. In fact, there are a few other ones. And one of the other major competing ones is the Android OS. Why is it that there has been more of an impact to the social media companies derivative of privacy changes from the Apple operating system than from any privacy changes because there's also a privacy push within the Android OS as well? Well, I think all companies need to step back and the regulators doing this as well. And look at what privacy means, how to define it, and what we actually want, and to get ready for it. And there's just a whole range of outcomes. This is a huge global social, political decision that we all have to make. And there's so many moving cards. I'd love to predict it, but I would just say to all companies, you have to ready yourself for a large number of different regulatory outcomes. Really, the question is, we know what is possible with AI. What will what does society want us to do with it? And that is a very big decision that's happening right now. There's no one route. It depends on operating systems. It depends on policies. It depends on choices that consumers and companies make. And nobody knows what's going to happen. So you just have to be ready for a variety of outcomes. Already, when the market gets a sense, the Fed is done raising rates for this cycle. What will that mean for the M&A market? Well, so I have somewhat infamous for not making timing predictions. And I think I don't make them because I'm terrible at them. And also causality is hard like knowing this happens. And that's going to happen next and predicting the timing of it. Who knows? Right there. There is M&A happening. There are in every economy, including the one that we currently have, there are difficult spots and there are bright spots. Again, back to AI, if you're looking at financing and in acquisitions and combinations.",https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XTJjX90THDQ,57,2022-10-21 17:59:53
3874," currently have their difficult spots and their bright spots. Again, back to AI, if you're looking at financing and in acquisitions and combinations of all kinds, in that area of AI, that is booming, just like probably better than ever. And so there are bright spot screenshots even now in certain sectors and AI is certainly one of them. Marty, we only got about 30 seconds left, but I'd love to know, especially as so many companies are making changes when it comes to diversity, equity and inclusion, whether that be at the entry level, mid management, all the way up to the board. What is the step that a company can take right now in order to ensure that even in the midst of macroeconomic uncertainty, that they are retaining those values? Well, so the companies have the right values in that in general. I'm not going to make a blanket statement, but really it comes down to what are you actually doing day to day in your recruitment and you're filling the pipeline in understanding connected to managing your people. And so companies are doing a much better job at the entry level, though it's still hard, in reflecting the demographics of the cities and environments where they operate. Really, the hard part is as people become more senior in their careers. How do we continue to make them want to be here as opposed to some other place and how we actively manage their careers to mentorship and sponsorship? Those are the things that all companies need to be doing in a disciplined process-oriented way every day through every market cycle. Sixth Street's partner and vice chairman, thanks so much for joining us. Marty Shavez, appreciate the time this morning. Pleasure, do well. Thanks. You guys coming up, we're going to share the full interview with Verizon Wireless CEO, Hans Vestberg on the other side of this short break-in on the back of his company's company's $1,000,000. Verizon closing the books on its third quarter. It reported results before the bell and its stock currently moving lower by about 5.6% as investors mold the report and weigh the impact of inflation on the wireless providers consumer business. I spoke to Verizon CEO, Hans Vestberg, earlier about the quarter. Take a listen.

3875," I spoke to Verizon CEO Hans Vesper earlier about the quarter. Take a listen. I think we came out from the second quarter. We had some softness in our consumer business, especially on the wireless. We took a lot of actions in the second quarter, especially around new plants, new products, but we also did some price adjustments. Coming into the third quarter and now reporting that, we can see some of that is really getting good effect. We're growing 10% or wireless revenue or EBITA grew 3%, almost 3%, 12.2 billion dollars. Definitely the progress we put in place was actually working, but it's a lot more to do. We're a large company and we need to continue the hard work we're doing right now to continue to do the great cash generation we're doing. That was the highlight of the quarter. We saw also the prepaid market. We acquired a track fund last year, which added a really good asset when it comes to being in the value segment. We had a new product in there, a new product called Total Wireless, but Verizon. We also added home broadband to the prepaid market. Overall, our broadband had a really good quarter. 377,000 new broadband customers in the quarter across business and consumer. That fixed wireless access business we're doing is really working. A lot of things was working for us. We still are working on the consumer segment to be even stronger. We're going to take more actions. It's a very agile market when it comes to consumer segment at the moment. I want to talk a little bit more about that consumer segment as well, Hans. From your perspective, when you think about what you said at the end of the second quarter, mid-summer, second half challenges, you were looking out into the future and saying that second half challenges, you see them as short-term. Is that still the case? Or do you believe that there's some facets of the softness in the consumer, especially as they're paying more for necessities right now, and the macroeconomic climate that you believe might protrude into 2023 or even beyond? It's a little bit mixed feelings, actually. We have the highest quality customer base and the largest consumer base in the country. We see really good payment from our customers, consumers, where we are actually better than pre-COVID. So we don't see anything there. We actually see the roaming when people are traveling abroad. That movements are equally big or higher than pre-COVID. So a lot of things are moving as normal and are store traffic between Q2 to Q3. That increased with double digits. So people are actually doing movement. Then of course, we all read what's happening in the macroeconomy with higher inflation and the interest rate is coming up. So it's a little bit mixed, but clearly we are in the fundamental product. Everybody needs mobility. Everybody needs to be connected. That's so important for us and even more important these days. So clearly, there are mixed feelings. We think we have a great product, we have a great network, and we are spanning all the consumer segments. And then not forget our business side. That has a really good quarter with both growth. There are almost 6% in a wireless business in the business group. But not only that. I did 200,000 new, almost 200,000 new net-dads, full net-dads in the business segment. So it's a little bit mixed when you read in the market and what we're seeing in our customer base. Certainly. I want to talk a little bit more about those network investments in a moment. But before that, we know that you're one of the largest partners with Apple in terms of the iPhone, the latest edition of this consumer device and the smartphone that comes out year after year. And within that, there's even been some of the reports around where the demand might be pulling back. Are you seeing that show up in your business at all right now? Now, when we come to the iPhone 14 launch, we have seen very normal volumes. But moreover, we actually made an exclusive deal with Apple, which we have done over a long time. We're Apple 1 for our unlimited. It's a new offering where you have all the Apple services, Apple Plus, the gaming, etc. In one package together with our unlimited. Very good for us to get the with Apple. So now we're very normal. There's a little bit of mix, of course, which type of products our customers are taking. But in general, very normal levels of a launch of an iPhone. It's...",https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XTJjX90THDQ,59,2022-10-21 18:08:35
3876," Very normal. There is a little bit of mix of course which type of products our customers are taking but in general very normal Levels over over lunch of an iPhone if you were coming back to the the network infrastructure investments that you're making as well If we were to see any kind of recessionary concerns Really permeate over into the next year What would that mean in terms of the moderation of the level of network investments that you might be making and and perhaps on the other and where your full steam ahead? I think that the last six seven years we have at the plan exactly how we're going to invest in the network This is our peak year. We're going to do some somewhere between around 22 billion in Capex that's our guidance And that's one portion is our business as usual and then the other is that the new spectrum we bought last year Is actually coming to execution right now and we're doing that as fast as we can and next year that will will come down So but we have invested in fiber. We are investing in the CBAN the spectrum we bought We're going to pass 200 million pop in the first quarter on our CBAN and the important with the CBAN That's a five-despictrum that we're using we see good growth on that so where we launch a market with the CBAN We see mobility Business growing we see fixed-wise access growing and for the viewers Important we we bought that spectrum but we get it all the time as the satellite companies are releasing it and the last piece of that spectrum We will get at the end of 2023, but basically it's nationwide 160 megahertz which is a lot of spectrum and we're only deploying a piece is over right now But by year and 2023 will have also we have a clear process of how we implement and execute in our in our network And that's on number one capital priority as well. So we will do what is needed for a network We're already have the best network and it's just getting better So just lastly while we have you here I got a hustle to my finish here But I'm taking a look at the stock price investors clearly reaction to this morning's earnings report and perhaps they may be paying Attention to some of the churn in end users or subscribers But they also may be paying close attention to the margins as related to some of the cap ex that's going to be Set forth and continues to be earmarked to the tune of 2020 22 billion dollars that you just mentioned When do you believe either some of the churn will start to alleviate and then on the other side when you can start to Adequately wind down perhaps some of the spending so that the margins aren't as compressed So when it comes to our shurn in the in the third quarter that was expected We took a deliberate decision in a second quarter to do price adjustment in certain consumer segments And we knew that we would have a shurn bubble so so that that was sort of an expected and very deliberate decision We took and it was important for us to also do that because our industry has not done price adjustments on wireless ever So this was the time to do it we did it for certain segments So that will ease over over time So I think that's a very important message and when it comes to the the the cap ex we have a clear plan We will come back of course with exact guidance for 23 but we're very clear plan how we are on the peak level of spending right now and then it will come down as we are Spending as fast as we can and deploying the C band Spectrum that we bought a year ago All right, the Supreme Court has rejected a request made to block the Biden administration's program for student debt relief As has a district court yellow finances legal correspondent Lexus Keenan has the latest Lexus Hi, Brian. Yes, so two courts yesterday rejecting The request for emergency relief that would cancel the Implementation of Biden's student loan forgiveness plan now one was the supreme court Request showed up there from a group of Wisconsin taxpayers Associate Justice Amy Coney Barrett she denied that request not even taking up the matter on the merits at all The other one came from a district court in Missouri The Missouri case was brought by six Republican led states They argued that Biden you served Congress's authority to spend the taxpayers money They also said that the relief plan jeopardizes the state's tax revenues particularly Revenue from the state run loan servicers that a lot of different states have across the country the Wisconsin case for its Taxpayers it was brought by Brown County taxpayers Near Green Bay, Wisconsin.

3877," Alright, our line earnings coming in hot, the theme park space may be worth another little bit of fine investors more on this straight ahead. Theme parks have had a rocky year as they look to bounce back from the lows of COVID-19 and our next guest says estimate need to come down to a better reflect the challenges ahead. City Research Director James Hartman joins us now James good to see you again right in the middle of a fright fest for six flags and it's been a very frightful year for that company they have really been struggling how do you think this quarter shaped up? Yeah I mean and you're right it has been a tough year for these guys they had a new strategy where they're essentially aiming to have fewer customers right but the strategy that we know that's not a good strategy here we don't want to let you in but take less business we're okay with that. That's right is that we'll we dove the Jeremy Wires strategy. You were more more profits better service that may have made more sense come into this year it's been I think it's been a tough sell as some of these macro pressures have mounted and so to answer your question I do think it's a tough third it was a tough third quarter for these guys I think estimates probably are too high I think attendance if anything it was pretty pretty bad in the second quarter anything there's a good chance that I got worse here in 3Q James for the lay person following this six-flets story and the CEO made some just bizarre comments on that last earnings call but push out its side what is wrong with six flags is it the the stands where they get the food are the rides not cool enough is it a combination of all that or is it just too expensive to go to these parks? Yeah I think it's a it's a combination of all of those things relative to other theme parks six flags has historically not been able to get the pricing that that those others have in that they would hope to particularly since they cater to you know some of the the biggest cities in the US with some of the best disposable income it tends to be a lot more teenager oriented as opposed to family oriented and I think that plays a role in terms of the pricing that they're able to get you know there's an argument to be made that they haven't invested enough in their parks over the years and that has also led to this sort of lower quality experience at least that being the perception and so",https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XTJjX90THDQ,61,2022-10-21 18:19:31
3878," over the years and that has also led to this sort of lower quality experience, at least that being the perception. And so I think that's all what predated this new concept that they ultimately had. They didn't put it this way, but that they fired their customers in a lot of ways. And you got to be real careful with that, suffice it to say. That's bad news for the Dippin' Dot Barometer, James. When we think about some of the other major theme parks that are out there, I mean, what is going to be vastly different between this year and next year? This was supposed to be that travel-demand boom year, that revenge-experience-show-economy year. If not this year, then what does that shape up for next year for the theme parks? Yeah, it's such a great point. I mean, we were believers that there was this pent-up demand as we exited the pandemic for exactly these types of experiences. Unfortunately, there isn't a whole lot of daylight between the post-pandemic phase or story and the pre-recession or recession story. And I think that's those two things ultimately pointed up against each other here in the summer of 22. I've got numbers lower for next year. We have seen pretty consistently over the course of the summer slowing demand trends for the theme parks. Now, the good news is I do think that these companies, these businesses tend to hold in better than some of the other discretionary names that I follow. And so they're going to feel it. I think attendance is likely to be down. Sales are likely to be down. But they generally hold in pretty well. And the reason for that is they tend to be trained down beneficiaries. As opposed, once travel turns over, if in fact it does, these tend to be cheaper alternatives than going to Orlando or Mexico or Europe. James, what you often see in a lot of these theme park parking lots is when a bigos family take these when a bigos and they go to the theme parks. Now, that is the stock you cover. This company just reported earnings. Take us through their inventory situation. Are they able to get the semiconductors and the supplies they need to get these trucks or these mobile homes out of the showrooms and into the front porches or the dryways of customers? Yeah, I mean, so that was the narrative for so much of 2021 in the early part of 2022. But they get the supply out there because there was very much to believe that true demand was better than these reported retail numbers. IE, if you had more product, you could sell more product. I think that narrative has changed over the past three months and, and oh, by the way, I don't think it's just for RVs. I think the ability to stock showroom floors has improved dramatically. And if you want to get one of these, you can get one of these right now. I think that the, it's a double head sword now, though. The concern is that these manufacturers will pump up the channel too much with some of these inventories. And that would ultimately turn make a bad situation worse as we think about a potential recession. And again, it's not just RVs. I think this whole debate as to are we are aren't we heading towards a recession? In what I cover, right, big ticket discretionary. In a lot of ways, it feels like we're there or, or vastly quickly approaching that place. It does seem like over the past few months, supply has improved, but the demand has not. All right. Well, for those of us brining myself included who are priced out of the housing market, the RVs are looking to be good. I'm Neil Baby. Yeah. City Research Director James Hardman, thanks for taking the time here today. Have a great weekend. Thanks, guys. Guys, coming up, we're going to do a roundup of the top things that we've heard this week from some key business leaders, from everything from our all market summit to kick off the week through to, yeah, today's conversations with some big CEOs as well. It's next. All right, bro.",https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XTJjX90THDQ,62,2022-10-21 18:23:59
3879," 🎵 to Yahoo Finance, everyone. It was an energizer-bundet type of week here for us here on the morning show as we spoke with a numerous amount of executives, including CEOs from Bank of America. We had Proctor and Gamble, Target, or Tarje, and Hilton all seeming to be optimistic surrounding recession chances, and the current state of the consumer. Here's what they had to say. They have pushed that projection for recession out a little bit into 23, but their core belief it's a mild recession. So purely from a consumer demand and willingness to spend the standpoint, we wouldn't predict a recession. The hope is, it allows the Fed, at some point, over the next six or 12 months, to sort of stabilize, having done their job with inflation more in control, and allow the economy to get its footing again and start a process of re-acceleration. They continue to say they want to celebrate the holidays, and we know they're out on the streets of New York, they're in restaurants, they're in our stores. So right now, we're seeing a stable environment. So there was a ton to really be extrapolated from those conversations, whether it was during our all market summit to kick off the week, or even later on as we move through early season, but particularly one of the threads was where the Fed policy is going to continue to actually impact the consumer in this near term, and what that actually does for the economy to change the demand profile or the demand cycle that we find ourselves in as relates to these companies' financial performance. Yeah, we talked about it earlier, Brad. I think we got a taste to that in that really major profit warming for a whirlpool. Again, those are big ticket purchases that you put on credit cards, heard it from Gen. Rack, earlier in the week, but what is interesting, I'll just call up Target as well, Brian Cornell, Chairman and CEO, telling us he's a stable business, but how stable is it next year? Let's say there's a Target store next to Snap headquarters or where Snap employees work. They just missed their quarter because of pressure on online spending because the economy is slowing down. That person now lost their job. Are they still spending at the same rate after this holiday season at Target that they were this year unclear, which speaks to the bigger thing. This is a very challenging earning season. It is really hard to truly understand what is going on inside corporate America. It's a hard earning season, but at the same time for us and the conversations, I mean, the questions that we're asking are definitely trying to just get a different sense of where there actually is some of that vulnerability, how they're managing through that, and then on the other side of that, what kind of company is emerging on the other side of that economic downturn or macroeconomic challenge that continues to be cited here? More big convos to come next week. Well, that is it for myself and Brad. Coming up, the Kiko Fujita will speak with two analysts who got the state of the semi-conduct.",https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XTJjX90THDQ,63,2022-10-21 18:28:29
3880," or economic challenge that continues to be cited here. More big convos to come next week. Well, that is it for myself and Brad. Coming up, the Kiko Fujita will speak with two analysts about the state of the semiconductor sector. You won't want to miss it. Have a great weekend. Thanks for your time. Welcome to Yahoo Finance Live. And happy Friday to all of you. It's 11 am here in New York City. I'm a Kiko Fujita. Here's what I'm watching at this hour. Snap, crackle, flop. Shares of the social media company plummet. As declining ad revenue and widening losses way on investors, we're going to discuss the numbers and implications for wider tech. Musk under scrutiny. The Biden administration reportedly considers national security reviews for the Tesla CEO as questions swirl around foreign investors involved with the Twitter buyout. And chip disruption. New US tech controls threatened to shake up the global semiconductor industry. As companies scrambled to be in compliance, we've got a paddle standing by for you to discuss the implications. First though, let's check in on the market action. We are 90 minutes into the trading day, of course. Trying to round out the week here on a positive note. We've got the Dow up 151 points. The S&P 500 up 9. The Nasdaq the only one in the red. The yield on the 10 year treasury note, one to really note today climbing to a level we have not seen in 14 years. We also saw a big jump in the 30 year yield. But we've seen a bit of a pull back off the highs in part because of some of the comments that we have gotten from Fed officials. There's that Wall Street Journal report that came out that pointed to potential concerns within our among Fed officials about over tightening and how aggressively they're moving. And that could be partly what we're doing.",https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XTJjX90THDQ,64,2022-10-21 18:32:45
3881," That came out that pointed to potential concerns within our MungFed officials about over tightening and how aggressively they're moving. And that could be probably what we're seeing the levels right now but the 10-year yield still at 4.24%. Moving on to our top story of the hour. It is all about snap and take a look at where shares are trading right now down more than 30% following its mis-on-revenue estimates for the third quarter. The social media company citing continued deceleration of revenue growth as a result of ongoing challenges that include platform policy changes, macroeconomic headwinds, and increased competition. Joining us now for a snapshot of the path ahead for staff. We've got Jason Halstein, up in Heimer Managing Director and Head of Internet Research. Jason, you know, this certainly was not a great quarter but this is a steep fall for this company. Shares are down more than 30%. How much of this do you think is overdone? Look, I think the challenges and investors are kind of asking themselves, do they want to support this company longer term? I think one of the questions we get from investors is, you know, will they ever put ads in messaging? I think it's pretty well known. We all know we use all of us use messaging products, right? And we generally don't see ads in messaging products. And so, and a lot of this company's use case is at the messaging tool, right? When they do then try to take that activity and get you to spend time using spotlight and using discover, but they're also seeing a ton of competition there from TikTok and others. And so, when you couple together, the 5% decline in US time spent with kind of revenue that was below expectations, and kind of monthly trend that investors are having a really hard time to salary, you know, I think you're having investors trying to decide, do they want to underwrite the stock longer, the company longer term? Jason, there are two key issues that have really persisted from quarter to quarter this year. One is, of course, the slowdown that we've seen in ad spending to the point you just made. Also, the other one is about this company being able to navigate these changes that have taken part as a result of the privacy guardrails that are now in place through Apple's iOS. I mean, these are not new problems that came up during this quarter. And I wonder if you think we've taken away anything more based on that earnings call yesterday about how much worse things are about to get particularly for Snap? Yeah, we think kind of the Apple privacy is a good excuse but not the main reason. That really only affects, for the most part, app downloads or advertisers trying to drop downloads. The bulk of Snapchats advertising is brand advertising. And that's what's been bouncing around kind of month among in kind of an unpredictable way. And they're telling you that they expect their brand advertising to slow as they move through the quarter, right? And so that is the issue. And then they're also telling you that effectively competition is still a threat to time spent. And so this quarter, you saw impressions slowed. Not a ton, they were up 8% item of ads sold versus 9% less quarter. But then price spread was down 3% versus up 4% in the second quarter. And they're kind of telling you that they think those metrics will slow, right? It's basically flat revenue growth in the back half. And it's not the fourth quarter. And it's not all currency. currency was about two points of headwind. So there's definitely, I'd say more companies specific factors. And obviously we'll know more next week when Alphabet and Meta report, but we don't expect kind of as bad of an outlook from Meta because they will be comparing against what was a challenging period last year. Well, and let's pick up on that point because when you look at the other social media stocks, they are falling today in tandem with Snap, not to the levels that we're seeing in terms of declines in the Snap Stock. But Alphabet, you mentioned Meta, Pinterest, another one that's been coming down as well. We've learned in the last quarter that this isn't Snap isn't always a bell weather, partly because these other names are a little more diversified. I mean, what's your expectation when you look at some of these names on the screen? Who's best position?",https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XTJjX90THDQ,65,2022-10-21 18:36:49
3882," This isn't snap isn't always a bell weather partly because these other names are a little more diversified I mean what's your expectation when you look at some of these names on the screen? Who's best position to write out the macro headwinds? Yeah, I mean to your point, you know, we do think that the whole sector is getting penalized Obviously not not as bad as a snap is but kind of down, you know four or five six percent depending on the company We actually do like meta the past right now for playing digital advertising within large cap in front of the quarter Mostly because they already took their loans a year ago, right? So they were the most impacted by Apple's privacy changes They called out at 10 percentage point kind of impact to them They also benefited the most during the pandemic from the poll forward in e-commerce Spending any commerce advertising and that has unwound as we As the economy is reopened you look at the monthly data on retail sales e-commerce isn't growing any faster than overall retail sales So that's kind of telling you that they're still kind of like a hangover there And so we think as that starts to obey and you've easier calms We think the setup is is pretty good for meta and then the last thing is we are waiting for Apple to kind of update It's called SCAD network 4.0. It's the next Technology tool to improve Tracking of ads and and performance data and we think meta is the best position company to take advantage of that for their advertiser So we are optimistic on meta in front of the quarter Okay, well we're watching for those numbers when they come out next week Jason health scene up and Hymer managing director and head of internet Research appreciate the time Thank you Well, let's not turn to the broader markets. We've got fed officials now moving forward Towards another rate hike of point 75 percentage points at the November meeting We've got Yahoo Finance as Jared liqueur is always on top of this and yield certainly been the focus of the week But yet again today we're talking about a level we haven't seen in 14 years Yes, and let's go to the Wi-Fi interactive. I'm plotting the US dollar index We're gonna circle around to currencies in a second because what we're talking about in terms of bonds very closely link with Currencies and there are spillover effects into equities everything is linked here So here's a US dollar index appreciated 17% versus this basket of currencies Mainly weighted towards a euro, but very illustrative of what's been going on here Here's a 10-year Tino yield it looks very similar to that US dollar chart In fact, they're very correlated hitting 4.22 percent now it has backed off a little bit higher number than that But as you said at Keiko most of these bond yields we have not seen since 2007 through 2011 I can put you I can show the five year That's down nine basis points a 30 year that is up base eight basis points So we have a lot that's happening with the yield curve right now and essentially it has been flattening And let me just point you I'm gonna put up the US dollar one more time here And I have some comments from Norte that I want to go over because we are caught in an effects Loop here and this has to do with respect This has to do with the Bank of Japan now Norte is taking a look at this countries They're saying do not have an endless amount of US dollars at disposal to sell meaning that effects intervention will fail when the US dollar Coffers run dry this is from the perspective of these central bankers over in Japan They have amassed a war chest of US dollars. They also hold 1.2 trillion dollars in US treasuries very important here So Norte going on to say more over effects intervention involves selling US treasuries That's to get US dollars which adds upward pressure on US rates That's because rates are inverse to bond prices stick with me one more second here This leads to a stronger US dollar and isolation this affects Intervention intervention US US dollar doom loop doom loop illustrated here I'll show you the picture in a second could lead to dollar overshooting especially when central banks are Enforcing the loop so here we go weaker yen sales of US treasuries higher US dollar rates weaker yen and the cycle Continues and that's what we've been seeing here And this the spillover effects as I mentioned with respect to equities These leveraging actions right here. We're not going to see a bit on equities until all of this is done and the central bankers Have been very flat-footed about the response so far. Yeah the BOJ in even tougher position given the data We got today right eight year high inflation not at the level that we're seeing in the US But still they've got a very dovish policy in place. They've got the yen continuing to weaken against the job",https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XTJjX90THDQ,66,2022-10-21 18:41:06
3883," should give them the data we got today, right? Eight-year high inflation, not at the level that we're seeing in the US, but still, they've got a very dovish policy in place. They've got the Yen continuing to weaken against the dollar and then now that they're looking at it. We didn't get to it, but the Yen very volatile today, maybe an intervention that we don't know about going on right now. Okay, something to watch. Thanks so much for that, Jared. Well, at the time now for our trending ticker and we're seeing weaker than expected subscriber numbers, weighing on shares of Verizon. That stock is down more than 6%. And hitting a 52 week low today, the largest wireless carrier added just 8,000 monthly subscribers in the most recent quarter as competitors offered aggressive promotions to take away market share. That prompted Verizon to offer its own discounts and introduce low-cost mobile phone service and internet plans. There's what CEO Hans Besberg had to say on customer churn this morning. We took a deliberate decision in a second quarter to do price adjustment in certain consumer segments. And we knew that we would have a show on Bob Bell. So that was sort of an expected and very deliberate decision we took. And it was important for us to also do that because our industry has not done price adjustments on wireless ever. So this was the time to do it. We did it for certain segments. So that will ease over over time. So I think that's a very important message. broadband proved to be a bright spot for the quarter for Verizon. The company added another 343,000 wireless home internet customers in the quarter. Well, coming up, the result season stealing the headlines this week, but investors keeping a very close watch on the bond market as a 10-year treasury yield hits levels we haven't seen in 14 years. We're going to talk to market strategy on the other side. If you're interested in software and technology.

3884," It's not quite finished raising its target rate as inflation remains stubbornly high. Meanwhile, a fresh report in the Wall Street Journal this morning suggests some fed officials are signaling unease with big rate rises. So is this the first sign of the long-awaited pivot? Joining us to discuss is Emily Roland, co-chief investments for just a John Hancock investment management. Emily, I'd be curious to get your thoughts on this report that came out from the journal today about the debate that's happening. Whether you, in fact, think that the data that we have gotten, the latest data points to the need for at least a pause in the hikes. Yeah, the volatility in the rate market today has been nothing short of astonishing. We woke up to this continued backup and interest rates that has been playing out over the last few days. And then this journal article comes out suggesting that potentially the Fed is going to be leaning towards 50 basis points in December, instead of 75, at least discussing that at the November Fed meeting here. So, you know, we think that it's right to consider a pause. And you even heard, Lail Brainerd earlier about a week ago talking about the fact that, you know, maybe we are a pause is potentially warranted here as some of the monetary policy decisions start to really work their way into the economy. And it's important to recognize that Fed policy works the long and variable lag. The Fed just started tightening in March of this year and they've implemented the most aggressive amount of tightening that we've seen in the generation in a really, really short amount of time. We want to watch to see how that actually filters into the economy before the Fed just continues down this path of aggressive tightening. How much of that have we actually seen filter through the economy based on what you've seen? Well, we look at the leading economic indicators and we just saw another negative readings. We've had three negative readings in a row here for the leading indicators. And that's the just that we are in a significantly decelerating economic growth climate. The challenge is that the Fed uses by nature of their mandates lagging economic data. So they're looking at the fact that the unemployment rate is at 3.5 percent near a 50 percent lower low, they're looking at CPI data, which just continues to be. And they're big component of that, of course, is the housing market shelter, which tends to be a very sticky component of inflation. It takes time to show up in the data. And the Fed is marching down this path of dampening inflation, really at any cost, but that's the key question at what cost. And they're looking like they're going to keep going until something breaks. I mean, the other big challenge, of course, comes down to messaging. And that's been a bit tricky when you think about how things played out over the summer. You know, now we know that the Fed officials didn't feel like the markets were simply getting the message. We got that very strong message at Jackson Hole. Since then, it's sort of been we're going to continue to hike rates until inflation comes down. How do you think they told the line here? If in fact there is some kind of pause to at least message to the markets, this doesn't mean a pivot. This is just a slowdown. It's such a great question because the messaging and the forward guidance is so critical. And one of the things we learned from this journal article this morning was that the Fed wants to be careful in avoiding a big upside move in markets based on this perceived Fed pivot. So I think if they do decide to go with 50 in December, it's going to be well telegraphed whether it's through the Wall Street Journal or some other mechanism, because you know, we saw that incredible rallying soft to play it out from mid-June to mid-August for your point there. And it was based on this false hope that the Fed was going to reverse course in quick fashion. And clearly that's not the case. And they've made it quite clear that they're going to keep the gloves off in the fight against inflation until the fight is done. Bottom line, Emily, as we look ahead to the next few months, and what does that mean from an investment standpoint? Is this change at all in terms of your thesis on where things are headed? Or, you know, is this also a time to maybe pause and wait to see where the economic debt all leads? Yeah, I mean, investors are feeling really steestic right now. Is this volatility picked up and we're suggesting...",https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XTJjX90THDQ,68,2022-10-21 18:49:45
3885," to see where the economic debt elites. Yeah, I mean, investors are feeling really specific right now is this volatility picked up and we're suggesting to them that they should focus on the horizon, which to us really means looking at the income on high quality bonds as something that's pretty competitive versus the other alternatives out there. You know, we used to talk about China. There's no alternative for so low. There was no other alternative, but to buy stocks and we would argue today that there is no alternative to bond. Yes, price pressures are there, but the fact that you can get five six percent income on high quality bonds right now, we think it's awfully competitive. You know, you look at the dividend yield on the S&T 500, which is less than 2%. So we want to move up the capital structure. We want to get paid income as we wait out this more and we want to get paid. So I'm going to take aways there. Emily Roland, Co-Chief Investment Stragist, John Hancock Investment Management. Good to talk to you today. Okay. There's even more trouble for Elon Musk ahead. The US government reportedly considering whether it should review Musk's newfound empire. That includes his ongoing deal for social media site Twitter and SpaceX's satellite network. Let's bring in Yahoo Finance, Alexis Keenan, who's tracking this. Alexis, let's start with what's happening with Twitter because this is an interesting one given that the concern is really about who's part of this investment group for Twitter that there are foreign players in here that could potentially signal a conflict. Right. So what Bloomberg is reporting is that US officials in the Abadan administration are concerned about the Twitter deal to the extent that the Saudi Arabian prince Al-Wali Ben-Talal, as well as Binance, which has a Chinese founder and has backing from Cuttersauver and Wealth Fund. So that's where they're saying that according to sources, there are maybe some concerns. Now, they also go on to say that it's not really clear which agency would originate this kind of inquiry. But one of the usual suspects is CIFIAS. That's the committee on foreign investment in the United States. That committee in 2018 was given a lot of expanded authority to conduct these types of threat assessments over possible security concerns that arise from foreign investment in US companies. And they even got expanded authority to look at those multinational deals that result in less than foreign control, which was the former case for the agency, especially they got some authority to look at investments that involve companies that are engaged in technology and personal data. Of course, the Twitter deal would qualify, I would think, perhaps under that standard. Now, the idea that the security review of a security review at all based on national concern, national security concerns, it's been raised previously with respect to Tesla, with respect to SpaceX's Starlink satellite network. But it's the first time we're hearing about it raised with respect to the Twitter deal. That's certainly sparking a lot of questions about whether the government could end up derailing this deal. And certainly part of that contract for the merger between the two companies does require that it surpass any regulatory and government review. So that's getting a lot of talk here. Elon Musk already tweeting that in response to this Bloomberg piece saying commenting on a Twitter post that said it would be hilarious if the government ended being the one to derail this tie up between Twitter and Musk's companies that he's formed in order to effectuate this merger. Really quickly, Alexis, you know, any of us who have followed these syphias reviews in the past know that this is never a quick turnaround. And we are talking months and months and months of review. If in fact that's triggered, what does that mean for the deal? Well, Akiko, syphias can take a look at transactions that are already happened. So they can go back and try to get some agreements from companies that have already done the deal. So it doesn't necessarily stop the deal from going forward. But the government could also intervene and say we would let us get out of the contract.",https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XTJjX90THDQ,69,2022-10-21 18:54:06
3886," agreements from companies that have already done the deal. So it doesn't necessarily stop the deal from going forward, but the government could also intervene and say we would like to have some things ironed out before it does commence. So we'll certainly be watching the deadline that the court has put on the deal, which is October 28th next Friday, one week from today. But look, yes, it could go on for a very long time, these types of inquiries, but it doesn't mean that it just stops the deal and it's tracks. Okay, thanks getting a little more complicated there. Alexis Keenan, thanks so much for that. Well, coming up, upscale electricity. If you like trucks and want something like a Hummer, then not exactly a Hummerable GMC might have the thing for you. Yahoo! Finances, pros, supermanians, going to have a story for us on the other side. The competition in the EV space is revving up. General Motors unveiled its latest electric truck yesterday, the 2024 GMC Sierra EV. It's now taking reservations for the $107,000 fully loaded version called the Sierra EV Denali Edition. Thankfully, we've got pros, supermanians, to break down all the details for us. That is a hefty price tag, but it's not the only truck on the market. That's an EV. How does it compare? Well, you know, it's, it's twin is basically this Silverado, the Chevy Silverado, which I find to have a design that's more adventure, lifestyle truck. Whereas if you look at the the new Sierra EV over here, it's more traditional truck like, looks like a work truck. I think it might appeal to a broader set of people. Power wise, it actually has more power than the top one, Silverado has around 750 horsepower, 400 miles of range in that top trim. So that's pretty competitive, but you did mention that price, $107,000, that top tier, it's very pricey, very high and very premium, I would say.",https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XTJjX90THDQ,70,2022-10-21 18:58:45
3887," of range in that top trim. So that's pretty competitive. But you did mention that price $107,000 for that top tier. It's very pricey, very high and very premium, I would say. But I did get a chance to speak to the chief engineer, Nicole Kratz, about lower trim levels that are actually going to compete against the Ford Lightning Pro. Here's what you'd say. $50,000 model for the Sierra EV is an elevation. It's an elevation trim, so it's not a work truck in the standpoint of a $50,000 model. Welcome to Yahoo Finance Live on this Friday afternoon. I'm Sean Smith alongside Dave Briggs. Let's get you up to speed on the market action as we get ready to close out. What has been a rather volatile week here for the market? But looking at today's gains, you can see the Dow up 600 and 36 point to the amp. The S&P up just around 2% the Nasak also pushing higher up just around 1.8% some comments from a San Francisco Fed president, Mary Daley, taking as a bit dovish here for the market. She didn't say that she would like the Fed to be able to quote step down on the pace of rate hikes going forward. That was enough to boost stocks here in afternoon trading. You can see the Nasak up just around 1.8% for the S&P over the past five days. You're looking at a gain of just over 4% with the S&P on track for its best week that we've seen since June. Take a look at the Russell 2000, the small cap index also pushing to the upside for the week up just over 3%. Let's take a look at what's going on in the bond market. You're looking at the 10 year yield putting back just a bit off around two basis points to 421, the 30 year here. It's just a bit higher up just around 8 basis points. When you take a look at some of the sector action that we're seeing. Let's first take a look at it on an intraday basis. So we're looking at materials, energy, financials, leading the way all 11 of the S&P sectors moving to the upside on the 5-day basis. So so far this week, energy by far the winner up just around 8% technology, not too far behind. You're looking at healthcare bringing up the rear up just around 1.8%. So really broad based gains today and buying that we saw not only today, but really what we've seen over the last five trading days. Maybe a misinterpretation of Mary Daly's comment. I think it was. I think they're searching for anything. I look we've had brutal Fridays quite frankly. We're going to turn it around. We'll take this one. Thank you Sean. Alright, let's get you up to speed now on the snap crash. The social media stock plummeting 30% following.",https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XTJjX90THDQ,71,2022-10-21 19:02:55
3888," Brutal Fridays, quite frankly. We have. We're going to turn things around. We'll take this one. Thank you, Sean. All right. Let's get you up to speed now on the snap crash. The social media stock plummeting 30% following a disappointing Q3 earnings report. Snapchat revenue grew just 6%. That's the smallest since the 2017 IPO. And losses surged 400% to $360 million in Part 2. $255 million restructuring charge. If you'll remember, snap announced it would cut 20% of its staff in August. It's roughly 6,000 employees. Jeffers analysts Brent Thale telling Yahoo Finance this morning they may have to go deeper than that. Snap shares now down 83%. This year, other social media stocks feeling the pain is well today metafelling less than 2% Pinterest down 7%. And Twitter also saw more than 4% decline largely on some other concerns, which we will address later in the program. But the ad environment's certainly not helping here. Over now to Jared Bickery is going to get us up to speed on the currency market. Jared, what do we see? Yes. Well, currencies are tied to bonds. They're tied to everything else. So let's take a look. I want to start with the Dow here. You mentioned some of the negative action that we've had on Fridays. Guess what? Not today. Like you said, traders are seizing on those very, very, very slightly dovish comments by Mary Daly. But also a Yen intervention that we got according to the NEC, the Bank of Japan, Interved in the currency market. So let me just go to the Yen here and let's see if I can find this. There we go. That's versus the UN. Here's the US dollar versus the Japanese yen. Now we had broken above the key 150 level. This is a level that has not been breached since 1990. And shortly after that happened earlier this morning, I was sitting with the Kiko Fijita. At the desk here, there was a huge reversal. Let me just show you how that looked. There was this big downleg, a little bit of a reversal there. And we got considerably lower. Now, if you take a look at a six months chart, you can see, well, this happened before. And what happened after that? A couple of weeks later, back to New Hyes. The US dollar was back to New Hyes versus the Yen. All of this is to say that the central bankers for all of the talk, for all of the actions, they haven't really done anything just yet. It's a market's maybe getting ahead of themselves. So we'll have to see if anything comes of this. I've been tweeting about it today. I'm going to be writing about the intervention over the weekend. I just want to get back to the market action today. Shauna went over the sector action. Let's take a look at the Nasdaq. We have Amazon up 3% Microsoft. Microsoft hop 2% Apple up 2% looking at the five day view. Really about the mega cap. So we are looking at some decent gains this week. And I think traders are going to take that. All right, Chair. Thanks so much for that. Let's talk about the broader market moves, what we're seeing play out in the markets today. Really what we've seen over the last several months. And for that, we want to bring in a Thomas Petrophy. He's interactive brokers founder and chairman. Thomas, it's great to see you. So I think we're all trying to make sense of the gains that we're seeing today and comparing that to the losses that we've seen really since the start of the year. The S&P still off just around 21% year to date. What's your assessment of where we stand today? Well, it's very hard to understand these gains because I think optimism is just too strong here because you know that the Fed has to has to rain in inflation. And and they are very far from having done that. So they still have a long way to go and those higher interest rates are certainly going to be earnings in the first, second, and third. And third quarter of next year and estimates will have to come down accordingly. And if you put 15 multiple unto those adjusted earnings, I don't really see the market much above 3000 on the S&P. So how much further do you think the markets have to fall Thomas? I think that it's going to get close to 3000. So that's 10 to 20% lower from here. Thomas, what do you make of the moves that the Fed has made so far because there's lots of debate about how far the Fed has gone if there is this risk that the Fed is going to overshoot? Do you think they've been too aggressive up to this point? I don't think they have been too aggressive. Maybe that would be aggressive in the future.",https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XTJjX90THDQ,72,2022-10-21 19:07:13
3889," Shoo, do you think they've been too aggressive up to this point? I don't think they have been too aggressive. Maybe they'll be aggressive in the future, but so far, look, the economy really hasn't slowed down much as a result of these rate increases and they really want to dampen down retail consumer demand. And once they succeed in doing that, then inflation will slow down, but that will show up in the sales figures for the big tech companies and most consumer goods companies. So, the Fed president, Mary Daly, San Francisco, really rallied the markets. How dovish did you hear these comments? It's time to start talking about stepping down. The time has now to start planning for stepping down. I think that is the wrong message. I think the Fed has to send the message that we're going to stamp out in place no matter what. And if they are in a better position, if they can scare the market into easing up on spending rather than having to force them to ease up on it. So, I don't think the Fed is very happy right now. And Thomas, and with all of that in mind, the fact that you're saying that the S&P could fall to 3,000, I'm curious what you're seeing from your customers, from the retail investor perspective. What are they doing at a time when there's so much uncertainty in the market? So, our core customers who are basically professional traders who work on the trading desks of many of the large investment banks around the world. And they hedge the report fully early on this year. And as the market has been pulling, they just recently started to cover those hedges very slowly. Unfortunately, the retail investors got really hurt and they are not the sidelines. Now, as far as the market going from here, it's generally accepted by the professional traders. The market, as I said, has another 10 to 20% to go down, but it is impossible to pick a button. And so, they have to pick a range of prices at which they gradually get back into the market using like interactive group brokers, as all kinds of algorithms that you can set up to buy, scale down, and falling price, or sales scale up in a range of pricing, pricing prices. So, yeah, it's So, based on the volume of TD Ameritrade and Charles Swab, the Wall Street Journal headline reads, time for day traders to go back to their day jobs. Overall, do you agree without assessment? And when do you think they come back? Well, I agree with the assessment day traders. Yes, they trade their, I mean, look, day traders don't do better or worse in an upmarket versus in a downmarket. So, day traders are just there to try to get the swing of things. And you know, the ones that cannot make a living, of course, they have to go back to their day jobs. But, you know, much of these day trading is now migrated over to the options markets where you can easily, you know, set up option spreads like buying one strike selling another where your risk and profit is limited. But you can take advantage of shorter moves without having to take too much of a risk. So, I think that the conventional day traders has moved from the stock market to the option market. And Thomas, as I take a look at your most recent earnings report, obviously, a",https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XTJjX90THDQ,73,2022-10-21 19:11:24
3890," the conventional data has moved from the stock market to the option market. And Thomas, as they take a look at your most recent earnings report, obviously a beat there. The street rewarded the stock. We saw some appetite for the stock as a result of those earnings. Just what's your assessment of your business at this point during the current quarter? And what does it look like as we look ahead to 2023? So, our business looks pretty good because we have more and more larger professional customers, like hedge funds coming onto our platform. And that is very helpful. So, we have spent several decades automating everything in the business so we can offer our services very, very inexpensively. And so we're finally getting the benefit of it because people are recognizing that IBKR is the platform to go to. All right, we'll have to leave it there. Interactive brokers, founder, Thomas Petrifi, good to see you, sir. Thank you. Enjoy the weekend. Just getting started here on Yahoo!

3891," I'll let's check the markets as we wrap up the week. It's a free-fry Friday, which is why they're rallying so much. Obviously, up more than 600 points on the Dow, the S&P up nearly 2% and the NASDAQ also up about 2% a strong Friday to wrap up this week. Let's talk about it with young you, mob, BMO, wealth management, US chief strategist, chief investment strategist, good to see us sir. So let's discuss this rally to end the week. Largely, we perceive on the perception that Mary Daly, San Francisco, Fed President's comments were dovish. What do you make of the rally? Well, it's welcome, certainly. And I think there are a lot of work participants that have had a lot of challenging days. And so a day like today is certainly a good relief. But if we look at more toward the median picture, we still have, as your previous guests said, a lot of inflation pressures. The Fed still has a lot of work to do and interest rates are still rising. So we're not putting all that much stock into this one day, but it's certainly welcome and we'll take it. Well, young you, what do you make then of the next couple of weeks, the next couple of months in terms of the fact that the Fed's going to stay more aggressive? The 75-base point hike seems like a short thing at this point at the next meeting. Is that going to trigger a sell off? I think the 75-base point is pretty much baked in and the big discussion now is on December meeting, whether it'll be 50 or 75-base point. But I think if we take a step back, the market's in a bit of a catch-22, because if we want earnings to stay stable, given the cost that companies are facing now, both wage pressures, other input costs as well, for them to pass those costs on is what's necessary for earnings to stay stable and passing those costs on mean inflation. And that means the Fed has to continue to be aggressive. So we're in this push and pull dynamic here that's not easy to get out of until we get much better inflation readings. Interesting. A huge week of earnings next week, but in the rear view mirror, what's the lesson, the thematic lesson that you've seen in earnings so far in Q3? Well, expectations came down a lot. I think that's the important thing to remember. If you strip out the energy sector, they went from about a positive 6% back in July for this quarter's earnings all the way down to I think maybe 3%. And so once you lower the bar that much, it does set up an environment where it's a lot easier to beat earnings, a lot easier to have relief rallies. But the problem is, when we go into Q4, if we continue to get downgrades and lower the bar, we'll go through the same pattern that we went through leading up to this quarter, which is a challenging environment. So I think the themes are, there's some stability. Companies are finding ways to manage costs, to pass costs on. But as your previous guest said, there's still a lot of headwinds that remain. And this is going to play out over multiple quarters, not just a couple months. So you're going to get without a mind that what should investors be doing at this point? There are a few areas that we like. And that's a great question. We certainly do like a value as a long term play, even small cap value where valuations are starting to look more attractive. And we're actually looking more favorably on fixed income than we have in a very long time. I think it's gone from an environment where we had a few years ago, what was referred to as Tina, there is no alternative to what I'm calling now as Tara. There's a real alternative. And that real alternative is in the fixed income market. You can get 4% on a two year, about 4.5% on a two year treasury. You can get over 6% and triple B corporates. You can get it around 9%, almost 9% in high yield corporates. Those are starting to look pretty attractive here. So the fixed income market is going to be getting more and more attention as these interest rates continue to rise. John, you have the path narrowed to a soft landing? There is still path to a soft landing. You do want to emphasize that that's still our base case, a soft landing, but that path is narrowing. As interest rates continue to rise and rise sharply as a trajectory for inflation continues to look like it's going to be quite a sticky path ahead. And as global factors and geopolitical factors continue to present problems, that path is starting to narrow.",https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XTJjX90THDQ,75,2022-10-21 19:20:10
3892," to look like it's going to be quite a sticky path ahead. And as global factors and geopolitical factors continue to present problems, that path is starting to narrow. But on the positive side, what you want to reiterate, the job market is very strong. Consumer spending should have a floor under it given the strength of the job market. And so there is a path ahead that can lead to a soft landing. But it becomes challenged as interest rates continue to rise. Young, we were talking to Mark Zandee yesterday about when he expects to see inflation significantly cool. And you told us that he expected to be cut in half in about six months. Do you agree with that? I think that's a reasonable estimate. I guess it depends on which measure you're looking at, headline or core. But I don't think the challenge is getting from, say, 6%, 7% inflation down to 3%, 3%, 1,5% inflation. That's not the challenge. I think that's reasonably achievable. I think the challenge that the Fed's going to have is getting from 3%, 3%, 1,5% down to 2%. And that last mile of inflation is really going to be a sticking point because the tightness of the labor market and the other inflation and pressures, supply chain pressures, ensuring you name it, I think that environment speaks to a situation where getting down to 2% is very difficult. So if the Fed sticks to that target, I think there's going to be a considerable amount more work to do. But yeah, being halved in six months seems reasonable. And then of course, the debate out there is whether or not even has to get to 2% in order for the Fed to think that the job is complete. Well, young Yuma, always great, Tavi. Thanks so much. Have a good weekend. Thank you, Sean. Thanks, Dave. Coming up, Toyota issuing a new warning over the chip shortage. We have the details. And what it could mean if you're looking for a car next.",https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XTJjX90THDQ,76,2022-10-21 19:25:13
3893," Apple is opening doors to how your phone can be used to get in your home. Literally, the tech giant has teamed up with level on a door lock that uses Apple Home Key. You just tap your iPhone or Apple Watch against the lock to lock or unlock it. You can also text keys to people that you want to let into your home when you're not there. The $329 level lock plus is the first home key supported lock that's being sold in Apple stores. Apple shares currently trading up just over 2%. As fantastic as this is in terms of a luxury is a little bit terrifying. I know real estate agents already have something similar but just being able to the fear of someone you want to hack your phone and get in your home. Yeah. Paraportals will use your phone and it's not locked. Or if you lose your phone. Or if you lose your phone. Or if you lose your phone. Or if you lose your phone. Or if you lose your phone. Risk there. As someone who routinely locks theirself out and always forgets the keys, I am a big proponent of this and I think it sounds like a great idea. I do though. You don't have any fear. There are some fears out there. I think I need to learn a little bit more exactly about what happens if you do lose your phone. How long that key stays active if you were to send it to somebody so they could access your house. Whether it's like a 5 minute thing or a hour thing. It is. It is. I'm excited about it. All right. Moving on here. This semiconductor shortage further hand-bring the automakers. This time threatening Toyota's production targets. Yahoo! Finance is pro supermanian has been following the story for us and pro's more trouble here ahead for Toyota. This chip crisis is still lingering there, especially in Japan. Toyota having to cut its 9.7 million vehicle fiscal forecast for the fiscal year. They are evaluating a new target. They even told us what they are going to cut it to. They are also cutting their monthly outputs. They cut their October output to 800,000. Their November output to 800,000 as well. Cars affected like the Corolla, the RAV4, some Lexus models, even some Camrys. In popular name plates, popular brands across the board are being affected slightly here by their production cut. One note that 9.7 million was an all-time high for the brand. They are optimistic here. It will ask if they made it on 8.6. They are projecting a big 2022, but clearly not happening right now. All right. Prostick around. I want to talk a little bit about Elon. Even by Elon Musk's standards, it has been a very volatile 24 hours. Notably reports suggesting the Biden administration officials are discussing whether his deals should be subject to U.S. national security reviews, including Twitter and SpaceX's Starlink satellite network. According to Bloomberg, one way to do so would be through the law governing the Committee on Foreign Investment in the United States under the Treasury Department. Time is of the essence, Sean. The $44 billion deal for Twitter scheduled to close one week from today. So the timing is certainly interesting to say. The least. Yeah, the timing is certainly interesting. I think there's still a lot of unanswered questions. We talk about this every time just in terms of what from something as basic as what exactly Twitter is going to look like under Musk to how he's going to be able to secure this financing. We know so far. Prostick has had, he's raised about 15 billion in cash from selling part of his stake in Tesla. He's disclosing may filing about $7 billion of financing commitments. But then that does leave a large chunk of change that will still need to be raised in order for this deal to close, in order for him to follow through and buy it for $44 billion. So lots of unanswered questions that we're exactly that money is going to come from and how he's going to get that. Yeah, and that's sort of a more of an overhang in the stock of Tesla stock that he's selling. Those reports he might have to sell in there at $5 to $10 million in Tesla. I'm talking billion. I'm talking billion in Tesla shares to fund the Twitter deal. Coincidentally, this week they talked about buybacks on the earnings call, must say that the board has talked about, we debated it. The board generally thinks it makes sense for a buyback. This look at it do the whole kind of the board approval and the sort of all the kind of looking into how they do that. But it's kind of interesting that that buyback is sort of coinciding with how much money he needs to sort of raise. In the sense that the shareholders a little bit upset about the fact that the, you know, look at Tesla shares this year.",https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XTJjX90THDQ,77,2022-10-21 19:28:54
3894, I'm just saying that that that that that buyback is sort of coinciding with how much money he needs to sort of raise in the sense that people the shareholders a little bit upset about the fact that you know look at Tesla shares this year down you know 30% or so. So it's kind of like a problem not only for Twitter but also for Tesla and we just saw right now the journalist publishing a story about how this would be the biggest hung deal in in in debt because people the banks are kind of saddled with the debt and no one wants to buy it right now. So it's both Tesla shares and also debt kind of mixing together in a kind of a problematic buy here for Musk and Twitter. And you're talking about things mixing together. I mean Elon can't stay out of international issues and this is appears to be by design. I mean he is funding the Starlink Internet there in the Ukraine and I said at one point he wants the US government to do it but now he's going to continue to fund it at 20 million dollars a month. Just yesterday he retweeted a Russian national security security council expert Demetri Medvedev who had trolled Liz Truss so he can't help himself in staying out of these things and we haven't even gotten to the fact that there was a Washington Post report suggesting Elon would lay off 75% of Twitter employees Twitter is now telling their employees don't worry about that. That's not on the cards. You are now. Of course are going to worry about that and start freshening your resume. Yeah of course you are and we've already heard some analyst reaction. Janis is out with the notes saying that you can't cut your way to grow simply that that is not going to happen. He went on to say that if we do see must come in and cut in the numbers of that 75% range is going to be way too aggressive in their option doing that coming in and doing that right out of the gate and it's going to take years before this X app strategy takes hold. So if you go and cut 75% of the workforce I mean press that also lends a lot of questions to exactly why he thinks Twitter is going to be able to operate with a 75% reduction in the head count. There are around 7000 or so employees I believe at Twitter but that's significant of a cut. You've got to start scratching your head and say what the heck is Twitter going to potentially look like under months? Yeah I mean he's sort of taking the viewpoint of I'm from California Silicon Valley. I know to fix these things. We can do these better than how Twitter and current management is doing that right now. One thing I want to note about the syphia stuff is I'm going to key about this. You have the kind of like let's say China cracks down on free speech on Twitter and it lenses I don't want to do that. What about your next Chinese factory? Are they going to then step on him on Tesla in order to get him to act on Twitter? So these guys his hands everywhere but that's going to be a problem with regards to that sort of thing. National security concerns are obvious everywhere. Prost thank you good stuff. All right come out American Express Shares following despite reporting and earnings feet find out why when we come back. It's,https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XTJjX90THDQ,78,2022-10-21 19:33:18
3895," O. Slamifer This time, we're at Triple Play, three stats that we're watching here in the final 30 minutes of trading American Express, Netflix and Hawaiian Airlines, Jared Blyckery. Joining us on Zed to break all of this down my pick today is American Express. The stock actually taking a hit after the company raised its guidance, but that wasn't enough for the street. For the quarter though, the numbers were pretty strong sales, jumping at 24% to 13.5 billion. That's a new record for the company, CEO Steven Squarie, saying that the upbeat that he was still upbeat on the consumer, traveled, demand, exceeding expectations. Customers are not changing spending behavior at least for now. One thing I do want to note though, profits were up only 3% during the quarter, Jared. A lot of that has to do with the fact that American Express set aside more than $700 million in anticipation of a tougher macro economic environment. You're looking at a year to date. It shares off just around 15%. Compare that to the broader market. American Express is actually doing pretty well. So no signs yet, Jared, that the consumer is pulling back. You've got to question though what these numbers could potentially look like for the current quarter and then of course maybe for the early quarters of 2023. Yes. And American Express wasn't the only one that was increasing their loan loss reserves. Let's go to the Wi-Fi Interactive. I'm going to do a quick charting on this. We just showed a year to date. This is a one year and we are indeed by some critical levels here. But let me just put a 20 year chart. Oopsies, let's try to get that 20 year chart up one more time as I fat finger this tiny little tablet. All right, here we go. Now, see what we're looking at here. Everybody focus on that, Shana. There we go. All right, so we got a series of consolidations and breaks to new highs. But this is like a textbook upward trend here. It's just taking place over a very, very long period of time. And the current lows are actually the prior highs and so all is well in the universe here. Now let me shift attention to the NASDAQ 100 from the Dow. And this is over the last five days. Netflix here is the leader. If we sort by equal weight, you can see up in the upper left Netflix up 25% for the week. And here is a 20 year chart. Now this looks a little bit different. It had been in a nice uptrend and severely broke that. That's what happens with some of these growth stocks. But I just want to show you on a two year basis what's that's looking, what that is looking like. Now, we know the news this week, Netflix has somewhat improved their response to subscriber losses. And it seems like they have that on track right now. Lots of hope with their reengineering strategy also pushing to increase the revenues through that ad supported service and also to monetize the free loaders, aka me. So we'll see how that works out, guys. You are full of surprises today, brother. Oopsies, you haven't yet that. Netflix is really interesting. Obviously, the story moving forward is the ad tier and the password sharing. But in terms of the actual content, I think it's interesting because they have this sequel to Knives Outcoming. And I always forget the name is called Glass Onion. And while the theaters want them to do more of that, this is limited. One week, 600 theaters. And on the other hand, they've seen Dumber 10th most stream show of all time. It's not bad. So you can't help but wonder which direction they'll take in terms of content moving forward. I think the Dumber type model seems to favor them a lot more, find these franchises that put up these massive numbers. Yeah, it certainly does. And it also, I think it's just big as a question just in terms of what that subscriber growth is going to look...",https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XTJjX90THDQ,79,2022-10-21 19:37:41
3896," seems to favor them a lot more, find these franchises to put up these massive numbers. Yeah, it certainly does. And I think it's just big as a question, just in terms of what that subscriber growth is going to look like. Like, yes, we got a very, very strong number for the third quarter. I think the ad tier is going to boost numbers at least in the short term. But how many of those subscribers are going to potentially downgrade? I know you and I have talked about that many times. And how many new subscribers are really going to be able to pull in? Because, yes, it's cheaper than what the entry, what the base price is now. But it's still a lot. And people already are subscribed to so many different services that you've got a question where that saturation number is. It will be an interesting story ahead. My play is Hawaiian Airlines, who Amazon is now hired to fly the first Airbus cargo planes in the retail giant's air network. Hawaiian will fly at least 10 Airbus A330-300 converted freighters for Amazon starting in the fall of 2023. Now, the Airbus Jets will be the largest in Amazon's fleet. And we'll replace older aircraft. Amazon currently outsources to Atlas worldwide holdings, ATSG and Sun Country, which fly mainly Boeing jets. Under the agreement, Hawaiian is issuing words for Amazon to acquire up to 15% of its stock. Exercise will over the next nine years. Hawaiian will also hire pilots and additional mechanics as well. Hawaiian stock up more than 10% on this news. But still down, more than 18% year to date, Amazon's up also more than 3%. After a string of strong airlines earnings, Hawaiian will report on Tuesday. One interesting thing we've seen from Amazon, from American to Delta to United Jared is every CEO is talked about the new Norman travel, which is people combining business with pleasure travel, all three of them seeing it wildly. It should be interesting to see if that's a new norm or just a minor reflection of remote work. I really want to jump in on this bandwagon. So no to my superiors here, I am down to fly to wherever, as long as it is a coastal destination with good weather right now. And work. And work, yeah, yeah, work related obviously. Work. It's a great, I don't even know how to follow up with that. You're really throwing them out there. I like it a lot. But let's say I'd back to Hawaiian and what we could hear next week, because there was an interesting note out from Deutsche Bank on the heels of this announcement saying that Amazon's business will not only improve Hawaiians and revenue diversification, but it's also going to help alleviate the earnings volatility that we tend to see when it comes to Hawaiians business. So Deutsche Bank saying it's very positive. You mentioned the fact that they are negative year to date. We'll take a, I guess get a better look at those numbers next week. Great. As we head to break, let's take a look at the rally that we're seeing play out, accelerating into the close. You can see the down year, the highs of the day, up 757 points. S&P up nearly two and a half percent. The NASDAQ also hanging onto gains up just around a 2%. Not next, a TikTok under fire following a report on how the company wanted to use location data. We've got the details on that when we come back. $133 million.��",https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XTJjX90THDQ,80,2022-10-21 19:42:07
3897," Epic music The US-China trade war thought to have simmered a bit following the Trump administration's tariffs escalating to a whole new level the US ban on advanced chip exports. Senior columnist Rick Newman and presidential candidate in 2024 joining us now. No, Rick, you're not running? You've declared, right? Tax breaks for our news anchors. That's my whole platform. That's your platform. So, tell us about the escalation here. These are new rules that the Biden administration announced two weeks ago with almost no fanfare. If you remember back, everything about the Trump tariffs on China went through a megaphone where Trump was talking about it on Twitter, on all of his interviews and everybody had to figure out if he's really going to go through on this thread or not go all the distance. What Biden has done seems to be far more significant with far less fanfare. In the short version this, it's very complicated, is a whole new range of what are basically embargoes on advanced semiconductor sales to China and also any technology that China might be able to use to make its own advanced semiconductor. So one analyst described this as an intent to strangle with an intent to kill China's artificial intelligence industry. And this has everything to do not just with computers and technology, but it has a lot to do with surveillance, electric vehicles, and certainly with advanced weaponry. So the Biden administration is doing something here that really seems like it is going to put a stranglehold on part of China's economy and China is probably going to retaliate in some way. So, this is going to get messier. Just real quick, how do you think they might retaliate? Because we haven't heard much about that yet, Rick. No, they haven't. So some of the things they could do would be making life hard for US businesses operating in China. There are many American businesses that want to sell to the Chinese market and do so to the Chinese market. And you think about Tesla and Apple, for example. They could also restrict sales to the United States of things like rare earth minerals. There are some such minerals, really important to technologies of the future that China has kind of has a corner on the market. So they could do that or they could do subtler things. And they can also file a complaint at the World Trade Organization, which would take years and years to resolve as is usually the case. So this is going to be very interesting for a long time to come. And Rick, speaking of the rising escalating tensions here between the US and China, the Chinese from behind TikTok has now denying some allegations that we heard published initially in Forbes that it was using the social media app to track American users. You would think that this would attract even more scrutiny from Washington, then. And I think it is attracting scrutiny from Washington behind the scenes. This is kind of a weird dance, if you will, between bite dance, TikTok's parent company in Forbes.",https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XTJjX90THDQ,81,2022-10-21 19:46:18
3898," And then. And I think it is attracting scrutiny from Washington behind the scenes. This is what this is kind of a weird dance, if you will, between bite dance, tick tock parent company and Forbes. So Forbes published a piece recently. Saying that the parent company of tick tock based in China had a plan to monitor or track a what sounds like a small number of us individuals and they did not identify who they were now they said they had a plan to track these people and we don't know if it was just randos using tick tock or if they were going to track like Mitch McConnell and Joe Biden on tick tock now what bite dance has come out and said is no we did not track anybody. And we don't track anybody on tick tock any us users on tick tock so Forbes said they had a plan to do it but actually putting it into effect and bite dance came out and said no we never track anybody any American users on tick tock so what's really going on here. But look, I mean, we should all know at this point every social media company sucks up every bit of data. It can get about you, including one space here in the United States. And now there are many millions of people whose data is on a social media app that is controlled by a company in China. Yeah. Is that cool with everybody? You know, it seems to be it seems like a lot of the users simply don't care, which is also part of the issue here, but I'm sure we will this is not the last event. We will continue to hear more about this Rick Newman. As always, thanks so much. Have a good weekend. Bye. All right. Doctors across the US reporting a rise in pediatric respiratory viruses well before the typical winter cold and flu season Yahoo finances. And we're already seeing the number of cases overwhelm some hospitals. That's right. And this is something that experts had been warning about. We've seen that respiratory viruses have been absent from the pressure that health health systems face in the last few years because of COVID. And so what typically happens is that these respiratory viruses come with one rising and the other falling by comparison to each other. But what we're finding right now is a health systems are preparing for three different outbreaks at the same time in the same season. That includes COVID in flu and RSV RSV is an interesting one because it really impacts the most vulnerable and impacts kids and also impacts elderly adults. We've seen 2.1 million cases typically a year. And you see each year RSV leads to on average 58,000 hospitalizations with about 100 to 500 deaths among kids younger than five. So that's where the concern is and that's why children's hospitals especially are overwhelmed. We also know that that's the same age group that has the lowest COVID vaccination rate. So as you can imagine really, really tough times for these health systems right now not surprising health experts have been warning about this in the in previous months and we're trying to see an early aggressive flu season as well. We just spoke to the lab course CEO Adam Schecter about one test that can test for all three COVID and the flu as well. And vaccine companies are working on combo vaccine for for the same reason. Yep. So the rise and respiratory illness shortage of a mox is still in reportedly what are we learning. So we know that this is largely affecting certain CVS locations in the country. It's not a widespread shortage just yet. The company is working with the manufacturer or manufacturers right now. No more details on that. It's important to note that this is something that's been sort of hopscotting around the globe. We've heard reports of shortages on and off throughout the year in different countries as well. From some from various manufacturers and done clear right now what really is causing that but we know we do know that CVS is on track to resume this and it shouldn't be a widespread issue. I'm Julie Kimmelani. Thanks so much for those details coming up next the new business or big business. I should say a Taylor Swift a number of companies are teaming up with her to promote her midnight's album. Well the details after the break. You",https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XTJjX90THDQ,82,2022-10-21 19:50:30
3899," MUSIC Taylor Swift and her fans as Swifties have taken over Twitter amid the release of her new album Midnight Yahoo! The album was released at Midnight and according to Downic Detector, nearly 8,000 reports of outages on the Spotify platform as a direct result of the album's release. And if we're talking about Taylor Swift, I know into the break you call her a big business, and she certainly is. From a marketing perspective, the buzz leading up to this album has been very astonishing. Taylor has released TikTok videos, Instagram posts. She released a teaser video during Amazon's Thursday night football game last night, obviously a huge platform there, and she's seen a significant amount of engagement through all of those tactics. And on Twitter, the company released a whole report on Taylor Swift's popularity. Some nuggets from that report you're seeing on your screen, 329 million tweets mentioning Taylor Swift in the last 12 years that fan base name Swifties tweeted over 18 million times since 2010. And so much more, I spoke with Brand expert Sunny Bono. He'll told me that Taylor has used a variety of strategies to increase the momentum surrounding each of her respective releases. We know she's constantly reinventing herself, her music, her look, and that reinvention has really been key to her success. And then finally, one thing that I want to call out is that on Twitter, I notice that a lot of these consumer facing brands, inions, Amtrak, LinkedIn, even do a lingo, they've all tweeted about the midnight's album over the past 24 hours, 12 hours. So they're really capitalizing on Taylor Swift. And that just goes to show the impact that she's had. So at the end of the day, it's just, you know, Taylor's world, we're all just living in it. No doubt, man, she is an absolute machine. Switching gears to the box office, Ally, two releases expected to dominate this weekend. One is a DC comic book, black Adam, the other.",https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XTJjX90THDQ,83,2022-10-21 19:55:10
3900," and she is an absolute machine. Switching years to the box office, Ally, two releases expected to dominate this weekend. One is a DC comic book, black Adam, the other, a romcom, which we haven't seen a lot in the theaters recently. Ticket to Paradise, what's the expectation? Yeah, and I want to start with that, that romcom, because I love a good underdog story. Ticket to Paradise, it's already secure nearly a 75 million internationally, a very successful start, and it does take the pressure off of that domestic debut currently expectations are set in the low to mid teens. It will have to battle the rocks black Adam. That's expected to secure around 6 million plus. So ticket to Paradise could be more of a slow burn, but it does call into question the future of the romcom, according to one analyst that I spoke with, this could symbolize a resurgence of the romcom, especially after the success of the lost city back in March. But we'll have to see how it does. And Ally, I know we're a few weeks away from the black panthers. The sequel here will condo, but the bar has been set so, so high for this film. What are the expectations? Yeah, it's crazy that we already have expectations for this, but early tracking by NRG shows that the sequel could debut to 175 million. Now, if that number holds, it would be the second biggest debut this year, right behind another big Marvel sequel, Dr. Strange in the multiverse of madness. And for a little context there, the original black panther opened to 202 million in 2018. So still a possibility that that number could come in even higher. And we've seen advanced ticket sales been really strong. It won't have that much competition. And of course, it's going to debut right before the holidays. So potentially some more momentum carrying it through the end of the year. But November 11th, that's the magic date that we'll finally see this movie come to theaters. Very much looking forward to that one. Ally, can I now thank you? Enjoy the weekend, my friend. Thanks. You too. Coming up, we're counting down to the closing bell on Wall Street. Stay with us here on Yandong Finance Law.",https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XTJjX90THDQ,84,2022-10-21 19:59:36
3901," All right, just a couple of minutes away from the closing bell. Let's bring in Yahoo! Fanat's is Jared Blyckery to see if we can finally have ourselves a positive Friday, my friend. Finally, eight out of the last nine have been negative. But look at this. To close the week, we have the Dow, the S&P 500, the Nasdaq, each up over 2% throwing the Russell 2000 there with it. The S&P 500 is deck up over 5% down there almost with it and S&P 500 about in the same place. Here is, I think this is going to be the sector action for the week. In fact, the entire week, all five days, energy in the lead followed by tech materials, consumer discretionary, all of those the outperformers and what a day for the Fed. I mean, we woke up to a Nick Timmerl's article, then we had a intervention, then we had some Mary daily comments as well, throwing all of it. And guess what? By the end of the day, by the end of the week, we're seeing a lot of the money flow into some of these fringe markets like meme stocks. So I'm going to go through some of these rather quickly. Here's the Nasdaq also on a five day basis, Amazon, tacking on gains 11% there and video also up 11%. Tesla, having a little bit of a rough go after its earnings, but still managing to cap the week at 4.5% Microsoft alphabet right there with it. Let me just show you some of our heatmaps here for the week. Travel looking pretty good. Carnival cruise lines up 15% United Airlines, the airlines announcing. That's up 14% bank stocks doing fairly well after rounding out the big bank earnings. Earlier this week, you can see JP Morgan Bank of America each up about 10%. Goldman Sachs up 8% with 15 seconds to go. We're going to check in on the EB market. And here we go. I took a Tesla, but look at Ford. That's up 4.5% and GM up 6%. This ending the day well in the green as we wrap up the trading week. Dow, Nasdaq and S&P all up over 2% today. Some of that rally coming in in the final hour and a half of trading. To look at the sector action, all 11 of the S&P sectors moving to the upside for the day materials by far the outperform up just around 3.5%. Energy consumer discretionary financials not too far behind. Right from on, this will bring in Jordan, Pence, Pence, Capitol, management, cheap investment officer. We also have Alfred Eskindar. He's a self financial president and chief operating officer. Dryden, let me start with you. We're certainly are looking at a day of solid gains all through the major averages up to well over 2% today. What's your takeaway not only from the buying we saw today, but really what we've seen play out over the entire trading week? Well, I think everyone's looking for that idea about pause. And whenever you have anything from the Fed speak that possibly there's a pause and raising the interest rate cycle. I think you're going to see a kind of a hyperactive response because everybody's been the frazzled cat for the last couple of months. So things have been a little too negative when every bad news comes out and then sometimes we get a little overreactive on the positive side. So anytime you get something about the Fed's possibly going to pause, then you're going to see this massive reaction. Sometimes it can be an overreaction as well. And that's the question, isn't it Alfred? Because San Francisco Fed President Mary Daly, you have to really seek out the dovish comment and she said the time is now to start talking about stepping down. The time is now to start planning for stepping down, but she was clear, this ain't it. Are we overreacting? Are the markets rather? I don't think it's so much of an overreaction as a release. We've had volatility spiking all year. I mean, if you think about where volatility began and January where we are, it's up 73%. So think about the rocky road that investors have to deal with. You couple that with obviously the moves and the Fed inflation and everyone feeling the pinch at home. And then you get a psychology really coming into play with the average investor. So when you have huge down weeks like we've had in the last couple, a week like today is fantastic. It feels great to be up almost 5% on all the major indices for the week. But that is not a respite for the all clear sign. What we have to understand is the rest of the year is going to look pretty much like this. We're going to have massive weeks up and massive weeks down.",https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XTJjX90THDQ,85,2022-10-21 20:03:30
3902," the all clear side. What we have to understand is the rest of the year is going to look pretty much like this. We're going to have massive weeks up and massive weeks down. And you know, it is not for the investor with a soft stomach. Jordan, what do you think these happen in order for there to be some more conviction in the market and for you to be more bullish? Well, I think there's three big terms out there. We're looking for peace in the Ukraine. We're looking for a pause. We're looking for verification of the peak and interest rates. And so far, a core has not peaked yet. And we don't we're not going to really get until the middle of next month. If you're after this next Fed move, the next read on on inflation. And that's going to probably not be a pretty read. If you it has a core hasn't peaked yet, we think. And so I think you have to get past where we have this moment of assurance that we probably have hit peak both core and headline. And that we are actually legitimately talking about a pause in the rise in the federal fund rates. I don't think a pivot is probably something to be afraid of because I think if they pivot, they've broken it. But if they move to a pause and extended pause period of time to let because consumers have to catch up. We can trade policy. You can change policy overnight or within a day or markets will check in a day. But consumers, the drivers of inflation have to catch up. It takes six or eight months. And I think that we're forgetting that. So for me to be bullish again, we have to begin to see that policy makers are beginning to give the consumers some time for reality to catch up with what they're trying to do. A lot of peas in there. So Alfred, when do we see that pause? And when do we get an indication that inflation is beginning to at least peak? Well, you know, the numbers are going to guide us and and certainly the federal respond accordingly. But in lieu of all that, I think investors really need to take a look at the portfolios and understand the risk exposure and depending on who you are. You know, if you're a young investor, guess what? You've got time. You could actually write out, you know, this volatility, you know, for the next few quarters. However, if you're a little bit older, thankfully, there are plenty of products that have been introduced in the last 10, 15 years that are quite sophisticated that are really terrific defensive products to use when markets are this volatile. You know, if you're 55 and you're thinking about retirement, seeing a 20% draw down the S&P 30 and that's like, that's not what you want to experience. So there's plenty of products out there. Think about the risk in your portfolio and be defensive. Like, you know, winning is also akin to not losing. So the less you lose, the more you win in markets like this. And I think taking a much more defensive posture for those who have been in the market for quite a bit is the right thing to do. It's the prudent thing to do right now. Can you give some of those older investors some of those products? Sure. Well, listen, anything from, you know, fixed index annuities, structured products and then on the super accessible, easy thing are buffer ETFs. Now granted, they're not going to protect you for the total downside that we've seen this year in the markets. But, you know, being down 10% versus being down 25 is still a win. So again, defensive sectors, defensive products products that actually can give the investor downside protection to some extent or completely are some things that should be added to a portfolio. It's not just about stocks and certainly bonds have been down this year as well. So we got to think about the portfolio a lot differently. The 6040 is kind of updated. Jordan, what do you think? And I guess where are you seeing the most opportunity today in terms of what investors should be doing? Well, one thing we have now that we have not had in years is we have an interest rate. And so for some investors, actually, it's appropriate right now. The two years is actually yielding pretty good. And so if they think about long term, we're going to have rights go down. Now's a good time to think about sometime between now and the end of the year, maybe adding some to your treasury to the portfolios because now you can, you know, if you're trying to get eight long term and compound that, well, you know, all four to quarter, get you halfway there. And so, but the other side of it is when we think about looking at who's going to do well in a continued inflationary environment. And we actually see that barbellying things make some sense to the consumer. You have companies like Walmart and some of the ones who are helping.",https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XTJjX90THDQ,86,2022-10-21 20:07:50
3903," than a continued inflationary environment. And we actually see that barbellying things make some sense to the consumer. You have companies like Walmart and some of the ones who are helping the low end consumer, you have people who are making over $80,000 a year. Now moving down to that market, so you're gonna see continued growth there. And actually, wages have grown faster than inflation. So you see wages growing faster than inflation for people at the lower end of the economic spectrum. At the higher end of the economic spectrum, their incomes are rising as fast as inflation. And so it's kind of this barbell between LVMH, luxury goods and Walmart. But it's the people in the middle that are gonna continue to have problems as we get into 2023. Maybe we have a small recession. They're gonna be hurt the most. And so you kind of break it up when you think of equity, you think of barbellying those two ends of the consumer. And I think in the center, you're gonna have some challenges for the maces, the targets and those guys because their customers are gonna move to either side. LVMH Walmart barbell is a fascinating one, Jordan, thank you. Appreciate you coming out in the studio. Alfred, you come see us next time. Both of you guys have a good weekend. Appreciate it. Coming up, stuck barges and lighter loads, how low water levels in the Mississippi River are wreaking havoc on the Midwest supply chain next. here. The pandemic related bottleneck of cargo ships off a Southern California's coast has finally cleared Yahoo finances, Danny Romero joining us now with the details. Danny, what can you tell us about this improvement? Yeah, so the backlog that we saw off the Southern California coast has drastically decline. Let's just take a picture. Let's just take a look at what it looks like right now. Here's a picture from Marine Exchange. They are an organization that tracks the backlog at the",https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XTJjX90THDQ,87,2022-10-21 20:12:46
3904," just take a look at what it looks like right now. Here's a picture from Marine Exchange. They are an organization that tracks the backlog at the LA County ports. You can tell in this picture, really clear waters, not much backlog there. As of yesterday, five container ships are backed up at the LA County ports. So that's a big drop from what we saw, the 109 cargo ships that were backlogged in the LA County ports. But the reason goes back to many of these shipping companies, retailers have been shifting and sending their goods to other ports like Georgia, Savannah, Georgia, Houston, Texas, New York. And so to really cushion themselves against the supply chain snarls that they dealt with during the pandemic, when they sent all their goods to the LA County ports. But another reason for why we're seeing such a big drastic decline in these backlogs goes back to cargo volume. Cargo container volume has actually decreased about 11%. So you're really seeing this shift in dynamics, but the backlogs still remain as there is excess inventory that retailers are dealing with. Certainly something that we will continue to watch right now. Thanks so much. Cargo volume, meanwhile a mess on the Mississippi. How vital is the Mississippi River for US commerce? Well, between 2015 and 2019, 95% of corn, 94% of soybeans, and 45% of wheat moved by barge through the Mississippi River. Now we have dangerously low water levels threatening the flow of grain exports. Peter Friedman is the executive director of the Agricultural Transportation Coalition. Good to see you, sir. I want to dive into the economics in a moment. But how do you characterize these dangerously low water levels in the situation you're seeing? It's having a devastating impact on the flow of some of our major agricultural commodities, both impacting the domestic market, but also impacting our ability in our country to be a good, dependable supplier to the world of these agricultural commodities. Yeah, Peter, talk a little bit more about the economic implications of this because like Dave said, half of US grain exports traveled down to the Mississippi when you see an issue like this. What does this potentially do to prices? Well, it'll increase the prices. Look at the difficulty here. Unlike the international ocean containerized cargo, these are bulk commodities. They travel north, south from the northern part of the Midwest down to the Mississippi River, the mouth of the Mississippi River, to bulk ships that carry corn and soybeans, grains, in bulk, huge commodity volumes all over the world. And those are products that are dependent upon by the rest of the world. And in many cases, they can substitute the sourcing from other countries, but in most cases, they cannot substitute. They cannot find these volumes elsewhere. So what happens is the pricing goes up because you're not only buying grain or soybeans from the United States, you're buying grain and soybeans delivered to the place you need them in Africa, South America, and Asia, and so forth. So the delivery cost is skyrocketing because you can't get the product down the river. And the difficulty is that unlike these containerized cargoes that go are the east coast or the west coast, and you can move around. There is no alternative, no realistic alternative, to the barge movement of these massive volumes of commodities. I can give you an example. One barge, just one barge, is holds the equivalent of cargo of 138 trucks. We're talking about the biggest semi-trucks that you see on the highways. One barge, 138 of those trucks. And typically, the barges go in four barge toes, they're called four toes, four barges. That's 550.",https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XTJjX90THDQ,88,2022-10-21 20:16:25
3905," Typically, the barges go in four barged toes, they're called toes, four barges. That's 550 huge trucks. And you see there are thousands of these barges that are on the sand sitting on the bottom, not moving. So that's thousands of barges. We do not have hundreds of thousands of extra trucks sitting around, or hundreds of thousands of extra truck drivers sitting around able to carry that cargo. So it's going that there until we get some rain. Those pictures are just stunning. Is it as simple as a lack of precipitation? And what can be done? Well, first of all, it has to be recognized. Some people would say that, well, if it doesn't go in barge, can it go by rail? Because rail can also carry large volumes. Difficulty is that the barges and our river system go north to south. And most of our railroads go east and west. So there is not a simple replacement of rail for barge. The situation is really dependent upon, as you show here, precipitation. And what we have with agriculture is you certainly have farmers who know that while people living in cities, sometimes we think we're insulated from mother nature. We're not. Farmers know it. This happens. And we need rain to fill the river and get the depth we need to move those barges. And Peter, you need a lot of rain in order to fill that river. Any assymage, and how long this problem could potentially last? There are some people saying that it could be three weeks. But again, it's mother nature. And predicting that is a profession, I guess, but it's not a science. So we're thinking three weeks. There will be some areas that will fill faster. One of the kind of interim solutions is that you load the barges with less grain, less soybean, less corn. And so they'll be lighter and they can float on less water. And I think that's what we're going to be seeing first. Again, that dramatically increases the cost of transportation by moving less cargo with each barge movement. The other thing that's happening is that there are huge storage facilities being developed. And you just got to place the stuff on the ground. Corn can handle storage on the ground. Soybeans are more delicate. So we're going to be seeing and expecting some damage for that cargo. And when you ship damage goods, you get less money for them. So that's another downstream expectation, even once the water fills these rivers. And massive, massive economic implications here. Peter Freeman, great to have you. Thanks so much for joining us. Thanks for having me. Thanks for coming up. Coming up as soon, you'll be able to squirrel away even more money for retirement. And you have inflation to thank for it.

3906,"........ All right. Me too. Yeah. So nice. You're doing great. Yeah. Oh, yeah. Yeah. Yeah. The pandemic's 7.5 million student loan bar was in default in April. The Education Department announced an initiative to get default bar wars in good standing through its fresh start program. The financial crisis is running with more details on this. How is the fresh start program different from what was previously available to bar wars? Previously, bar wars had to have at least 9 on time payments before they could get out of default status. Due to the pandemic and the forbearance pause, those payments of 0 will count towards that 9. It's useful for people who are like, you know, they've been struggling. They couldn't do it. So now you can use those payments to do it. Also, the forbearance, the fresh start program allows people to restore their eligibility for student student aid. And it removes default from the credit history and also the credit alert system for mortgage lenders. It's important to point out that it's not just students who are able to apply for this relief. Many parents who supported those students throughout college are also eligible. What can you tell us about that? So separate from the fresh start program for default borrowers. The Biden student loan for giving this program is available for anybody that has federal student loans. So what we've been seeing, what representative Ayanna Presley and AOC have been talking about, has been parents and grandparents who've been burdened by not only the parent plus loans as they've taken out for their children and grandchildren. But also, they're still carrying their own debt. Many of them couldn't retire. So if they have debt that they still have from their federal student loan, they can apply. If their children took out federal student loans, they can apply. If they took out parent plus loans, they are also eligible for relief. All right, round of the important information there. Thanks so much for filling us in. All right, it's time to review your Medicare benefits beneficiaries. Have until December 7th to make some potentially money saving decision. Joghub Finance is carrying in and joins us now with the details and carry tells. What do we need to know? Oh, yeah, this is now this is good news. One year and I want to start quickly with some good savings coming up for Medicare beneficiaries in the in 2023. The premiums and the deductibles for Medicare part B are coming down, which is excellent news. The co shares on vaccines are going away and the insulin cap is going to come into effect starting at about $35 a month. So this is great news. So good savings ahead. But this is open enrollment season. So what that means is you have until as you mentioned, December 7th to really take a look. If you have a Medicare Advantage program or a part D prescription plan, this is your time to really look.",https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XTJjX90THDQ,90,2022-10-21 20:25:17
3907," December 7th to really take a look. If you have a Medicare Advantage program or a Part D prescription plan, this is your time to really look hard back to the matter. Seven out of 10 people, Kaiser Family Foundation has found don't actually do this, but they're big savings to be had. And here's why every year, every year changes are constantly going on. You'll get a notice you've already had it from your plan provider, which is called the annual notice of change. And it's things like what pharmacies you can go to your deductibles, all of that stuff comes in the out of pocket minimums, all kinds of things get shifted around every single year. And you can find big savings. I mean, even if your pharmacy is no longer in the network, you could end up saving thousands of dollars by simply moving to a pharmacy that is now in your network, but you might not even realize that if you don't do your homework. So it's really important to really pay attention to these changes because it's the time Medicare Advantage plan, there's a lot of great ones out there, but it's important to really know what is changing year to year and where you can get the biggest bang. Indeed, and Carrie, Dave, if people have questions about their options or how to sign up, what should they do? Where they go? Oh, I'm so glad you asked that. You know, interestingly enough, Medicare has one of the best ways to help you do this comparison shopping. They have something called the plan finder right on the website medicare.gov. Check it out because it's everything. It's not just if you go to your insurer. This is actually giving you everything in your area and yet very helpful. They also, you can just call Medicare. They're excellent about getting on the phone with you and helping you out. Medicare Rights Center is also a terrific resource to help you hold your hand a little bit walk you through it. Trust me, this is a head scratcher for a lot of people very confusing, but there's help out there. The other one I really like is the state health insurance assistance programs. It's called ship help dot org. And if you go to ship help dot org, there's free volunteers. It's a free service volunteers all over the country are there to really help you walk you through this comparison shopping and it doesn't have to be super hard. I mean, someone I was interviewing for this story said to me, hey, you know, if you can shop on Amazon, you can really use Medicare's plan finder. It's not that hard. So it's really worth doing. Even I can figure that out. Carry hand and good to see you. Thanks so much. Enjoy the weekend. Alright, high inflation means there are big updates to retirement savings plan contributions. The IRS announcing a record increase in contribution limits to certain retirement plans. Here are the numbers you need to know. Starting next year, you'll be allowed to contribute up to 22,500 into your 401k for 3B. Most 457 plans or the thrift savings plan for federal employees. That's $2,000 more than the current limit of 20,500 for participants who are 50 or older. The catch up contribution for 401ks and other workplace plans will increase by $1,000 to $7,500. That means if you're over 50, you can contribute as much as $30,000 to your 401k next year. Let's move to individual retirement accounts or IRAs IRA contributions will raise increase $6,500 for 2023 of $500 increase. However, the catch up contribution limit stays unchanged at $1,000. In addition, the IRS announced updates to contributions to individual 401ks and income limits for Roth IRAs. All this just one more way inflation is impacting your wallet.

The company posted a further slowdown in sales in its most recent quarter. And it also signaled no growth here going forward when you take a look at snapshairs. Closing the week well in the red, the five day chart there. You can see it off just around 22%. It's the latest sign that advertisers are still cutting back on spending. The disappointing result, dragging some competitors lower today. Meta and Pinterest, both of those stocks, ending the day in the red. You can see Meta off just over 1% Pinterest on the other hand, off a 6.5%. Another big mover of the week is Tesla. Now shares Sank after the company missed on third quarter revenue. And warn that deliveries may fall just short of that 50% annual growth target. Despite that miss, CEO Elon Musk, he of course, remained upbeat on the earnings called telling analysts that Tesla remains, quote, pedal to the metal even as a potential recession. Looms, shares fell about 6% on Thursday. But taking a look at the week to date chart, you can see it up still in the green. Up just around 4.6% selling the week at 2.1444 a share. Now it's rounded out with Netflix. The stock also moving on earnings. But this time, a surprise beat on subscriber growth, ascending the stock's soaring. Now share sword about 13% earlier this week. It's been a top performer in the S&P this coming after the gain of 2.4 million new users during the third quarter. More than double what they had just projected a quarter ago. The streaming giant also giving details on how a plan said crack down on password sharing. Take a look at this five day chart. You can see the shares up 25% selling the week at 289. A 57 on your day basis though, still well in the red with shares off just over 50%. Dave. Great stuff. Shauna, thank you. Here's what we're washing in a very busy earnings period next week. Monday, I want to be quiet on that front. We'll get a glimpse at U.S. manufacturing services PMI. Tuesday, there is where the phone begins with earnings from Coca-Cola, UPS, GM, GE, Jet Blue, Twitter, Alphabet and Chipotle.

Wednesday, earnings from Boeing, Hilton, Metta, Kraft Hines, and Ford as well as new home sales. Thursday, the fun continues. Probably the big one. Apple and Amazon report. So too, will MasterCard McDonald, Southwest Airlines, Merck, Intel, and Caterpillar would get a really good glimpse at the state of the economy on that day. Economic data, including GDP, initial jobless claims, and durable goods orders. And Friday, it's all energy. Exxon and Chevron report earnings. We'll also see Core PCE, University of Michigan, Consumer Sentiment, Index, and pending home sales of very busy week in the economy, Yahoo Finance, all over it. All right, we'll make space on your shelf, a new book out, now called Win Women Lead, what they achieve, why they succeed, how we can learn from them details, the stories of more than 60 female executives and their experiences leading companies. The book's author, Julia Borson, is here along with Yahoo Finance, editor in chief, Andy Sirward. Julia, it's great to have you. Congratulations on the new book, was going through some stats that you said over just 8% of Fortune 500 CEOs, our women drawing in less than 3% of all VC dollars. I know you've talked with people, everyone from Gwen with Palchro, Dijon, Hyman, at Rent the Runway to Smaller Business Owners, but tell us just what you learned about the key characteristics from those women who do in fact succeed. Yes, those women succeed despite the odds. And I was always so curious, how did these women manage not only to grow and scale game-changing companies, but to do so with such little access to capital compared to their male counterparts. And what I found is that women lead in very different ways than the traditional archetypal male leadership. They're more likely to lead with empathy, a communal approach to management. So bringing in perspectives from across an organization rather than just top-down management, and women are more likely to lead with things like vulnerability or gratitude, characteristics which are not traditionally associated with leadership, but in fact can be leadership superpowers. Julia, Andy here, how are you doing? So good to see you, Andy. Good to see you too. I have a question. So there have been a number of books about women and empowerment and leadership, and how do you think you're moving the conversation forward? Well, so, Andy, there are so many books that tell women what to do to succeed. They say, lean in. Here's the confidence code. Here's how to act, but there are very few books that really summarize and share all these amazing examples and stories. And I think what's really necessary is, as a journalist, for me to show, not tell. You are my boss and mentor many years ago, Andy, and you always said, show, don't tell. I think it's really important for women to see these amazing examples and to see these leadership traits in action. So what I do is I tell the stories of dozens of game-changing, odd-stifying leaders, and then I use the research and data to explain what it is they're doing. Okay, here she's leading with something called servant leadership. Servant leadership is an approach that's taken by Howard Schultz, who founded Starbucks, but is something women are more likely to do, and here's why it's effective if done by both men and women. And Julia, what was kind of the most surprising interview that you did or something that just really blew your mind the most? Oh, there were so many interesting stories in here and so many inspiring stories. I can't tell you the number of times in an interview with one of these founders, Brahmit of Tears, because the grit and resilience encourage of these women to defy the odds was so remarkable. But I think sometimes the stories are most surprising are the ones that are right in front of your nose. So how say Whitney Wolfherd? You may have remembered that she was that tender before she founded Bumble, but what was really driving her to try to switch the way online dating works and put women in charge or the fact that Bwyneth Paltrow, she leads with vulnerability. She's maybe one of the biggest movie stars in the world, but she decided to admit what she didn't know and she had to ask for the CEO role of the company that she started herself. So had to put herself in a position of vulnerability to do that. So I think looking at the surprising unexpected angles of characters that you may have seen out in the news, really finding those news stories will surprise you.

3910," is surprising unexpected angles of characters that you may have seen out in the news, really finding those new stories will surprise you. Well, Julia Borsden, congratulations on your new book, author of When Women Lead. Congratulations, we wish you all the best. Thank you. Andy, before we let you go, we want to talk about the column that you just wrote. And you looked into, why ever sessions happen, what causes inflation, what causes economic downturns? And I know a lot of it comes down to supply and demand. What can you tell us? Yeah, well, I mean, it really does come down to that, Shawna, and there's either too much demand or not enough supply. And one of those two things causes prices to rise, economic downturn and a recession. I mean, the typical demand shock would be, say, a stock market crash or 2008, the housing crash, where people didn't have enough money, a lack of demand. A supply shock would be, say, the oil in bargos in the 1970s when there was not enough oil in that tank, the economy. So what do we have here? Well, we have both. And I think it's fair to say that, certainly not in my lifetime, where I have ever seen a case where we got such great imbalances, because you have both huge demand brought about by government stimulus in the United States, where people were buying cars and homes and meme stocks, right? And then the supply problems, which you know about, which are oil, not enough employees, not enough semiconductors. So you put those things together, very complicated. We definitely have both a supply and demand problem right now, which is very vexing for J-PAL for Liz Trusts, right? Leaders having a hard time figuring this out, you guys. Liz Trust, didn't outlive the lettuce. No, it wasn't. What about supply side constraints? We're not all that familiar with. Yeah, I mean, there's a bunch of them. I mean, some of these things are pretty obvious. Like COVID, of course, has caused supply constraints, because number one, of course, it's constricting. The number of people going to work still. And also in China, very much constricting manufacturing there. Ukraine, of course, constricting supply of food, green oil, fertilizer, and those kinds of things. But also you've got things like climate change, which we can get into a little bit. Like for instance, right now, there's going to be a shortage, you guys, of cranberries and prices going up because massive droughts in Massachusetts and the economists are saying, that's because of climate change now, one season. I don't know. I'm not going to get into that. I'm not going down that rabbit hole. But here's another one, for instance. I talked to a guy who runs a waste management company, right? And he said he needs permitting all the time, right? For his business. And he said, because of the great resignation, key personnel in local municipalities, state government, provinces in Canada, federal government, they're not filling these things. It's not because of budget things. It's just there are no people there, so he can't get permits, right? So that's another type of supply constraint. There's just not enough people around to do these kinds of jobs. And Andy, of course, the question that everyone is trying to figure out the answer to is, how do you address the supply shocks and the problems that we're seeing play out in the economy? Well, it's interesting you ask, because the traditional tools of the Fed uses, which is higher rates in the balance sheet, that affects and impacts demand. It doesn't do anything about supply. OK, so some of the things you can do for supply are to reduce tariffs, right? So we need trade flowing around the world. Remember, we also have a trade war with China right now. You guys have been talking about that this afternoon, right? Yeah. And there are other things you can do. For instance, providing relief to debt-ridden nations right now. Other things to do is make sure that the problems of Ukraine aren't hurting Europe. So in other words, providing as much oil and gas as you can to Europe. So there's a number of things like that. And then longer term, climate change people are saying, you know, moving away from oil and gas helps because it's more decentralized, right? So it's not even, it's not the climate change per se. It's just that to get oil, you know, there are certain nations have it, others that don't. So if you can have localized energy. And then supporting local businesses here, like a chip factory in the United States, providing government loans for that versus, you know, waiting for things to come from Asia. So there's, but those are longer term things. It's interesting, which is so used to like flipping a lever at the Federal Reserve for demand. But it's not going to work so well this time around. Yeah, and we're certainly seeing that play out at this time around. Andy Sauer, thanks so much.

And of course you can read Andy's column on Yahoo Finance dot com this week. And all right, coming up next the 2022 World Cup kicks off in less than a month. Up next, one of the most well-known voices in soccer lays out what you'll expect from the tournament, including the controversy. We'll be right back. We'll be right back. And that is the sound of soccer. And in just 30 days, tens of millions of soccer fans around the world will hear that voice. This is the biggest sporting event on the planet returns nearly 3 million tickets have been sold for the Qatar World Cup and nearly 4 billion are expected to watch. Let's welcome in. The legendary Andres Cantor who I call the goal, father, Telemundo de Porteis lead broadcaster want to talk a lot about the cup but give us quickly the story of how that call came to be. Well I grew up in Argentina, they thank you for having me on and I grew up listening to the games in the radio. And radio was big and all the announcers called the goal call the same way I do and I happened to be very lucky to be in the right place at the right time and popularize the game of soccer through my goal call and especially in the 1994 World Cup. So I didn't invent anything, I just popularized it a little bit more. It is passionate and it's probably the most imitated call in all of sports. So we are focused now on the World Cup.",https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XTJjX90THDQ,95,2022-10-21 20:47:07
3912," I just, you know, popularized it a little bit more. It is passionate and it's probably the most imitated call in all of sports. So we're focused now on the World Cup. And much of the attention leading up has been on the venue, being on Qatar, being on the lack of human rights. How concerned are you about this venue? In particular, that we've switched seasons. It's not when we typically expect it. And again, that human rights factor. Obviously, you know, when we go into a major tournament, whether it be the Olympics of the World Cup, you're always worried about something happening, because obviously all eyeballs are there for a month. So obviously, I know there has been a lot of things written about human rights violations and so forth. Tel Amundo is taking the most responsible news team on site. So they will report on anything that they find factual to be reported. And I will get to call the games. Obviously, I will not live in a bubble. So if something happens during a game in the fans or with the players protesting, which I doubt FIFA will let them. But obviously, we will report it as serious as the case may be. And with all the responsibility that we have to our audience. Should human rights be considered when selecting a venue for the biggest sporting event on the planet? And should the seasonality of it? Because it's going to go head-to-head with our football versus your football. Obviously, human rights have to be taking care of on many other things when you select big sporting events like the World Cup, which is the biggest sporting event of them all. I have no doubt. We live in a very crazy world. Where do you take the next? I mean, I know it's coming home in 2026. But people from other sites of the world could point out many things that we don't do right in this country. I'm not obviously saying that. But it's obviously a consideration that major sports organizations have to take when they award the hosting rights to different countries. And in terms of the seasonality, I have to say that I love it that it's going to be played in November and December, because the players will get there with about 21 games under the belt. Usually when the World Cup is in the summer, the big stars play about 65 matches a year. So I mean, that is a lot. They get very tired legs when they have to play the World Cup. And now they will play only 21 games. So hopefully that will make for a better level of play. In this country would help certainly if the United States succeeds. It doesn't look great. They come in with the scoreless draw in the Saudis, a two-zip loss to Japan. What's their ceiling? We will see. I have to say that not only for the US, but all the other ones that are not playing great. I mean, England hasn't had a good run lately. They did not make it to the Final Four in Nation's League, neither France, neither Germany. They're not playing that well. But the World Cup is a different animal. It's seven games to get to the Final. The US has its Final on Game One, which is against Wales. If they get past Wales with three points, then they get to play England on Black Friday on the day after Thanksgiving. And if they can be England, then it's onto the next round, then. I don't know what the ceiling will be. But so I think everyone has to concentrate on the opening match more the US than anybody else. Calendar's interesting. The Final will be a week before Christmas on a Sunday. Are you feeling you live in Miami? Are you feeling soccer reach a new level here and whether that be Ted Lasso or Ryan Reynolds purchase of Rexham or the MLS or the NWSL really growing? Are you feeling? Oh, yes. Yeah. I mean, soccer keeps growing in this country. Now I have no doubt. I mean, just numbers alone. You see what the media companies are paying, what NBC paid to renew the Premier League rights, what Paramount Plus paid for four years of Champions League, $1.5 billion. MLS broke attendance records. Telemundo will break sales records for the woke up in Qatar. The ratings are there. The interest is there.",https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XTJjX90THDQ,96,2022-10-21 20:51:18
3913," dollars. MLS broke attendance records. Tel Avivundo will break sales records were the woke up in Qatar. The ratings are there, the interest is there. At a grassroots level, I don't have to tell you everyone plays on the weekend in the parks, in the little league system, if you will. So I think there's tremendous excitement around this woke up. Lionel Messi has Brazil and France as the favorites, agree, disagree? Sure, whatever he says, I'll agree to. He like a good Argentinian, that's one of Jing's Argentinian's chances. I think Argentina will be up there. Argentina is in the path to play semi-final against Brazil, if all planets align. So I think whoever wins that semi-final will crown itself the champion of the world and on the other side. Francis, I believe, is on this side of the bracket. So if he said France, they have to play Argentina. So I don't think he saw the brackets. So it's going to be Argentina, Brazil on one side and I believe it's going to be either Spain or Germany on the other side. All right, should I try it before we go? Go! Go! There you go. Very good. Very good. Very good. Andre Skade, you have to do it for 64 games. I don't have the passion. I don't have the pipes. You'll hear him on Telemundo and on Peacock during the World Cup. Great to see you, sir. Thank you, Dave. Thank you. I do not have the passion. I was impressed. I was hoping you were going to give it a go. So, could I ask you for that one? You made a good point about now, make no mistake. Not a fan of Qatar hosting a World Cup because of the human rights situation. But Andre Skade made a great point about the size being a real advantage. It was prior in Russia, the largest country in the world by area. Teams traveled three, four, and five thousand miles throughout that World Cup. Now it's in the smallest country we've ever seen, the whole world cup. He thinks it's a huge advantage for the teams. They don't have to travel as much and the fans that are all going to see one another and interact with another. Now that's, of course, if the Qatari government treats them well, which is a big concern. Yeah, and Qatar has been a controversial choice ever since it did win the right to host this World Cup. It's going to be interesting. You touched on it at the timing of it. He was saying that he was a fan of the November December timeline ratings wise, at least here in the U.S. when you brought it up, just going up against the NFL. What that could potentially need for ratings here, you would think it would be a huge challenge. But we will see maybe because of the time difference of the games, it would actually work out okay. But I think there's a lot of hype. It won't dampen the Telemundo audience. That is that is that is that is that is that is that is that is that is that is that is our passionate. Alright, coming up, our business known for its meats, but the company now has a smoked bourbon and just know we had to try it for ourselves to close the week.

3914," Till all the tips you get are useful special! gras Tulomimi Arby's slogan remains we got the meats, but they also got the collaborations inspired by its 13 hour smoked brisket sandwich. Arby's this week teamed up with craft distilled re-brain brew to introduce a limited edition smoked bourbon. Smoke with the same wood used to smoke their meats. The bourbon went on sale Wednesday at arbysmoked bourbon.com. It's sold out immediately. They had a second drop today at noon. Flew off the website in a hurry. Thankfully we did get our hands on some. So I do want Shonda to try it. They comes with a smoker that you ordinarily put over this. So you take a little bourbon, you just pour it over the arby's ice cube, mind you. That's a big point. So you can literally put wood chips in here, light it on fire, and it would smoke the cocktail with the wood chips. It's a really nice tactic. Are you sure you don't want to try it? I don't want to make any fire here in the studio. Yeah, I could see. No, so I want to have you try it and see what you think. Don't worry, it won't taste like arby's meat per se. That's what I was a little bit nervous. It tastes good. I'm not a huge bourbon drinker, but it tastes, I'm going to go back first, I got one. You're going back again, so that can't be all that. It is pretty good, and I think that when we've talked about this time and time again, arby is just so smart, we can share. Arby's just so smart when it comes to their partnerships. This is far from the first time that they have teamed up with a liquor brand or somebody else to try and bring some innovation to their menus, some excitement, and clearly by what you just said, the fact that it's sold out twice, it's working. Flies off the shelves. They had a crinkle cut and curly fry vodka a year ago, and it came with a bloody Mary kit. It like this sold out. What do you think of it? I think it's fantastic. I am a bourbon guy though, unlike yourself. So this is a perfect way to end the week. I'd say it's about an eight and a half. I wish I would have let us lighten. We could have done the whole real smoked. Talk to the boss about that. I know, I guess it was a little bit too risky, but maybe I'll take another, one more sip before I walk out today, but I like it, and I was a little bit skeptical on all this. Alright, well cheers to everyone out there on a wonderful week, and that'll do for us on Yahoo Finance. I make sure to come back Monday at 3 p.m. Eastern Time.

3920," of about two tens of percent. In today here we did see some early waffling out of the gate. Yeah, that's your W to give you that waffling oscillation action. But also the S and P 500, you're seeing that up by about 1% right now, no testing of that flat line. It has just been up in the green off to the races here. Also speaking of off into the races, we are off into the races with Ernie season as of right now. We've got big tech coming out this week. We've also got in the auto's landscape Ford and GM. That's set to come out. Of course Tesla last week we brought that down for you, but taking a look at Ford here on the day. It's up by about two and a half percent to kick off the week. Also taking a look at GM. You're seeing that up by about one and a half percent. So GM, they're going to be reporting on Tuesday Ford that's going to come on Wednesday as well. And so those two companies certainly going to be in focus. GM stumbled out of the gate this morning. Was negative for a moment, but now steadily in positive territory up by about one and a half percent. And then also just taking a look at some of the other auto's here as well. You've got Rivian that's actually down by about three percent this morning. Keep a close eye on our IVN. And then lastly here lucid neo. You're seeing neo down by twenty, seventeen percent. Excuse me. And so we'll keep a close eye on neo as well as we move on throughout the rest of today's streaming session. That's a look at some of those EV names, but let's turn now to energy markets. Energy and crude are a political hand grenade for nearly every country this according to our next guest. OPEX relationship with the US and the US's use of the strategic petroleum reserve is just one of several flashpoints worldwide. With more, we've got Rebecca Babin, who is the senior energy trader over at CIBC, private, wealth, US. All right, help us break this down a little bit more. When you say political hand grenade, what should we expect to play out with regard to this? So that's a great question. I think what we should expect to play out is a lot of volatility going forward, right? We're looking at an escalation of the relationship between OPEX and the US and both parties trying to influence how crude trades, one by cutting production and supporting prices and the other by releasing barrels of the SPR into the market, right? So you have these dueling factions both trying to sway market pricing. This is a big deal because this is a market that traditionally trades on fundamentals, supply and demand. And now you have these two huge players kind of at the other end of the polls trying to influence the market. So that's one thing to expect. I expect that we will see more SPR releases come throughout the winter. Last week's announcement from Biden really was a reiteration of what he's already deployed, which was 180 million barrels in May. He said he's going to do the last 15 million barrels over the next month. There is room however for him to do more as we head into 2023 and I do expect that. On the other side of that equation I think we have OPEX Plus, which is going to continue to cut production and make sure that the market does not feel a lot of downward pressure. Why are they going to do this? Because macro, the macro environment is super challenging right now with cross-currents, Chinese demand as a huge concern, European recession as a huge concern. And they really want to support prices in the near term and not let the bottom fall out of crude as it has done in previous cycles. Then Rebecca, given those, you have OPEX Plus cutting, you have the body administration putting more oil out there on the market, what does that mean for prices? That's a great question. And a lot of that hinges on what happens as we head into the December 5th EU sanctions package and how much Russian crude is disrupted based on those sanctions. So I personally think the market is anticipating about a million barrels of Russian crude to be disrupted due to the increased sanctions and that ultimately the floor under crude is strong enough to hold, but the upside is a little bit more of the unknown. If we lose a million barrels of Russian crude and China demand starts to improve, and I know the data we saw today wasn't really indicative of that, but if it does, you could see a lot more upside. So I think ultimately you have downside kind of to that 70 to 75 range.",https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=x_oQWsK-sM4,2,2022-10-24 14:02:38
3921," of that, but if it does, you could see a lot more upside. So I think ultimately you have downside kind of to that 70 to 75 range and you have upside north of 100. So if you're looking at risk reward, it really feels like at this point we're fairly well balanced, but the upside tail looks a little bit more explosive. However, there are very few investors willing to put that money to work. If we look at positioning that came out over last week, we saw continued cutting of WTI Brent and gasoline products positioning as the market is really afraid of all of these risk and not really feeling comfortable making a bet either way. So I think that's what increases the volatility is the lack of positioning and this really these really outsides tails on either end of the spectrum here. Does China still want to be a purchaser of Russian oil supply? I think they do. So I think that it makes a lot of sense for them and if we just look at their most recent actions, they're increasing their imports of crude even though their demand for crude isn't increasing why? Because they increase their quota for export of product. So they're buying cheaper crude from Russia. They're increasing their refining capacity and they're selling that really expensive product out to the market as we have all talked about refining margins have been really really robust and they're able to turn that profit. It makes sense for them on a multitude of levels. It helps spark internal demand and keep the economy going a little bit. It feels a whole of the product supply that could be disrupted from Russia and they're able to turn a profit. So I do think they're going to continue to want Russian crude. I don't think they're going to be super public about it but I think they'll continue to buy it. Rebecca, we've seen some reports recently that looking at the heating oil market this winter, US consumers, they might see their bills go up anywhere from 20 to 30 percent. Does that sound about right to you? Yeah, it does and it's unfortunate but the reality is our heating oil inventories are very low. I mean the lowest I think that they've ever been. Does it mean that we're going to have run out of inventories? No. It means that we're going to have the potential for spikes particularly in a cold winter and I think it's drawing a lot of concern and that's why we're seeing China's really ramp up their diesel exports because those refining margins are so high for diesel. The US is in this situation because we've cut a lot of our refining capacity. So even though we have a lot of crude coming out of the ground, we don't necessarily have the refiner there to produce it into product to help meet these needs. So unfortunately, yeah, 20 to 25 percent I think is where prices are looking. If we get a mild winter, that could come in but it's really a weather dependent scenario and I think there's a lot of fear baked into that as well. Rebecca, I'm going to ask a question that is absolutely fueled by my own personal aspirations of seeing lower airline prices in the future and where in this environment they're purchasing from the different suppliers and refineries and particularly where that will actually net out for them to see lower fuel costs. We saw it show up in American Airlines earnings that they were paying 97 percent higher for some of their supply and so when will that start to subside for the airlines and their purchasing requirements that they need just to operate their routes? I don't think that subsides in the next six months or even maybe the next year, unfortunately, unless and this will be the sad scenario, we have more restrictive travel policies globally to to COVID but based on where things are right now, if the demand stays worse at and I kind of feel like it might, you don't really see that pullback in jet because again, you need someone to refine all that crude into jet fuel and right now it's more attractive to refine it into diesel because that has the higher refining margin. So you're going to use all your refinery capacity to diesel and then you'll do jet right until the price of jet becomes so expensive that people reconfigure their refiners to sell jet. So the sad answer is probably not for a little while. You might see a modest dip but I don't think you go back to kind of really, really attractive pricing from...",https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=x_oQWsK-sM4,3,2022-10-24 14:06:52
3922," Jet, so the sad answer is probably not for a little while. You might see a modest dip, but I don't think you go back to kind of really, really attractive pricing for at least a year.

Sounds global markets have been watching the situation China closely as President Xi consolidates power and enters an unprecedented third term as leader of the country. The move making many uneasy as US and China relations are already strained. Last week, Yao finances, Enter and Chief Andy Sober sat down with economist Noreal Roubini during the all market summit to discuss the state of US China relations and Andy joins us now. Andy, Dr. Doom always good to catch up with him. Yeah, Dr. Doom, Noreal Roubini saying that we're already in a third cold war with China. So not very good for the sensibility there are the markets. But when you're talking about Xi Jinping consolidating power, Brian, over the last week, it really wasn't a surprise. But I think the particulars surprised people how he did it. I mean, if you saw, for instance, the footage of the former president, Hu Jintao being removed forcibly from those meetings that was really chilling. I mean, look at this stuff. And this is all for show because this didn't have to be done. I mean, what a humiliation for the former president. And you see Xi Jinping just sitting there. Some people were saying that, well, he was Hu Jintao was not well and needed to be removed. But that didn't have to be done publicly like that, I think. There's a number of things going on in China. And I think that the peaceful transition of power in this authoritarian regime has been something that has actually really been kind of remarkable for China since Mao Zedong. And now you've got a situation where instead of two terms is three terms. That's unsettling. A couple of other points you guys that are also unsettling. One, using the zero tolerance COVID policy to turn the country more into a surveillance state. Number one, number two, also reducing corruption and trying to address wealth inequality. But also using that as an opportunity to remove political opponents is something else that Xi Jinping has done. And if you look and see how the markets in China and the Hang saying have responded, that is not a pretty picture in my understanding is that's the worst drop since 2007, 2008. So stand, Druck and Miller was talking the other day. You need to look forward 18 months, 24 months out. What does it look like? This situation is not going to be a great situation, I think, for tech stocks, for Chinese stocks, for companies that have big exposure there. So it's unsettling and unnerving. There's still so much that is unresolved on the tit for attack trade war that took place back during the Trump administration. And so even now, with this move in China, what does that signal for the Biden administration in terms of the broader business component here in rectifying some of those issues that still are unresolved? Well, Brad, it's not like President Biden has reduced those tariffs. And in fact, he's imposed measures that are arguably more harsh when it comes to the tech sector and chips. And you can understand that because when you're talking about surveillance, this is a real risk to the US economy and to the global economy. On the other hand, it's not doing anything to increase trade and kind of leave the attention. And then, of course, hanging out across the horizon there is Taiwan and the situation there. And how that is going to be resolved, that is something that is very much front and center on Xi Jinping's agenda. And how that transpires if and when China ever reclaims that island nation as part of China per se, it's going to be a very, very touchy thing going forward. I'm not telling you guys any, you don't know. But I guess the bottom line is things are not ready to really dispel your needs?",https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=x_oQWsK-sM4,5,2022-10-24 14:15:47

But I guess the bottom line is, things are not really getting better, and what's really interesting, and back to your original point, Brad, is Republican president, Democratic president, continuity, right? Same thing, and so that's tough for relations there. Hey, that footage at the top. Wow, that was just jarring. Yeah, it's shocking. And, you know, again, people are saying, oh, he wasn't well. Well, you know, they could have just said, we're going to take a pause here, turn the camera off. That was when Westerners were there. Chinese media not reporting on that, but the footage is out all over the place. So in other words, the Chinese leadership wanted this footage out there. They didn't want to comment on it. And, you know, look at this. Just, it's just, no, almost no acknowledgement. You know, straight, right? No, look at that body language right there. Yeah. Wow, right, yeah. That's crazy. Unreal. Wow.

3925," the T or the IDFA issue weighing on gaming budgets. And Snap is now also seeing brand budgets moving to the sidelines, which is probably like the macrohead from that death lacking. So your best proxy is probably looking back to 0809, where 2008 was still a fine year for ad agencies and a lot of brands spent and then 09s or a year after, literally met another things hit. You saw like a minus 10% or so hit on top line on these guys. So if I could just snap, I would still say that against, like TikTok and other social media networks, there is a lot of utility on the platform, especially with messaging. There's a lot of first party data that they have. And they're also like if you undermonitize ventures like maps and spotlight, building AR features in an e-commerce environment and so on. And that actually makes a slightly positive on the prospects of Snap if they continue to invest through this recessionary environment. Is there a turnover in favorability of social media platforms? And if so, which ones are slated to continue to win kind of the screen wars and that attention for time, which directly correlates back into where and why advertisers would want to spend their dollars on these platforms? Right. I mean, I guess what you have seen now on Spotlight, on Snap, you could say, you could talk about YouTube shorts, you could talk about Reels on Instagram. All these are kind of me to offering this what TikTok is doing. And the question that we would raise is moving forward maybe a year from now, are we talking about TikTok stealing time away from these properties? Or are we having more utility alongside these other me two offerings that keeps people on the more established social media networks? It's hard to say where user adoption is going to go to. But there's a huge risk for TikTok now, not the other way around. Well, then how does Snap go about restoring investor confidence? Yeah, I mean, as what I had pointed out, it is really kind of like changing this advertiser makes going more into DR, especially e-commerce related offerings. It's an integration with Shopify, the other others like that out there. That's what you have to prove. And you have to start monetizing these ventures where you are not seeing ads right now, especially Spotlight, which will draw some of these TikTok budgets, which will think about also other video budgets coming live with respect to Netflix and Disney+, which will draw a lot of the linear TV budgets over into digital. And they are likely also going to end up in some of these social media networks. All of the social media networks right now are trying to become the shopping mall or at least replace them need for going to physical retail and drive more conversion. Can they successfully fill the void where perhaps that in-person shopping experience can be offset by that virtual shopping experience driven by interest and then actual purchase decisions. And do you see that actual amount of money that's going to be spent on this platform on these platforms improving over the near term as well? Yeah, I mean, I guess it's a few things that need to happen there, right? First, we have to work on friction. Friction between looking at products, buying them, after sales service with respect to messaging integrations and so on. And these platforms are working on that. You see that with click to messaging functionality on WhatsApp, you know, in the meta universe, and we are going to see more of that. The second thing that we need to see is more integration of inventory. So literally everyone of these social media platforms has integrated with Shopify now. There are many more similar offerings like Shopify out there to think about like a WooCommerce, for example, and so on. These need to happen and need to be smooth as well. And you have to think about like combined baskets so that a checkout experience, you know, might work significantly easier than it is today. And then lastly, when you also think about all these ID headwinds that we're having and Apple's ATT is just the beginning, right? You have to think about like SDK runtime on Android. You have to think about cookies disappearing for many of these retailers. Both OmniTanel and smaller DTC brands, it is becoming significantly harder to track from an ad to a conversion if there is not an on-platform checkout functionality embedded into that. So the more we are going towards in that direction of IDs disappearing, the more likely we're going to see adoption of these on-platform.",https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=x_oQWsK-sM4,7,2022-10-24 14:24:23
3926," and bettered into that. So the more we are going towards in that direction of ideas disappearing, the more likely we're going to see adoption of these on-platform functionalities and that should increase the shopping that we're seeing on these platforms. Okay, and so with so much of that focus on shopping, being either prompted by the consumer data that the companies, the social media platforms are looking at, or just by the trends of how many people are just comfortable spending their money through a social media platform, does that mean that there's an authenticity vacuum with legacy social media right now? If everybody's just trying to sell me on something and content creators, I know that they're in partnership with someone who wants to get my dollar at the end of the day, then where do I go to actually just have that valuable connection? Yeah, I mean, if you think about some of the larger retailers out there, right? So name Amazon, name Etsy, name eBay. One of these have an issue that they don't really have any social media connections or offerings on the side. Amazon might be with Twitch, but still small compared to other social media networks. But what all of them have and throw a Shopify in the bucket as well is they have huge audiences and they have huge intent and conversion data. And if that sort of data can be made actionable into these social media environments and that brings us, you know, like also into the discussion of clean rooms and privacy laws and so on, but if that data can be made actionable, then we're not going to be overloaded with shopping related ads and it's going to be likely significantly more targeted than we have seen it so far. Okay, all right. Perhaps just my own sugar in that I inserted there into the conversation and we're gonna take research, senior analysts, the ROCRO Strauss, we appreciate your analysis of all these companies and breaking that down for us this morning. Thanks. Coming up, Big Tech earnings are on tap this week, but what does this mean for ETF investors? We've got that conversation for you next.� Sir, immediately here is a",https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=x_oQWsK-sM4,8,2022-10-24 14:29:14
3927," All eyes are on big tech this week with Apple, Amazon and Meta plus Alpha Bed. All set to report earnings. But how will this impact ETF investors? Let us identify head of research Todd Rosenbluth joins us now to discuss. Okay, so help us break this down. I mean, with regard to some of the ETF trends that we've seen this far, what are inflows looking like into tech sector ETFs? Well, the technology sector has been relatively strong in 2022. We've seen over $6 billion of money go into technology ETFs that's following on with some of the more defensive sectors. So we've seen strong inflows into consumer staples, strong inflows into utilities. Healthcare has actually been the leading sector, whereas consumer discretionary and communication services sectors have seen net outflows. And as we tie into the big tech earnings that you talked about, it really matters what ETF we're talking about and whether how it's classified. Todd, where do you see investors gravitating to more specifically in the tech? Are they still staying clear of anything that owns a social media stock? I think what the real focus for them is understanding what is inside these portfolios. So we mentioned earlier meta and alpha beta reporting results. Those are classified as communication services companies in many of the sector ETFs. So you would find that in XLC, which is the communication services selector spider ETF, but you would not find meta or alpha bet within the technology selector spider, which is XLC or the Vanguard information technology ETF VGT because of those, these sector ETFs are tied to the Gix sector framework and S&P and MSCI classified companies like Apple and Microsoft as technology companies like meta and alpha bet as communication services companies. And so the devil is in the details as to what's inside these portfolios. So with regard to all of these big tech names, it's still going to come down to what their free cash flow looks like and where they're maintaining margins within their businesses. Some of them very much advertising focused or all of their businesses advertising, whereas some of them have a little bit more at play with regard to Amazon there. And so what would you be watching kind of throughout these tech earnings to see where they're maintaining some of those margins? So I think the focus for all of these companies were likely to see the currency headwinds happen. And so these companies are multinational in nature, it's different how their exposure happens to be, but we've had a strong US dollar that is going to weigh down on overall profitability. It just comes down to how profitable they were before the currency impact. And so a company like Apple, which is again in the technology sector and part of VGT or XLK, the demand for iPhone is going to be important. A company like Meta of course that's tied to search, you're going to have different impact search as well as social media, you're going to have a different impact as well. So I'm not an expert on individual companies, but I do think investors are looking to get exposure to these companies through the diversification benefits of an ETF and they need to know what's inside those ETFs. Todd, is anything surprised you this earnings season? I think it's been better than we've seen and expected. I think financials has been relatively strong and you get exposure to financials through the financial select sector, spider ETF and through bank oriented ETFs like the spider S&P bank ETF. I think it's been relatively strong. The bar tends to be set relatively low, heading into earnings season and companies have been exceeding that relatively low bar. But we'll see what happens. And again, ETF investors get the benefits of diversification across the sector as opposed to having to pick an individual winner heading into an after-earning season. Do you expect that any of these companies will either revise downward their guidance or pull guidance? I don't think we're going, I don't have the expertise to be able to dive into individual companies.",https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=x_oQWsK-sM4,9,2022-10-24 14:32:59
3928," are there guidance or pull guidance? I don't think we're going to have the expertise to be able to dive into individual companies, but what tends to happen when companies report results, they tend to beat the expectations and then the guidance takes a look at where we are from an economic perspective. And so the dollars likely to continue to be strong, or likely to see the impact of rising interest rates, impact the overall economy, and recession has been top of mind for many companies. So they're more likely to lower the bar and again, seek to exceed that during earning season, giving investors something else to watch beyond the current forecast, looking further into the future. I wish you were here, Todd, because the big energy is flowing on this desk between me and Brad. We are psyched for app earnings. This is a big, big week of earnings. Always an exciting time for all of us. Vetify head of research, Todd Rosenbluth. Good to see you. We'll talk to you soon. Thank you. All right, midterms are just two weeks away. A new poll finds that the Dems are facing a tough fight in the key swing state of Ohio. Tomorrow, let's bring in our very own senior columnist, Rick Newman. Rick. They're facing a lot of tough fights, and it's looking pretty clear at this point that Republicans are very likely to take back the House. The Senate might be 50-50, but to go to that Senate race in Ohio, that's where Tim Ryan, the current congressman, is facing JD Vance. And I mean, there you see, it's tied. This is interesting, because President Trump won Ohio in 2020 by a considerable margin. So in this race, the Democrat actually is outperforming, but that is not the case in some other states where Nevada, for example, where Democrat incumbents are in real trouble. So it looks like we're going to have divided government after the midterm elections. That is not a bad thing for markets. What it mostly means is that we're just not going to see any significant legislation during the next two years. Okay, so Rick, with all the key races that we have been watching here, I mean, is there going to be any actual legislative agenda changes, any policy headway that gets made post-election? The one thing that's gotten a lot of attention recently is Kevin McCarthy in the House, who would probably be speaker if Republicans take the House. He has indicated that Republicans may not sign off on or easily sign off on the next extension of the federal borrowing limit. That's probably going to come up in mid to late 2023. And that means we could have one of these standoffs that we've seen before where the federal government can't borrow money. It goes right down to the wire. This type of standoff led to the downgrade of U.S. debt all the way back in 2011. So we might get another one of those. Republicans have also suggested they may not easily sign off on funding for military aid to Ukraine. McCarthy said, don't expect a blank check on that. So that's another thing to watch. But for markets, we're not going to have any tax increases. That seems very sure. We're not going to have any big new spending programs. So there is often a rally in the stock market after the midterm elections. And some people are saying maybe that'll be a little bit of something fueling a late year rally this year. Rick, what do you think, look, the political wins are constantly changing day to day. But what do you think is the biggest issue in the minds of voters? Is it still gas prices and heating all costs like we've been talking to yours? It's something like just popped up recently. The federal, the loan changes to the student loan program being blocked. I, you know, I think this is actually shifted. So obviously the Biden administration paid a lot of attention to gas prices during the last four months, let's say, and Biden has been releasing oil from the strategic reserve to get that down. Gas prices are now around $3.80, which I think is okay. I think what has snuck up on Biden has been these other types of inflation. I mean, we've seen food inflation is now 13%. Moody's Analytics has a nice piece of analysis out today saying they think one of the biggest factors in midterm elections is real disposable income. And on that, so that's your income, your paycheck after inflation. And Biden, the Biden economy is doing very poorly on real disposable income, mainly just because inflation is eating away at wage gains. So all of this makes people think.",https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=x_oQWsK-sM4,10,2022-10-24 14:37:22
3929," is doing very poorly on real disposable income. Mainly just because inflation is eating away at wage gains. So all of this makes people feel really unhappy and when they're unhappy, they blame the incumbents. So that is one of the big reasons Biden's Democrats are probably gonna take it on the chin. You look happy, Rick. I'm happy. Brad's happy. So happy. Let's bring on the wake. Brick Newman, thanks so much. Hi, guys. Coming up, vegetarians listen up. A new Beyond Meat item is coming soon. And we'll discuss next. Welcome back to Y'all for Finance Live, everyone. Just over a little bit, just over an hour actually into today's trading session here. And taking a look at the SEP 500, we actually dipped into negative territory here for a hot moment, reverse course, back and positive territory, up by about half a percent right now. The NASDAQ composite, you're also seeing that still in the red as right now, early morning oscillation that we were tracking, but now we're down by about half a percent there. So we'll keep it close to there. And the Dow Jones industrial average, you're seeing that hold on to gains. It's up by about 9 tenths of a percent right now. Some of the other movers that have been keeping close tabs on this morning as well, been watching retail, Amazon, of course, that's going to be reporting earnings later on this week, but also in tandem with that watching Walmart here. It's up by about 1.6%. You're seeing Costco up by about 2.2% here, early in the morning in Target or Tarsier. That's up by about 7 tenths of a percent. But then additionally here, just quickly checking in on some of the pharmacy benefits managers. And here's why the Walgreens Flu Index is actually 10 times higher right now year over year. This comes after the CDC had actually given out warning last week about an elevated level for flu coinciding with the, of course, COVID, the novel coronavirus as well. And so with that going into the next weeks and months of the winter, we're going to be keeping close eye on the virus.",https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=x_oQWsK-sM4,11,2022-10-24 14:42:02
3930," of course COVID, the novel coronavirus as well. And so with that going into the next weeks and months of the winter, we're gonna be keeping a close eye on that. Louisiana, Texas Mississippi seemed to be trending the highest as of right now. We're seeing Walnut Green's boots alliance shares down flat bits of the downside right now on the day. A lot of green though on the screen for the other PBM sauce. Yeah, although supermarkets shut out, it's definitely had me excited about Apple earnings later in the week, Brad. All right, switching gears here. The internal revenue service announced a welcome cost of living adjustment to the US's marginal tax rate that will increase the take home pay for many workers in 2023. Joining us now with more on the latest tax brackets is Blue Ocean and Global Wealth CEO Margarita Cheng. Margarita, good to see you here this morning. So what do these changes mean to the average consumer? So this is actually a positive. Who would have thought inflation is positive, but because inflation has been at the highest level in 40 years what that means is you could find yourself in a lower tax bracket because the IRS has raised the income level so you could be earning the same if not slightly more and still end up in the same tax brackets. Okay, so all right, help me understand this. Like how quickly does this go into effect? I mean, is this just immediate? Sure, I definitely can understand. So I know that we just finished taxes in April. There are some people who filed an extension so they just submitted their 2020 return October 15th and I know we're in 2022 and 2022 is not over but we are planning for 2023. So here's the takeaway. The US tax system is not a flat tax system. It is progressive, it's graduated. So there are, as you can see on the screen, there are seven tax brackets. The lowest is 10%. The highest is 37. So I want people to understand is if you find yourself in the middle 24% tax bracket, that does not mean that you pay 24% on all $364,000. You pay 10% on the first 11, then from 11, then it goes up. So that's what we mean by graduated. So Maya, this does go into effect for 2023 and the reason why it is going into effect is the IRS has made adjustments. I don't need to tell you all that inflation is real and this is based on costs of goods and services for 80,000 items. Okay, and so with all of this in mind, how does this actually impact the real take home wages for people? Does it change anything there? So assuming your income is the same and your income has not gone up, you very well could be in a lower tax brackets. The other takeaway is the IRS has raised the standard deduction. So they have raised the standard deduction for somebody who is single by $900 and they've raised the standard deduction for somebody who's married by $1800. So what that means is you certainly can itemize your deductions, but if your itemized deductions do not exceed the standard deduction, you'd be better off taking the standard deduction. So that's essentially how it can impact everyday individuals and families. Margarit, since these changes have come to light, what are some of the biggest questions you've gotten from your clients? So the first question is, and this was surprising for folks. So what can we do about this? How does this affect me? So the first thing I've told people is you want to visit the IRS tax withholding calculator and just because you don't want to be unpleasantly surprised. So the first thing is check that out and if you do need to adjust your withholding, you want to complete a W4. The other thing that people have asked about is the limits. The IRS has increased the 401K contribution limit by $2,000. So that is a very significant increase. So for individuals under 50, they can now contribute $22,500. They can also contribute $500 more to an IRA or Roth IRA. They can also increase their contribution to a health care flexible spending account. The thing that has been shocking for people who...",https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=x_oQWsK-sM4,12,2022-10-24 14:46:00
3931," They have also increased their contribution to a health care flexible spending account. The thing that has been shocking for people who have young children is the dependent care spending account amount has not been adjusted. It is still at $5,000. So this is how it has impacted individuals and families. All right, our taxes. For retirees as well. There you go. Thank you so much for breaking this down. We have taxes of place that we never want to be unpleasantly surprised at global wealth, blue ocean, global wealth, chief executive officer, Mark and Rita Chang. Rita, thanks so much for taking the time here with us today. Switching gears, everyone. Shares of Beyond Meat. Today, wow. The other down 5 percent after the plant-based meat company announced a new offering beyond steak. Yeah, we'll find out. And this is Brooke DiPolma is here with the details, bro. That's right, Brad, Beyond Meat looking to cook up some excitement here. We're doing the opposite. As you said, shares down nearly 6 percent this morning. Of course, some frozen food comes out today beyond steak. It's seared. It's bite-sized pieces and can be prepared. And what they're saying, either a skillet or an air fryer in just five minutes, of course, this comes as the frozen food section. See a bit of a boom here. This year, $70 billion in sales happened for the frozen food aisle. That's a 31 percent jump since 2019. But if you take your closer look at this offering, they're really looking to expand it to a broad audience from meat lovers, flexitarians alike. It includes 21 grams of protein per serving. They're saying it's low and saturated fat, 0 miligame of cholesterol. But if you look at where it's being offering, really looking to hit across the U.S. today, Beyond Steaks, launching at Crocker, Walmart, Albertsons, and A-hole divisions, of course, that's the name that we may not know exactly, but I've seen, especially here, in New York. That includes stop and shop giant food lion and fresh direct. Of course, this adds to the Beyond Meat portfolio back in 2020. We saw Beyond Meat add meatballs at Costco. We also see that opportunity at Target. But the Beyond Steak yet to be determined if this would be offered there as well, of course, meat saying here that this was a highly anticipated expansion to its beef lineup, which now includes burgers, beef, sausage, and meatballs. But yet to be determined, just how excited Main Street is and Wall Street this morning, like I said before, down nearly 6% shares of Beyond Meat. So not drumming up too much excitement here. Now, Brooke, yeah, 21 grams of protein call definitely important for folks, such as myself and our former Fed course, Bonner, Brian Chung. But look, Beyond Meat just had a lot of layoffs. How do they launch a product like this? Yeah, that's a great question. Of course, last week, the brand's announced it's set to cut 19% of its global workforce. Of course, that included their chief operating officer Doug Ramsey, who is a rest day in late September for allegedly biting a man's nose at an Arkansas football game. In addition to that, if you take a look year to date one year ago, right here, it is down 87%. Now, year to date down 80%. And if you take a look back to their IPO in 2019, it is down 81%. Now, in addition to that, dealing with a lot of other noise out there in October 18th, Beyond Meat and Plant-based Food Maker, Don Lee settled to dispute over previous partnership. Both sides are satisfied with the outcome according to court filings. But Beyond Meat really looking to push forward, looking to come out with these innovations, hoping to grab consumers attention. Of course, here, they're keep on pushing on, I guess you could say here, calling it once again, a highly anticipated expansion, really looking to continue to enthuse and excite consumers about these new offerings. Work while we have you with all of the expansions that they've been making, they had been investing so much into taking the operations under their own helm, not licensing or renting space at other manufacturing practices in at least areas. And so with that in mind, investors have had to price in how much they're spending of their own money just to make sure that they can bring more of that operation in houses. Is it clear how they're doing in terms of producing all of these new menu items? Yeah, that's a great question. Well, what we can relate that to is the test that they did with McDonald's in hopes to launch that McPlan and while it launched in the UK and Ireland overseas, it's really, you know, TBD on what exactly...",https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=x_oQWsK-sM4,13,2022-10-24 14:50:24
3932," with McDonald's in hopes to launch that McPlan. And while it launched in the UK and Ireland overseas, it's really, you know, TBD on what exactly that will look like, what exactly we might see that nationwide here in the US. So investors really standing by and waiting to see if all these major investments that they're putting out are seeing a return on that share price. Yeah, we'll find it's on Brook to Palmo with a breakdown on Beyond Meet this morning. We appreciate it, I appreciate it, Brook, not Beyond. It's Monday, it is Monday, let's Monday. Ryan Brad Brook, it's the eye. I know we are bullish on BR's around here at Yahoo Finance. Thanks so much, Brook, appreciate it. Come and grab everyone Walmart, relaunching and renaming. It's Sleepwear brand. We've got the details next. Slapah, the base. It's time for Cut for Time, three stories, one minute each. We start with this today. Walmart is reinventing its intimits and sleepwear line, replacing the billion dollar brand secret treasures with the more modern and contemporary style brand, Joy Spun. I don't know. I just take me back to what Walmart did. This was 10 or 15 years ago, almost an analyst. They made it to a big push into more high-end fashion and their parallel is a complete flop. I'm going to be very fascinating to see how a brand like this does inside of Walmart, which really for the past 10 years, since that really dreadful push into fashion has just been focused on very affordable cheap basics. I don't know the prices on these, but this looks a little bit more fashionable than I think Walmart is known for. Tell about the homegrown brands. I mean, Walmart, of course, has some big partners on the apparel front that has allowed them to move into, of course, all of these storefront locations brick and mortar that Walmart dominates in. But then it comes down to, all right, where's Walmart also growing up their own brands.",https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=x_oQWsK-sM4,14,2022-10-24 14:54:54
3933," of them to move into, you know, of course, all of these storefront locations brick and mortar that Walmart dominates in, but then it comes down to, all right, where is Walmart also growing up their own brands? Walmart doing this target or tarjet doing that. Amazon also doing this too. Amazon has what, 12 of its own homegrown lines. And so it's really just that ease of knowing you're in the store to perhaps get some of your eggs there and instead, you know what, I'll get the intimates from there. Not going, and money geek finding that burger combos are 9% more expensive than last year, the three most expensive cities to order a burger meal in our San Francisco launch at Los Angeles in New York. And Brad, I'm not surprised by this. I believe about a month ago, I ordered myself two breakfast sandwiches from McDonald's. Now I get double leg, I get double meat. I pay $28 and I didn't even get a drink. $28 along Island, New York for two. Again, not the standard order, but I go into McDonald's, I have a touch screen, I customize everything. I mean, it was $28 for two sandwiches. You what? I know. I had to do a double take. I was just absolutely shocked. Wait, why didn't you? They were good. You didn't select a combo? No, I just, I like building my own sandwich because I need the double leg, I need the double meat, like I'm hungry. I'm really hungry. I mean, I get that, but you got to make sure you're getting this. I know. Drinked. I'm not surprised. Look at these combo meals. You walk into a lot of these restaurants now. I mean, they are no longer common meals were started to essentially save people money. Now, look at this. Are you kidding me? But when you look at the history of when some of these combo meals originated to, it was during economic downturns. There are these pullbacks in some of the consumer discretionary categories too, trying to make more of a value-pushing value play. All right, guys, let's talk about my beloved Philadelphia Phillies here. Today, the latest recession indicator could be the Philadelphia Phillies winning the World Series. Every Phillies World Series win or I should say Philadelphia baseball team win in the last 100 years has been followed by an economic downturn. It was the Philadelphia Athletics that kind of kicked that off. They were seeing there in 1929 and then later on, the Phillies 1980. I remember 2008 and the Pandemonium that just absolutely ensued after the Philadelphia has won the World Series. It was a great time, but not so much economically at least. I want to support everything, I always want to support you, but I can't root for the Phillies. I can't root for the Phillies because they just boo everybody. What was it, Jill Biden, the first lady two weeks ago at the Eagles game? She got booed, they've booed Santa Claus. How am I can't put my support behind the Phillies? That's not specific. Even though the Astros, even the Astros just demolished my Yankees and they, you know, someone would say they are more cheaters. They are cheaters. But, I mean, Philly, you can't boo the first lady and Santa Claus? We boo everybody. Santa Claus. We boo everybody. That's mascot. We got Gritty and we got the Philadelphia man. That's Gritty. Yeah, and for a while we had a bunny rabbit as the Sixers mascot as well, hip hop. And so with all of this in mind, I mean, look, we're a fandom that's known to fight our own athletes in parking lot. I understand. I'm a Polish dancer. All right, coming up, Kiko Fajida and Ajali Kamani will speak to see a quest. Diagnostics, you won't want to miss it again.

First, let's check in on the market action, though. We are 90 minutes into the trading day right now. A bit of a split picture, obviously. The NASDAQ going to be the big focus of the week with those big tech earnings on tap. It is down about 26 points right now. The Dow, up 256 points, though. And the S&P 500 up 20. We're also watching the bonnills closely here. We've talking about a bit of a pull back last week on potentially a Fed pivot up. We are seeing those yields back up today. Take a look at the 10 year yield that 428, the 30 year yield now well above 4.4%. We are beginning this hour, though, with all eyes on China. President Xi Jinping officially securing a third term on Sunday, making him the most powerful leader since Mao Zedong. Xi consolidating power by packing the Politburo standing committee with the most loyal to him. China's third quarter GDP data delayed by a week came in above estimates with growth at 3.9% in year over year. But a robust recovery remains elusive as China faces challenges, such as persistent COVID-19 curves and global recession risks. We should point out that that stocks lower in greater China on investor fears of Xi's new term, favoring ideology driven policies over growth. The Hang Seng and Hong Kong captains were state since the financial crisis in 2008. And the Shanghai Comp also down about 2% there. Major Chinese tech names also falling into the red on concerns about Xi's embrace of state-owned firms versus private companies. We've got a panel for you to break it all down for us. We've got China-Bajibok co-founder and CEO, Lila Miller, alongside Keith Krack, his chairman of the Krack Institute for Tech Diplomacy at Purdue. And gentlemen, it's great to have both of you on today. Lila, let me just start with you on the reaction that we got overnight in the Asia session here. It certainly looks like it.",https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=x_oQWsK-sM4,16,2022-10-24 15:03:42
3935," see at Purdue and gentlemen, this great to have both of you on today. Leland, let me just start with you on the reaction that we got overnight in the Asia session here. Certainly, it looks like investors not feeling very comfortable with which direction China is now heading in with she securing his third term. What do you make of this sell off? Well, it's not altogether clear whether whether markets believe China's economic data this time around, but what's pretty clear is that nobody was very happy with the way that she packed the new leadership with loyalists. I think there was always a desire to see somebody who symbolized more market openings, disagreements in the top leadership, some sort of wholesome pushback against COVID-0. Look, you can read Tee Leaves a million different ways here, but when you look at who he put up next to him, it looks like it's going to be the she-show with very little pushback against him. I think that worries people who have watched the crackdowns of the last two years. Leland, just to follow up there, I mean, this did seem very much like a focus more on sort of national security, not necessarily on economic policy. And I know we don't come to expect that at the party congress, but we're still looking at a growth rate here, well above that 5.5 percent target that was initially set out for the year. What does that tell you about where the economic priorities are for the third term for this president? I just think the economic priorities have completely changed from this time around. We've been taught as China watchers to see the party as prioritizing growth above all. And that has been true for the last 5, 10, 15 years. It is not true anymore. The China we're looking at right now, led by Xi Jinping, is one focused more on security, it's focused more on restructuring the economy. So there's fewer vulnerabilities for the party in terms of reckless credit expansion in the property sector, shadow, finance out of control. They want to take control of the economy, reroute the economic growth model. And to do that, they have to materially slow down the economy, stop pumping credit in. So things are changing dramatically. They're not forgetting about the economy, but the Chinese economic growth model, as we know, it is over. And they're shifting to a more realistic stance. Keith, certainly from the US perspective, a lot to watch here in terms of the language that came out of the party congress. One thing, certainly those in Washington watching here, the changing in terms of the language with the party's constitution here, specifically on Taiwan, using the word strengthened fighting spirit and ability deterring any kind of separatists, or saying that they are, in fact, still moving in the direction of reunification. Why don't you take away from this party congress in terms of the timeline China is now thinking about in terms of reunification? Well, I don't think there's any doubt, Keiko, that she is committed to that. She is not only the most powerful dictator since Mao, but he's probably the most powerful dictator in the world since Hitler. And he's probably even more dangerous. So I think a question for your viewers is not just what's the data, what's the analysis. Leland is one of the great experts of the world on that. The question is, we know what's happening. There's no limit to his ambitions. So the question is, in terms of business boardrooms, what are you going to do about it? And what are the moral responsibilities? What are the fiduciary duties that shareholders have to mitigate risk with these board members have to mitigate that risk for their shareholders? And I've spent a lot of time with the corporate boards out here in Silicon Valley. And all of these folks are putting together China contingency plans because they see the crackdown on the private sector. They see the draconian COVID lockdowns and they see no limit to his ambition for power. To what extent have those risks been elevated because of that consolidation of power that we saw over the weekend? When you said that you're talking to companies and their boards, what do those contingency plans now look like? Well, they cover a number of things. First of all, they cover supply chains because if there's any bottlenecks there, they all saw that.",https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=x_oQWsK-sM4,17,2022-10-24 15:07:41
3936," Well, they cover a number of things. First of all, they cover supply chains. Because if there's any bottlenecks there, they all saw that during COVID. So that was a wake up call. The other big wake up call was when cheese totalitarian twin, put invaded Russia and 300 companies had to come out. They lost hundreds of billions. The China problems 10 to 20 time X that. So if there's a conflict in Taiwan, it's not only disastrous for the business community. It's catastrophic for the tech business because of Taiwan's lock on on semi conduct. They also see the risk of cheap nationalizing firms, nationalizing, not being able to get their their money out of there. But the also big question now that's popping up, Akeko is these crimes against humanity. They're committing in places like Xinjiang, United States and several other countries have labeled that genocide. So there's a real moral issue because they export that slave labor all throughout China. And we have already seen legislation here in the U.S. to crack down on some of that. Leila, last question to you. You know, as you know, these party congresses are very closely orchestrated. Every single detail is really, doesn't go without a hitch. And yet we saw what was kind of an awkward moment here where we saw the former president, Hujin Tao, being escorted out. He's sitting right next to Xi Jinping there. It appeared at least that he didn't want to go. And there's been a lot being made of that. What exactly was the message Xi Jinping was trying to send if it was, in fact, that? What was your read on that moment that we saw over the weekend? You know, it's hard to know for sure. We know that it was a pretty big humiliation for who. But are we absolutely sure this is part of a public urge of the Communist Youth League faction, which barely exists anymore? That's not clear at all. Whose son was in the room? He's in the Polo Bureau. So I guess if we track his career over the coming months, we'll be able to get indications of whether this is something that was specific against who or was some other dynamic. But very weird, was such a choreographed event. It is weird to have a spectacle like that that left people talking all weekend. So we're going to just have to watch the politics in the next couple of months to see what this was all about. OK, I appreciate you both joining us today, China-Bajibok, co-founder and CEO, Lila Miller, along with Keith Krock, he's chairman of the Krock Institute for Tecta Polmese at Purdue. Well, turning now, looking ahead at the week ahead for markets, we have Yahoo finances and as for here to break it all down. And as a force we're talking about, the big tech names reporting here, Meta, Amazon, Microsoft, Apple, you name it. Yeah, it's the Super Bowl of earnings really when you're talking about these big tech names. And as you just mentioned, these are the big mega caps that will be reporting earnings this week. And what's will be interesting to watch is Apple, Microsoft, Tuesday, Alphabet, Amazon on Thursday, Meta on Wednesday. But look, these companies, they're outsized, waiting in the S&P 500 is significant. Earnings per share are expected to fall year over year. But really the ones to watch for it, in my opinion, are Apple, Microsoft, Alphabet and Amazon. Because Meta, you could say, has already gotten whacked and part of that has to do with advertising part it has to do with also Meta's strategy pivoting towards the Metaverse, which it announced earlier this year. But really, it will be interesting to watch Apple, what Apple says about China, what the advertising looks like when it comes to Meta, when it comes to Alphabet. And YouTube, for example. And then most importantly, also, is any talk of FX. For an exchange and how the currencies have been impacting revenue for these companies, for these companies that produce services. And also, they sell their products abroad. Amazon, 30% of its e-commerce comes from the international market. So it'll be interesting to watch to see how the strong dollar is impacting their performance. And it'll be interesting to see if they talk about constant currency, which is basically where they strip out that volatility. Also, to watch out for for this week, preliminary reading of GDP. So for the third quarter, that's expected to come in at 2.3% after the first and second quarter.",https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=x_oQWsK-sM4,18,2022-10-24 15:12:00
3937," fertility. Also to watch out for for this week, preliminary reading of GDP. So for the third quarter, that's expected to come in at 2.3 percent after the first and second quarter were contractions. So it'll be interesting to watch. Yeah, you mentioned FX, certainly something that we've heard from so many companies. It's also going to be interesting to hear what Apple has to say about this latest regulation coming down from the Biden administration on semiconductors because they've already frozen the use of YMTC chips, one of those Chinese makers that are now basically, you know, sort of their band from selling to that. It'll be interesting if they talk about that, if they have any commentary on that, and also, of course, their iPhone demand and China supply chain. I mean, there's so much to talk about when we talk about Apple because it really is one of the bellweathers of the economy. Okay, a big week ahead and that's thanks so much for that. Well, let's take a look at Tesla shares right now, sliding after the EV maker slash the price of its Model 3 and Model Y vehicles in China. The stock is down nearly 5% in the session. This coming after must comments during last week's Tesla earnings call saying there are elements of a recession in China. Let's bring in Yahoo finances, pros, supermanian, pros. This has a lot of people saying, look, is he trying to start price war essentially in the EV market or the biggest EV market? Yeah, I mean, I think you see the Model 3 coming down by 5% Model Y base level by almost 9%. So there is concern there that demand is slowing Musk, as he said, is much on the call. It's that is related to the property market, but that sort of trickles on everywhere. So analysts are thinking that this could actually boost demand, but also could also lead to a price war. Other competitors like Leado, X-Pung, among others, could follow suit and they could actually do that with their pricing strategy. So I'm not surprised to see that. Also want to note that Electric has seen that Tesla is restarting the referral program. So if you buy a car through me through a referral link, you can actually get rewards points for stuff like free supercharging. You also have raffles to get a bulk buckle and free use of a car for you. So they're trying to like just basically try to get that demand back up there in China. You know, they had a record quarter of September, 80,000 sales or so, but I guess that's still not enough when you have like the Shanghai Gigafactory kind of increasing output and lead times coming down. So there needs to be a way to kind of get those cars out the door. What does that mean in terms of the revenue coming out of China if they have to lower the prices? I would imagine that would revenue be okay. I think revenue would be okay. This margin will begin impacted. If they're making more than 80,000 cars a month out of China, that's a serious demand. Maybe they'll start exporting more to other places like Europe, but for now in the Chinese local market, it seems like demand slowing down, competition heating up, B-Y-D, 200,000 cars sold last month. So that's a big part of that whole equation. Yeah, B-Y-D giving them big competition in China. Thanks so much for that, Frost. Well, shares of Meta are falling ahead of its quarterly results after Bank of America downgrade, the stock from buy to neutral. It is often the lows of the session still down about half a percent here. Analysts also lower the stock's price target from 196 to a share to $150, citing concerns about a decline in online ad spending. The B-Y-D now expects that to accelerate next year, with revenue growing at just 4 percent year on year, that's half of what the street is expecting. Analysts also saying that they are, in their words, incrementally more cautious on this content shift that we're seeing on Facebook and Instagram to reels this coming after those very disappointing snappers all last week. Well, coming up on the other side, we are staying with the taxoria's big tech reports allume. We're talking about Amazon, Apple and Meta all showing their hands in the coming days. How much of an issue is over investment in this struggling ad market in the hawkish bed? We're going to dive into all of those issues on the other side.",https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=x_oQWsK-sM4,19,2022-10-24 15:16:28
3938,"<|cs|><|translate|> WITH NO Well, it is shaping up to be a big week for the broader tech story with the likes of Apple, Amazon and Metta all reporting in the coming days. Until now, a big revenue miss for Snap and signs of a dire online ad market has been the major warning sign for the space. The NASEC has plummeted over 30% since the start of the year outpacing declines for the S&P. The sector has also been contending with what my next guest calls a COVID hangover because of tech over investment. Let's bring in Erica Klauer, a Jamison associate tech equity portfolio manager, a lot to get through to this week. But let's start by looking back to what happened last week. We saw the huge sell-off coming on the back of Snap that has accelerated concerns about a decline in online ad spend. How much of that are we going to see reflected, especially in Metta and Elphabet? Well, we talked a little bit about the fact that a lot of the advertising at SnapChat has basically been a result of share loss. I think relative share gainers will be companies like Google, like Facebook. Nevertheless, there is a lot more pressure in terms of justifying the price of advertising online that I think will persist throughout 2023. And so when you look at somebody like Elphabet, what we have learned, at least from the past few quarters, is that they are a little more diversified when it comes to this online ad spending. So obviously, it's not like Snap, or we're just talking about one particular app, you know, a specific market. Does that shield Elphabet for some of the headwinds that we've been seeing in a company like Snap? I think you're absolutely right. Google is much more diversified than a Snapchat is. And Samsung goes for Facebook as well. What about Amazon? They have made making a lot of big in roads, especially in the advertising space. That's right. I think Amazon has done a very, very good job with its advertising assets. And I expect that that division will continue to outperform and gain share. So how do you think investors should be looking at that? We'll sort of break down Apple separately, obviously, that there's a lot to get into there. But when you talk specifically about the stocks that are really affected by digital ads, and we're seeing a pullback in general, who's best positioned? Who do you stay away from? Well, I think overall spending will be somewhat pressured because there is a need right now to really look at all costs amongst all enterprises. Okay.",https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=x_oQWsK-sM4,20,2022-10-24 15:21:16
3939," Well, I think overall spending will be somewhat pressured because there is a need right now to really look at all costs amongst all enterprises. There is rampant inflation with regards to labor costs and also input costs. So clearly, people are going to be scrutinizing their advertising budgets more than ever. However, in that context, the companies that are really executing and gaining share would include Amazon, Google and Facebook. Let's talk about Apple. There's the obvious, numbers that we look for in terms of where their demand is on iPhones, how they're expanding in services. But there's a larger story that I think a lot of investors are looking at that puts Apple right in the middle. And that is supply chain movements. We were just talking about China and the concerns that persist around there. Apple has a big presence. They've been trying to move production into India away from China. And then there's this big tech controls crackdown that the Biden administration has put forward that does affect Apple and where they source their chips. Well, if we take a giant step back, what we're looking at this week is a cumulative 7 trillion amount and market value of companies reporting this week amongst the big tech players. The advertising companies are in one bucket and then of course, they're the hardware and software companies in the other bucket, including the likes of Apple. And what I would say about Apple is that the company is executing extremely well. But it is not immune to the the trends that you just mentioned. It took decades to basically consolidate all of their manufacturing in lower cost regions. That's being undone right now as the supply chain is being diversified. So ultimately, that is inflationary in its nature. And at the same time, we have a much more difficult demand environment where many people bought their smartphones. They bought their personal computers during COVID. So there's not that dramatic need that we've seen over the last three years to upgrade or even to attract the first time buyer. We can talk about the shift in where manufacturing is happening, where you source your supplies. What does that specifically mean in terms of inflationary? Are we looking at higher prices down the road? Is it going to be cushioned by the company just given the cash pile that they have? How do you see that being reflected in the coming quarters? Well, there are companies that are just masters of their supply chain. Apple would be the poster child for that. However, I think that when one is thinking about duplicate efforts to ensure no disruption to supply chain, that inherently means higher costs. And so the company will have to really assert its pricing power in order to offset those higher costs. I think that's going to be a story over the next couple of years. Still the strongest name, though, in the big tech space? Absolutely. I think Apple is showing very strong gains in market share. Even now with its dominant position, it's still outpacing its peers in terms of adoption. Eric, apply our Genescent Associates Technology Equity Portfolio Manager. It's good to talk to you today. Appreciate your time. Thank you. Well, one of the thories of 2022, not been only the hawkish bed and the occasional market meltdowns, but the lack of safe havens investors thought they could lean on. That's certainly the case with Bitcoin, which has spent much of the year following stocks. Bank of America's latest crypto note offers some help for Haven status, however, suggesting the possibility of price divergence, our chart of the day specifically takes a closer look at the Bitcoin gold correlation. Something we've talked about before. It chose a negative trend from March 2nd before eventually turning positive on September 5th. And it's been staying there as ever with Bitcoin. Things change quickly. So we're going to continue to watch the space. Well, coming up, diagnosing the future for class, we speak without going CEO Steve Ruskowski on a decade in the role of a record sending 2021.

3940," Naive Welcome back to Yahoo Finance Live. I'm going to be talking about a few hours into the trading week. I've been in the split picture emerging, although positive with the Dow, trying to build on those gains that we saw from last week, up about 260 points, the S&P 500 up 20, and then as I act, the only one that's down in the red, although slightly, of course, earnings, a big focus this week in terms of sectors that we're watching right now. Health care, one of the biggest gainers on the day. And of course, we're going to be talking about all those big tech earnings on tap this week. I'm going to be talking about my colleague, Anjali Kamlani, who is joined by a special guest, Anjali. That's right, if you go, thank you so much. We are joined now by the CEO of Questagnostic, Steve Rikskowski, really a legendary individual in the health care space. Over the last 10 years, at the helm of one of the most important health care companies. Steve, thank you so much for joining here us here today. Thanks for having me. I want to stir off with obviously the pandemic, one of the most unprecedented situations that any CEO has had to contend with. You, of course, seeing that demand on testing like never before. Tell us about it and how you got through it. Yeah, so it's been a busy two and a half years, Anjali. We started in the fall, excuse me on the spring of 2020, when we first realized that this pandemic would be here and, and really sink its teeth into us. And so in March of 2020, we actually first started to bring up our testing. And then we brought it up, not just in one laboratory, but throughout our whole system of laboratories. And we thought it would be capped within the year, but it extended itself into 21 and we continue to have substantial testing this year as well. So fortunately for us, we've responded to what we need to do from a testing perspective. And we're continuing to advance the science to provide serology test in other ways for us to start to understand.",https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=x_oQWsK-sM4,22,2022-10-24 15:29:38
3941," and do from a testing perspective. And we're continuing to advance the science to provide serology testing in other ways for us to start to understand where people are in their protection for COVID going forward. Yeah, I wanna talk about that continuation. Do you feel like the company's at a place now where you can really continue to scale up and scale down as needed considering the fact that we might be facing future pandemics? Yes, we have now about 300,000 test capacity per day. We've been at a fraction of that for the last several weeks. We actually have seen the testing volume for what's referred to as PCR, the central lab testing capability for COVID come down. But we're prepared in the event that it starts to ramp up. They'll be able to bring on more tests. So we're not closing down that capacity, but we're preparing the event that it comes back out. Here, now I'm looking at the look back at the company 10 years now at the helm, talking about what the industry has been through. I mean, it's been really a push into consumer driven healthcare decisions. We're talking about a virtual care really on the horizon. So talk to me about how you've seen those changes and where you see a quest role in all of that. Yeah, it's been a remarkable decade. If you think about it, we put it place the Affordable Care Act. We've had substantial cuts in how we get paid by Medicare in this industry. And then finally, as we just spoke, we just came through the pandemic. And so it's been in three big changes within healthcare delivery. But through all that change, we've also seen emergence where when I joined 10 years ago, we said we're much more than a lab. What we do is empower better health with that inside we deliver every day for physicians and increasingly for consumers. And we also believe that the consumer is now playing a much bigger role in their healthcare. And so we brought up a capability a number of years ago to offer testing capability to consumers where they can go on and directly engage with quest diagnostics against the test they need. One of the other major milestones of the industry really went through was with Theranosaga and everything that came after the questions about testing. What do you think has been the biggest learning from that episode? And do you think that the industry's in a different place today? Yeah, you think about what that dialogue brought to this industry. It was a dialogue around the importance of testing. The reality is we're about 2% of the healthcare costs in this country. Well, we represent around 75% of the information but a clinician, a physician, a nurse, and an individual used to make the important next choice in healthcare. So very important portion of that information that's needed every day. And then secondly, what that period of time showed us is that we can test consumers in a much simpler working meaning way. And at quest diagnostics, we actually have brought up our patient service centers and we have around 2,200 of those. And many of those are now in retail-like settings. And we've actually started to partner, where retail partners like Walmart, where we have some of our patient service centers in their actual stores. And so the convenience of getting access to testing and the ability for you to directly order it has been a new capability. All that came out of that dialogue around the importance of testing and the need for it to be much more available to consumers. Another big issue in the healthcare industry today still is costs. I know that you've seen the conversation over the past several years. And you know right now the company's also doing something interesting when it comes to helping to balance out the cost of access to healthcare. Yes, we have actually a number of years ago, we said we need to do something about our healthcare cost for employees. We sell, I'm sure, about 60,000 people at Quest Diagnostic. So what we did is we put in place a different approach of managing our healthcare costs. We heard a physician with healthcare insurance background and we started step by step to see what we could do ourselves to bend the cost curve.",https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=x_oQWsK-sM4,23,2022-10-24 15:33:43
3942," and inching our health care costs, we heard a physician with health care insurance background, and we started step by step see what we could do ourselves to bend the cost curve. And fortunately, I'm pleased to tell you that we did bend the cost curve. And actually this year, what we just introduced in the fall, for 95% of our employees, there'll be no increase in their payment for their health care. For 5% of those employees, there will be a fee increase. And that's primarily for the highest paid people at Quest Agnostics. So real good progress of bending the cost curve for our own employees. And definitely a push into health equity. I've got to end with just a look back and everything that you've achieved and before Quest also working at Phillips, so you've really been in the health care industry for quite some time. What's next? Well, you know, I've got a long bucket list through my personal life, I've got four great grandchildren, two kids and a lovely wife. And so we're gonna spend more time personally. Well, professionally, I'll do something. I'm still thinking my way through that. I'm still actively managing Quest Agnostics as a CEO. I'll stay as the executive chair to the end of March of 23. And then we'll head to the next chapter of my life. Sounds good. Well, we'll have to leave it there. And hopefully this isn't the last we see of you. Quest Agnostics CEO, Steve Vrskowski. Thank you again for joining us today. All right, now thanks to Angelie as well for bringing us that interview. Well, coming up the revolving door, the UK gets its third Prime Minister in seven weeks as Rishi Sunack prepares to step into 10 Downing Street, strolling in UK bond like the sound of stability, but we'll come to the expect from the former chancellor. We'll discuss next. 뭔가 seis-erroringוהmone Danielle,",https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=x_oQWsK-sM4,24,2022-10-24 15:38:41
3943," Well, taking a look now at British bonds, a three-year guilt rising alongside the sterling, as Rishi Sunak has said to become the next British Prime Minister. Sunak will become the first person of color to take up residence at number 10, with markets cheering expectations of less volatility. Yahoo, finances, Jared Blachery here to break it down. Less volatility, but the bar's pretty low, Jared. Hey, after the last seven weeks, six weeks. I don't think we should be slapping each other on the backs just yet, because we still have a lot of central bank actions to go. We're going to get to the BOJ in a second. We've got a big meeting this week, but let's take a look at the Wi-Fi interactive, where I am looking at the British Pound versus US dollars. Up means stronger pound, down means stronger dollar. This is a pretty ho hum day here. Now, a lot of this news, I think a lot of the news that was moved the market last week was really the resignation of trust. That has been largely priced in, but let me show you a year-to-date picture of the British Pound versus US dollar down 16%. Now, when I put some candlesticks, you can see the volatile price action probing these lower levels almost back to, I would say, back to parity, but I don't think it's ever been there. So that would be a first. Now, you take a look at what's happened with some of their markets like the footsie. That has been under pressure as well, but the bottom line is that the local markets, that is the pension system, will be ring-fenced by the local central bank, which happens to be the bank of England over there. That is going to happen. It's going to be local's first, and I think that policy is going to pervade around the world. These central bankers meet quite frequently. However, we obviously have different goals. Let's talk about Japan. We've always been following the Yen. We were just talking on Friday about a potential intervention. It came out after that they, they, they, they, BOJ did, in fact, intervene. The levels are not at where they were on Friday, but they're not that much higher. That's right. And we can see that it's on the Wi-Fi interactive again here. Now, this is a three-month view of the US dollar versus the Yen. So, higher prices here mean a stronger US dollar and weaker Yen. So, there is this big, outsized candle. These don't look like huge moves, but in currency worlds, these are huge, huge moves. And we saw this volatility get above 150 for the first time. And I don't know how many decades here. We saw a decline here based on the intervention. That is the Japanese authorities. We don't have official confirmation, but it was released by N.K. that they had intervened in the market. And they were likely doing this by selling US treasuries. All of this relates to the US market because if you're selling US treasuries, guess what? The 30 year in the US? Well, that is up to 2007 highs right now. And it's a feedback back loop. It's a vicious feedback loop that actually strengthens the US dollar. So, in the long run. So, my point is, without further intervention this week and the market is already discounting this, probably going to end up back at square one. So, back up to above 150. Yes. Yentervention. Is that what we're calling it? I'm just reading this from other sources. I thought it was pretty catchy. Yeah. Yen intervention. Yentervention. All right, thanks for that, Jared. Coming up a new era or more of the same, Xi Jinping takes the reins on the third term as China's leader, market reaction, anything but warm, but what about the politics? We're going to head to DC for reaction on that story of the day.",https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=x_oQWsK-sM4,25,2022-10-24 15:42:27
3944," Well. Feet high shaped rotates over his chest and knees. Each of his legs with hers sticks together. Well, Chinese president Xi Jinping unveiling a new central committee over the weekend and securing an unprecedented third term as the Communist Party's general secretary. Meanwhile, the Ohio Senate race is getting tighter. We've got Yahoo Finance contributor. Kevin's really on top of all of the big stories for us on this Monday. Kevin, let's start with what's happening over in China. What's been the reaction from the White House? Well, look, I think policymakers in Washington, D.C. by partisan policymakers are really incredibly growing skeptical of exactly what Xi Jinping intends to do in the years ahead. Now, the question is, the biggest question, of course, remains about what will Xi Jinping's actions be on Taiwan? And how long will he wait? Should he want to invade the Democratic Island? Will he wait until the 100-year anniversary in 2049? Will he start to take aggressive action in the short term in the years ahead? And that's really the open-ended debate here in Washington, D.C. As well as what type of an approach he would take. Would he deploy tactics similarly to Hong Kong, or would he try to do a different route? But I was really incredibly struck by a bipartisan statement that came out from the leadership of the all-powerful Senate Foreign Relations Committee earlier this month, chaired, of course, by Robert Menendez, a Democrat from New Jersey, and Jim Rish, who is a Republican from Idaho, in which they said, quote, a country truly committed to addressing the world security challenges does not threaten the war as she is doing to Taiwan. China is also providing metals and energy to prop up Russia's growth test war in Ukraine. Xi securing a third term will only continue this path of repression, economic coercion, and regional instability. The finances coming out of Congress are also striking. They have doubled their military assistance over the next five years to $10 billion. The initial request earlier this month was about $5.5 billion. So not just rhetoric coming from Washington, but a financial backing as well. Yeah, also got some interesting comments last week from the head of the U.S. Navy saying that he expects the timeline for some kind of invasion of Taiwan to take place in 2024. Let's shift gears to what we're watching here in the U.S. I counted 15 days until the midterms. You've been talking a lot about the Pennsylvania race, but though a high-oh-rays, a new pull out showing things are neck and neck between Tim Ryan and JD Vance. They're absolutely neck.",https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=x_oQWsK-sM4,26,2022-10-24 15:47:20
3945," talking a lot about the Pennsylvania race, but though Ohio race. A new pull out showing things are neck and neck between Tim Ryan and JD Vance. They're absolutely neck and neck and it's and China is actually playing in Ohio, Ohio, Ohio where you've got Tim Ryan a moderate, tender crack, a centrist, Democrat former congressman, former presidential candidate too, mind you. And he's really going on offense against JD Vance. He's a mega back candidate. He's JD Vance has also received financing from of course Peter Teal. And he has said to see an end to Jake Tapper just in prime time on Friday night that they that he is trying to position JD Vance as a China candidate who is, he was investing in China while criticizing China on the campaign trail. So it's interesting to see geopolitics play in the populist streak of the heartland and American politics. But if you look at the subject pole that just came out, it is neck and neck. JD Vance does have a slight edge, but still within the pole's margin of error, 47% to 45% with 7% of voters still on the side of it or inclined to choose another candidate, plus or minus 4% in the margin of error. So it's, you know, Ohio typically has been leaning more conservative in both presidential and midterm cycles. So if Tim Ryan were to pull this off, it would be the cause of issues like the economy in which he's making a more moderate type of democratic pitch. In contrast to someone like a John Fetterman in Pennsylvania, as you know, who's made a more progressive economic pitch. So it'll be interesting to see what resonates with voters. Even as we look ahead, we have to constantly look back because of the former president, Donald Trump. He's still got his legal issues, his organizations, a fraud trial, tax fraud trial, starting this week. What's the very latest that you're watching on that front? Well, you know, Liz Cheney, who is, of course, one of the leaders of the January 6th committee, and she spoke to Meet the Press in a very stoic, sobering interview yesterday over the weekend, rather. And she said that it would be a quote-unquote disaster for Trump. Should he, for the Republican Party, should Trump be the nominee in 2024? Now, why does this matter? Now, whether or not you think that Liz Cheney has any chance to become president in 2024 to be the standard bearer for the party, she has stake her claim for the never-Trump movement. And she becomes ultimately the defacto leader of the never-Trump crowd. The conservatives who felt left out of the MAGA brand of conservative politics. So that has data implications, it has fundraising implications. And it also has short-term implications in mid-November. Remember, the January 6th committee has subpoenaed former president Trump to hand over documents and to testify under oath before the committee. Whether or not Trump cooperates with that, we don't know. But she insists, Liz Cheney insists that this will not be her words comparing it to the first presidential debate back in the last cycle between Biden and Trump. And that she would hope that this would be an opportunity for the record to set the record straight, but also to get some more information about what happened on January 6th. Finally, Kevin, we were talking this morning that you always like to remind us you're from Philly. I'm surprised you know, you have a Yahoo Finance sign, not the Philly sign. Now that they're headed to the world, Derek. Don't tempt me, because look what I do now right next to my good-bye chart. This has been Franklin, he is a famous Philadelphia. I mean, how great is it? I was talking to my mom and dad earlier this morning. I had a conference call with them. And I had a conference call with your parents. For ages after the gym, right? How great is it to be a Philadelphia and I grow right outside the city of Delco? But I mean, it's the greatest city we invented America. The birds are undefeated. And the Philadelphia Phillies are going to the World Series. I feel like a mummer on a Monday. I had 10 comfortable words. How it's just, you know, it's good news for the city of Brotherly Love. And we could all use some fun and we could all use some good news. And I'm just, you know, it's a great day. It's a great Monday. It's a great story. I think an amazing story. I'm going to be rooting for the Phillies. I'm still heartbroken about my Dodgers, but I'm rooting for the Phillies. Because nobody wants the Astros to win again, right? No. Let me tell you that.",https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=x_oQWsK-sM4,27,2022-10-24 15:51:09
3946," I'm gonna be rooting for the Philly. I'm still heartbroken about my Dodgers, but I'm rooting for the Philly's because nobody wants the Astros to win again, right? No, but let me tell you this. I couldn't go to the Philadelphia Eagle Super Bowl parade because there was a partial government shutdown and I had to cover it. So let me tell you, if the, I did go to the parade when the Philly's won the World Series the last time. And you know, I love the parade. So maybe I'll get to go to a World Series parade where like the Macy's Thanksgiving Day parade in New York too. I just thought I had a good parade too. All right, we're gonna all be rooting on your behalf. Kevin is always good to talk to you. Good start to the week. Kevin's really Yadavu Finance contributor. Now let's take a quick detour and turn to the world of rodents. Yes, rats are being trained to be sent into earthquake and natural disaster debris, wearing tiny, I take back facts. This is what the producers do to make me laugh by the way. To help first responder search for survivors in disaster zones. The project is led by Belgian nonprofit API Po, which is based in Tanzania. The program is currently training African giant pouched rats to locate targets, pull a switch on their B-Burr, on their backpack to signal a target is found and then return to base where they're rewarded with a treat. The nonprofit has been training dogs and rats for search and rescue for over a decade. I get a lot of comments on this one, but I'll just keep them to myself. All right, coming up on the other side, swing and it is. Yes, what Kevin talked about, the Philly is making their first playoffs since we should say World Series in France in 2011, but if the win, if they win, history says it should also mean a recession is on the way. That's if you believe in all this stuff. Does Yadavu Finance is Josh Schaefer believe that? He's gonna give us his take on the other side. This is the goal.",https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=x_oQWsK-sM4,28,2022-10-24 15:55:52
3947," Well the Philadelphia Phillies continue their journey towards a World Series Championship after beating the San Diego Padres 4-3 in game 5 of the NL Championship Series. The Philadelphia Phillies World Series win followed by the followed by an economic downturn. I mean I don't know if it's a superstition, is it really rude to be on it? We should probably start with the caveat that these indicators are really just kind of fun. It's like when we talk about the Super Bowl indicator every year, which by the way has been proven wrong this year. Normally when an NFC team wins the market goes up, that clearly hasn't happened. So that gives you an idea of how these sports indicators work. The Phillies won. So the Phillies have only won two World Series Akeko. 2008 and 1980 for most of our viewers that listen to us talk about the downturn that we might be experiencing or might not be those years stick out. But the one thing that sticks out to me when you look at this chart specifically too, so you can see when the Phillies win, the market has gone way down. But when they won in 2008, the market was down nearly 40% that year, but it actually went up 23% the next year because 2008 was kind of midway to almost the end of the crisis as far as what we saw in the markets. 1980 was a little bit different. 1980 the market was up that year and then went down about 10% next year. So even using this indicator, I don't really know if you can come up with a clear, well, it always goes up the year after because it was actually different. One thing it did, it was a sign of was a recession. So maybe instead of looking at two quarters of down GDP, we can just watch the Phillies. Is this the reason to root against the Phillies? I mean, we don't really know. I think America is going to be rooting for the Phillies either way. Yes, I think so because of the Astros history cheating. But let's talk about how the MLB sees this because going into the playoffs, it was the Yankees, Aaron Judges, home run record, the Dodgers, their regular season record. And here we are at the end of the season talking about the Astros and Phillies. Not major markets. They do have followings, but what's the expectation on ratings there? Yeah, it's going to be interesting. I think one thing that sticks out to me is game one is Friday night. This Friday night, which is a good night for sports right now. You're going to have the NBA and NHL, but you're not going to have big football. And they avoid Sundays throughout the whole World Series schedule, which is really huge. You just don't want to play with the NFL. You're not going to win. I think the Phillies are a fun narrative. And Mike, you said a lot of people because of the Astros cheating scandal want to root against them. This Phillies team is fun. They dance after they win. The crowd goes crazy. They really weren't supposed to be in the playoffs. So it's a fun narrative from a star power perspective though. I don't know. So we'll have to see. Feels like the Phillies have momentum on their side. They weren't expected to be here. They're right here. I love the momentum pick. I grew up in Red Sox fans, so I buy into that. We're both going to pick the Phillies. I'm not going to keep it a secret. All right. Thanks so much for that, Josh. Final check of the markets here. We've been watching the NASXY. The only one in the red here, but take a look at that. It's in the green now. Up 32 points. The Dow accelerating its games here. Up about 390 points. That does it for me in this hour. We've got much more to come here on Yahoo Finance live. Keep it right here. It's here.",https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=x_oQWsK-sM4,29,2022-10-24 15:59:57
3948," Joke In the third quarter, as travel and leisure continues, its recovery from COVID-19. American Airlines for one boosting premium seats by 60 percent on strong demand. So what are the best names to own headed into next year? Joining us now, Connor Cunningham, Melius, research director. Connor, good to see you as always. Let's start American Airlines because they're focused on boosting premium seats. Certainly, I would argue when viral online, what is the earnings impact that company from doing that? Yeah, so premium seating has been a big deal for quite some time. Airlines have been, if you look historically, there hasn't been a lot of new mainline economy seats being added to the system. It's mostly been the growth has been through premium seating. So this has been a trend, a mega trend that I would say throughout the industry for quite some time that's been occurring. So yeah, American getting rid of first class and adding more business seats is really they're just trying to add products that people are willing to purchase at the end of the day. So what a big trend again that I think airlines have learned from the past is that historically they've done a really bad job of actually selling their seats from a premium standpoint. So now they're actually doing a much better job of displaying it to folks making the price less shocking when you're looking at them and more reasonable for the common person to kind of look at him potentially by. So yeah, it's been a big trend. Something that we expect to continue, huge benefits for Delta United, American on some level as we look out into the future. And Connor, this is on outsized leisure travel. When do you expect corporate travel to come back in full of force? Yeah, so corporate travel has grinded up for quite some time now. You know, there's been a lot of in spills over the demise of corporate travel zoom being something that people talk a lot about all the time. But corporate travel is about 80% recovered from a volume standpoint right now. The yields themselves are doing pretty well too. So you know, where it's a steady grind higher our expectation is that in the fourth quarter there won't be another big step up. That's going to be more of a 20, 23 event. So we still continue to believe there will be a full recovery. It's just going to look a lot different. We hear a lot about these blended itineraries that people are doing. So please your conditional travel days of uncorporate. That's moving more to untraditional days, which is de-risking a lot of the issues that some of the islands have seen throughout the week. Connor, how do these stocks perform in a recession next year? The million dollar question. So yeah, recessions typically aren't great for the islands. But what I would say is that, you know, the airlines went through hell and back and now we're kind of getting through it. And we're not still fully recovered to traditionally what the airlines do is there percentage of GDP that they want to be in the revenue standpoint. So they would do that they've already made the adjustments. What I would say is that a lot of the airlines still aren't back to 2019 capacity. So if that we do hit a major recession and demand does ease, we could see them just not add the seats back. And so again, it's all about them commanding more pricing power and whatnot. What we're going to do is the best job that they possibly can from trying to match supply and demand. So again, they wouldn't necessarily add back to capacity. So do I expect the airlines to trade really well in an environment like that? I think they'll be choppy at that.",https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=x_oQWsK-sM4,30,2022-10-24 16:04:32
3949," job that they possibly can from from from trying to match the plan to man. So again, it's they wouldn't necessarily add back the capacity. So do I expect the airlines to trade really well in an environment like that? I think they'll be choppy at that first until the adjustments are made. But they've been learning a lot and moving very quickly from that standpoint historically. So you know, I am somewhat optimistic. There is an overarching trend though. People are are still willing to spend money and they're spending more on services and experiences than they are on, you know, a couch. So, that that trend is still very much in their favor right now. So from what we can see, things still remain pretty good. Conor, that is why I upgraded my couch. So I am one of the consumers that is already not taking as much of the pricing increases from airlines. Do you believe that there's a threshold where we'll see more of a trend where consumers are pushing back on pricing? Yeah, I mean, it's a good question. We haven't seen it yet. I mean, what I would say is that they're they're really the market right now from from from from a supply standpoint is still super limited and going to be limited through of next year. And so, you know, traditionally, air traffic has kind of grown at two times GDP and capacities generally cut the cut pace. Airlines really haven't been able to add back anything for quite some time. So we're still trying to catch up. So there's still massive supply demand and balance and people are still willing to pay up for for those pairs. You know, there still will be deals to be made that be had in like the off peak time frames if you're willing to be flexible. But, you know, the if you're if you're looking to book for Thanksgiving, like we would suggest doing it now if you haven't already, it's only going to get more expensive. Peaky days will will remain very very, you know, the pricing environment will remain very high there. So again, if you can be flexible, you may find some opportunities, but there hasn't been a pushback yet. We're not talking about massive fair increases here. So it's like, you know, when we're adding 20 bucks, so you're really going to just not go on your vacation for that. But when you haven't really been able to do so for the past couple of years. So that the the consumer's been willing to pay. We'll see if it stays that way. Connor, what industry is the biggest secondary winner with this type of travel demand? We've heard travel demand cited in the corporate card complex for American Express. We've heard it cited in the roaming from some of the major telecom providers as well. Who wins out when we see more of that traveling actually take place? Yeah, I mean, so you're just looking through the whole travel complex. So yeah, airlines are one benefit area of it. But you can start to look towards, you know, lodging and so on. You know, cruise lines have been very beat up. Leisure, they're very much leisure focused. They got their own issues, but you know, there's potential there is things start to normalize. But yeah, I mean lodgings would be another big winner. One difference between them and the airlines is that they can't move their capacity around. So if you have a hotel, you're not tearing it down. Airlines can move things in and out. So an RV right now, the big winners are the airlines. But over the long term, you know, people will then start to look towards the bookings of the world, OTAs. Those guys will also benefit from this from this massive trend. But right now where you want to be is on the corporate side and international side. You know, what we've seen during earnings is this is this shift from domestic to international driving the revenue benefits. So that, you know, again, our view is that you should be looking more towards Delta's and the United to the world, which are the larger international corporate focused airlines out there. Within that answer, however, Connor, you did remind me of my second reason that I upgraded my couch, which is because I'm not getting on a cruise. Connor, cunning him. Marius research director. Thanks so much. Joining us here today, I appreciate it.",https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=x_oQWsK-sM4,31,2022-10-24 16:08:34
3950," you i before the bell and it's stock currently moving lower by about 5.6% as investors mold the report and weigh the impact of inflation on the wireless providers consumer business. I spoke to Verizon CEO Hans Vesper earlier about the quarter. Take a listen. I think we came out from the second quarter. We had some softness in our consumer business, especially on the wireless. We took a lot of actions in the second quarter, especially around new plants, new products, but also did some price adjustments and coming into the third quarter and now reporting that we can see some of that is really getting good effect. I mean we're growing 10% or wireless revenue or EBITA grew 3% or almost 3% to 12.2 billion dollars. So definitely the progress we put in place was actually working, but it's a lot more to do. We're a large company and we need to continue the hard work we're doing right now to continue to do the great cash generation we're doing. So that was the highlight of the quarter. So we saw also the prepaid market. We acquired a track phone last year which added a really good asset when it comes to being in the value segment. We had a new products in there, a new product called Total Wireless but Verizon. We also added home broadband to the prepaid market and overall our broadband had a really good quarter. 377,000 new broadband customers in the quarter across business and consumer. So that fixed wireless access business we're doing is really working. So a lot of things was working for us. We still are working on the consumer segment to be even stronger and we're going to take more actions. It's a very agile market when it comes to consumer segment at the moment. I want to talk a little bit more about that consumer segment as well Hansen and from your perspective when you think about what you'd said at the end of the second quarter, mid-summer, second half challenges you were kind of looking out into the future and saying that second half challenges you see them as short term. Is that still the case or do you believe that there's some facets of the softness in the consumer especially as they're paying more for necessities right now and the macroeconomic climate that you believe might protrude into 2023 or even beyond. It's a little bit mixed feelings actually. We have the highest quality custom base and the largest consumer base in the country. We see really good payment from our customers, consumers where we are actually better than pre-covid so we don't see anything there. We actually see the roaming when people are traveling abroad. That movement are equally big or higher than pre-covid. So a lot of things are moving as normal and are store traffic between Q2 to Q3. That increased with double digits. So people are actually doing movement. Then of course we all read what's happening in the macroeconomy with higher inflation and the interest rates coming up. So it's a little bit mixed but clearly we are in the fundamental product. Everybody needs mobility. Everybody needs to be connected. That's so important for us and even more important these days. So clearly there are mixed feeling. We think we have a great product, we have a great network and we are spanning all the consumer segments and then not forget our business side that has a really good quarter with both growth. There are almost 6% in a wireless business in the in the business group but not only that. I did 200,000 new almost 200,000.",https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=x_oQWsK-sM4,32,2022-10-24 16:12:46
3951," water with both growth. There are almost 6% in a wireless business in the business group, but not only that. Added 200,000 new, almost 200,000 new net-dads in the business segment. So it's a little bit mixed when you're reading the market and what we're seeing in our customer base. Certainly. I want to talk a little bit more about those network investments in a moment, but before that, we know that you're one of the largest partners with Apple in terms of the iPhone, the latest edition of this consumer device in the smartphone that comes out year after year. And within that, there's even been some of the reports around where the demand might be pulling back. Are you seeing that show up in your business at all right now? Now, when we come to the iPhone 14 launch, we have seen very normal volumes. But moreover, we actually made an exclusive deal with Apple, which we have done over a long time where Apple 1 for only limited is a new offering, where you have all the Apple services, Apple Plus, the gaming, etc. In one package together we are only limited, very good for us to get it with Apple. So now we're very normal. There's a little bit of mix, of course, which type of products our customers are taking, but in general, very normal levels of a launch of an iPhone. If you were coming back to the network infrastructure investments that you're making as well, if we were to see any kind of recessionary concerns really permeate over into the next year, what would that mean in terms of the moderation of the level of network investments that you might be making? And perhaps on the other end, where you're full steam ahead? I think that the last six, seven years we have the plan exactly how we're going to invest in the network. This is our peak year. We're going to do some somewhere between around 22 billion in Capex, that's our guidance. And that's one portion is our business as usual. And then the other is that the new spectrum we bought last year is actually coming to execution right now, and we're doing that as fast as we can. And next year that will come down. But we have invested in fiber, we're investing in the C band, the spectrum we bought, we're going to pass 200 million pop in the first quarter on our C band. And the important with the C band, that's a five-despictrum that we're using. We see good growth on that. So we launch a market with the C band, we see mobility, business growing, we see fixed-wise access growing. And for the viewers, important, we bought that spectrum, but we get it all the time as the satellite companies are releasing it. And the last piece of that spectrum we will get at the end of 2023. But basically, it's nationwide 160 megahertz, which is a lot of spectrum. And we're only deploying pieces of it right now. But by year and 2023, we'll have all. So we have a clear process of how we implement and execute in our network. And that's on number one capital priority as well. So we will do what is needed for the network. We already have the best network, and it's just getting better. So just lastly, while we have you here, I got a hustle to my finish here. But I'm taking a look at the stock price, investors clearly reaction to this morning's earnings report. And perhaps they may be paying attention to some of the churn in end users or subscribers. But they also may be paying close attention to the margins as related to some of the capex that's going to be set forth and continues to be earmarked to the tune of 2022 billion dollars. That's your gents mentioned. When do you believe either some of the churn will start to alleviate, and then on the other side, when you can start to adequately wind down perhaps some of the spending so that the margins aren't as compressed? So when it comes to our churn in the third quarter, that was expected. We took a deliberate decision in the second quarter to do price adjustment in certain consumer segments. And we knew that we would have a churn bubble. So that was sort of an expected and very deliberate decision we took. And it was important for us to also do that because our industry has not done price adjustments on wireless ever. So this was the time to do it. We did it for certain segments. So that will ease over over time. So I think that's a very important message. And when it comes to the capex, we have a clear plan. We will come back, of course, with exact guidance for 23. But we have a very clear plan how we are on the peak level of spending right now. And that will come down as we are spending as fast as we can and deploying the C band.",https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=x_oQWsK-sM4,33,2022-10-24 16:17:10

There is another OS that's out there. In fact, there are a few other ones. And one of the other major competing ones is the Android OS. Why is it that there has been more of an impact to the social media companies' derivative of privacy changes from the Apple operating system than from any privacy changes because there's also a privacy push within the Android OS as well? Well, I think all companies need to step back and the regulators doing this as well. And look at what privacy means, how to define it, and what we actually want and to get ready for it. And there's just a whole range of outcomes. This is a huge global social, political decision that we all have to make. And there's so many moving cards I'd love to predict it. But I would just say to all companies, you have to ready yourself for a large number of different regulatory outcomes. Really, the question is, we know what is possible with AI. What does society want us to do with it? And that is a very big decision that's happening right now. There's no one route. It depends on operating systems. It depends on policies. It depends on choices that consumers and companies make. And nobody knows what's going to happen. So you just have to be ready for a variety of outcomes. Marty, when the market gets a sense, the Fed is done raising rates for this cycle. What will that mean for the M&A market? Well, so I have somewhat infamous for not making timing predictions. And I think I don't make them because I'm terrible at them. And also causality is hard, like knowing this happens. And that's going to happen next. And predicting the timing of it, who nuts right there. There is M&A happening. There are in every economy, including the one that we currently have. There are difficult spots. And there are bright spots. Again, back to AI, if you're looking at financing and in acquisitions and combinations of all kinds, in that area of AI, that is booming, just like probably better than ever. And so there are bright spot screenshots, even now, in certain sectors. And AI is certainly one of them. Marty, we only got about 30 seconds left. But I'd love to know, especially as so many companies are making changes when it comes to diversity, equity, and inclusion, whether that be at the entry level, mid management, all the way up to the board. What is the step that a company can take right now in order to ensure that even in the midst of macroeconomic uncertainty, that they are retaining those values? Well, so the companies have the right values in that in general. I'm not going to make a blanket statement. But really, it comes down to what are you actually doing day to day in your recruitment and your filling the pipeline in understanding connected to managing your people? And so companies are doing a much better job at the entry level, though it's still hard, and reflecting the demographics of the cities and environments where they operate. Really, the hard part is as people to become more senior in their careers, how do we continue to make them want to be here as opposed to some other place, and how we actively manage their careers to mentorship and sponsorship? Those are the things that all companies need to be doing in a disciplined, process-oriented way every day through every market cycle. Sixth Street's partner and vice chairman, thanks so much for joining us. Marty Chavez, appreciate the time this morning.

3954," you you any technologies. But what could all this mean for the path forward in the semi-sector? Let's bring in Daniel Newman, his future on research principal analysts. We both have got either Edith Young, Grace Capital General partner here to break it all down for us. Edith, I want to start with you because I think it's worth noting an interesting set that you have put out here in terms of what this exactly means. When you look at it, China consumes more than 75 percent of the semiconductors globally, but produces only about 15 percent. We have heard so many reports since the administration came down with these tech controls about not just panic, but just full on reassessment happening. What are you hearing from those on the ground? I think right now what China is trying to s-axis is if the intent from the U.S. government is to make sure that China cannot even buy or produce or even maintain what does that mean? It actually could impact many, many industry. We're not just talking about computer or smartphone, EV. This all sort of industry actually really needs this chipset to continue to run. I don't think there is a conclusion yet, but what I'm worried about that if China really wants to be as aggressive as the U.S. and retaliate, there could be a lot of impact for all the other companies in the U.S. And I think this is beyond just impact in terms of revenue for Intel or Qualcomm or Nvidia or of course we need to watch out for TSMC, but if they retaliate in other industries, this is going to be disastrous. And we'll get to the impact on some of those companies in just a bit, but really follow up here, Edith, what's the capability of these Chinese companies to be able to be self-sufficient when you're talking about advanced chips? So for the fast few years, President Xi is trying very, very hard to make sure that China as a country can be independent from buying from Nvidia, Intel or Qualcomm. But I think personally, I think it's still very, very far away to get to that level. I don't think China is self-sufficient yet. And though, the TSMC, SMIC, it's sort of the TSMC for China, but they're still far, TSMC is still far ahead in terms of what is being produced locally. Daniel Zedith highlighted, I mean, these as in the companies in China are major customers for American chip designers, chip makers too. There's an interesting report that BCG put out a few years ago that said that full tech control, as in a complete ban, could lead to upwards of 40% drop in revenue for some of these big names in the US. How are you assessing that impact right now? Yeah, I think we got to look at the more broad economic...",https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=x_oQWsK-sM4,36,2022-10-24 16:30:05
3955," for some of these big names in the U.S. How are you assessing that impact right now? Yeah, I think we got to look at the more broad economic story of what's going on here. I think President Xi Jinping is, you know, been very declarative about the intention of China to be the leading designer and manufacturer of leading edge semiconductors. The U.S. has put a massive investments with the CHIPS Act to take more control of its own fate and its supply chain. We have a lot of microaggressions going on in the South China Sea. And right now, this is one of the things China is very dependent on U.S. intellectual property and engineering capabilities in order to manufacture these leading edge chips. So a lot of this is focused on things like AI, high performance computing, which are going to not only enable innovation in, you know, as our other guests said, in smartphones and EVs, but in biotechnology in, you know, financial services and money laundering and fraud and things that need a lot of compute power. And so the U.S. right now is looking at the opportunity to sort of control the fate of the development of leading edge technologies, chipsets. And of course, this puts strain on both sides. It puts strains on U.S. manufacturers and designers of semiconductors. It also puts strain on equipment makers because part of this ban is also the shipping of equipment, the export of equipment that China needs in order to build more leading edge capacity. So, you know, as I see it, it's a very interesting moment because it's not only macroeconomic, it's also about their economic policy and national defense and security. But if we're talking strictly, Daniel, what it means for businesses, I mean, if China consumes more than 75 percent of this, and that market is effectively blocked off, you know, if the Biden administration really does put these controls in place and cracks down, what does that mean for these companies in terms of revenue? Well, right now, it's only very specific chips. And everybody's been assessing this. It's not the whole, you know, it's not the whole portfolio of semiconductors. Folks, I've listened to, you know, Justin Wong at Nvidia, they're already accounting for what they think are going to be components of their portfolio and the impact that it might have on revenue. And of course, we've seen the early warnings coming out from these companies. There's certainly a chance that this could have a much bigger waterfall effect. But I think these companies have already looked at the situation, they're assessing it. And in this sort of tough macro and tough economic period, they're starting to put those warnings out about what it could mean. I'm not overly alarmed that it's going to be the whole portfolio of all chips, lagging ads that are used to manufacture our refrigerators and air conditioning systems. I think this is about leading the arms race for the next generation of technology in areas like supercomputing, high performance compute and artificial intelligence. Edith Young, race capital general partner and Daniel Newman, future and research principle and I'll appreciate both of you joining us today. Thanks so much for your time.

3956," Moving on to our top story of the hour. It is all about snap and take a look at where shares are trading right now, down more than 30 percent following its mis-on-revenue estimates for the third quarter. The social media company citing continued deceleration of revenue growth as a result of ongoing challenges that include platform policy changes, macroeconomic headwinds, and increased competition. Joining us now for a snapshot of the path ahead for staff. We got Jason Healthstein, up in Heimer Managing Director in Head of Internet Research. Jason, you know, this certainly was not a great quarter, but this is a steep fall for this company. Shares are down more than 30 percent. How much of this do you think is overdone? Look, I think the challenges investors are kind of asking themselves, do they want to support this company longer term? I think one of the questions we get from investors is, you know, will they ever put ads in messaging? I think it's pretty well known. We all know we use all of us use messaging products, right? And we generally don't see ads in messaging products. And so, and a lot of this company's use case is at the messaging tool, right? I mean, they do then try to take that activity and get you to spend time using spotlight and using discover, but they're also seeing a ton of competition there from TikTok and others. So, when you couple together the 5 percent decline in U.S. time spent with kind of revenue that was below expectations and in terms of monthly trends that investors are having a really hard time to cybering, you know, I think you're having investors trying to side, do they want to underwrite the stock longer, the company longer term? Jason, there are two key issues that have really persisted from quarter to quarter this year. One is, of course, that the slowdown that we've seen in ad spending to the point you just made. Also, the other one is about this company being able to navigate these changes that have taken part as a result of the privacy guardrails that are now in place through Apple's IOS. I mean, these are not new problems that came up during this quarter. And I wonder if you think we've taken away anything more based on that earnings call yesterday about how much worse things are about to get particularly for SNAP? Yeah, we think kind of the Apple privacy is a good excuse but not the main reason. That really only affects for the most part app downloads or advertisers trying to write downloads. The bulk of SNAP chats advertising is brand advertising and that's what's been bouncing around kind of month to month in kind of an unpredictable way. So they're telling you that they expect their brand advertising to slow as they move through the quarter, right? And so that is the issue. And then they're also telling you that effectively competition is still a threat to time spent. And so this quarter, you saw impressions slowed. Not a ton. They were up 8% of the number of ads sold for SNAP. And the last quarter, then price spread was down 3% versus up 4% in the second quarter. And they're kind of telling you that they think those metrics will slow, right? Expecting to be a flat revenue growth in the back half. And it's not the fourth quarter. And it's not all currency. Conority was about two points of headwind. So there's definitely, I'd say more companies specific factors. Obviously, we'll know more next week when Alphabet and Meta report, but we don't expect kind of as bad of an outlook from Meta because they will be comparing against what was a challenging period last year. Well, and let's pick up on that point because when you look at the other social media stocks, they are following today in tandem with SNAP, not to the levels that we're seeing in terms of declines in the SNAP stock, but Alphabet, you mentioned Meta, Pinterest, another one that's been coming down as well. We've learned in the last quarter that this isn't SNAP, isn't always a bellweather, partly because these other names are a little more diversified. I mean, what's your expectation when you look at some of these names on the screen, who's best positioned to ride out the macro headwinds? Yeah, to your point, we do think that the whole sector is getting penalized. Obviously, not as...",https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=x_oQWsK-sM4,38,2022-10-24 16:38:50
3957," macro headwinds. Yeah, I mean to to your point, you know, we do think that the whole sector is getting penalized. Obviously not not as bad as a snap is, but kind of down, you know, four or five, six percent depending on the company. We actually do like meta the best right now for playing digital advertising within large cap in front of the quarter, mostly because they already took their loans a year ago, right? So they were the most impacted by Apple's privacy changes. They call that a 10 percentage point kind of impact to them. They also benefited the most during the pandemic from the poll forward in e-commerce spending and e-commerce advertising and that has unwound as we as the economy is reopened. If you look at the monthly data on retail sales, e-commerce isn't growing any faster than overall retail sales. So that's kind of telling you that they're still kind of like a hangover there. And so we think as that starts to obey and you're easier calms, we think the setup is is pretty good for meta. And then the last thing is we are waiting for Apple to kind of update. It's called SCAD Network 4.0. It's the next technology tool to improve tracking of ads and performance data. And we think meta is the best position company to take advantage of that for their advertisers. So we are optimistic on meta in front of the quarter. Okay, well we're watching for those numbers when they come out next week. Jason Helstein, Oppenheimer, managing director and head of internet research. I appreciate the time. Thank you. Well, we are seeing crude setting to finish off what has been a very choppy week. His investors look ahead to earnings from the oil majors given growing, growing suppliers in places like Libyan recession fears though, question is where prices headed. For more on that, let's bring in Mohammed Darwaza. He's senior analyst of macro energy at energy aspects. I'm going to get to talk to you today. Let's start with the demand that we've been looking at over in China. Of course, we started off the week at the party congress that's now wrapping up and the expectation was maybe we'd get some signaling on weather. In fact, China was sort of back off on the zero COVID policy, which is led to a lot of concerns about the demand coming out of there. What do you see in terms of how things are likely to shape up in the next few months? Yeah, thank you for having me. I think you're absolutely right. There may be had been some expectations building up that post party congress China would start moving away from zero COVID. I think what has been clear is that actually a lot of these lockdowns have come into effect ahead of the party congress in anticipation or sort of expectation that policy will begin to shift over the next sort of three to six months. I think the market is now kind of caught up with the view that this is unlikely to change imminently, but I think going forward, there is an expectation that COVID rules are going to begin to be relaxed. China has been somewhat absent from the buying cycle, including markets over",https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=x_oQWsK-sM4,39,2022-10-24 16:43:11
3958," There is an expectation that COVID rules are going to begin to be relaxed. China has been somewhat absent from the buying cycle, including markets over the past year or so. And I think once China does come back, this is going to be a certainly a bullish factor. The next marker, a lot of investors certainly looking ahead to, is in December, when we see those sanctions come down on Russian oil, we're looking at where prices are tracking today. It certainly looks like at least some of those recession fears have subsided a little. How are you looking at where things are right now for talking Brent Critt at 9288 in the context of what's to come? Yeah, absolutely. I think obviously a lot of uncertainty going into your end. And this is kind of cast a sort of a cloud over the market. The EU embargo on Russian crude and products that set to come in in December of this year and in February of next year. I think ultimately will have a significant impact on Russian production. We expect Russian production to drop by an average of about a million barrels a day sort of by the end of Q1 of next year. More generally, I think prices will be kept going forward because of demand fears, because of concerns around recession. We are expecting quite a deep recession in Europe, a much shorter and a shallow one in the United States. And I think ultimately the extractor here is really China. So much of the concern in the oil markets have been shaped around the supply concern. You mentioned demand concern. Is that what's going to be driving prices going into your end? And what are some of those risks that we're overlooking? Yeah, I mean supply, I think the market does spend a lot of time looking at supply. Supply is constrained. This is a structural issue. I think people are coming around to that view. I think I would say it's a lot more sort of divergence in the market in terms of expectations. And in times of recession, we tend to see commodities and late cycle sort of sell off. And this is no different. But when we look at sort of the highs of the year, we have come off and we're about 20-ish percent from this year's highs. OK. We'll be watching a lot of people watching to see where those prices track. Mohamed Darwaza, senior analyst of macroenergy at energy aspects. big and high quality segments. you you today. We are now in the United States. It's great to see you, so I think we're all trying to make sense of the gains that we're seeing today and comparing that to the losses that we've seen really since the start of the year, the SMP still off just around 21% you're today, what's your assessment of where we stand today? I think optimism is just too strong here because the Fed has to reign in inflation and they are very far from having done that. So they still have a long way to go.",https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=x_oQWsK-sM4,40,2022-10-24 16:47:24
3959," So the fact has to reign in inflation, and they are very far from having done that. So they still have a long way to go, and those higher interest rates are certainly going to hit earnings in the first, second, and third quarter of next year. And estimates will have to come down accordingly. And if you put 15 multiple unto those adjusted earnings, I don't really see the market much about 3,000 on the S&P. So how much further do you think the markets have to fall, Thomas? I think that it's going to get close to 3,000. So that's 10 to 20% lower from here. Thomas, what do you make of the moves that the Fed has made so far? Because there's lots of debate about how far the Fed has gone. If there is that risk, that the Fed is going to overshoot. Do you think they've been too aggressive up to this point? I don't think they have been too aggressive. Maybe they'll be aggressive in the future. But so far, look, the economy really hasn't slowed down much as a result of these rate increases. And they really want to dampen down retail consumer demand. And once they succeed in doing that, then inflation will slow down. And what that will show up in the sales figures for the big tech companies and most consumer rich companies. So the Fed president, Mary Daly, San Francisco, really rallied the markets. How did you hear these comments? It's time to start talking about stepping down. The time has now to start planning for stepping down. I think that is the wrong message. I think the Fed has to send the message that we're going to stamp out in place no matter what. And if they are in a better position, if they can scare the market into easing up on spending rather than having to force them to ease upon it. So I don't think the Fed is very happy right now. And Thomas, and with all of that in mind, the fact that you're saying that the S&P could fall to 3,000, I'm curious what you're seeing from your customers, from the retail investor perspective. What are they doing at a time when there's so much uncertainty in the market? So our core customers who are basically professional traders who work on the trading desks of many of the large investment banks around the world. And they have stayed portfolio early on this year. And as the market has been polling, they just recently started to cover those hedges. They're slowly, unfortunately, the retail investors got really hurt. And they are not the sidelines. As far as the market going from here, it's generally accepted by the professional traders. The market, as I said, has another 10% to 20% to go down. But it is impossible to pick a button. And so they have to pick a range of prices at which they gradually get back into the market using right interactive boom brokers as all kinds of algorithms that you can set up to buy, scale down, and in falling prices or sales fail up in a range of rising prices. So yeah. So based on the volume of TD Ameritrade and Charles Swab, the Wall Street Journal headline reads, time for day traders to go back to their day jobs. Overall, do you agree with that assessment? And when do you think they come back? Well, I agree with the assessment day traders. Yes. Day traders. Ameritrade.",https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=x_oQWsK-sM4,41,2022-10-24 16:51:40
3960," Well, I agree with the assessment day traders. Yes. Yeah. Day traders. I mean, look, day traders don't do better or worse in an upmarket versus in a downmarket. So day traders are just there to try to get the swing of things. And the ones that cannot make a living, of course, they have to move at the age of. But much of these day trading is now migrated over to the options markets, where you can easily set up option spreads, like buying one strike selling another, where your risk and profit is limited. But you can take advantage of shorter moves without having to take too much of a risk. So I think that the conventional day traders has moved from the stock market to the option markets. And Thomas, as they take a look at your most recent earnings report, obviously, a beat there. The street rewarded the stock. We saw some appetite for the stock as a result of those earnings. Just what's your assessment of your business at this point during the current quarter? And what does it look like as we look ahead to 2023? So our business looks pretty good, because we have more and more larger professional customers, like Edge Funds coming onto our platform. And that is very helpful. So we have spent several decades automating everything in the business so we can offer our services very, very inexpensively. And so we're finally getting the benefit of it, because people are recognizing that IBKR is the platform to go to. And so we're finally getting the benefit of the stock market. Largely, we perceive on the perception that Mary Daly San Francisco Fed President's comments were dovish. What do you make of the rally? Well, it's welcome, certainly. And I think that a lot of my participants that have had a lot of challenging days. And so a day like today is certainly a good relief. But if we look at more toward the median picture, we still have, as your previous guests said, a lot of inflation pressures. The Fed still has a lot of work to do. And interest rates are still rising. So we're not putting all that much stock into this one day, but it's certainly welcome. And we'll take it. Well, Yungy, what do you make then of the next couple of weeks, the next couple of months, in terms of the fact that the Fed's going to stay more aggressive. So 75 basis point height seems like a short thing.",https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=x_oQWsK-sM4,42,2022-10-24 16:56:14
3961, What do you make then of the next couple of weeks and next couple of months in terms of the fact that the feds going to stay more aggressive the 75 base is point high seems like a short thing at this point at the next meeting. Is that going to trigger sell off? I think the 75 basis point is pretty much baked in and the big discussion now is on December meeting whether it'll be 50 or 75 basis point. But I think if we take a step back the markets in a bit of a catch 22 because if we want earnings to stay stable given the cost that companies are facing now both wage pressures other input costs as well for them to pass those costs on is what's necessary for earnings to stay stable and passing those costs on mean inflation. And that means the fed has to continue to be aggressive. So we're in this push and pull dynamic here that's not easy to get out of until we get much better inflation readings. Interesting huge week of earnings next week but in the rear view mirror what's the lesson the the maddick lesson that you've seen and earnings so far in Q3. Well expectations came down a lot I think that's the that's the important thing to remember earnings expectations if you strip out the energy sector they went from about positive 6% back in July for this quarter earnings all the way down I think negative 3% and so once you lower the bar that much it does set up an environment where it's it's a lot easier to beat earnings a lot easier to have relief rallies. So the problem is when we go into Q4 if we continue to get down grades and lower earnings estimates will go through the same pattern that we went through leading up to this quarter which is a challenging environment so I think the themes are it's it's there's some stability companies are finding ways to manage costs to pass costs on but as your previous guest said there's still a lot of headwinds that remain and this is going to play out over multiple quarters not just a couple months. So what's that in mind that what should investors be doing at this point. There are a few areas that we like and that's a great question we certainly do like a value as a long term play even small cat value where valuations are certain look more attractive and we're actually looking more favorably on fixed income then we have in a very long time I think it's gone from an environment where we had a few years ago and it was Tina there is no alternative to what I'm calling now is Tara there's a real alternative and that real alternative is in the fixed income market you can get 4% on a two year about 4 and a half percent on a two year treasury you can get over 6% and triple be corporates you can get it around 9% almost 9% high yield corporates those are starting to look pretty attractive here so the fixed income market is going to be getting more and more attention as these interest rates continue to rise. Young you has the path narrowed to a soft landing. There is still path to a soft landing we do want to emphasize that that's still our base case a soft landing but that path is narrowing as interest rates continue to rise and rise sharply as a trajectory for inflation continues to look like it's going to be quite a sticky path ahead and as global factors and geopolitical factors continue to present problems that path is starting to narrow. But on the positive side we do want to reiterate that job market is very strong consumer spending should have a floor under it given the strength of the job market and so there is a path ahead that can lead to a soft landing but it becomes challenge as interest rates continue to rise. I guess it depends on which measure looking at headline or core but I don't think the challenge is getting from say 6% 7% inflation down to 3 3 and a half percent inflation that's not the challenge I think that's reasonably achievable I think the challenge of the feds going to have is getting from 3 3 and a half percent down to 2% and that last mile of inflation is really going to be a sticking point because the tightness of the labor market and the other inflation and pressures supply chain pressures ensuring you name it I think those that environment speaks to a situation where getting down to 2% is very difficult.,https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=x_oQWsK-sM4,43,2022-10-24 17:00:26
3962," pressures, ensuring you name it, I think those that environment speaks to a situation we're getting down to 2% is very difficult. So if the Fed sticks to that target, I think there's going to be a considerable amount more work to do. But yeah, being halved in six months seems reasonable. And then of course the debate out there is whether or not even has to get to 2% in order for the Fed to think that the job is completely well. Young Yuma, always great to have you. Thanks so much. Have a good weekend. Thank you, Sean. Thanks, Dave. In this episode of influencers, venture capitalists and domain money CEO, Adam Dell. You can invest today in the banking system of tomorrow. And that's a very exciting investment opportunity for retail investors. If you are solving a fundamental problem with a technology solution that feels to the end customer, that's a pretty good formula. You know, I've been very fortunate to have a front row seat to one of the great entrepreneurial success stories in our country's history and could be more proud of my brother, Boyd, he's done. Hello, everyone. And welcome to influencers. I'm Andy Sherwer and welcome to our guest, Adam Dell venture capitalists and the founder and CEO of a new trading platform domain money. Adam, great to see you. Good to see you, Andy. Thanks for having me. I want to ask you all about domain money. But first of all, I've got to ask you about the crazy markets this year, both in crypto and in equities. What the heck is going on? Well, market volatility is one of the things that is inherent in our market, right? Whenever you have such a large inflow of capital into a discrete number of assets, you're going to have significant swings. As Warren Buffett likes to say, the market is a voting machine in the short term and a weighing machine in long term. And as I look at the long term trends of some of the free cash flows, sources that are being spit out of some of the larger tech names, I'm quite bullish on their prospects going forward. And as it relates to cryptocurrencies, where we're focused, I look at the fundamental underlying components of blockchain technologies and their contribution to our financial markets, less from a speculative standpoint and more from a core market function, a core financial function. If you look at, say, for example, Visa, Visa moved about $10 trillion worth of transaction volume around the planet last year. Last year, Ethereum alone moved 11 trillion. And so that just gives you a sense of the scale of the impact of these technologies and what impact they will have on our broader economy. I'll give you another example. Money markets. A few years ago, the number of dollars involved in DeFi, money market protocols was less than a billion. That's a 2018 stat. This year, it's over 200 billion. And so the growth of the financial utility of these underlying technologies is undeniable. And as they become more widely adopted in commercial use cases, again, unrelated to speculation, I think you're going to see a significant growth in real revenue and real cash flow coming out of these technologies. Yeah, I hear you. And I want to ask you more about those technologies, but just sort of again, back to the macro environment, because, say, first of all, with the tech stocks, you know, they've just been such winners in so many ways in our economy. But the driver here right now is higher interest rates. Does that concern you? Well, I mean, you know, interest rates have been so low for so long that there's...",https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=x_oQWsK-sM4,44,2022-10-24 17:04:42
3963," interest rates? Does that concern you? Well, I mean, you know, interest rates have been so low for so long that there's a whole generation of investors out there and market analysts who believe that this is the norm. And obviously on a historical basis, interest rates don't stay this low. And so I think, you know, given, you know, the true cost of capital and the fiscal responsibility that is incumbent upon responsible central banks to employ, interest rates inevitably need to go up over the long term. And with regard to cryptocurrencies, blockchain aside, people are talking about Bitcoin and they've sort of positioned it, Bitcoin and Ethereum, other cryptocurrencies as either a hedge or not correlated to equities. But right now, it looks like those currencies are correlated to equities. What's your take on that? Yeah, I think that is a reflection of the maturity that the crypto markets are going through. You know, these assets are now more broadly held across the larger institutional base. They're now held across a larger retail base. And so downward pressure in the macro market invariably will impact crypto as well. All right, let's switch over to domain money. Your new company is it pretty new and what is it? How old is it? So we launched today on January 25th. So we have thousands of customers on the platform today. It is a robust, sophisticated investment solution for both stocks and crypto. We provide a number of differentiated features that we think distinguish us in the market. Achief among them is our signal product, which goes really deep down the data rabbit hole around the underlying fundamentals associated with these crypto assets. I'll give you a few examples. We analyze the Twitter firehose as well as other social channels. And we provide a proprietary social sentiment score where we basically provide positive, neutral, negative ratings on the social sentiment of underlying assets. Another thing we do is we track the flow of funds on exchanges. So tracking the on chain and off chain activity of underlying crypto assets, which is indicative of sentiment and price volatility. A third thing we do is we track project health. We look at the overall quality of the management team, the number of GitHub submissions. And we present all of these insights to retail investors in a very consumable and easy to understand way. So those are some of the things that we are doing at domain that are unique. What about the timing of this all Adam? I mean, with the Fed, you know, probably raising rates a number of times this year, we were in this incredible bull market, particularly during COVID, where there was all those stimulus checks coming into people's pockets and then they were going out to broker dealers and spending it. Are you heading into sort of a wind coming in your face? Yeah, well, I mean, short term market swings are not really the thing that we pay a lot of attention to. We spend much more of our focus on the long term trajectory of these assets. And as I mentioned, you know, there are some incredibly powerful forces that are driving the global cash flow out of a number of the investment projects, the investment classes that we're looking at, particularly as it relates to DeFi protocols. And so we're very encouraged by the underlying trends that we see. You know, a lot of people look at the price of Bitcoin or the price of any given crypto asset over the last couple of weeks and say, gee, this was a look.",https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=x_oQWsK-sM4,45,2022-10-24 17:09:03
3964," trying trends that we see. You know, a lot of people look at the price of Bitcoin or the price of any given crypto asset over the last couple of weeks and say, gee, this isn't really good. I look at something very different, which is that a couple of years ago there was virtually no transaction volume moving around the world to empower NFT transactions. Last year, it was 23 billion. Okay. Less, a few years ago, less than a billion in D5 volume, last year, 200 billion. You know, 11 trillion in transaction volume on Ethereum. These are profound trends that are not going away just because of the short-term volatility in the financial markets. And speaking of those profound trends, Adam, and you mentioned, you worked at Goldman, you mentioned Visa, what does your take on these legacy institutions? Are they going to get consumed by these trends? Or are they going to co-opt them? I'm everyone I always talk about Visa and MasterCard or Dead because of electronic payments. Of course, they benefited like crazy. But now there are questions about those companies, for instance. Yeah. Yeah.",https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=x_oQWsK-sM4,46,2022-10-24 17:13:49
3965," I always talk OVISA and MasterCard are dead because of electronic payments. And of course, they benefited like crazy. But now there are questions about those companies, for instance. Yeah. Well, we've been honored that we were selected by MasterCard to be part of their Smart Path program. What I've seen from the Visa and the MasterCards of the world is they've really wrapped their tentacles around anything and everything related to blockchain technologies because they, like many smart investors, see the opportunity set and what it can mean for improving the efficiency of our banking plumbing. The bigger story, though, is what these technologies will do to allow consumers to both borrow and lend on their assets. That game is going to change profoundly because of blockchains and represents for consumers a real opportunity to make real yield on their assets or borrow at a much more market-driven rate rather than one available from their credit card or from their personal loan provider. We'd explain to us how that would work at them. Well, if you look on a number of the DeFi marketplaces where you can borrow and lend, you see rates that are much lower than what you would get from a credit card or from a personal loan provider out there in the market. But aren't those companies just trying to garner market shares and not a money-losing proposition or is the margin on crypto so much lower so that it is still profitable? Well, it's a true marketplace where rates are a function of what someone's willing to pay rather than a fair bit of regulatory constraints and controls that prevent true market rates from being accessible to anyone. The average consumer can't access a money market in the same way that an institutional investor can. And crypto represents an opportunity for those markets to be opened up to anyone. That was a metaphor I was looking for. That's great. And speaking of regulation, though, you provided me with a nice segue. The Biden administration is reportedly looking, as reportedly preparing, I should say, an executive order for release coming up soon that will outline a comprehensive government strategy on crypto. Is it a good idea for the White House to get directly involved here? Well, we welcome and invite regulation into this industry because it's an important step in its maturity. I point people to the fact that China's efforts to try to clamp down on this activity had virtually no impact on the overall value of the market or trading activity for that matter. And it just shows you that information wants to be free and markets want to be free. And so I think it's incumbent upon the United States as a leader, financial systems and financial markets to think through the policy decisions around what is a stable digital currency? How do we bring this nascent market into mainstream financial functions while at the same time protecting investors from the things that are scary and may not be as above board about this industry? And obviously in any new industry, those players emerge. Andy, you and I remember the early.com period where there were hundreds of companies many going public without clear business model or any line of sight to positive cash flow. And yet despite all of that noise, an enormously valuable set of companies emerged that redefined the very fabric of our economy. And the same dynamic will exist with blockchain and crypto. We're in the middle of a Cambrian explosion of diverse projects and initiatives that are being tackled by engineers using these technologies. And some subset of those will become the very building blocks of the next generation of our banking system. Would regulation impact domain money? We've worked hard to ensure that we are following the letter of the laws relates to regulation because we want to...",https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=x_oQWsK-sM4,47,2022-10-24 17:17:44
3966," Act domain money. We've worked hard to ensure that we are following the letter of the laws relates to regulation because we want to represent this industry as it matures, rather than being part of the fringes of the wild west of the industry. Right. My understanding, Adam, is that you said, quote, the notion that individuals are rational actors is a false one. They're emotional animals and they make financial decisions based on emotion. So is that true? OK, good. Glad we got that right. To trading platforms like yours, though, then have an obligation to protect users from themselves. Well, you know, I believe it's our obligation to inform the consumer and provide them with as much information as we can to educate them about making a rational investment choices. You know, we really stress on our platform education, transparency and time tested investment strategies. So we talk a lot about dollar cost averaging. We talk a lot about portfolio theory. We talk about a lot about market fundamentals. What is the market size of this technology? What is the product market fit? What is the management team? What is the business model? And what is the viability of that business model over time, rather than, you know, things that are meme and momentum driven. And so while I can't protect, you know, individuals from making bad decisions, I can help inform them. And so our goal is to is to achieve that for investors. I want to ask you about wealth inequality and financial services because of course, the wealthiest Americans still own the vast majority of equities. And it's probably true about crypto, although I'm not really informed. I'm just guessing maybe you know the answer to that as well. How do we address that? Is that anything that concerns you, Adam? Well, the most interesting opportunity for blockchain technologies is opening up of markets to a broader set of our members of society that don't have fair access to a financial relationship that allows them to live their lives, borrowing money, earning interest on deposits. Those core components of our financial system are available to people who have bank accounts, who have credit scores. And blockchains operate differently. They don't require there to be trust between the two parties to a transaction. And so they, as I mentioned earlier, represent an opportunity to open up those markets to a broader segment of our society and to make available to individuals who have a few dollars, a fairer interest rate, a real yield on their savings, which they might not otherwise have access to. I mean, if you're a merchant in Taiwan and you have savings, how do you get yield on those savings? If you're a doctor in Nebraska and you have savings in your bank account, they're paying you 0.06%. That's not a market rate in terms of interest on your money. And blockchains represent an opportunity to open those up to fair market rates and real market rates for each one of those individuals. Does that mean bad things for the legacy banks? I believe that the legacy banks are smart enough to acquire and partner and evolve their business models over time to embrace the changing nature of how financial entities make money. If you look at banking over the last 10, 15 years, it's been, it's very clear what's happened with the introduction of Dodd-Frank and other regulation, you know, interest rate competition has been introduced into the market and so the revenue that banks have made from interest has basically been cut in half. In response, what they've done is they've basically doubled their fees. And so they nickel and dime the consumer on these little things that, you know, nobody pays attention to, but add up over time. Eventually, that game is going to run out and true market-",https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=x_oQWsK-sM4,48,2022-10-24 17:22:06
3967," and the consumer on these little things that nobody pays attention to, but add up over time. Eventually that that game is going to run out and true market rates. What can you borrow for at what rate, what can you earn on your deposits at what rate. Those will be made available to consumers without the required on ramp associated with, you know, establishing a bank account. You will be able to access those rates through DeFi protocols powered by blockchain technologies. As we wrap things up here, I got to ask you some personal questions. And of course that means I got to ask you about Michael, your older brother Michael Dell CEO of Dell. What was it like growing up with Michael. And what about it do you think contributed to the success of both of you guys your household.",https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=x_oQWsK-sM4,49,2022-10-24 17:26:29
3968," Now what was it like growing up with Michael and what about it do you think contributed to the success of both of you guys your household. Well, my mom used to like to say that she had three boys and she left out food for two. Michael was always a young man in a hurry. He was always tinkering with something, doing something, working on something and he was pretty good at figuring things out. And so, you know, I've been very fortunate to have a front row seat to one of the great entrepreneurial success stories in our country's history and couldn't be more proud of my brother and what he's done. Right. Okay. So, you're still working with him. I mean, you're in touch with him. You guys talk. What's your relationship like today? We talk a lot and I just saw him and he's doing well and working hard and enjoying his role as the CEO of Dell. Yeah, and it's just watching that kind of come and not go, but it's sort of had these different chapters, I guess, is how you characterize it, right? Yeah. All right. And so, you've now founded a bunch of successful companies, your self-addom and you've sold some to different entities. What have you learned and what are some mistakes you've made? What are some things you've learned along the way? Yeah. Well, you know, one is that if you are solving a fundamental problem with a technology solution that appeals to the end customer, that's a pretty good formula. And so, I've tried to focus on finding market problems and solving them with technology. The second and this won't be any deep insight, but it's all about the team and the quality of the people around the table trying to solve the problem you're trying to solve. And so, I really focus on that. I'm very proud of the team we've put together at Domain Money, about 25 of my former colleagues from Goldman Sachs chose to join me in this new adventure. And in addition to those folks, we've hired Brad Olson, who was the head of content for seeking alpha, the head of trade ops from Kenneth Gerald, we hired a COO who ran the crypto business for so far. We've established a really solid team that is very focused on our mission, which is to build our customers wealth. You have a metaverse part of it or no. Well, we will bring additional assets onto the platform over time. I think you'll see us getting into the NFTs base sooner rather than later. And so customers can look forward to that in the coming months. All right, let me know when you get the metaverse thing down. Okay. I'll add sad going to Domain Money. Question, how do you see using your influence on this world? Well, I don't know how much influence I have other than I like building things. I like catalyzing teams around specific objectives and goals and trying to motivate at set direction there. It is very fun for me to build things. I genuinely enjoyed it. I get a real rush out of creating something and then having people use it. And so I'm very focused on making sure that we deliver the best investment platform experience in the market. I remember when Goldman was working on the Apple card and there was chatter among the industry and even within the halls of Goldman Sachs, what does the world need another credit card for? And if you've ever used the Apple card, it's really a delightful unique experience. And I think the same opportunity exists in investment platforms where there are real improvements that can be made in the customer experience, the customer support, the education process, the journey that we take customers down as we help them try to make better investment decisions. And so I'm very focused on that as well as the rest of the team. Adam DelVC and founder and CEO of Domain Money. Thanks so much for your time. Thanks for having me. You've been watching influencers.",https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=x_oQWsK-sM4,50,2022-10-24 17:30:43
3969," the rest of the team. Adam Del V.C. and Founder and CEO of Domain Money. Thanks so much for your time. Andy, thanks for having me. You've been watching influencers. I'm Andy Servor. We'll see you next time. There is room however for him to do more as we head into 2023 and I do expect that. On the other side of that equation, I think we have Bobak Plus, which is going to continue to cut production and make sure that the market does not feel a lot of downward pressure. Why are they going to do this? Because the macro environment is super challenging right now with cross-currents, Chinese demand as a huge concern, European recession as a huge concern, and they really want to support prices in the near term and not let the bottom fall out of crude as it has done in previous cycles. Then Rebecca, given those, you have OPEC Plus cutting, you have the body administration putting more oil out there on the market, what does that mean for prices? It's a great question and a lot of that hinges on what happens as we head into the December 5th EU sanctions package and how much Russian crude is disrupted based on those sanctions. So I personally think the market is anticipating about a million barrels of Russian crude to be disrupted due to the increased sanctions and that ultimately the floor undercrued is strong enough to hold, but the upside is a little bit more of the unknown. If we lose a million barrels of Russian crude and China demand starts to improve and I know the data we saw today wasn't really indicative of that, but if it does, you could see a lot more upside. So I think ultimately you have downside kind of to that 70 to 75 range and you have upside north of 100. So if you're looking at risk reward, it really feels like at this point we're fairly well balanced, but the upside tail looks a little bit more explosive. However, there are very few investors willing to put that money to work. If we look at positioning that came out over last week, we saw continued cutting of WTI, Brent, and gasoline products positioning as the market is really afraid of all of these risks and not really feeling comfortable making a bet either way. So I think that's what increases the volatility is the lack of positioning and this really these really outside tails on either end of the spectrum here. This China still want to be a purchaser of Russian oil supply? I think they do. So I think that it makes a lot of sense for them and if we just look at their most recent actions, they're increasing their imports of crude even though their demand for crude isn't increasing why? Because they increase their quota for export of product. So they're buying cheaper crude from Russia. They're increasing their refining capacity and they're selling that really expensive product out to the market. As we have all talked about refining margins have been really really robust and they're able to turn that profit. It makes sense for them on a multitude of levels. It helps spark internal demand and keep the economy going a little bit. It feels a whole of the product supply that could be disrupted from Russia and they're able to turn a profit. So I do think they're going to continue to want Russian crude. I don't think they're going to be super public about it but I think they'll continue to buy it. Rebecca, we've seen some reports recently that looking at the heating oil market this winter, US consumers, they might see their bills go up anywhere from 20 to 30 percent. Does that sound about right to you? Yeah, it does and it's unfortunate but the reality is our heating oil inventories are very low. I mean the lowest I think that they've ever been. Does it mean that we're going to have run out of inventories? No, it means that we're going to have the potential for spites particularly in a cold winter and I think it's drawing a lot of concern and that's why we're seeing China's really ramp up their diesel exports because those refining margins are so high for diesel. The US is in this situation because we've cut a lot of our refining capacity. So even though we have a lot of crude coming out of the ground, we don't necessarily have the refiner's there to produce it into product to help you know kind of meet these needs. So",https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=x_oQWsK-sM4,51,2022-10-24 17:35:10
3970," we have a lot of crude coming out of the ground. We don't necessarily have the refiner there to produce it into product, to help kind of meet these needs. So unfortunately, yeah, 20 to 25%, I think is kind of where prices are looking. If we get a mild winter, that could come in. But it's really kind of a weather dependent scenario. And I think there's a lot of fear baked into that as well. Rebecca, I'm gonna ask a question that is absolutely fueled by my own personal aspirations of seeing lower airline prices in the future. And where in this environment, they're purchasing from the different suppliers and refineries, and particularly where that will actually net out for them to see lower fuel costs. We saw it show up in American Airlines earnings that they were paying 97% higher for some of their supply. And so when will that start to subside for the airlines and their purchasing requirements that they need just to operate their routes? I don't think that subsides in the next six months or even maybe the next year, unfortunately, unless, and this will be the sad scenario, we have more restrictive travel policies globally to COVID, but based on where things are right now, with the demand stays worth at, and I kind of feel like it might. You don't really see that pullback in jet, because again, you need someone to refine all that crude into jet fuel. And right now, it's more attractive to refine it into diesel, because that has the higher refining margin. So you're gonna use all your refinery capacity to diesel, and then you'll do jet, right, until the price of jet becomes so expensive that people reconfigure their refiners to sell jet. So the sad answer is probably not for a little while. You might see a modest dip, but I don't think you go back to kind of really, really attractive pricing for at least a year. Rebecca, I just purchased five new blankets from Target, because I'm not hitting my thermostat this winter. I'm not touching it. It might be 60 degrees in my place, just not going near it. Rebecca Babin, Cener, Energy Trader, CIBC, Private Wealth, always good to see you. Talk to you soon.

Global markets have been watching the situation China closely as President Xi consolidates power and enters an unprecedented third term as leader of the country. The move making many uneasy as US and China relations are already strained. Last week, Yao finances, editor-in-chief Andy Sober sat down with economist Noreal Robini during the all-market summit to discuss the state of US-China relations and Andy joins us now. Andy, Dr. Doom always good to catch up with him. Yeah, Dr. Doom, Noreal Robini, saying that we're already in a third cold war with China. So not very good for the sensibility there or the markets. But when you're talking about Xi Jinping consolidating power, Brian, over the last week, it really wasn't a surprise. But I think the particulars surprised people how he did it. If you saw, for instance, the footage of the former president, Hu Juntao being removed forcibly from those meetings that was really chilling. Look at this stuff. This is all for show because this didn't have to be done. What a humiliation for the former president. You see Xi Jinping just sitting there. Some people were saying that, well, he was Hu Juntao was not well and needed to be removed. But that didn't have to be done publicly like that, I think. There's a number of things going on in China. I think that the peaceful transition of power in this authoritarian regime has been something that has actually really been kind of remarkable for China since Mao Zedong. And now you've got a situation where, instead of two terms, there's three terms. That's unsettling. A couple of other points you guys that are also unsettling. One, using the zero tolerance COVID policy to turn the country more into a surveillance state. Number one, number two, also reducing corruption and trying to address wealth inequality. But also using that as an opportunity.",https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=x_oQWsK-sM4,53,2022-10-24 17:43:52
3972," Number two, also reducing corruption and trying to address wealth inequality, but also using that as an opportunity to remove political opponents is something else that Xi Jinping has done. And if you look and see how the markets in China and Hang Tsang have responded, that is not a pretty picture in my understanding is that's the worst drop since 2007-2008. So stand, Druck and Miller was talking the other day. We need to look forward 18 months, 24 months out. What does it look like? This situation is not going to be a great situation, I think, for tech stocks, for Chinese stocks, for companies that have big exposure there. So it's unsettling and unnerving. There's still so much that is unresolved on the kind of tit for tat trade war that took place back during the Trump administration. And so even now, with this move in China, what does that signal for the Biden administration? In terms of the broader business component here in rectifying some of those issues that still are unresolved? Well, Brad, it's not like President Biden has reduced those tariffs. And in fact, he's imposed measures that are arguably more harsh when it comes to the tech sector and chips. And you can understand that because when you're talking about surveillance, this is a real risk to the US economy and to the global economy. On the other hand, it's not doing anything to increase trade and kind of alleviate tension. And then, of course, hanging out across the horizon there is Taiwan and the situation there. And how that is going to be resolved, that is something that is very much front and center on Xi Jinping's agenda. And how that transpires if and when China ever reclaims that island nation as part of China per se, it's going to be a very, very touchy thing going forward. I'm not telling you guys any, you don't know. But I guess the bottom line is, things are not really getting better. And what's really interesting and back to your original point, Brad, is Republican President, Democratic President, continuity, right? Same thing. And so that's tough for relations there. Hey, that footage at the top. Wow, that was just jarring. Yeah, it's shocking. And, you know, again, people are saying, oh, he wasn't well. Well, you know, they could have just said, we're going to take a pause here, turn the camera off. And the senators were there, Chinese media not reporting on that, but the footage is out all over the place. So in other words, the Chinese leadership wanted this footage out there. They don't want to comment on it. And you know, look at this. Just, it's just, they're almost no acknowledgement. You know, straight, right? Look at this. Look at that body language right there.

3973," Go tricky. The snaps, Ugly Arnex report, is sent fresh shock waves throughout a social media landscape struggling with slowing growth, bloated costs and weak stock prices. So what's the next shoot to drop here? I've got to say research, senior analyst, Rocco Strauss joins us now to discuss Rocco. Good to see you this morning. Is it time to start picking at the rubble here? You just stay away from the space. I guess with respect to Snap, I mean, there still remains to be an unfavorable apricot hasn't mixed for them. With Snap being overly dependent on discretionary spend, when you think about the VC bag, grocery and crypto, App installed, you know, budgets vanishing in the last quarter or so. It's still an overhang from Apple's ATT or the IDF-8 issue weighing on gaming budgets. And Snap is now also seeing brand budgets moving to the sidelines, which is probably like the macrohead from that death lacking. So your best proxy is probably looking back to 0809, where 2008 was still a fine year for ad agencies and a lot of brands spent and then 09 or a year after literally met another thing's hit. You saw like a minus 10% or so hit on top line on these guys. So back to Snap, I would still say that against, you know, like TikTok and other social media networks, there is a lot of utility on the platform, you know, especially with messaging. There's a lot of first party data that they have. And they're also like if you undermonetize ventures like maps and spotlight, you know, building AR features, you know, in an e-commerce environment and so on. And that actually makes a slightly positive on the prospects of Snap if they continue to invest through this recessionary environment. Is there a turnover in favorability of social media platforms? And if so, which ones are slated to continue to win kind of the screen wars and that attention for time, which directly correlates back into where and why advertisers would want to spend their dollars on these platforms? Right. I mean, I guess what you have seen now on Spotlight, on Snap, you know, you could say, you could talk about YouTube shorts, you could talk about Reels on Instagram. All these are kind of me to offerings to what TikTok is doing. And the question that we would raise is, you know, moving forward maybe a year from now, are we talking about TikTok stealing time away from these properties? Or are we having more utility alongside these other me to offerings that keeps people on the more established social media networks? It's hard to say where user adoption is going to go to. But there's a huge risk for TikTok now, not the other way around. Well, then how does Snap go about restoring investor confidence? Yeah, I mean, it's, it's, it's, it's, as what I had pointed out, it is really kind of like changing this advertiser makes, you know, like going more into DR, especially e-commerce related offerings. There is an integration with Shopify, the other others like that out there. That's what you have to prove and you have to start monetizing these, these ventures where you are not seeing ads right now, especially Spotlight, which will draw some of these TikTok budgets, you know, think about, you know, like also other video budgets coming live with respect to Netflix and Disney+, which will draw a lot of the linear TV budgets over into digital and they are likely also going to end up in some of the social media networks. All of the social media networks right now are trying to become the shopping mall or at least replace the need for going to physical retail and-",https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=x_oQWsK-sM4,55,2022-10-24 17:52:40
3974," likely also going to end up in some of the social media networks. All of the social media networks right now are trying to become the shopping mall or at least replace the need for going to physical retail and drive more conversion. Can they successfully fill the void where perhaps that in-person shopping experience can be offset by that virtual shopping experience driven by interest and then actual purchase decisions? And do you see that actual amount of money that's going to be spent on this platform, on these platforms improving over the near term as well? Yeah, I mean, I guess it's a few things that need to happen there, right? First, we have to work on friction. Friction between looking at products, buying them after sales service with respect to messaging integrations and so on. And these platforms are working on that. You see that was picked to messaging functionality on WhatsApp, you know, in the meta universe, and we are going to see more of that. The second thing that we need to see is more integration of inventory. So literally everyone of these social media platforms has integrated with Shopify now. There are many more similar offerings like Shopify out there to think about like the WooCommerce for example, and so on. These need to happen and need to be smooth as well. You have to think about like combined baskets so that a checkout experience, you know, might work significantly easier than it is today. And then lastly, when you also think about all these ID headwinds that we're having and Apple's ATT is just the beginning, right? You have to think about like SDK runtime on Android, you have to think about cookies disappearing for many of these retailers. Both OmniChannel and smaller DTC brands, it is becoming significantly harder to track from an ad to a conversion if there is not an on-platform checkout functionality embedded into that. So the more we are going towards in that direction of IDs disappearing, the more likely we're going to see adoption of these on-platform functionalities. And that should increase the shopping that we're seeing on these platforms. Okay. And so with so much of that focus on shopping, being either prompted by the consumer data that the companies, the social media platforms are looking at, or just by the trends of how many people are just comfortable spending their money through a social media platform, does that mean that there's an authenticity vacuum with legacy social media right now? If everybody's just trying to sell me on something and content creators, I know that they're in partnership with someone who wants to get my dollar at the end of the day, then where do I go to actually just have that valuable connection? Yeah, I mean, if you think about some of the larger retailers out there, right? So name Amazon, name Etsy, name eBay. All of these have an issue that they don't really have any social media connections or offerings on the side. It might be with Twitch, but still small compared to other social media networks. But what all of them have and throw Shopify in their bucket as well is they have huge audiences and they have huge intent and conversion data. And if that sort of data can be made actionable into these social media environments, and that brings us to the discussion of clean rooms and privacy laws and so on, but if that data can be made actionable, then we're not going to be overloaded with shopping related ads. And it's going to be likely significantly more targeted than we have seen it so far. Okay. All right. Perhaps just my own sugar in that I inserted there into the conversation. ArrateTech, research, senior analysts, the ROCOS droughts. We appreciate your analysis of all these companies and breaking that down for us this morning. Thanks. Coming up, Big Tech earnings are on tap this week. But what does this mean for ETF investors? We've got that conversation for you next.",https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=x_oQWsK-sM4,56,2022-10-24 17:56:54
3975," ​ All eyes are on big tech this week with Apple, Amazon, and Meta plus AlphaBet all set to report earnings. But how will this impact ETF investors? Betify head of research Todd Rosenbluth joins us now to discuss. Okay, so help us break this down. I mean, with regard to some of the ETF trends that we've seen thus far, what are inflows looking like into tech sector ETFs? Well, the technology sector has been relatively strong in 2022. We've seen over $6 billion of money go into technology ETFs that's following on with some of the more defensive sectors. So we've seen strong inflows into consumer staples, strong inflows into utilities. Healthcare has actually been the leading sector, whereas consumer discretionary and communication services sectors have seen net outflows. And as we tie into the big tech earnings that he talked about, it really matters what ETF we're talking about and whether how it's classified. Todd, where do you see investors gravitating to more specifically in the tech? Are they still staying clear of anything that owns a social media stock? I think what the real focus for them is understanding what is inside these portfolios. So we mentioned earlier Meta and AlphaBet are reporting results. Those are classified as communication services companies in many of the sector ETFs. So you would find that in XLC, which is a communication services sector spider ETF, but you would not find Meta or AlphaBet within the technology select sector spider, which is XLK or the Vanguard information technology ETF VGT. Because of those, these sector ETFs are tied to the Gix sector framework and S&P and MSCI classified companies like Apple and Microsoft as technology companies like Meta and AlphaBet as communication services companies. And so the devil is in the details as to what's inside these portfolios. So with regard to all of these big tech names, it's still going to come down to what their free cash flow looks like and where their maintaining margins within their businesses. Some of them very much advertising focused or all of their businesses advertising, whereas some of them have a little bit more at play with regard to Amazon there. So what would you be watching kind of throughout these tech earnings to see where they're maintaining.",https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=x_oQWsK-sM4,57,2022-10-24 18:01:40
3976," advertising, whereas some of them have a little bit more at play with regard to Amazon there. So what would you be watching kind of throughout these tech earnings to see where they're maintaining some of those margins? So I think the focus for all of these companies were likely to see the currency headwinds happen. All of these companies are multinational in nature. It's different how their exposure happens to be, but we've had a strong US dollar that is going to weigh down on overall profitability. It just comes down to how profitable they were before the currency impact. And so a company like Apple, which is again in the technology sector and part of VGT or XLK, the demand for iPhone is going to be important. A company like Meta, of course, that's tied to search, you're going to have different impact search as well as social media. You're going to have a different impact as well. So I'm not an expert on individual companies, but I do think investors are looking to get exposure to these companies through the diversification benefits of an ETF and they need to know what's inside those ETFs. Todd, is anything surprised you this earnings season? I think it's been better than we've seen and expected. I think financials has been relatively strong and you get exposure to financials through the financial select sector, spider ETF and through bank oriented ETFs like the spider S&P bank ETF. I think it's been relatively strong, the bar tends to be set relatively low, heading into earnings season and companies have been exceeding that relatively low bar. But we'll see what happens. And again, ETF investors get the benefits of diversification across the sector as opposed to having to pick an individual winner heading into an after earning season. Do you expect that any of these companies will either revise downward their guidance or pull guidance? I don't think we're going, I don't have the expertise to be able to dive into individual companies, but what tends to happen when companies report results, they tend to beat the expectations and then the guidance takes a look at where we are from an economic perspective. And so the dollar is likely to continue to be strong or likely to see the impact of rising interest rates, impact the overall economy and recession has been top of mind for many companies. So they're more likely to lower the bar and again seek to exceed that during earnings season, growing investors, something else to watch beyond the current forecast looking further into the future. I wish you were here, Todd, because the big energy is flowing on this desk between me and Brad. We are psyched for app earnings. This is a big, big week of earnings. Always an exciting time for all of us. Vetify head of research, Todd Rosenbluth. Good to see you. We'll talk to you soon. Thank you. All right, midterms are just two weeks away. A new poll finds that the Dems are facing a tough fight in the key swing state of Ohio. Tomorrow, let's bring in our very own senior columnist, Rick Newman. Rick. We're facing a lot of tough fights and it's looking pretty clear at this point that Republicans are very likely to take back the House. The Senate might be 50-50, but to go to that Senate race in Ohio, that's where Tim Ryan, the current congressman, is facing JD Vance. And I mean, there you see it's tied. This is interesting because President Trump won Ohio in 2020 by a considerable margin. So in this race, the Democrat actually is outperforming, but that is not the case in some other states where Nevada, for example, where Democrat incumbents are in real trouble. So it looks like we're going to have divided government after the midterm elections. That is not a bad thing for markets. What it mostly means is that we're just not going to see any significant legislation during the next two years. Okay, so Rick, with all the key races that we have been watching here, I mean, is there going to be any actual legislative agenda, changes, any policy headway that gets made post-election? The one thing that's gotten a lot of attention recently is Kevin McCarthy in the House, who would probably be speaker if Republicans take the House. He has indicated that Republicans may not sign off on or easily sign off on the next extension of the federal borrowing limit. That's probably going to come up in mid to late 2023. And that means we could have one of these standoffs that we've seen before where the federal government can't borrow money. It goes right down to the wire. This type of standoff led to the downgrade of US debt all the way back.",https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=x_oQWsK-sM4,58,2022-10-24 18:05:29
3977," seen before where the federal government can't borrow money. It goes right down to the wire. This type of standoff led to the downgrade of US debt all the way back in 2011. So we might get another one of those. Republicans have also suggested they may not easily sign off on funding for military aid to Ukraine. McCarthy said, don't expect a blank check on that. So that's another thing to watch. But for markets, we're not going to have any tax increases. That seems very sure. We're not going to have any big new spending programs. So there is often a rally in the stock market after the midterm elections. And some people are saying maybe that'll be a little bit of something fueling a late year rally this year. Right. What do you think? Look, the political wins are constantly changing day to day. But what do you think is the biggest issue in the minds of voters? Is it still gas prices and heating all costs? Like we've been talking to yours. It's something like just popped up recently. The federal, the loan changes to the student loan program being blocked. I, you know, I, this is actually shifted. So obviously the Biden administration paid a lot of attention to gas prices during the last four months, let's say. And Biden has been releasing oil from the strategic reserve to get that down. Gas prices are now around $3.80, which I think is OK. I think what has snuck up on Biden has been these other types of inflation. I mean, we've seen food inflation is now 13%. Moody's Analytics has a nice piece of analysis out today saying they think one of the biggest factors in midterm elections is real disposable income. And on that, so that's your income, your paycheck, after inflation. And Biden, the Biden economy is doing very poorly on real disposable income, mainly just because inflation is eating away at wage gains. So all of this makes people feel really unhappy. And when they're unhappy, they blame the incumbents. So that is one of the big reasons Biden's Democrats are probably going to take it on the chin. You look happy, Rick. I'm happy. Brad's happy. So happy. Let's bring on the wake. Rick Newman, thanks so much. Hi, guys. Coming up, vegetarians listen up. A new Beyond Meat Item is coming soon. And we'll discuss next. Hi.",https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=x_oQWsK-sM4,59,2022-10-24 18:10:17
3978," Let's check. Welcome back to Y'all for Finance Live, everyone. Just over a little bit, just over an hour actually into today's trading session here. And taking a look at the S&P 500, we actually dipped into negative territory here for a hot moment. Reverse course back in positive territory up by about half a percent right now. And as that composite, you're also seeing that still in the red as right now early morning oscillation that we were tracking, but now we're down by about half a percent there. So we'll keep it close to there. And the Dow Jones industrial average. You're seeing that hold on to gains. It's up by about 9 tenths of a percent right now. Some of the other movers that have been keeping close tabs on this morning as well. Been watching retail, Amazon of course, that's going to be reporting earnings later on this week. But also in tandem with that watching Walmart here. It's up by about 1.6 percent. You're seeing Costco up by about 2.2 percent here early in the morning and Target or Tarje. That's up by about 7 tenths of a percent. But then additionally here, just quickly checking in on some of the pharmacy benefits managers. And here's why the Walgreens Flu Index is actually 10 times higher right now year over year. This comes after the CDC had actually given out warning last week about an elevated level for flu co-inciting with the, of course, COVID, the novel coronavirus as well. And so with that going into the next weeks and months of the winter, we're going to be keeping a close eye on that. Louisiana, Texas, Mississippi seem to be trending in the highest as of right now. We're seeing Walgreens boots, alliance shares down flat, but to the downside right now on the day. A lot of green though on the screen for the other PBM sauce. Yeah, although supermarkets shut out, definitely have me excited about Apple earnings later in the week, Brad. All right, switching gears here. The internal revenue service announced a welcome cost of living adjustment to the US is marginal tax rate that will increase the take home pay for many workers in 2023. Joining us now with more on the latest tax brackets is blue ocean and global wealth CEO Margarita Chang. Margarita, good to see you here this morning. So what do these changes mean to the average consumer? So this is actually a positive. Who would have thought inflation is positive, but because inflation has been at the highest level in 40 years, what that means is you could find yourself in a lower tax bracket because the IRS has raised the income levels. So you could be earning the same if not slightly more and still end up in the same tax brackets. Okay. So, all right. Help me understand this. Like, how quickly does this go into effect? I mean, is this, is this just immediate? Sure, I definitely can understand. So I know that we just finished taxes in April. There are some people who filed an extension, so they just submitted their 2020 return October 15th. And I know we're in 2022 and 2022 is not over, but we are planning for 2023. So here's the takeaway. The US tax system is not a flat tax system. It is progressive. It's graduated. So there are, as you can see on the screen, there are seven tax brackets. The lowest is 10%. The highest is 37. So I want people to understand is if you find yourself in the middle, 24% tax bracket, that does not mean that you pay 24% on all $364,000. You pay 10% on the first 11, then from 11, then it goes up. So that's what we mean by graduated. So this does go into effect for 2023. And the reason why it is going into effect is the IRS has made adjustments. I don't need to tell you all that inflation is real. And this is based on cost of goods and services for 80,000 items. Okay. And so with all of this in mind, how does this actually impact the real take home wages for people? Does it change anything there?",https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=x_oQWsK-sM4,60,2022-10-24 18:14:17
3979," of beyond meat today. Wow. Gathered down 5% after the plant-based meat company announced a new offering beyond steak. The finalist's book to Palma is here with the details. That's right Brad. Beyond me looking to cook out some excitement here. We're doing the opposite. As you said, shares down nearly 6% this morning. Of course, and frozen food comes out today beyond steak. It's seared. It's bite-sized pieces and can be prepared on what they're saying. Either a skillet or an air fryer in just 5 minutes. Of course, this comes as the frozen food section. Say a bit of a boom here. This year, 70 billion sale, 70 billion dollars in sales happened for the frozen food aisle. That's a 31% jump since 2019. But if you take your closer look at this offering, they're really looking to expand it to a broad audience from meat lovers, flexitarians alike. It includes 21 grams of protein per serving. They're saying it's low and saturated fat, 0 miligame of cholesterol. But if you look at where it's being offering, really looking to hit across the U.S. today, beyond steaks launching at Kroger, Walmart, Albertsons, and A-hole divisions, of course, that's a name that we may not know exactly, but I've seen, especially here in New York. That includes stop and shop giant food lion and fresh direct. Of course, this adds to the Beyond Meat portfolio. Back in 2020, we saw Beyond Meat add meatballs at Costco. We also see that opportunity at Target. But the Beyond Steak yet to be determined if this would be offered there as well. Of course, meat saying here that this was a highly anticipated expansion to its beef lineup, which now includes burgers, beef, sausage, and meatballs. But yet to be determined, just how excited Main Street is and Wall Street this morning, like I said before, down nearly 6% shares of Beyond Meat. So not drumming up too much excitement here. Yeah, bro, yeah, 21 grams of protein call definitely important for folks such as myself and our former FedCore, Sponor, Brian Chung. But look, Beyond Meat just had a lot of layoffs. How do they launch a product like this? Yeah, that's a great question. Of course, last week, the brand announced it's set to cut 19% of its global workforce. Of course, that included their cheap operating officer Doug Ramsey, who is a rest day in late September for allegedly biting a man's nose at an Arkansas football game. In addition to that, if you take a look year to date one year ago, right here, it is down 87%. Now, year to date down 80%. And if you take a look back to their IPO in 2019, it is down 81%. Now, in addition to that, dealing with a lot of other noise out there in October 18th, Beyond Meat and Plant-based Food Maker, Don Lee settled to dispute over previous partnership. Both sides are satisfied with the outcome according to court filings. But Beyond Meat really looking to push forward, looking to come out with these innovations, hoping to grab consumers attention. Of course, here they're keep on pushing on. I guess you could say here, calling it once again, a highly anticipated expansion, really looking to continue to enthuse and excite consumers about these new offerings. Brook, while we have you with all the expansions that they've been making, they had been investing so much into taking the operations under their own home, not licensing or renting space at other manufacturing practices in at least areas. And so with that in mind, investors have had to price in how much they're spending of their own money just to make sure that they can bring more of that operation in houses. Is it clear how they're doing in terms of producing all of these new menu items? Yeah, that's a great question. Well, what we can relate that to is the test that they did with McDonald's in hopes to launch that McPlan and while it launches the UK and Ireland overseas, it's really, you know, TBD on what exactly that will look like. One exactly we might see that nationwide here in the US. So investors really standing by and waiting to see if all these major investments that they're putting out are seeing a return on that share price. Yeah, we'll find this is on Brook to Palmo with a breakdown on Beyond Meat this morning we appreciate it. Appreciate it, Brook. Not beyond. It's Monday. It is Monday. Let's Monday. Brian Brad Brook is the hour. I know we are bullish on BR's around here at Yahoo Finance. Thanks so much, Brook. Appreciate it. Come again, everyone. Walmart, relaunching and renaming.

Three stories, one minute each. We start with this today. Walmart is reinventing its intimits and sleepwear line, replacing the billion dollar brand secret treasures with the more modern and contemporary style brand. Joy's spun. I don't know. I think they've never heard of the other one. Yeah, I didn't even know. It just takes me back to what Walmart did. This was 10 or 15 years ago, it was an analyst. They made it to a big push into more high-end fashion and their parallel is a complete flop. I'm going to be very, very fascinating to see how a brand like this does inside of Walmart, which really for the past 10 years, since that really dreadful push into fashion has been just been focused on very affordable, cheap basics. I don't know the prices on these, but this looks a little bit more fashionable than I think Walmart is known for. It's all about the homegrown brands. I mean, Walmart, of course, has some big partners on the apparel front that has allowed them to move into, you know, of course, all of these storefront locations brick and mortar that Walmart dominates in. But then it comes down to, all right, where is Walmart also growing up their own brands? Walmart doing this target, or Tarje doing that. Amazon also doing this too. Amazon has what, 12 of its own homegrown lines. And so it's really just that ease of knowing you're in the store to perhaps get some of your eggs there.

I pay $28 and I didn't even get a drink. $28 along Island, New York for two. Again, not the standard order, but I go into the McDonald's, I have a touch screen, I customize everything. I mean, it was $28 for two sandwiches. Do you? What? I know. I had to do a double take. I was just absolutely shocked. Wait, why didn't they were good? You didn't select a combo? No, I just, I like building my own salads because I need the double leg, I need the double meat, like I'm hungry. I'm really hungry. I mean, I get that, but you've got to make sure you're getting the drink. I know. I'm not surprised. Look at these combo meals. You walk into a lot of these restaurants now. I mean, they are no longer, combo meals were started to essentially save people money. Now, look at this. Are you kidding me? But when you look at the history of when some of these combo meals originated to, it was during economic downturns, or at least pullbacks in some of the consumer discretionary categories too, trying to make more of a value push in value play. All right, guys, let's talk about my beloved Philadelphia Phillies here. Today, the latest recession indicator could be the Philadelphia Phillies winning the World Series. Every Phillies World Series win, or I should say, Philadelphia baseball team win in the last 100 years has been followed by an economic downturn. It was the Philadelphia Athletics that kind of kicked that off. They're saying they're 1929, and then later on, the Phillies 1980. I remember 2008 and the pandemonium that just absolutely ensued after the Philadelphia's won the World Series. It was a great time, but not so much economically at least. I've wanted to support everything. I always want to support you, Robert. I can't root for the, I can't root for the Phillies. Because they just boo everybody. What was it, Jill Biden, the first lady two weeks ago at the Eagles game? She got booed. They booed Santa Claus. How am I? I can't put my support behind the Phillies. That's not special. Even though the Astros, even the Astros just demolished my Yankees. And they, you know, some would say they are, were cheaters. They are cheaters. But, you know, the Phillies, you can't boo the first lady and Santa Claus? We boo everybody. Santa Claus. We boo everybody. We got the best mascots. We got Gritty and we got the Philadelphia Athletics. That's Gritty. Yeah, and for a while, we had a bunny rabbit as the sixers mascot as well, hip hop. And so with all of this in mind, I mean, look, we're a fandom that's known to fight our own athletes in parking lot. I understand. All right, coming up, a kick off for GDN.

3982," 🎵 Welcome to Yahoo Finance Live. It is 11 a.m. here in New York City. I'm Akiko Fujita. Here's what we're watching at this hour. Coronation complete. Chinese president Xi Jinping secures a third term as leader consolidating power, but investors given the cold shoulder as greater China market sell off on economic uncertainty. Bracing for another tech crack, Big Tech prepares to report quarterly results this week. The digital absolute on firmly in focus after snaps free fall last week and looking for stability. Sterling gets a bump as the UK gets its latest Prime Minister former Chancellor Sunak Rishi Sunak steps into 10 downing street as fresh data points to a deep downturn. First let's check in on the market action though. We are 90 minutes into the trading day right now. A bit of a split picture. Obviously the NAS that can be the big focus of the week with those big tech earnings on tap. It is down about 26 points right now. The Dow up to 156 points though and the S&P 500 up 20. We're also watching the bond yields closely here. We've talking about a bit of a pullback last week on potentially a fed pivot up. We are seeing those yields back up today. Take a look at the 10 year yield that 428. The 30 year yield now well above 4.4%. We are beginning this hour though with all eyes on China. President Xi Jinping officially securing a third term on Sunday making him the most powerful leader since Mao Zedong. Xi consolidating power by packing the Politburo standing committee with the most loyal to him. China's third quarter GDP data delayed by a week came in above estimates with growth at 3.9% in year over year. But a robust recovery remains elusive as China faces challenges such as persistent COVID-19 curves and global recession risks. We should point out that that stocks lower in greater China on investor fears of Xi's new term favoring ideology driven policies over growth. The Hang Seng and Hong Kong captains were stay since the financial crisis in 2008. And the Shanghai comp also down about 2% there. Major Chinese tech names also falling into the red on concerns about Xi's embrace of state-owned firms versus private companies. We have a panel for you to break it all down for us. We have China's Beijing Co-founder and CEO Lila Miller alongside Keith Cracky's Chairman of the Crack Institute for Tech Diplomacy at Purdue. Gentlemen, this great to have both of you on today. Lila, let me just start with you on the reaction that we got overnight in the Asia session here. Certainly it looks like investors not feeling very comfortable with which direction China is now heading in with Xi securing his third term. What do you make of this sell off? Well, it's not altogether clear whether markets believe China's economic data this time around. But what's pretty clear is that nobody was very happy with the way that Xi packed the new leadership with loyalists. I think there was always a desire to see somebody who symbolized more market openings, disagreements in the top leadership, some sort of a fulsome pushback against COVID-19. Look, you can read tea leaves a million different ways here.",https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=x_oQWsK-sM4,64,2022-10-24 18:34:17
3983," putting disagreements in the top leadership, some sort of more fulsome pushback against COVID-0. Look, you can read T. Leaves a million different ways here. But when you look at who he put up next to him, it looks like it's gonna be the she-show with very little pushback against him. And I think that worries people who've watched the crackdowns of the last two years. Leland, just to follow up there, I mean, this did seem very much like a focus more on sort of national security, not necessarily on economic policy. And I know we don't come to expect that at the party Congress, but we're still looking at a growth rate here well above that five and a half percent target that was initially set out for the year. What does that tell you about where the economic priorities are for the third term for this president? I just think the economic priorities have completely changed from this time around. You know, we've been taught as China watchers to see the party as prioritizing growth above all. And that has been true for the last five, 10, 15 years. It is not true anymore. Now, the China we're looking at right now led by Xi Jinping is one focused more on security. It's focused more on restructuring the economy. So there's fewer vulnerabilities for the party in terms of reckless credit expansion in the property sector, shadow of finance out of control. They want to take control of the economy, reroute the economic growth model. And to do that, they have to materially slow down the economy, stop pumping credit in. So things are changing dramatically. They're not forgetting about the economy, but the Chinese economic growth model, as we know, it is over. And they're shifting to a more realistic stance. Keith, certainly from the US perspective, a lot to watch here in terms of the language that came out of the party Congress. One thing, certainly those in Washington watching here, the changing in terms of the language with the party's constitution here, specifically on Taiwan, using the word strengthened, fighting spirit and ability, deterring any kind of separatists or saying that they are in fact still moving in the direction of reunification. Why don't you take away from this party Congress in terms of the timeline China is now thinking about in terms of reunification? Well, I don't think there's any doubt, Keiko, that she is committed to that. She is not only the most powerful dictator since Mao, but he's probably the most powerful dictator in the world since Hitler. And he's probably even more dangerous. So I think a question for your viewers is not just what's the data, what's the analysis? Leeland is one of the great experts in the world on that. The question is, we know what's happening. There's no limit to his ambitions. So the question is, in terms of business boardrooms, what are you gonna do about it? And what are the moral responsibilities? What are the fiduciary duties that shareholders have to mitigate risk with these board members have to mitigate that risk for their shareholders? And I've spent a lot of time with the corporate boards out here in Silicon Valley. And all of these folks are putting together China contingency plans because they see the crackdown on the private sector. They see the draconian COVID lockdowns and they see no limit to his ambition for power. To what extent have those risks been elevated because of that consolidation of power that we saw over the weekend? When you said that you're talking to companies and their boards, what do those contingency plans now look like? Well, they cover a number of things. First of all, they cover supply chains because if there's any bottlenecks there, they all saw that during COVID. So that was a wake up call. The other big wake up call was when cheese totalitarian twin, put invaded Russia and 300 companies had to come out, they lost hundreds of billions. The China problems 10 to 20 time X that. So if there's a conflict in Taiwan, it's not only disastrous for the business community, it's catastrophic for the tech business because of Taiwan's lock on semiconductors. They also see the risk of cheap nationalizing firms, nationalizing, not being able to get their money out of there. But there's also a big question now, this pop it up.",https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=x_oQWsK-sM4,65,2022-10-24 18:38:29
3984," of cheap nationalizing, firms nationalizing, not being able to get their money out of there. But the also big question now that's popping up, Akeiko, is these crimes against humanity. They're committing in places like Shinjong, United States, and several other countries have labeled that genocide. So there's a real moral issue because they export that slave labor all throughout China. And we have already seen legislation here in the U.S. to crack down on some of that. Leland, last question to you. You know, as you know, these party congresses are very closely orchestrated every single detail. It is really, it doesn't go without a hitch. And yet we saw what was kind of an awkward moment here, where we saw the former president Huzhintel being escorted out. He's sitting right next to Shinjongping there. It appeared at least that he didn't want to go. And there's been a lot being made of that. You know, what exactly was the message Shinjongping was trying to send if it was, in fact, that? What was your read on that moment that we saw over the weekend? You know, it's hard to know for sure. You know, we know that it was a pretty big humiliation for who. But are we absolutely sure this is part of a public urge of the Communist Youth League faction, which which barely exists anymore? That's not clear at all. Who's son was in the room? You know, he's in the Polo Bureau. So I guess if we track his career over the coming months, we'll be able to get indications of whether this is something that was specific against who, or it was some other dynamic. But very weird, with such a choreographed event, it is weird to have a spectacle like that that left people talking all weekend. So, you know, we're going to just have to watch the politics in the next couple of months to see to see what this was all about. Okay, appreciate you both joining us today. China-Bajibok, co-founder and CEO Lila Miller, along with Keith Krakis, chairman of the Krak Institute for Tech to Policy at Purdue. Well, turning now, looking ahead at the week ahead for markets, we have Yahoo finances and as for here to break it all down and as of course we're talking about the big tech names reporting here, Meta, Amazon, Microsoft, Apple, you name it. Yeah, it's the Super Bowl of earnings really when you're talking about these big tech names. And as you just mentioned, these are the big mega caps that will be reporting earnings this week. And what's will be interesting to watch is Apple, Microsoft, Tuesday, Alphabet, Amazon on Thursday, Meta on Wednesday. But look, these companies, they're outsized, waiting in the S&P 500 is significant. Earnings per share are expected to fall year over year. But really the ones to watch for in my opinion are Apple, Microsoft, Alphabet and Amazon because Meta, you could say, has already gotten whacked and part of that has to do with advertising part it has to do with also Meta's strategy pivoting towards the Metaverse, which it announced earlier this year. But really, it will be interesting to watch Apple, what Apple says about China, what the advertising looks like when it comes to Meta, when it comes to Alphabet and YouTube, for example. And then most importantly, also is any talk of FX, for an exchange and how the currencies have been impacting revenue for these companies, for these companies that produce services. And also they sell their products abroad. Amazon 30% of its e-commerce comes from the international market. So it'll be interesting to watch to see how the strong dollar is impacting their performance. And it'll be interesting to see if they talk about constant currency, which is basically where they strip out that volatility. Also to watch out for for this week, preliminary reading of GDP. So for the third quarter that's expected to come in at 2.3% after the first and second quarter were contractions. So it'll be interesting to watch. Yeah, you mentioned FX, certainly something that we've heard from so many companies. It's also going to be interesting to hear what Apple has to say about this latest regulation coming down from the Biden administration on semiconductors because they've already frozen the use of YMTC chips, one of those Chinese makers that are now basically, you know, sort of their ban from selling to them. It'll be interesting if they talk about that, if they have any commentary on that. And also, of course, their iPhone demand and China supply chain. I mean, there's so much to talk about when we talk about Apple because it really is one of the bellweathers of the economy. Okay, a big week ahead. And that's thanks so much for that. Well, let's take a look at Tesla shares right now, sliding after the EV maker slaps.",https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=x_oQWsK-sM4,66,2022-10-24 18:42:50
3985," about Apple because it really is one of the bell weather of the economy. OK, a big week ahead and that's thanks so much for that. Well, let's take a look at Tesla shares right now sliding after the EV maker slash the price of its model three and model Y vehicles in China. The stock is down nearly 5% in the session. This coming after must comments during last week's Tesla earnings call saying there are elements of a recession in China. Let's bring in Yahoo finances, pros, supermanian. Pros, this has a lot of people saying, look, is he trying to start price war essentially in the EV market or the biggest EV market? Yeah, I mean, I think you see the model three coming down by 5% model Y base level by almost 9%. So there is concern there that demand is letting must, as you said, is much on the call. It's that is related to property market, but that sort of trickles on everywhere. Yeah, so analysts are thinking that, yeah, this could actually boost demand, but also could also lead to a price war. Other competitors like Leonardo, X-Pung, among others, could follow suit and they could actually do that with their pricing strategy. So I'm not surprised to see that. Also want to note that electric has seen that a Tesla is restarting the referral program. So if you buy a car through me through a referral link, you can actually get rewards points for like stuff like free supercharging. You also have raffles to get a bulk buckle and free use of a car for you. So they're trying to like just basically try to get that demand back up there in China. They had a record quarter of September, 80,000 sales or so. But I guess that's still not enough when you have like the Shanghai Gigafactory kind of increasing output and lead times coming down. So there needs to be a way to kind of get those cars off the door. What does that mean in terms of the revenue coming out of China if they have to lower the prices? I would imagine that would revenue be OK. I think of a hit willing. Yeah, I think revenue to be OK is margins will begin impacted. If they're making more than 80,000 cars a month out of China, that's a serious demand. Maybe they'll start exporting more to other places like Europe. But for now in the Chinese local market, it seems like demand slowing down, competition heating up, B-Y-D, 200,000 cars sold last month. So that's a big part of that whole equation. Yeah, B-Y-D giving them big competition in China. Thanks so much for that, Fraz. Well, shares of Meta are falling ahead of its quarterly results after Bank of America downgrade the stock from buy to neutral. It is up and low to the session still down about half a percent here. Analysts also lower the stock's price target from $196 to a share to $150 citing concerns about a decline in online ad spending. B-Y-D now expects that to slow down to accelerate next year with revenue growing at just 4% year on year. That's half of what the street is expecting. Analysts also saying that they are, in their words, incrementally more cautious on this content shift that we're seeing on Facebook and Instagram to reels this coming after those very disappointing snappers' all last week. Well, coming up on the other side, we are staying with the TXORIA's big tech reports allume. We're talking about Amazon, Apple, and Meta all showing their hands in the coming days. How much of an issue is over investment in this struggling ad market in the hawkish fed? We're going to dive into all of those issues on the other side.reu",https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=x_oQWsK-sM4,67,2022-10-24 18:47:44
3986," Gerilim Well, it is shaping up to be a big week for the broader tech story with the likes of Apple, Amazon, and Metta all reporting in the coming days. Until now, a big revenue miss for Snap and signs of a dire online ad market has been the major warning sign for the space. The NASDAQ has plummeted over 30% since the start of the year outpacing declines for the S&P. The sector has also been contending with what my next guest calls a COVID hangover because of tech over-investment. Let's bring in Erica Klauer, a Jamison associate tech equity portfolio manager a lot to get through to this week. But let's start by looking back to what happened last week. We saw the huge sell-off coming on the back of Snap that has accelerated concerns about a decline in online ad spend. How much of that are we going to see reflected, especially in Metta and Alphabet? Well, we talked a little bit about the fact that a lot of the advertising at SnapChat has basically been a result of share loss. I think relative share gainers will be companies like Google, like Facebook. Never unless there is a lot more pressure in terms of justifying the price of advertising online that I think will persist throughout 2023. And so when you look at somebody like Alphabet, what we have learned, at least from the past few quarters, is that they are a little more diversified when it comes to this online ad spending. So obviously, it's not like Snap, or we're just talking about one particular app, you know, a specific market. Does that shield Alphabet for some of the headwinds that we've been seeing in a company like Snap? I think you're absolutely right. Google is much more diversified than a Snapchat is. And Sam goes for Facebook as well. What about Amazon? They have made making a lot of big in roads, especially in the advertising space. That's right. That has done a very, very good job with its advertising assets. And I expect that that division will continue to outperform and gain share. So how do you think investors should be looking at that? We'll sort of break down Apple separately, obviously, that there's a lot to get into there. But when you talk specifically about the stocks that are really affected by digital ads, and we're seeing a pullback in general, who is best positioned? Who do you stay away from? Well, I think overall spending will be somewhat pressured because there is a need right now to really look at all costs amongst all enterprises. There is rampant inflation with regards to labor costs and also input costs. So clearly, people are going to be scrutinizing their advertising budgets more than ever. However, in that context, the companies that are really executing and gaining share would include Amazon, Google, and Facebook. Let's talk about Apple. There's the obvious numbers that we look for in terms of where their demand is on iPhones, how they're expanding in services. But there's a larger story that I think a lot of investors are looking at that puts Apple right in the middle. And that is supply chain movements. We were just talking about China and the concerns that persist around there. Apple has a big presence even.",https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=x_oQWsK-sM4,68,2022-10-24 18:51:56
3987," Investors are looking at that puts Apple right in the middle. And that is supply chain movements. We were just talking about China and the concerns that persist around there. Apple has a big presence. They've been trying to move production into India away from China. And then there's this big tech control crackdown that the Biden administration has put forward that does affect Apple and where they source their chips. Well, if we take a giant step back, what we're looking at this week is accumulative is 7 trillion amount and market value of companies reporting this week amongst the big tech players. The advertising companies are in one bucket and then of course they're the hardware and software companies in the other bucket including the likes of Apple. And what I would say about Apple is that the company is executing extremely well. But it is not immune to the the trends that you just mentioned. It took decades to basically consolidate all of their manufacturing in lower cost regions. That's being undone right now as the supply chain is being diversified. So ultimately that is inflationary in its nature. And at the same time we have a much more difficult to man's environment where many people bought their smartphones. They bought their personal computers during COVID. So there's not that dramatic need that we've seen over the last three years to upgrade or even to attract the first time buyer. We can talk about the shift in where manufacturing is happening, where you source your supplies. What does that specifically mean in terms of inflationary? Are we going to are we looking at higher prices down the road? Is it going to be cushioned by the company just given the cash pile that they have? I mean how do you see that being reflected in the coming quarters? Well, there are companies that are just masters of their supply chain. Apple would be the poster child for that. However, I think that when one is thinking about duplicate efforts to ensure no disruption to supply chain, that inherently means higher costs. And so the company will have to really assert its pricing power in order to offset those higher costs. I think that's going to be a story over the next couple of years. Still the strongest name though in the big tech space? Absolutely. I think Apple is showing very strong gains in market share even now with its dominant position. It's still outpacing its peers in terms of adoption. Erica Klauer, Geneson Associates Technology, Equity Portfolio Manager. Let's get to talk to you today. Appreciate your time. Thank you. Well, one of the 40s of 2022 will happen only the hawkish bed and the occasional market meltdowns. But the lack of safe havens investors thought they could lean on. That's certainly the case with Bitcoin, which has spent much of the year following stocks. Think of America's latest crypto note offers some help for haven status, however, suggesting the possibility of price divergence are trying to today specifically take a closer look at the Bitcoin gold correlation. Something we've talked about before. It shows a negative trend from March 2nd before eventually turning positive on September 5th. And it's been staying there as ever with Bitcoin. Things change quickly. So we're going to continue to watch the space. Well coming up, diagnosing the future for class. We speak without going CEO Steve Ruskowski on a decade in the role. Our record sending 2021 and what our COVID testing revenues will continue trending downward. We certainly don't want to miss that. We'll be right back.

3988," A f so Welcome back to Yahoo Finance Live. Two hours into the trading week. I've been on the split picture emerging, although positive with the Dow trying to build on those gains that we saw from last week, up about 260 points, the S&P 500 up 20, and then I have to act the only one that's down in the red, although slightly. Of course, earnings a big focus this week in terms of sectors that we're watching right now, health care, one of the biggest gainers on the day, and of course we're going to be talking about all those big tech earnings on tap this week. When now we're heading out to my colleague, Anjali Kamlani, who is joined by a special guest, Anjali. That's right, I keep going. Thank you so much. We are joined now by the CEO of Questagnostics, Steve Ryskowski, really a legendary individual in the health care space. Over the last 10 years, at the helm of one of the most important health care companies. Steve, thank you so much for joining here us here today. I just want to start off with obviously the pandemic. One of the most unprecedented situations that any CEO has had to contend with you, of course, seeing that demand on testing like never before. Tell us about it and how you got through it. Yeah, so it's been a busy 2.5 years, Anjali. It all started in the fall, excuse me, in the spring of 2020, when we first realized that this pandemic would be here and really sink its teeth into us. And so in March of 2020, we actually first started",https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=x_oQWsK-sM4,70,2022-10-24 19:00:44
3989," you you you. Welcome to Yahoo Finance live on this Monday afternoon. I'm Shauna Sipa long with Dave Briggs. Let's get you up to speed on today's market action. Take a look at the major averages. You're still looking at gains. Take a look at the Dow up around five hundred points right now. That's a one point six percent gain as a composite up and nearly 1% SMP. You can see it now above thirty $4,800. That's again a nearly one and a half percent Russell 2000 also holding on to gains today Although up just around a two tens of a percent taking look at some of the bond market action here The 10-year yield pushing higher by just around two basis points to 423 30 year yield also pushing just a bit higher at 436 a lot of the focus on the street today on earnings also some of those geopolitical risks Specifically the new developments out of China, which we will get to a little bit more on that in just a minute But take a look at the Nasdaq 100 you can see some of the larger cap tech names that will be out with earnings later this week Apple Amazon Microsoft Google all posting intraday gains today You can see Microsoft leading the way up just around two percent inside the Dow the leadership there coming from some of those largest As well as United Health J&J also pushing to the upside you have murk up just about two percent and taking a look at the sector action Inter-day basis all 11 of S&P sectors as we enter the final hour of trading our posting gains today Healthcare you can see financials among the leaders there real estate those still holding on to gains although the Lager it, I guess you can say of the 11 sectors up just around two tenths of a percent date good stuff Thank you, Shana. Let's get you up to speed now in the situation in the UK A tumultuous period for the British economy getting some certainty today with conservatives naming Rishi Sunak to become the first Person of color to serve as UK prime minister at 42 Sunak also the youngest politician in two centuries Moving to the VRBO we now know as ten downing his predecessor Liz truss, of course in office for just 44 days a disastrous Tax cut plan sealed her immediate downfall in brief remarks Sunak saying there is no doubt we face a profound economic challenge We need stability and unity and I will make it my utmost priority to bring our party and our country together The footsie rallied slightly as did the dollar in response to the selection Let's now get you to Jared Blyckery against you have to speed with more overseas action. Hey Jared Hey there Well, let's take a look at those Chinese stocks that we were taking a look at or at least talking about a few Seconds ago. This is the Nasdaq golden dragon China index and let me tell you somebody this had This was a worst day it has ever had and you can see here's a candlestick chart over the last two days Let me Beat this up with a line chart there. You can see the carnage now here is a max chart and you can see well Let me put this on a six months basis. Maybe we can get that and you can see at the lowest levels in six months But as I said before worst day ever going back over 21 years for the golden dragon index And here is some of the carnage that we're seeing inside that Ali Baba is sinking below it's $68 IPO price you can see 62 52 let's get a max chart of Ali Baba there You can see basically at the lowest levels not quite just yet, but almost at the lowest levels some of those suffered in 2015 2016 Another issued pin duo duo that is down",https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=x_oQWsK-sM4,71,2022-10-24 19:04:39
3990," Basically, at the lowest levels, not quite just yet, but almost at the lowest levels. Some of those suffered in 2015, 2016. Another issue, Pindu Oduo, that is down 25 percent. This stock has been hampered many times over the last couple of years. And the overall implications for this, the question on trader's minds, is this about China? Is this some idiosyncratic event? Or is this yet another one of the, I guess, canaries in the coal mine with respect to the global situation and the problem that risk markets have had? So we're going to have to see if this morphs into anything bigger. We didn't even get into the Chinese Yuan, which is at the worst levels, the weakest levels, versus the US dollar. That is the offshore Chinese Yuan we have ever seen. All right, Jared. Thanks so much for that. Of course, a big focus here for Wall Street is what's going on in some of those US listed Chinese names. When you take a look at the broader averages still holding onto gains, Dow off the highs of the day, up just around 489 points. So let's talk about all this with Linda Dissle, Federated Hermes, senior equity strategist. Linda, it's great to see you. Let's start with the losses that we're seeing overseas, specifically some of the concern about what this could mean for the US when it becomes US and China policy. And of course, economic implications there. From a market's perspective, though, do you think the reaction that we're seeing in some of these Chinese names is a bit of an overreaction? Well, thank you for having me, Shana and Dave. And we'll only tell whether this is an overreaction with what we've been through here in these last several years. Anything can happen, I guess we come to see. But the reason I think that the market is behaving so emotionally about this with what you saw with the footage and the leading out of the previous ruler of that country, it just, you know, and kind of a consolidation of power, everybody knew that President Xi would definitely get another term, maybe would be in place for our lifetimes. But this kind of a hold on power. He almost talks as if he doesn't care what markets think. He doesn't care what companies around the globe might do in terms of trying to exit there. I've heard many people say that Russia is uninvestable when we at Federated Hermes don't have exposure there. But we have had exposure internationally, and we've always said that China is the poster child for emerging markets. It's a really tough call right now to decide that that could be uninvestable, you know, so there's a lot of discussion that has to be had here. Yeah, it does appear at least on the outside. He does not care at this point. What do you make of our markets continuing to rally after the S&P gained 4.7 percent and still a strong start to this week? Yeah, much more comfortable talking about the USA here. Much more, well, we have said at Federated Hermes, we think that we're going to be in a broad trading range of 3,400 to 4,200 based on earnings and what price you ought to pay for them. We're kind of in the middle of that range. Benso for some number of months right now. And you know, I'm somebody who travels across the country pretty much every week. And one of the main questions that I get wherever I go is, what should I buy now? I believe there's still too much money on the sidelines. We have too much money. And we remember the great times. And I know that's a fact because we were buying mean stocks as recently as summer of this year. So we're all talking about global recession, slowing down here in the economy, inflation ought coming off as fast as the Fed wants. Why are we bidding up the markets? Well, you know, it's a midterm election year, right after every midterm election year, many of them most. You get a nice rally. You know, and you're starting to see, breadth come up again. It's just a lot of money looking for a place to put it to work. And I guess you may be are going to go buy China today and maybe won't buy Europe today. Well, Linda, let's talk a little bit more about that. I know you were saying that you have been asked this a number of times outside of some of those beaten up stocks today. Where are you seeing the opportunity? OK. So it's an interesting time to traverse. I've been comparing today with the 70s where you had vicious bear market rallies and then big pullbacks. We would call this a bear market rally and it can be a vicious one. And if you are a long-term investor and not a trader and you say, but you know what I have cash and I'd like to put some money to work. And let's look for something that might be a fat pitch. We're starting to look at maybe some more ideas over in Techland, some of the larger cap names, not necessarily speaking of the fang stocks. And some of the semiconductors we've seen are going to be an interesting place.",https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=x_oQWsK-sM4,72,2022-10-24 19:08:59
3991," Maybe some more ideas over in Techland, some of the larger cap names, not necessarily speaking of the fangstarts, even semiconductors we've seen are getting to be an interesting place. And that's an early cycle play, but here we are, they've been bid down as if there were recession. Cheap as sectors, I should say industries, still energy very cheap, and we continue to like that a lot. Homebuilders, I'm low to say this on TV, homebuilders are being crushed right now, but it versus their forward PE is as cheap as it's been, really since the 1970s, you can say the same thing for metals and minings, you could say the same thing for banks. This is for a long-term investor and these are not particularly timely. But neither was the energy call back in November of 20, 21 we said, you know, you might take a flyer here, it's historically cheap. Oh, doubt. Looking forward to this week, it's gonna be a busy one, Microsoft, Amazon, Apple, Meta, just to name a few X on it, Chevron, you mentioned energy, just give me one thing you expect that will learn throughout a very pivotal earnings week. Yes, and it is, I believe about 48% of the market kept us going to tell us about their earnings this week, we've all said coming into this quarter, we're not worried about what happened in the last quarter, we're worried about the outlook, we're so afraid of the outlook, and we're going to watch for throughout the various sectors is what we've learned so far, which believe it or not, so far, forward earnings estimates are done just 1%. We're getting no message still yet of a weakness here in the USA corporates that are still having their own big expenses to pay, it's still having to pay up for workers, and that could be a tell that would allow the market to continue to power in a nice rally here into the year end, maybe backwards, back up to those highs of 4,200, then I would say have your cell list ready. This 2023 is going to be a very interesting year. We can all agree on that, Linda Distol, great to have you, appreciate it very much. We're just getting started here on Yahoo Finance Live, coming up the closer look at the geopolitical implications of Xi Jinping's third term, especially when it comes to US China tensions rising, plus the biggest names in tech in the spotlight this week with earnings on tap, we break down what you need to know and be on the lookout for.

3992," [♪OUTRO MUSICен [♪ competition tv Market's plunging today in Hong Kong. After a Chinese leader Xi Jinping solidified control over the ruling Communist Party and secured an unprecedented third term. Some of our founding editor at large, Steve Clemens, joining us now for the first time on Yahoo Finance. Steve, good to see you. Let's first talk about the context of U.S.-China relations, given that the Biden administration just really ramped up that trade war with tripist chip restrictions to China. What does Xi's continued rule mean for U.S.-China relations? Well, I think it means that we're at an inflection point. And Xi Jinping is reading the global map as one in which he sees America in strategic contraction. That made it feel differently than how we see things in Washington or New York, but that's what he sees. And he sees this as a time when China's got to get back to ideological purity, back to the territorial reacquisition of parts of China that had previously been with it, like Taiwan. And that part of the message here is that while Deng Xiaoping, a previous Chinese leader said, it's good for China to be rich. Well now China is rich and it's going to get back to ideology. And that is very uncomfortable for markets and many of the transnational firms that are based there. From a U.S.-China perspective, it means competition and challenge are coming. If we're not already in it actually, it's going to be a fight over standards. And we're going to be fighting over that rising global middle class in the world. Steve, you mentioned the reaction that we're seeing in the markets and markets are certainly taking this news very hard. You look no further than some of the largest U.S.-listed Chinese companies in terms of that reaction today. Do you think that's justified? Well, I think it's, you know, I think markets fall when there's not trust in the future and there's doubt. And I think there's a lot of doubt right now on how much Xi Jinping is going to be friendly to this. Look, we all have this view. And I did two at one point, a couple of decades ago, that the more China got interwoven into the world trade organization became dependent on Chinese trade, held U.S. debt, that it would become a better stakeholder in world affairs. Well, it turns out that equation has some wobbliness to it. And I think right now it looks like China is not going to be, you know, increasingly like us or the West. It's going to set standards in a new and different way. And right now it's one of the reasons it explains why Xi Jinping is so focused on consolidating power. He does not want to be challenged. He knows it's going to be rough. And he's going to be asking his people for a lot of sacrifices as he basically takes on the West, in my view, for more leadership in world affairs and more consolidation within China. None of those are friendly to markets. He has cracked down on big tech leaders there in China, our prior guest Linda Düsseld, essentially said he does not care about the economy in the short term. Can you put that in context for us? How a president would not care about the growth of their economy? Well, I think right now he has been focused on corruption. He's been focused on other elements. And you know, at one level, you know, Xi Jinping has this theory of what he calls great power relations or what it means for China to be great on the world stage. And that does not mean making Ali Baba rich. That means taking the power and assets of China, which he thinks are awesome and basically throwing all of his support behind that. They use that to changing the economy of the People's Republic, depending on the economicization of the interests.",https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=x_oQWsK-sM4,74,2022-10-24 19:17:52
3993," in Alling Boba Rich. That means taking the power and assets of China, which he thinks are awesome, and basically throwing all of his support behind that. But he's a bit disdainful that China's power is dependent upon its assets and markets being managed all around the world. I saw him in Davos a few years ago, and this was right when the Trump administration that came in and he gave a remarkable speech in which he said, don't worry, world. I'm going to be the one to protect markets and the market trading system in the world, and I'm going to be the one to save us all from climate change. And it turns out that part one, he's not living up to. So when you take a look at the fact that Xi Jinping has been so strict when it comes to COVID, the number of the COVID zero policy, the number of lockdowns that have been instituted in China over the last two and a half years. I guess though, at what point will he need to start listening to the Chinese people, those that are sick of these types of policies? And we're obviously seeing that play out in the economy today. Well, it's really interesting because he's just elevated a number of people that were responsible for that policy. So I don't predict any real weakening of that. And I think it's going to be complicated for China as it tries to reopen next year. I mean, I think we have to be very careful of mirror imaging with China that we would say, don't they want to risk back? Don't they want their people back? Don't they want to have all of the benefits that come with transnational traveling, exchange, and tourism, sure at one level they do. But the obsession with state control, the obsession with making sure, now you have to understand by basically shutting China off, it's also become much, much more vulnerable to a future variant or something. You do not have the antibodies, the natural immunity that has built up in places that have been hit hard by COVID. So to some degree, China's got a staggering problem ahead in that it is basically created a Galapagos island problem for itself, where its own population is now less prepared for a future variant from COVID than it might have otherwise been. And I don't know how they'll handle that. All I know is that this is a person very, very comfortable with asserting a lot of control over people's lives. That's good stuff. What does the third term mean for Taiwan? And if they're to take Taiwan, they do it by force, they do it by economic blockade. Or look, I think that we have to be careful with Taiwan. I do think there are things that we could do or they could do that could trip us into war and it would be a very, very nasty war. And there are geographic realities with Taiwan that are very complex. But look, I think that China is of the view that its incremental growth, the increasing investment it's made in its military power, its naval power, it's looking at how it is focused on what it could do by way of a blockade and others. I think we have to be very careful. And remember, the Taiwanese themselves may not, in fact, want this show down. Some do, but some don't. And I think we need to make sure that they're in the picture. 90% of the world's most advanced semiconductors come from Taiwan. China wants it back, but I think right now, we're basically trying to figure out, is the era of strategic ambiguity over Taiwan, which has actually been stable. Is that coming to an end? And this is one of the areas that could lead to an actual kinetic collision between American forces and Chinese forces if we're not careful. And I think it is one of the real hot points in the world. And I think Taiwan is in a vice between them. And we don't have many Henry Kissinger's around to kind of put this deal back together. No, we do not. Speaking of competition, Steve, wanted to hear about your outlet, Semaphore. It's an interesting tech play. I'm just curious how you guys position yourself in an increasingly competitive media environment. Look, we love all of our sibling organizations are out there working in the new media space. We launched about a week ago. We had, I think, largely really good reception from across all the verticals we're doing. I help anchor and host the politics and policy division called Principles, so if they'll be to sign up. But look, the big thing we're trying to say is there is a crisis out there in trust and confidence in news. It's also a market opportunity, honestly. And if we can come back to educating and interacting with the American public and the global public, frankly. And say, it's important to hear Steve Clemens' views on things perhaps, or my analysis of the news or scoop. But I've got to be responsible to the fact that there are alternative views and opinions out there. And we build that in.",https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=x_oQWsK-sM4,75,2022-10-24 19:21:57
3994," It's important to hear Steve Clements' views on things, perhaps, or my analysis of the news or scoop. But I've got to be responsible to the fact that there are alternative views and opinions out there. And we build that in. We build in a disagreement. We build in international perspectives into what we're doing. We show people that you can look at the facts and the scoop out there, but you can get a lot of different views out there and you should demand it and expect it in your media. And that is not, as you know, what is typically happening. You're able to do it in the broadcast format much, much better than the typical print and journalism world that we're in. And so by building in alternative reviews, by building this in, I think we'll have a richer and more trusted news formed down the road. And I look, you know, I encourage people to check us out. Steve, you're talking to a guy who worked at Fox News and CNN, man. So I get it. And I appreciate very much what you are doing. Thank you. We do look forward to following some of them. Of course, I'm a feeling we will be talking much more about that in the future. Steve, great to have you. Thanks so much for joining us. Well, come here next, earning season, kicking into high gear. Up next, we're going to take a look beyond profit and revenue. Instead, focus on what company leaders are saying about the economy and market moves. We got that for you next. Joe, does ease that've still just won I'm going to do a little bit of this. I'm going to do a little bit of this. I'm going to do a little bit of this. I'm going to do a little bit of this. I'm going to do a little bit of this. I'm going to do a little bit of this. I'm going to do a little bit of this. I'm going to do a little bit of this. I'm going to do a little bit of this. The biggest earnings week of the quarter is upon us with more than a third of S&P 500 companies reporting an almost half of the market cap. What have we learned thus far though about the direction of the economy, the strength and the dollar, and the health and the consumer? Scott Kraseloff is the transcript editor and founder of Avondale Asset Management. Scott, go to CL. Let's start before we dive into specific statements thematically. What have we learned thus far? What have we heard from our business leaders? I think that right now.",https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=x_oQWsK-sM4,76,2022-10-24 19:26:14
3995," dive into specific statements thematically. What have we learned thus far? What have we heard from our business leaders? Yeah, I think that right now, business leaders are really focused, obviously, on the prospects of recession. And people are watching that very closely. See, looking for signs whether or not the economy is tilting into a recession. What we're seeing so far, though, is that consumer spending is held in really strongly. You're hearing from banks, especially at the beginning of the earning season, that consumers are still spending, that consumer spending is up, double digits still year over year. And so there's strength in the economy at the most fundamental level, which is the consumer. And yet you have deteriorating company confidence, I think among the CEOs, thinking that they need to be preparing for a recession. So at a high level, that's what we're really saying right now. It's gotten to that point. I want to bring up what Goldman Sachs, a CEO, David Solomon, did say shortly after the earnings were released. He said, on the distribution of outcomes, there's a good chance that we have a recession in the United States, comparing that to what we've heard from other bank CEOs, other executives. How does it stack up just in terms of the likelihood that we will see a significant slowdown? Yeah, that's a great question. I think David Solomon has probably been on the more bearish end of CEOs, bank CEOs, especially for the last several quarters. I think that it's easier to find a more negative comment from David than from some of the other ones. Obviously, Jamie Diamond has been notably bearish talking about a hurricane, could be coming through the economy. And I would say that Brian Moynihan has been on the most bullish side at Bank of America, of any of the bank CEOs. And that has proven the same case during this earnings season as well. So Brian Moynihan was one who reminded that the consumer is still very strong, relatively Goldman Sachs and JP Morgan CEO's, David Solomon and Jamie Diamond were both a little bit more bearish. And I would say that David Solomon has been the most cautious of anybody, which maybe isn't too surprising because Goldman Sachs obvious has the largest capital markets business of those three, whereas Bank of America would be touching consumers more directly. Right, right. It's not just their interpretation. Some of them certainly have different business models. So let's move over to the consumer and what we're learning from them. Here's the MX CEO. We're confident. Look, the spending speaks for itself. I mean, just look at some of these numbers. You've got goods and services up 16%. Our US consumer is up 22%. Millennial spending is up 39%. Our teeny spending is up 57%. International spending is 37%. We haven't seen any change. And you can look at this quarter over quarter. And the reality is that S quarter was a record level quarter in terms of spending. And this is like a billion dollars behind or something like that. But if you look at year over year growth, we're not seeing any changes in consumer spending behavior at all. A remarkable statement given inflation. Was that an outlier statement or does it really sum up what we're hearing? No, I think it sums up honestly with what we're hearing from consumer credit card companies, especially, which is really the most important indicator because credit card companies are obviously seeing all of the spend that consumers are doing, not just in certain categories. And the numbers that they're seeing are significant. So you heard an American Express talk about double-digit increases in some major categories. And so I think what's important and why we focus on what's going on at the credit card spending company or the companies with credit card data is that in some of the other areas of the consumer sector, we're seeing slowdown. And you're seeing this shift from goods back to services that's still playing out post-pandemic. And the card companies are capturing all of that. But if you just listen to certain segments, you may see decline in goods spending or boosts in service spending. But the card companies are encapsulating all of that. It's got another big theme, obviously, is the strong dollar. We've heard it not only this quarter, but of course over the past several quarters when you take a look at the dollars jump up nearly 17% this year alone. I want to play a quick clip from what we heard on Netflix's earnings call after their results. The FX drag is significant. We mentioned in the letter if we look at our, you can do the math on our.",https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=x_oQWsK-sM4,77,2022-10-24 19:30:38
3996," If again, we mentioned in the letter, if we look at, you know, our, you can do the math on our four quarters now and you kind of roll it out to a full year number. We're still holding to what we're calling FX neutral to the beginning of the year, January one of this year to that 19 to 20% margin range FX neutral. You can, you'll see it's actually is in the mid to higher end of that range. But on a reported basis, it's just a little over 17%. So there's about two and a half points of FX drag in our margin that equates to about it's about a billion dollars of revenue drag about 800 million dollars of of margin drag. And that was Netflix, a CFO Spencer Newman. And Scott, we've heard it from a number of executives, IBM, one of the big companies obviously outwiring about the strong dollar their CFO saying it's a big wild card to what's going to happen to the US dollar, obviously having a huge impact on their business. I'm sure we'll hear it more this week when we hear from some of the larger tech giants. What's on your radar as we look out over the next couple weeks when it comes to the strong dollar. Yeah, I mean, I think the strong dollar is one component, one major component that's impacting earnings growth in this quarter. And I think that's one of the big things that we're seeing this quarter versus previous quarters is that you're really starting to see earnings growth get impacted by some of the headwinds that we've been seeing in the economy. So the dollar is one and Netflix pointed out there. Proctor and Gamble also talked about a nine point headwind just from currency in its most recent quarter. But then also proctor and Gamble talked about a 27 point overall earnings growth headwind, which again, 27 points, a massive number in terms of the growth headwind. And that was not just in terms of strong dollar, but that was also just the general inflation area environment, both in terms of their input costs and then also their free delivery costs. And so those things, you know, that what we've been talking about thematically and markets and capital markets for a long time, I think are starting to actually hit the financial statements of companies in this quarter. And that's that's really important for two reasons. Not only is it it's it's impacting and showing where the economy is going. But as we think about what multiples to give to stocks to equities and ability to repay debt for companies as well, capital markets can get get impacted further lag here by by decreasing earnings and some of these dynamics finally flowing through. Alright, that's great stuff. The transcript editor and avidale asset management founder Scott Kraseloff, appreciate it man. Thanks. I hope you enjoyed the details for your next.",https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=x_oQWsK-sM4,78,2022-10-24 19:35:17
3997," What are you doing, D winner? I'm going to make sure to break everything down. I'm going to have friends. Yeah, you're having a hard time, he's just sitting there. Do you remember what's going to happen, Ed? Anyway, they're really-, This time for our triple play, three stocks that were watching in the final 25 minutes of trading. We have Starbucks, Atesla and Las Vegas, San's, Jareblicrate on set to help us break down some of these movers. All right, let's start with my pick and that is Starbucks. Shares falling today. One more that China president as Xi Jinping's tighter control is going to lead to the continuation of the COVID-0 approach. The drop today, early on a drop of just around 5% now earlier in the day with the largest single drop that we have seen, single day drop that we have seen in nearly a year. China is a critical market for Starbucks. We've heard that many times from the company that has more than 50s of 100 stores in the region. Shares year to date well in the red. Things are going to be paying very close attention to any further detail that we get on the earnings call from Starbucks next week just in terms of their China business. What this could potentially mean for Starbucks over the coming months. And Jareb, when you take a look at that year-to-day chart, you're looking at shares firmly in the red and we know that it has been a stock that has struggled not only overseas but of course with the sewing economy here in the US too. Yes, and I want to go to the Wi-Fi Interactive where I have the Nasdaq 100 daily heat map here and look at all that nice screen except for the bottom. And I like how all of our picks today are basically around the same theme which is weakness in China because of that big consolidation of power. Here's Starbucks over the last 20 years. Now I just want to show you it's still, here's the good news for the bulls. Let me see if I can draw this trend line ever so haphazardly. But still, I guess on the right side of this trend line, although we have had a very, very big decline here. But in the same vein, I do want to highlight some of the Chinese stocks that are suffering as a result of the weekend action and notably Tesla is going to be among them. Now that is of course a US stock. You can see all that red in your page. I want to go to Tesla now which also has some other news. It lowered the price of its Model 3 in China. By about 5%, you can pick one up for about 37,600. Now over the last year, look at the price action and you can see that is from the upper left to the lower right. It has now exceeded to the downside these lows that we had earlier in the year. So right now, perch at a pretty precarious level, I would say here's a three year chart and you can see now in danger of violating this really big what might be considered a topping formation here. If that is a topping formation, considerable downside remains. However, if it were to launch from here, given all this price history around let's say 170 to 175, 200, could mark a bottom. But only price action can tell Dave. Still let's talk to it was down 47% year to date prior to this news out of China. So you think a lot of the bad news is already baked in there. I've just had a little counter story. Reuters reporting today in Toyota may entirely retool their entire EV program with sites set on catching Tesla. But literally going back to the drawing board which is a fascinating development there. And because we've got a triple play of China's related stocks, mine is LVS, Las Vegas Sands. LVS currently a trending ticker on Yahoo Finance, the stock folding on Xi Jinping securing a third term as Chinese president. This implies a continuation of those strict COVID-19 policies that's proven ruinous for many of these businesses. In particular, the Macau casinos earlier today, officials in the Economic Center of Guangzhou announced that all schools and restaurants will be closed.",https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=x_oQWsK-sM4,79,2022-10-24 19:39:33
3998," Many of these businesses, in particular the Macau casinos earlier today, officials in the Economic Center of Guangzhou announced that all schools and restaurants would be closed to control the sudden rise of positive cases, really a confirmation of the widely held COVID-0 fears. Las Vegas Sands reported third quarter earnings last week, beating revenue expectations. Today, however, shares down 10 percent, though that is climbed back quite a bit from what they were down earlier. And when is also climbed back, some of their losses down less than 4 percent now. They were report Q3 earnings, November 9th, China. Yeah, Dave, I mean it's a worse performer among the peers. We know their exposure because of Macau. How critical that is to their business. We're seeing that reflected in this stock today. What was surprising to me though, when you take a look at analyst ratings on the stock, there is 12 buys, two holds and no sell ratings. So you could, I guess you could make sense if you're taking a look at it from a valuation perspective and that year-to-date drop. But when you take a look at the fact that it's going to be a pretty challenging couple of quarters, maybe ahead for this company, I want to be surprised if maybe we see some downward revisions here over the coming weeks. All right, coming up next, we are looking ahead to a big week for tech, the implications from snaps, disappointing results. What that means for the rest of the sector, mefster. Alright, here's a quick comment, right? Good using the ES Sauce content? Excellent. All right. The price war is in streaming heating up Apple, the latest company to make a change to its strategy, raising the price for Apple TV Plus and Apple Music. Now, the price of Apple TV Plus will now cost $6.99 a month from $4.99. Apple Music is going to go up to $10.99 from $9.99 per month. The company is saying licensing costs are the reason for the increase in rates. It's part of a broader trend that we're seeing across the space, especially in this inflationary environment. Netflix and Disney both raising prices.",https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=x_oQWsK-sM4,80,2022-10-24 19:43:59
3999," for the increase in rates and it's part of a broader trend that we're seeing across the space especially in this inflationary environment. Netflix and Disney both raising prices earlier this year and now both are launching lower tier ad supported packages as well. Apple shares today taking a look at that move is still in the green up just around 1.6%. Well, let's talk about this announcement from Apple and also what we're expecting to hear from some of the earnings from the big tech companies over the next couple of days. And for that, we want to bring in Dan Morgan. He is a centenuous trust a senior portfolio manager. Dan, it's great to see you. So first is your reaction to Apple raising prices here. I think was largely expected. A lot of people were waiting for when they were going to do so. But what do you make of it from an analyst perspective? Well, I mean, it's a very competitive environment and they're trying to offset some of the things that are happening with some of the competitors that you mentioned. We had Netflix last week. We know they're going to an ad tier model. We know Disney is already on one. So it's not surprising that Apple is trying to do what they can to try to leverage that unit. It's not a big part of their business. It's a component in their service side. But it is something that they've been working on to try to grow over a period of time. Dan, of course, it is a huge earnings week. Apple among them reporting, Amazon, Meta, Alphabet, you name it just about all the big heavy weights. And the question being as we lead in is what have we learned from SNAP? Does there issue more of a SNAP problem or an entire environment problem? They're now down more than 80% year to date, although interestingly, back up 8% today. So what did we learn from SNAP that we'll see later in the week? Dave, I think the SNAP report came in overall ad revenues, which is basically their revenue component was up 6%. They did beat and daily average users. But it does give us a window into obviously Meta, we're expecting them to report about a 5% drop in ad revenues. We've got Alphabet coming in tomorrow. They're expected to report about a 6% growth rate in ad revenues, very similar to SNAP. And then it rolls into other companies like Twitter. You've got Amazon and so forth in the ad revenue space. So I think it is an indication and it basically just gives more evidence that we continue to see a slow down in terms of ad spend on the internet. I think you're going to see those reflective in both Alphabet and Meta's numbers on Tuesday and Wednesday. And then speaking of Meta Bank of America downgrading the stock today, in part due to that pullback that we would likely see in advertising spending, what that could mean here for the company going forward. Year to date, the stock is off just over 60%. They certainly had a hard time selling their metaverse vision to Wall Street. What needs to happen in order for Wall Street to get on board with Meta's vision? What's a tough vision, Shawna, because we know they switched the reporting segments around a couple quarters ago. They have their reality labs group. They're very big on their virtual reality headgear. They're trying to put a lot into that. You talked about the movement towards metaverse. And you know what? We just don't know if that's going to pay off, right? We know what their bread and butter is. It's selling advertising over the internet. It's keeping people engaged, it's increasing their monthly and daily average users. So Wall Street just got to kind of embrace going forward whether this strategy is going to pay off. And you know, let's face it, Meta is not in the same position that AlphaBet it is. They don't have a GCP. They don't have an entry in the data center space. So it's a big question, guys, whether this is going to pay off for them or they are just going to kind of slowly go down as ad spend rates deaccelerate. Any collateral damage to AlphaBet and the stories that we've talked about? What are your expectations for them this week? Just the snap report, obviously rolling in, but I would expect good things in regards to their GCP business. Data center should be strong. AWS should grow 30%. We're looking for GCP at about 33%. Azer which is Microsoft, that should go up about 43%. We know that they've had some struggles with their YouTube franchise, the last two quarters, competition from TikTok, also privacy rule changes with iOS. But if they can leverage their GCP business to try to offset some of that slower demand in terms of ad revenues, they should come out okay. And hopefully post revenues about 10% growth. Live it a week.",https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=x_oQWsK-sM4,81,2022-10-24 19:48:00
4000," to try to offset some of that slower demand in terms of ad revenues, they should come out okay and hopefully post revenues of about 10 percent growth. Pivotal week in Big Tech, Dan Morgan, thanks so much for your analysis, appreciate all that. All right, what are the limits of cancel culture? With every passing day and every deplorable anti-Semitic comment, Kanye West is testing its limits to the Italian agency CIA, cutting ties with Kanye, fashion powerhouse Balenciaga, did the same last week, Kanye ended his deal with Gap last month, Gap Brands decided to quote, wind down at the partnership in their eyes because their vision was not aligned. What about Adidas though? That is the question, the hashtag boycottadidas is spreading on social media, but still nothing from the global shoe giant that's home to Yeezy Steakers. Kanye said recently on a podcast, I can say anti-Semitic things and Adidas can't drop me and quote, why can't they drop them? Well, if that's the truth, it's because Morningstar analyst David Schwartz estimates Yeezy sales are around $2 billion annually. That is 10 percent of Adidas sales. So Shana, it's easy to sit here in this seat on the financial journalist side of things and say, you have to cut ties with someone making these disgusting, deplorable comments day after day, but it ain't that easy when you're the CEO, when you're sitting in the C-suite and you know Yeezy Steakers are your window into a demographic you cannot otherwise touch, let alone 10 percent of your sales. I guess you can make that argument for now. One, I do think this backlash is going to pick up. I think Adidas is already under a tremendous amount of pressure to sever their ties with Kanye West. I am surprised that they haven't been more outspoken about this issue. The only thing that they have said is that their partnership is under review. And that was a couple of weeks ago. We've heard that Kanye West continued to make these types of antisemitic comments over the past couple of weeks here in terms of what this could mean for sales. I know you don't agree with me on this, but I would not be surprised if we do see a drop off in these sales of Kanye's, of Yeezy Shows when it comes to Adidas. Yes, right now the Morningstar analyst estimated that it makes up about 10 percent of Adidas's sales. Cowan was out with another estimate more recently saying that they expected to be around 8 percent of Adidas's sales. But maybe we will see the consumers speak up and the consumer no longer willing to buy Yeezy's brand, willing to spend the money on his products. And of course that could also have a massive impact on Adidas. If in fact they do sit there and do nothing. Don't get me wrong. I hope you're right. I know. I fear you're wrong. I do have a window into Yeezy buyers, the teenagers that I know still love these sneakers. They are not as socially conscious as you might hope. They are teenagers. They are busy and these sneakers are a status symbol whether we like it or not. Now hopefully the pressure comes from the private sector and there are forced to do something, at least say something, Adidas, that you condemn these morally reprehensible comments. If you're not going to sever said relationship, that deal goes through 2026. It's got a lot of legs left on it. A lot of people stop buying these sneakers, they just came out with the new color and the past couple of days I'm not entirely sold on that. But it will be one of the biggest stories in business in the weeks ahead. Coming up, we're learning more about the US Amoxicillin shortage that details after the break.

4001," GLORIA. three of the top four makers of a Moxasillian are reporting a supply shortages across the US Yahoo finances. Angela Kim Lonnie's been following the story for us and on what's the latest? That's right, Chana. As we know last week, we started off with just a select shortages in certain pharmacies, but it's grown to a little bit of still a sporadic but nationwide shortage of a Moxasillian specifically the doses that are needed in liquid form for children. So the pediatric use of this drug that anti-bacterial there. We're looking at, sorry, antibiotic. We're looking at specifically the makers, Hickma, Tava and Sandos, which is a Novartis company. All three of those are the ones that have reported shortages or shortages have been reported for them either by the FDA or other sources. And while there is efforts to sort of plug the holes there are, like the antibiotic situation where, for example, CBS has reported shortages, but Walmart has not. So it is quite a mixed bag of a situation right now, and we know that at least the regulatory body is keeping an eye on it. And the backstory is a little bit of what you might expect with, you know, all the world situation right now where it comes to supply chain issues, raw material shortages and the like and high energy costs all really much more than the market situation. As I said right now, still sporadic situation, but keeping an eye on it. All right, Audrey also the recent spike in RSV cases has been alarming in particular with children's hospitals. And I went hard for Connecticut. And absolute tobacco. What's the latest? That's right. You're hearing about pediatric hospitals filling up and needing beds. This is something that is kind of like the most important thing in the world. And I think that we're seeing in the with the same level of aggression and does affect individuals we've seen annually on average 58,000 hospitalization in kids and roughly 100 to 150 deaths reported each year. And that is the concern health experts have been warning about what could be a tri-demic this winter and we're already starting to see it a little bit with the RSV as well as the health care system. And the danger for kids, of course, under five is that this can present just like COVID as well as flew. So it is hard to figure out with an at home test. There is no at home test for that right now. And it's one of those things that's really pressuring the health care system as we speak.",https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=x_oQWsK-sM4,83,2022-10-24 19:57:11

Certainly an alarming surge in the number of cases. And Angelica Mlani, thanks so much. Well, coming up, we are counting down to the closing bell on Wall Street. You're still looking at gains across the board. Dow of 376 points, S&B Nasdaq also in the green. We'll be right back. That's enough. I'm going to do a little bit more of this. I'm going to do a little bit more of this. I'm going to do a little bit more of this. I'm going to do a little bit more of this. I'm going to do a little bit more of this. I'm going to do a little bit more of this. I'm going to do a little bit more of this. I'm going to do a little bit more of this. We're just minutes away from the closing bell. Let's bring in a Jared Blyckery for a closer look at some of the gains that we're seeing this afternoon. That's right, Sean. We have the Dow leading the way. That's up 1.3%, roughly, SMB 500, a little bit less. Nasdaq lagging. It's up about 8% of a percent. We're not for the route in Chinese stocks. I think it would be a bit higher. We'll get to that in a second. First, we want to check out our sector action. Healthcare is still in the lead here, followed by staples, tech, industrials, financials. All of those outperforming. All of those up more than 1% to the downside. Materials in real estate. Those are the only two in the red. Let me just check out some of our leaders here to the upside. The transports, that is the top spot, DJT, rocking in about 3% today, followed by homebuilders, retail and value stocks. Also momentum outperforming. All of those above the SMB 500 to the downside. Guess what stands out? K-web. That is a Chinese internet ETF. That is often astounding 14% emerging markets. A lot of that is China. That's down over 3% and cannabis stocks as well. Let's get straight to the action one more time before. It looks like we got less than 30 seconds to the bell. JD.com, down 13%, Pinduoduo, off about 1 quarter of its entire value. All of the above it down 12% there. Now, closing in on the other with the travel sector. We can see it's kind of a mix board here. Delta up 2% united. Delta up over 3.5%.",https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=x_oQWsK-sM4,84,2022-10-24 20:01:03
4003," Now, closing in on the other with the travel sector, we can see it's kind of a mixboard here delta up 2% united up a workday in the half. Alright, that'll do it. There's your closing bell on Wall Street. Let's check out the markets as the Dow is Jared just told us solid rise 1.34% up more than 400 points. The NASDAQ has solid gained just under 1% for 93 points and the S&P up 1.2% after an incredible week, really up 4.7% last week the best week since June for a closer look at the broader markets. Let's bring in a Lestio DeLongis, Invest Go investment solution, Senior Portfolio Manager and Megan Horniman, Verdun's Capital Advisors Chief Investment Officer. Nice to see you both. Megan will start with you. What do you make of the rally that really persisted through last week? And continue today despite the macro outlook? I think there's a couple things. Keep in mind that we came into earning season with earnings being downgraded for the third quarter by a pretty significant amount. So, you know, any there I think there was a lot of the pessimism already priced in there and I think earnings have come in a little bit better than expected. And then when you look at economic data, yeah, this is kind of one of those stories where you know bad news can be good news. And the economic data has been pretty dismal and that has people now looking at possibly the Fed to slow down in their interest rate hikes, possibly as early as December. Well, let's say what do you think of the gains that we've seen recently coming off the best week that we've had since June pushing further to the upside today? Do you think these gains are going to last? Yeah, I agree with the assessment. I think these gains are largely reflecting expectations relative to sentiment going into earnings season, but the revisions and the guidance on future earnings are actually more more worrisome. So, as we have outlined in the past, we think this is a good opportunity to use these rallies to lighten up the risk in the portfolio and take advantage of to become a little bit more defensive. So, we don't expect these gains or at least these pace of gains to hold in the near future, but markets to resume a little bit more of a choppy high risk behavior. And Megan, we've had many a guests come on this program and say we think the S&P is going to fall 20% from here. What do you think is around the bend? Yeah, I don't necessarily think that we're going to see another 20% from here. Keep in mind that even though we've had a bit of a rally here recently, we were basically trading around the historical average that you tend to see with bear markets. So, we don't think we're going to fall another 20% from here. Can we go back and retest the lows for short? There's a lot of economic data coming out this week. There's a lot of earnings coming out this week. We have political uncertainty coming up with the midterm elections. So, there is a possibility that we'll see volatility, but keep in mind is well that volatility comes in both forms. And we're kind of seeing that lately. It can be volatility to the upside and volatility to the downside. So, in this situation, you've got to understand you're not going to be able to find in time perfectly the bottom of this bear market instead focus on the long term. And what we do tend to see is whether it's positive seasonality in the fourth quarter of a calendar year, or whether it's positive seasonality in the year after a midterm election. But I think that these are things that you have to take into consideration as you look for the long term and focus on what we've seen and what's pricing in that peak pessimism already. Let's say we just heard Megan quickly mentioned earnings. Let's talk about what we've seen so far because up until this point, we've had about 20% of the S&P that have reported earnings about 72% topping estimates. But we know that bar was set extremely low. I guess what's your assessment for of the result that we've gotten so far and what that could mean that we will likely see over the coming weeks? I think the results are encouraging, but they're also back we're looking and we shouldn't really put too much emphasis on them. The results for the summer months are yet to really reflect what is the perspective impact of the massive tightening in financial conditions and monetary policy that we have seen over the last few months as we know monetary policy operates with variable lags and",https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=x_oQWsK-sM4,85,2022-10-24 20:05:18
4004," massive tightening in financial conditions and monetary policy that we have seen over the last few months. As we know, monetary policy operates with variable lags. And so what is more important is to look at how earnings revisions are evolving. What is the guidance? And on that front, the news is a little bit more defensive, I would say. I think we need to prepare. We have been arguing for a using episodes like this quarter or this earning season to really move on with the rotation out of cyclicals into more defensive sectors of the market, be it healthcare, communication services, even information technology, high tech, mega companies tend to have more of a quality bias or not as cyclical as they used to be. But certainly a defensive orientation. And we think that the dynamic in bond yields should peak soon and provide some relief to these defensive sectors. And Megan, let's stay there with your, how do you position yourself given the situation ahead? Well, I think that I do agree with the guests that there is some room for downward revisions to earnings for next calendar year. I do agree with that, but I think that's going to be focused more in that high growth technology sector. I don't think that the interest rate increase that we've seen and the potential for the future interest rate increases is fully priced into those areas. So we would be careful with that growth technology side of the market. We think there's still some more room in what we consider price discovery there. Instead, we would look at obviously from the large cap space in the value area. And then also look at some areas of the market that have already priced in what we think is is going to be a volatile environment and a challenging economic environment. Look at small and big cap stocks. These areas of the market are still down 30, 40 percent from their 52 week high. These have priced in a lot of that downside. Plus, you've seen a pretty big decline in earnings expectations in those areas. So valuations, we think are very fair value and we would focus on those areas of the market. Let's quickly talk about the geopolitical risk. Because when you look over to Europe, the recession that's likely playing out over there, the uncertainty when it comes to the UK. And then the news today on China, obviously that's adding some uncertainty here to the markets. What's your assessment just in terms of how big of a risk that is potentially for US investors? Well, US investors have over the last decade enjoyed the benefit of the US being the lead, the leader in global markets performance. And that's been true everywhere. So that home bias has reflected itself. We don't see US investors having a outsized exposure to international stocks or emerging markets stocks. So from a wealth preservation standpoint, I think the direct exposure has been lower compared to say the pre-GFC time where there was really a ramp up in emerging markets, equities and fixed income exposure. We don't see that today. With that being said, emerging markets are always your best bell weather of the highest propensity to take risk in capital markets. When emerging markets suffer the way they do, it is a reminder that we don't see that the ampole liquidity support and unconditional propensity of investors to take risk. Investors are not seeking to increase risk in their portfolio. They're seeking to consolidate risk, especially when they see cash rates at 4%. Investment grade quality at 5% at 6%. I think this is a reminder of a catalyst of a gradual rotation out of equities into fixed income. Now the fixed income assets offer yields that we haven't seen in nearly 20 years. All right, let's say it's a longest and Megan Hurneman, thanks so much for joining us this afternoon. All right, well, coming up next, the man said to be UK's new prime minister may also be the first major leader to be a crypto bull.

4005," vão The U.S.-South-E relations on the brink rising tensions between President Biden and Saudi crown prince Mohammed bin Salman, putting the longstanding relationship between the two countries at risk. We want to bring Yahoo Finance, senior columnist Rick Newman joining us now with the latest. Hey there, Rick. So even though relationship obviously between Saudi Arabia and U.S. not at the best, we are expected to see a number of U.S. business leaders make their trip to Saudi Arabia later this week. Right. This is a three day. It's kind of a business and networking event similar to the Davos event that we attend. This is focused on the Middle East. And the idea is to generate business activity, business deals, Saudi Arabia is trying to diversify its economy beyond fossil fuels. And that's part of why they kicked this off. This conference was not controversial until four years ago when we now know the crown prince of Saudi Arabia, Mohammed bin Salman ordered the execution and dismemberment of journalist Jamal Kashoggi in Turkey. And since then there's been a lot of pressure on Western companies and American companies in particular to basically boycott this event. But I guess that pressure is fading because we're going to see CEOs of many of the big U.S. banks and some other companies attending this event. And of course this comes as the United States has been asking Saudi Arabia and other OPEC nations to produce more oil to put pressure on Russia in its war on Ukraine, but they had said recently no, they're going to do the opposite. They're going to produce less oil. So that has generated a lot of apparent visible friction between Washington and Riyadh, President Biden said there will be consequences for Saudi Arabia, basically engineering this cut in production, but no word yet on what those consequences are. Meanwhile, there's a big business fet in Saudi Arabia. Yeah, the consequences we've heard a little bit about the potential for stopping arms sales to Saudis. I am guessing Lockheed Martin and Raytheon had a little something to say about that, but we don't know the behind the scenes, but these just aren't any executives. We're talking JP Morgan.",https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=x_oQWsK-sM4,87,2022-10-24 20:14:26
4006," I am guessing Lockheed Martin and Raytheon had a little something to say about that, but we don't know the behind the scenes, but these just aren't any executives. We're talking JP Morgan, Goldman and Wells CEOs, Blackstone and Bridgewater CEOs, arguably some of the biggest in the world. But let's get back to oil. Has any of this back and forth, the OPEC plus move, changed the price of oil? Move the needle. Well, it's not a disaster for those of us in oil consuming nations. So I think when OPEC said it was going to cut production, there was an expectation that we'd see a bump in oil prices and we didn't. So if we did, it was very temporary. So last time I looked, what is oil around $82 a barrel? That's tolerable. I guess you could argue that if the Saudis and the other OPEC plus nations were continuing production at current levels. And remember, this is a gradual drop-off in production, not a one-time overnight drop-off. I guess we'd see oil prices lower. But President Biden has, he has been able to watch his gas prices, gasoline prices have fallen from $5 a gallon in June. They're now around $3.80. I mean, that is a dramatic improvement in gas prices. Of course, everybody would love for gasoline to be $1 per gallon, but we're never going to go back to those days. So I mean, this hasn't turned into like a crisis for Biden. I think it's just an irritant at this point. No doubt about that, but not apparently much sway with the big bank CEOs. I guess. At least not on paper right now. Rick Newman, good to see you, sir. Thank you. I guess. All right, incoming UK Prime Minister Rishi Sunak is the youngest PM in modern history. He's the first to do in first person of color to lead the UK. Will he also be the first crypto-bro leader, David Holler with here with that story? I know crypto-bro may not be the correct term, maybe it's crypto-bro, David, but is that the deal? Yeah, I mean, the former finance ministers, New Girl is leader of the UK's conservative party. Obviously, PAPES is way to becoming the Prime Minister. And this is interesting in the fact that just back in April, under as part of Boris Johnson's cabinet. Sunak proposed a series of initiatives to make the UK more crypto-friendly. This included sort of pushing forward a new law that would allow dollar pegs, stablecoins to be used in everyday payments and also asking the UK's royal mint to well, mint an NFT. And in preparation, he has actually met with members of the more of the venture community side of crypto. And also done round tables with other crypto companies such as asset manager, Bitwise, and Salona Labs. So we're looking at a politician here, I think, at the bare minimum, who has a lot more direct exposure to the crypto industry than say most world leaders. So this is obviously a very interesting development from that standpoint. It could potentially be very bullish here. Four crypto, at least in the longer term. What do you think, though, does this mean just in terms of the odds of making the UK a crypto hub? Yeah, I mean, I think, Sean, it's, you know, I think a lot of this does become a marketing thing, you know, where a country wants to sort of tout, you know, what they can do. We've seen this with, you know, smaller cities in the US, for example. And obviously, the US itself has also been pushing forward with crypto with Biden ever since Biden's executive order on cryptocurrency. But that being said, I think that really what the industry and regulators want to see is some sort of clarification on regulations. Now, whether those regulations are tougher or more friendly is sort of what it comes down to. And sort of taking a step back, Sunnack obviously is inheriting, you know, increasing financial stability concerns in the UK, you know, ever since we've seen trouble with the British pound. So I think right now, you know, it is, it might be a little bit early to expect any sort of, you know, extreme sort of.",https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=x_oQWsK-sM4,88,2022-10-24 20:18:24
4007," So I think right now, it might be a little bit early to expect any extreme policy recoveries sort of of what he talked about back in April before the crypto market showed its own example of financial instability. But I think it's definitely on the menu down the line and it does build well for the UK more broadly in terms of its fintech industry. Yeah, given the recent crypto fall, I don't think now is the best time to be making risky plays after the 44 day interim Liz Truss term. So David Holler, interesting stuff though. We'll keep our eyes on that. Appreciate the story. Get your popcorn ready folks will break down black atoms performance at the box office this weekend. That's a big rock film. There he is.

4008," Fortability challenges really rain on buyers' budgets and sellers' decisions on whether or not to list their homes. We're going to continue to see affordability constraints and in constrained inventory throughout the next year in this housing market. Nicole, you just mentioned constrained inventory. I guess you don't expect that to improve anytime soon, taking a longer-term outlook maybe year to years, three years down the line. When do you expect to see that balance return when it comes to supply versus demand? Well, when we look at where inventory is at right now, we're not anywhere near where we were before the pandemic and I don't think we're going to get back to that point anytime soon. We're still seeing new construction at a higher level than it was pre-pandemic, but it's pulled back quite a bit from the 2021 highs when the construction market was really booming. Now that affordability has started to hit both buyers and sellers, we're seeing a lot of existing homeowners locked into their current interest rates. That's going to lead to lower new homes coming onto the market from those existing inventory stock. That's going to lead to more inventory constraints and with the large number of demand, the people who want to be buying homes, if those homes are affordable, that's not going anywhere. This constraint inventory is really what's going to be keeping affordability pressures on the market and keeping prices from dipping down too low. Some pretty dire predictions though about the expected fall of home prices, one from the National Association of Realtors said, 20% drop in home values next year. Are you buying that? I don't think we're going to see anything near those extreme levels of price drops. We're going to continue to see these small declines throughout the rest of this year as the rebalancing takes place. But again, because we're going to see such low levels of inventory, that will likely keep us from seeing too low of drops of those home prices. So, especially when we look at the fact that home values are still up over 40% from where they were in 2019 at this time in that year. And so, existing homeowners still have a huge swath of equity that they've gained over the last couple of years. And the majority of that is likely not going to go anywhere. So to be clear, when you say rebalancing, no one's going to lose value in their home compared to 2019 levels, just coming down a bit from record highs. Yeah, for the majority of markets, we're just going to see this kind of smoothing out from where we're at right now. And especially in terms of affordability, markets that have seen the biggest borsening of affordability, right? When you look at local incomes versus where mortgage rates are taking current mortgage payments, the markets where we see the biggest increase in that affordability burden, that's where we're going to see prices coming down the most. But it's not likely going to be anywhere near the amount of appreciation we've seen in the past two and a half years. Mortgage rates, of course, are the story of 30 or fixed right now, averaging 6, 9, 4, up slightly from the week prior, but more than double from a year prior. How high do you think they'll get? The Fed still has what appears to be a 75 point hike if not a 50 after that in December. And some field mortgage rates could eclipse 8%. Yeah, it's absolutely. It's very challenging to estimate where exactly we're going to see mortgage rates going. There are a lot of factors that influence mortgage rate changes. We know that rates are likely going to stay much higher than those pandemic error lows. And so we're not going to be expecting to return anywhere near 3% anytime soon. So when looking at the next couple of months to the next couple of years, we're likely looking at higher rates than we had when there was this big frenzied housing market. And we're likely not going to return to that because the supportability challenge is going to be existing. Even if rates went down to 5%, we're still going to see affordability challenges with current home prices. And if rates get any higher, affordability is going to be a major challenge for most households. So that's likely not going to change much as rates are fluctuating throughout this year. Do we see 8% or 5% first? Yeah, that's really hard to tell. I think rates are likely going to stick around the level that they're at now with minor fluctuations, but it's really difficult to pin that down. Yeah, more reliant on the 10 year than they are the exact correlation to Fed Hikes. Rent has been a different story. It appears we're seeing a little leveling out. What are you seeing in the data? Yes, so rents are definitely strong compared to where they were pre-pandemic. Even as the four sales side of the market is softening, we're still seeing rents being pretty strong in terms of...",https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=x_oQWsK-sM4,90,2022-10-24 20:27:05
4009," Friends are definitely strong compared to where they were, you know, pre-pandemic. Even as the four sales side of the market is softening, we're still seeing rents being pretty strong in terms of rent growth and rent price levels. It's actually cheaper in most markets to rent than it is to pay for a monthly mortgage payment. And that's definitely weighing on people's decision-making of, you know, should I rent or should I buy? We're seeing a lot of people, you know, who are being priced out of the four- sale market, going back to rentals, and that's gonna boost demand for that market. We're seeing gluelow vacancy rates. We're seeing new construction builders switching over to multifamily properties, which will help reduce some of that burden. But it's likely that rent growth is gonna stay high, especially compared to the appreciation levels that we saw pre-pandemic. You know, we've got the biggest level of multifamily construction going on since the mid-1970s. So that is certainly a good rental news story. Are there sectors, regions of the country, or even cities, Nicole, that you think might not apply to that balancing out rule that might be actually a jeopardy of losing a lot of home value in the year ahead? What we're seeing is markets that have seen the biggest change in affordability over home prices are slowing down and dropping the most. That's mostly in the western half of the United States. Everything from Austin, which experience, you know, near 50% annual appreciation during the pandemic, over to Phoenix and San Francisco. All of those markets are seeing pretty significant declines in prices over the past couple of months. But again, nowhere near the level of appreciation that we saw since 2019. So even though we're seeing, you know, maybe 2% drops in Phoenix the last couple of months in a row, that's not eating into that 60% growth we've seen since 2019. Yeah, you just worry about those people that bought at the pandemic peaks and made some point realize they could be underwater. But hopefully we do not see that level in the cold, but show we really appreciate you being with us. Thank you so much ahead. All right, now let's talk to the box office, actually, roaring back in 2022. Thanks to movies like Top Gun Maverick and Minions, The Rise of Groo. Well, last weekend, Dwayne, The Rock, Johnson's new action movie, Black Adam also turned out to be a box office blowout. My son sacrificed his life to save me. Oh, my God! Oh, a fire! Oh, my God! Oh, my God! Oh, my God! Oh, my God! Now, I kneel before no one. The Rock, our Yahoo Finance is Ali Canal here with us to talk about the weekend performance. Ali, I'm checking out Rotten Tomatoes. I don't know that I've ever seen a spread like this. The audience says 90% the critics say 39. How to do? Ooh, I know. And you know what? That's an interesting spread as well, because we've been seeing the critics be more harsh to some of these types of movies where the audience score tends to be a little higher. But overall though, pretty strong weekend, if we take a look at the numbers, Black Adam delivered a very big opening weekend, 67 million in its domestic debut. And the first film since July to top 50 million, this is great news for Warner Brothers, which has been really committed to reviving the DC franchise to better compete with Disney's Marvel franchise. And obviously, great news for The Rock as well. This film delivering his best domestic opening as a leading man, a long time coming from him. And according to the studio, premium formats. So I'm X screens, they accounted for about 44% of overall domestic ticket sales. So another sign when it comes to strong box office appetite as those types of tickets tend to be a bit more expensive. Now elsewhere at the box office, we had George Clooney and Julia Roberts ticket to Paradise. That's all domestic debut that topped 16 million bucks. Expectations were set in the low to mid teens. So another B on industry estimates there. Analysts that I've spoken with so that this romcom could have some potential staying power through the holidays, even through the end of this year as these types of films tend to play the long game when it comes to ticket sales. But obviously, as strong keys can be made, especially when we think about those reviews. And depending on the genre, of course, that you have an A-list star audiences are going to show up. Year to date, box office attendant levels are still down about 30% compared to pre-pandemic times. However, the amount of movies is also significantly down.",https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=x_oQWsK-sM4,91,2022-10-24 20:31:27
4010," day box office attendant levels are still down about 30% compared to pre pandemic times. However, the amount of movies is also significantly down. So that's really important to think about. We just have a little more than one third of what we saw in 2019. And that's been the biggest uphill battle for theaters. And that's not going to really improve until 2023. We only have three big releases that will take us through the end of the year. We have Black Panther, while Conza forever that's out November 11th. Disney Strange World is out November 23rd. And then Avatar the way of water on December 16th. So those are the big three that are going to take us to 2023. But I don't think we're going to see that type of recovery that we want to until next year. Probably not. I'm looking forward to that George Clooney Julia Roberts. I'm a wrong confan, Ali. I have no problem admitting that. I'll see it. Ali, can I go to see you? Thank you. All right, more Americans are expected to take to the skies this holiday season. Is it too late to score a deal? Find out after the break. American or eager to travel. That's the clear takeaway from airline executive so far this quarter. And that willingness to spend doesn't seem to be slowing down at least anytime soon. Delta highlighted the strong appetite on its recent earnings call telling analysts that demand for the entire holiday period is quote very robust. American Airlines, a CFO, Derek Kerr echoed that same sentiment saying that quote, he doesn't see any signs of demand slowing down as we enter into the new year. So for more on this, and what we could expect from the travel industry going forward, we want to bring in Scott Kies, a founder of Scott's cheap flight. So Scott, the earnings calls that we've gotten so far, a lot of the largest US carriers very bullish about travel demand heading",https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=x_oQWsK-sM4,92,2022-10-24 20:36:01
4011," Highs a founder of Scott's cheap flight. So Scott, the earnings calls that we've gotten so far, a lot of the largest US carriers, very bullish about travel demand heading into the holiday season even beyond into 2023. Is that consistent with what you're seeing on your site? Yeah, absolutely. Look, we're seeing a really, really strong amount of travel demand going forward into the holiday season. The number of people that are looking to take vacations or visit family and relatives is as high if not higher than it was pre-pandemic. And the reason why we still don't see passenger numbers quite at pre-pandemic levels is that business travel is still down about 25%. So the makeup of folks on a plane right now, which are actually fuller today than they were in 2019 because of fewer flights in the air, is skewed towards vacationers and leisure travelers and away from those business travelers. Are you talking business travelers? You talk leisure travelers, but we hear from all these CEOs is this blended travel concept. And I know some call it bleezer. Is that something you're able to track? You're able to see in the amount of demand? Yeah, look, I think there is some amount of bleezer that's happening today in a way that it hadn't pre-pandemic because it's so much more common or acceptable to be doing remote work, to be flying out on a Thursday, work on Thursday and Friday. And then have vacation in through your weekend. That is a kind of tested and proven model today in a way that it wasn't in 2018 or 2019. But the fact is still that airlines would far prefer to have a business traveler than a leisure traveler because business travelers tend to pay more for their flights. They will, you know, they're far more valuable than a given vacation traveler who purchases a ticket out of their own funds and therefore is more price sensitive. So even with the rise in bleezer travel, I still don't think that's an equal substitute for airlines from a business perspective. They're probably still losing out in that trade and still hoping for a more full recovery of business travel to come. And Scott, when you take a look at the rebound that we're seeing carriers are in a tough spot because they're having trouble adding to routes because of the labor shortage, also the plane shortages, adding some complications there. I guess from your assessment, are we seeing any improvement on this front? You know, gradual. It's a bit by bit piece by piece type of improvement because the fact is that pilots, not to mention all, you know, mechanics and other aspects of air travel that normally don't think much about, but pilots is not an entry level job. It's something that takes months, years of training, you know, tens, hundreds of thousands of dollars to go through the process and 1500 hours of cockpit time before you can be certified to fly commercial jets in the United States and that takes time to try to train up new pilots, especially given the thousands and thousands of pilot shortage that we are facing at the moment. And so like this is something that impacts smaller airports and more regional carriers more than folks in, let's say New York or LA or Chicago, but it has an impact across the board and is leading to higher fares today than we would have seen in a parallel universe where the number of pilots had kept pace with where we were heading on a pre-pandemic trend level. Yeah, fears are some of these smaller destinations will disappear entirely from some of the regional airlines. So you talk about fewer pilots and fewer planes, adds up to scarcity, how far our price is up, how much is inflation factoring in to the airline picture? Yeah, look, it is quite a bit compared to last year, 2021, it's up over 25% air fare levels. But when you zoom out a little bit further and adjust for inflation, it actually looks like it's basically in line with pre-pandemic trends when it comes to air fare that we have been on a gradual downward slide in overall air fare cost starting in around 2014, 2015. And it's just been gradually getting cheaper and cheaper on a real dollar basis. And so while it had quite a few swings over the past couple of years, really dropping in 2020, rising up pretty rapidly this spring, it seemed to have evened out now. And I think for the first time since the pandemic began, we can say that the outlook for...",https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=x_oQWsK-sM4,93,2022-10-24 20:40:02
4012," dropping in 2020, rising up pretty rapidly this spring. It seemed to have evened out now. And I think for the first time since the pandemic began, we can say that the outlook for airfare looks something basically normal. It looks pretty close to what we saw pre pandemic, which means that a lot of those winter holiday flights or peak summer flights are going to be in many cases eye-poppingly expensive. But that was the case in 2018 and 2019 as well. What a pros, Scott, you put it on a T for me. So it's holiday travel time. Is it too late to score yourself a deal? If not, how do we do it? So a couple thoughts here. It's not too late, but it's getting too late. Not you generally want to try to avoid last minute flights because they tend to be quite a bit more expensive, but not all last minute flights are equal. A flight booked a day before travel is almost certainly going to be more expensive than a flight booked a week before travel. And that's almost certainly going to be more expensive than a flight booked a month before travel. So you want to try to book sooner rather than later. You want to remember that last minute flights tend to go in one direction when it comes to prices and it's not down. But the other thing that I would add is that Thanksgiving, in particular, if you got the week off work or the kids are out of school, it is the hidden best week for international travel. Folks don't think of Thanksgiving as a cheap time to fly, but that's because most folks are traveling domestically where Thanksgiving is a big holiday. Internationally, it is not a holiday and late November is very much low season. That's what I took a look just before coming on. If you live in New York City right now, flights over Thanksgiving cost the same to fly to Milan in northern Italy, 548 bucks round trip, as it cost to fly to Fargo in North Dakota. I, nothing against the Midwest, I grew up there, I loved the place. I would rather spend Thanksgiving in Italy than in North Dakota. Oh man, Fargo's coming for you, Scott. I don't know. Italy, Fargo, I've been to Fargo. It's a nice place. Scott, Kai, good stuff. Scott's cheap flights. You're placed to find those last minute deals. Sean, I don't know. Fargo is coming for him. There it is. I think I'm with Scott on that one. I don't know if I'd say it though. I'm earning's beat for Italy. Exactly. All right, let's take a look at some of these act hours. Movers, we have four free. We have Twitter, Discover Financial, Qualtrics, and Cadence Design. Let's kick it off with Twitter, some breaking news here within the last just couple of minutes when asked whether the Biden administration is putting Elon Musk's acquisition of Twitter under national security review White House press secretary, Karin Jean Pierre, replying that quote, we've heard those reporting those reporting are not true. We know that Elon Musk has until 5 p.m. Eastern time on Friday to complete his deal to buy Twitter or face a possible trial here. You can see Twitter closing the day up just over 3% over the last three months. If you take a look at that chart, you can see the stock up 29% year to date. We are still in the green. Up just around 9% 19% trading at 51, 52. And we know Musk's deal to buy Twitter was for 44 billion. So we're trading just below that 54 or 20 value. Let's take a look at Discover Financial Services moving to the downside here after hours and earnings miss is what's weighing on the stock EPS totally 354 during the quarter, the estimate out there or at least what the street was looking for was 377. Discover also saying that provision for credit losses totaled 773 million. The SMA was for 430 million. So make sure you think twice about maybe the slowdown that we will potentially see here in this quarter and then into next year. Take a look at Discover Financial year to date that stock off 17%. Let's take a look at Qualtrics International reporting better than expected quarterly results also raising their full year forecast. We're seeing that reflected after hours with the stock up just around 11% a strong sign here about the willingness of enterprise IT to spend at this point here today. It's a totally different story. You can see the stock off 70% over the past three months at least. It has performed okay. I guess we can say at this point as we take a look at the broader market but over the past three months Qualtrics off just around 14%. And wrapping up with cadence design systems another software play here that company boosting its full year adjusted EPS forecast also beating the street's estimates when it comes to earnings a dollar and six cents the estimate out there was for 97 cents over the past.",https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=x_oQWsK-sM4,94,2022-10-24 20:44:21

Better than Qualtrics off just around a 4.5% year to date taking a look at the performance here. The stock off a 14%. Very good. Interesting news on Twitter. Shout out thank you. Big earnings day Tuesday. I'm going to talk to you about the stock off. One of those for Tuesday. We're going to talk to you.

4014," is booming and sometimes scary face of that business is spirit Halloween. The National Retail Chain expanded this year to nearly 1500 stores and even to the silver screen with a new movie that hit theaters last month will show you that in a minute. We are seven days out from the big night and here with us spirit Halloween CEO Steven Silverstein. Steven, good to have you here. Really appreciate it. We are very big Halloween people, Sean. Nice to have you. We're very excited. We've got our plans. I'm just curious. How does one store come to dominate one holiday? I know mother's day belongs to hallmark and the like and maybe Valentine's day. But how did over your 20 years that you come to own this day? Because 20 years ago we identified and said this is what we do. We are so incredibly passionate about Halloween up and down and it's been the commitment of the entire organization to be building a brand. This is not just about a store. This is a story about a brand and a lifestyle. And Steven, speaking of that brand, obviously it's a very strong brand, a very recognizable brand this year. Like Dave just said, open a record 14 or 1,450 retail locations, hiring 35,000 associates doubling that retail presence that you've seen since 2009. Just give us your sense just on expanding in the brick and mortar space and how you're competing with some of those larger e-commerce players. Well, I like to say that you buy online but you shop in a store. What spirit provides in our brick and mortar format is a Halloween experience. You walk through the store you're enveloped. It's a sensory experience. We're coming at you every way we can. Sights and sounds and even smells and taste and touch. And it's a very engaging experience and that's what separates us from any kind of e-commerce experience. But the store itself goes that much further. I've always said if we could want it to charge admission, people would pay because the store is that much fun. And that's what spirit is all about. I've only been five times this year with my three kids. I assume tonight will probably make it six. You're not just an experience. You are a real estate play with those 14, 50 locations. What are you seeing in terms of vacancies, real estate prices? Are you moving away from malls and towards strip malls? What are you seeing in the real estate trends? Well, our choice location is always out actually in strip malls because we come back every year. It's really the visibility of the real estate that's probably most important to us. But as the brand has evolved, people are now starting to look for spirits. So we're getting a little more of an advantage there. But the reality is there's always been a vacancy in the real estate market, even during the paydays. Because once there was real estate was taken up, more would be built. So we're looking at the surplus real estate market and always have. The thing that makes us unique is that we're very flexible about the footprint that we can take. So we like the big box, but we'll take smaller boxes. We'll take car dealerships. We'll take movie theaters. We'll take furniture stores. Anything that really where we have the visibility and the location that work. And Steven, real quick, before we get into the hottest costumes of this season, are you able to find the workers that you need 35,000 seasonal workers? You know, one of the things we pride ourselves on is that we have a tremendous culture in our organization. People love Halloween. And there's this enthusiasm that takes place every year. And so there's an excitement about coming to work at Spirit Halloween because quite frankly, it's fun. And the other thing that I think of the mentality, we're sort of in the gig economy. You know, we're people who are doing lots of different things and then they come to us for a short period of time. And you would be surprised how often they come to us year after year after year. And quite frankly, it's a tremendous experience. And that's multiple times a year. Well, yeah. I mean, your session proves in every way what are speaking of the hot Halloween costumes on your streaming plays quite a big role in that this year. You know, everything influences Halloween costumes, right? Certainly the media, streaming, TV, movies are all part of the influences, but also things that are going on in our environment. And the way I'm looking at this year is kind of interesting, right? We're sort of in that post-COVID where all the reds come out for Halloween everywhere. And so in many ways, there's sort of a...",https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=x_oQWsK-sM4,96,2022-10-24 20:53:04
4015," We're sort of in that post-COVID where all redies come out for Halloween everywhere. And so in many ways there's sort of a reversion to kind of classic Halloween ideas in genres. So what are the leading areas is classic horror licenses. So Chucky and Mike Myers, which is at Halloween Ends, right? That was the last one of that. Fred at Krueger, Friday the 13th, ghost face, scream. I just came out with scream seven or whatever it is. So there's a lot of that that is of great influence. But then of course you go on beyond that and you get into what you see on TV. You mentioned Yellowstone. Yellowstone. Yellowstone. Top Gun is out there, certainly creating us charge. But you know what? The real answers question, I'm asking this question so often. The answer to this question is the best Halloween costume is the one you want to be. And that's the beauty of Halloween. It's so many different places, so many different interpretations horror, it's humor, it's classic, it's fantasy, it's everything. Yeah, as long as you're creative then that is a good costume. That's the only one. See, what have you seen just pricing wise? Because we talk about so much how inflation is hitting nearly every aspect of our lives. Have you been forced to raise prices at all for the costumes this year? Well, the reality that says really impacted what we do is the supply chain. So in our case, you know, that's been, we've seen a real shock. And since we are seasonal retailer, I don't react well to shocks. We're here for the long term. So the reality is we did not take significant price changes this year because that shock is not something that's long term in nature. And I think most of that's going to be coming back to us next year. So we've heard of held the line to the extent that we can. What do you got for me? I saw you bring presents, you got a costume over here. I have presents. I'm inspired. I'm inspired by, I know what your personal interests are. And this is completely unique to you. But we have, we have Dr. Greenweez for you in your pro cannabis. Oh my goodness. You did, Steven did his homework. Wow. That's a creative one. You got one for me? Yeah, for you. For you. And you're going to look lovely. You will look lovely and be the bell of the wall. And the keyly Jones from Ted Blossom. Oh, okay. I actually love Ted Lasso. One of the few shows that I have watched recently. That is beautiful. I like this one. But, but we also, we don't want to leave your family out of this. And family is a very important to Halloween, right? So for your kids, we have the very popular, bluey. Bluey. They have blue. They do. They do. Bluey. They are too old. Oh, bluey is. Oh, you don't? It's a great show. It's actually pretty entertaining for the parents too. I have to tell you. See, Barry, are you going to be dressing up this year? I really should. You don't, man. You're all right. I will now. I will now. I will now. I will now. You don't wait until Saturday. That's a bad idea. Yeah. I know. Everything's going to be sold out. All right, Steven Silverstein. Thanks so much for having on with us. We really appreciate it. All right. We'll be right back. You don't. Thank you so much.",https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=x_oQWsK-sM4,97,2022-10-24 20:57:58

4020, such promise and Weber. I had an interesting story to tell to investors when it came public. I lost so many people during the pandemic picked up and went and bought homes and many for the first time and they needed a grill or they wanted a grill so they bought out there and bought a Weber. So they saw a lot of demand there as well. Here's some yellow finance analysis on why this deal is probably getting served up. Post COVID results for Weber have been dreadful. Their longtime CEO recently left a couple months ago so the news has not been good. A lot of people now that they bought the grill during the pandemic they have not been going out there to buy a new grill. If you bought one a year and a half ago you do not need a new grill right now. Also strong U.S. manufacturing presence for Weber. When you compare Weber to its longtime rival Trigger Weber gets real high marks for having a lot of its manufacturing. Good chunk of it actually here in the United States where Trigger is that is not necessarily the case. They rely a lot more on China. Strong brand name. Everybody knows Weber has been around for decades. Largest player in the space with very very large deals of course with the likes of Home Depot lows and many other distribution outfits. And then lastly more millennials are owning homes. I know the rise in interest rates might shut a lot of millennials out but longer term. It's almost our time to start buying a house and we will need some form of grill and the likely two choices are going to be a Weber or Trigger. Now this comes and this is a good point by our friend Simeon Segal over at BMO Capital Markets. This is just the latest in a string of deals of upstart companies. You have at home group recently acquired you have Casper acquired you have. I won't put I robot in a in the upstart category but it was recently bought by Amazon. But you're starting to see big companies and big financial sponsors kick tires and some of these brands with strong names that have just been routed here in the market. So that is very interesting to see I do suspect you will see more deals and that is of course my take. You have a lot of companies sitting on a lot of excess capital whether it is financial sponsors they have to put this money to work and why not put it to work on a company like Weber with a strong name. And likely a strong long long term outlook once they get past you know the recent challenges. Yeah a lot of strong household names that you were mentioning there in the deal making ether right now beyond meat sausage right there. No. No. Cooking for broke to palm are beyond meat meat reporter. Okay. I'm not touching the beyond meat today but I think for some of the grills that have been bought or have not been bought it's only have not been bought side right now with the replenishment rate that we need to think about too because a lot of their whole government know as well. Look at that girl. Plottersweet rate again. The replenishment rate of your body. Wow. Yes. You can call it. You can call it. We were discussing it with Simeon Seagull. Yes. So with regards to the wholesale partners that they rely on to get these grills into stores if you have stores that are saying hey look people just aren't buying the grills. So we don't need to place an order for more but it's all of the tertiary products around that experience that Weber Trigger you can expect in the leaner. I am giving you power over that name. You create as far as I'm concerned you created that is the grill replenishment rate Brad. It's all yours. I will not I will not push back. Put Dr. LinkedIn profile credit. We're going to get a pulse check on the state of the consumer. We're breaking down consumer confidence on the other side plus UPS delivers the CFO of the region joins us to break down that company's report. That's an interview that you do not want to miss.

4021," 1 foot Welcome back to Yowl Finance. I'm Brian Saozi alongside Brad Smith, Julie Heiming. As the day off, it has been an earnings heavy morning, but let's lock in on some breaking news crossing the wires just about right now as you're seeing all three markets up higher on this. That is consumer confidence, Brad, coming in from the conference board. Yeah, that's right. 102.5 is the reading that we just had come in from the conference board here. And as we're continuing to look through some of the data and get it all refreshed on our side, this is particularly interesting to see how the markets will react to this as we move on throughout the rest of the day right now. The Dow Jones industrial leverage is still seeing that hold on to gains still net positive by about half percent a little bit more than that. The S&P 500 still holding on to gains. That's up by about nine tenths of a percent. And the Nasdaq composite that's been the leader largely throughout the day here. And that's up by about one and a half percent at this point in time. But again, consumer confidence coming in at a reading of 102.5 here this morning. But we're going to continue to see if we get even more of the data that rolls in from this report. And we can add a little bit more context to this as well. Yeah, consumer confidence. Interesting. But I look at these quarters from Coca-Cola, Assurance Williams, these companies are out there raising prices. And the consumers by and large, they've been able to withstand these prices. Yeah. But this is still a miss on what was actually estimated here. We were looking for 105.9. So coming in at 102.5, the markets right now still holding on to some of the move higher. And of course, this is kind of permeated from yesterday's trading activity. And even last week with this little bippity bought bounce, if you want to call it that, where we have seen, of course, in this larger bear market, at least these bounces in the near term. And a larger question of where consumers sit within that. And where the strength of the consumer is, where demand is actually coming in from. And I think that's a lot of really what's spelling out how confident the consumer really is at this point in time. You see demand is far different regardless of with the industries that we're looking at. Demand for travel, far different than demand for even Coca-Cola, as we're talking about. Even though you may see, it actually show up in the results and outpace some of the expectations, the expectations for the companies on the equity front have actually been lowered. So it's a question of, all right, where will the consumer continue to see some of that strength even as we're continuing to discuss the risk of recession too? All right. Let's stay on all things economy and the consumer. Strikingly different tone from shipping giant UPS this morning on its earnings report, compared to longtime rival FedEx. UPS showing good growth in the US and reaffirming its full year guidance ranges.

4022," Horking a fresh, restructuring plan just a few weeks ago, UPS CFO Brian Newman just got off his earnings call and joins us now. Good to see you here. Brian is always just for the lay investor out there. These stories between a UPS and a FedEx are now strikingly different, like I just mentioned. Why do you think you and your team are out executing a FedEx? Hey, Brian, good morning. It's great to see you. Listen, we have a mantra around here, which is control, which you can control. And we've been really focused on doing that over the last couple of quarters. The macros have been challenging domestically and particularly internationally. But we've been focused on with softer volumes across the world, really. How do we ensure we drive the right pricing mix and dynamics and also control the cost by doing that? You protect your margins and deliver to the shareholders. And Brian, I just want to stand that before we jump onto the broader quarter. So you're not out there closing sorting facilities, laying people off, right? I just want to make sure I have it right. So we are tightening the belt. Certainly at the corporate, we spend a lot of money in GNA. We've been tightening the belt there. But we've been doing that for a couple of years trying to right size the business. Carol introduced a better, not bigger strategy to the company. And what that really is, optimize the volume that comes into the system. So it's more profitable and then take the cost down. So we have been certainly right sizing the business over the last couple of years. But no, we're not closing sorting facilities right now. We have the ability to take our variable to set every variable cost down should the case arise. And so where are you seeing continued strength within the business? And the customers that you're servicing right now? That's a great question, Brad. The healthcare segment is a particularly strong one. We're doing very, very well there. The, as you think about the small and medium business, that's been a core focus over the last couple of years. We've been addressing the capabilities that those customers want. And by doing that, you create a wonderful environment for a very profitable customer. So we've been focused on the SMB, small and medium business, the healthcare segment. And then overall, trying to look at that international business because there's lots of growth opportunity there for us. We've been talking a lot about FX headwinds. That companies are seeing right now. When you think about that international business, of course, UPS is going to be rolling out some pricing increases. This also impacts the international segment in December, I believe. And that really going to be reflected as you finally get into 2023 as well. What is your anticipation around where the consumers and the strength that you were just laying out? Where they'll continue to take that price increase? So we announced a price increase for next year at 6.9%. That's supposed to be representative of a combination of inflation as well as the service we provide. So that will help drive the base rate in terms of the pricing equation. As we think about the currency impact that you mentioned, Brett, the currency impact in the quarter was about $82 million. So it is a meaningful headwind on our international business. But we're effectively offsetting that as we manage the portfolio across the domestic business and then across some of the other segments. Brian, I recently spoke to another Brian, Brian Cornell over a target for our all market summit conference last week. You see the holiday season is, is he's expecting to be pretty good? What's your read on things? So Brian and I used to work together at PepsiCoast. So I know him and target is a very important customer for UPS. I actually think it's going to be a decent peak season. We're ramping up right now. We're hiring. We hire over 100,000 people for the peak season to get ready. And with targets, customers like target, we're out there committing to them that we're going to be there with the excellent service that UPS provide. So I think that Brian, the peak season, our peak season volume goes up 50, 60% from a normal run rate. So it is a meaningful increase. But as we think about peak this year, you don't have the low inventory levels that we saw last year, which drove an earlier peak. People were rushing out to buy because they were afraid the inventory wouldn't be there for the holiday season. This year, inventories are much higher at the retail stores. So I think it'll be a bit of a later peak, Brian. All right, competing against Santa Claus like efficiency there in the logistics business. When you think about some of the future investments as well, they're Brian, and going out into next year and even beyond, what are the investments that you would like to see the company get right the first time in order to build a logistical network in a system that can really see its margins excel over the future? So that's a great question, Brad. The digital investments we're making, it's really shifting dynamic of UPS, old school package delivery. To now, it's more of an orchestrator of volume from end to end. We're putting investments into things like RFID technology so that every package in our system will have a code on it.",https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LuX9IXzHLV4,3,2022-10-25 14:08:09
4023," orchestrator of volume from end to end. We're putting investments into things like RFID technology so that every package in our system will have a code on it that we know where it is. And if there's nothing more frustrating for consumers or customers when they lose a package or they have an issue, they want to know where that package is by deploying this kind of technology. We're going to be able to tell people where are your packages and how can we recover and make sure we get them there on time for when the customers want them. And we do that at an incredible mid-90s percent in terms of on-time delivery. Brian, I made this comment earlier in the show before you came on. And I said, UPS is benefiting from, of course, having you as CFO, but also Carol too. Long time CFO, a home depot before she came to you. Am I off base there? Are you guys just looking at the quarter or your business differently than other big public companies? Brian, it's wonderful to have a boss. There used to be a CFO because we have great conversations. But Carol's done an amazing job shifting the culture. So as we think about the future of UPS, the yesterday's UPS is not going to get us tomorrow to where we want to be. We're 115-year-old company. Very proud of our past. But Carol is shifting the company to a place called Better and Boulder. The Boulder is growth and margin improvement. And so where is that going to come from? Areas of basically leaning into the most attractive parts of the market. I mentioned SMB. Margin's are great. It's a very attractive area. Healthcare. That's a high growth, high margin area. International. We're actually number two and three. And a number of markets overseas. So we're focused on stealing revenue share, value share as we call it, and going out there. So we're putting our investments in those areas that will be a credo from an investment perspective. UPS, CFO, Brian Newman. Thanks so much for joining us here this morning and breaking down the most recent quarter. Appreciate it. Thanks, Brian. Brian Brad, thank you. You got it. And everyone, switching gears here, let's take a look at some of the market activity that we've been tracking here. Out of the gate this morning, the Dow Jones Industrial Average, at least about 38 minutes into trading, holding on to gains. And this after what was weaker than expected, consumer confidence reading from the conference board here this morning. But as of right now, the Dow Jones Industrial Average is still up by about 110 points. Also, you've got the NASDAQ composite. That's higher by about 1.4%. And the S&P 500, you're seeing that hold on to gains to the tune of about 8% to 10% here. Also checking in on some of the other activity that we're seeing here on the day. We saw some electric vehicle, well, what category is it? It's electric vehicle earnings that have come out. But GM, really talking about their market share within this most recent quarter, shares are holding on to gains of about 2.4% that electric vehicle market share reaching about 8%. They said in this most recent report, we're also going to get results out from Ford. And that's going to be coming later on this week as well. And so as of right now, holding on to gains of about 1.4% there for Ford 2-Saus. All right, thanks, Brad. Before we head to break, let's flex some cautious comments on Meta into its earnings report on Wednesday from Jeffey Zanel's Brent Phil says that while Meta's stock appears cheap, we believe investors need four key levers to drive the stock higher. One, revenue growth above 2% and guidance of a possible acceleration in the fourth quarter. Two, flat or even declining year of a year expense growth, three, increased focus on the core business away from the metaverse. And four, the re-acceleration of share it repurchases, indeed, a tall order for Meta on its earnings report. Check the label on that dry shampoo. But for a use at this morning, Brad is back with today's top headlines next.",https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LuX9IXzHLV4,4,2022-10-25 14:12:49

4025," but still incredibly high prices, as you just noted, by the increase in final prices for US households, as well as affordability tied to interest rate hikes. So in both cases, we think the consumers will slow down dramatically, leading into a very shallow recession for early next year. Interesting. So with that in mind, where do you believe the mindset of the consumer would be by that point? Well, we're looking at the numbers from a consumer confidence a bit weaker than what we in market had expected. The idea is there that even that we expected a little bit not as extreme, largely because we saw a bit of a pick up in stock market, as well as pooling of gasoline prices. Well, that's not enough for consumers. They're still disappointed. And because it's not just about gasoline, it's about affordability and pretty much all aspects of society, particularly for shelter, not just how purchasing a home, but also renting a home. And that means less money to spend elsewhere. People are squeezed and we do think they'll finally buckle. Bethan, I've really been surprised by how many or how much price increases. A lot of these big companies have been reporting in recent weeks as they've come out with earnings. I continue to double-gen, double-gen increases for products and services, really for the second quarter in a row. When does it stop? When are we beyond these double-digit increases? Well, we're expecting to see eventually one of the reasons the good news about a recession and also the big difference lower prices. And the big question of is, what if consumers do slow down as we expect, that means there's going to be more inventory on businesses' books. So if we do see a sleep slowdown for consumers, then we end up seeing as a lot of inventory used to be unloaded. And unfortunately, that inventory is unloaded at lower prices. So indeed, the fact gets its wish in the end. But of course, there's a cost to both businesses and consumers as well. We've got a lot of companies that have started reporting earnings fast and furious in this most recent quarter. But the forward guidance here is going to be the big question. What are your expectations for where companies will continue to either reiterate their guidance or for some of them? We've already seen at least in the case of SNAP. No, a specific name. But where they might start to say, you know what, we have to either pull back our guidance or just pull it in entirety. And what net impact would that have? Well, speaking from an economic position, again, I don't cover particular industries or companies. But I can say that given this environment, this is a classic overheating situation for the United States, where the Fed has to come in and be incredibly aggressive. Understandably, we have core inflation still at a 40-year high on a year over your basis. So they have to move. And with that said, what I suspect we could see for those businesses that switched from just in time in inventory accumulation to just in case inventory accumulation, that means that they're going to be squeezed. And so I suspect the floor of guidance would be basically what happens to profits when we have to unload all those impenetories. That's where I suspect we can see some activity, particularly for retail, the retail sector who have been holding on to things. But I suppose other areas would be squeezed as well. Within your outlook, Beth Ann, for a mild recession, is the economy shedding jobs? Are we talking about non-farm payroll reports where maybe there's 50,000 jobs should? In our business cycle barometer, the one indicator that is still showing positive, everything else is neutral or negative and extremely negative. But the one area that we're seeing still positive territories in that jobs market that you pointed to, we're looking at job openings coming down, slowing down, but still rather high. So the question is, are businesses canceling that job opening and still want to hold on to those workers? I suspect in certain areas that we're going to see the crunch retail, I mentioned housing. Also, I suspect we're going to see some kind of a cutting of jobs, but overall we suspect a mild impact on jobs. And we do expect to see the unemployment rate rise, but we're looking at something that's going to be by 2024 about 5.5% in normal times. That's what we used to get to. So indeed, we'll see a pickup, but nothing dramatically. Dramatically so. Beth Ann Bovino, S&P Global Ratings, US Chief of Com's always good to see you. We'll talk to you soon.

4026," Persept in Google, LARC, our tech editor, Dan Halley, is back with some analysis next. Starting season rolls off at reports from Big Tech Giants, Microsoft and Alphabet expected after the closing bell today. Y'all find TechEd or Dan Halley joins us now to preview what to expect. And Dan, it could be another interesting quarter for both these companies. We have that strong dollar, you have growth slowing down. How do you see things? Yeah, we also have, you know, starting with Microsoft, obviously their cloud business, doing well. But then there's the drop in consumer spending on the personal computer front. So that could really sting Microsoft. Let's take a look at the numbers here. We have revenue estimates coming in at $49.6 billion. That's according to the street's consensus estimate. And then EPS, adjusted EPS, we have that coming in at $2.29. We have the productivity and business processes revenue. That's $16.12 billion. And then we have the intelligent cloud that's going to be at $20.31 billion. These are again, all those estimates. And then the more personal computing at $13.09 billion, that's a slight, slight increase. So, you know, we're starting to see the effects on Microsoft's bottom line of this kind of pullback in consumer spending on those types of devices. Not just because, you know, there's not enough on the market as there may have been during the pandemic, but because so many people purchased during the pandemic, but there's no reason for them to go back out and buy computers. Again, those usually last, you know, anywhere from three to five to seven years for some consumer. So there's really no reason for them to jump back out into the market. And then, you know, on the Google front, we're looking at revenue X-TAC, which is a traffic acquisition cost. That's at $58.18 billion or $58.2 billion. And then we have EPS, adjusted EPS, estimated at $1.36. An advertising revenue is going to be the big issue here, whether or not they're stung.",https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LuX9IXzHLV4,7,2022-10-25 14:25:34
4027," billion or 58.2 billion and then we have EPS adjusted EPS estimated at dollar 36. An advertising revenue was going to be the big issue here whether or not they're stung similar to how we saw SNAP stung when it reported last week taking that huge one in their stock price after reporting those disappointing earnings. We're looking at potential revenue of 57 billion from advertising and then cloud services at 6.61 billion. They're still being kind of work through to try and improve those make it one of the larger offerings on the market still well behind Amazon and Microsoft which are number one and number two and then we also have the other bets at 204 million. We also had reports that Google was coming back on some of its projects that may be visible in some of the the earnings we'll have to see there what the cap X looks like. So yeah obviously two important reports from two important companies especially when it comes to both the cloud and the digital advertising markets. We also got meta up there on the screen too they're expected to report you mentioned that you're going to be tracking across all of these companies where it does apply FX, cloud and ads but what about the metaverse and the spending perhaps if I was to sum it up to that for all of these tech companies and how that should be in focus too. Yeah I think for you know meta obviously the question is how much did it earn as far as ad revenue how much has been hurt as far as ad revenue and then how much is it continuing to spend on the metaverse project you know we had Mark Zuckerberg talking it meta connect basically laying out what he sees is the the future of the metaverse how the company is going to kind of build that out and the different opportunities they're available focusing heavily on you know work environment obviously Microsoft CEO Sanctinadel had made an appearance for that and then on the gaming environment but you know there's been calls obviously for there to be a reduced reduction in spending on the metaverse and there's been reports you know where the the worlds that they're building just aren't exciting for customers and that the headsets they offer aren't something that people usually use as you know months after they purchase the one like you know a gaming console or or PC so it'll be interesting to see what kind of the the situation is like on meta as far as what the ad revenue is and then what that means as far as the metaverse goes and the spending there because they have been just plowing money into it and you know they they're putting this as a long-term goal but you know for now it doesn't look like anybody's very much interested in it outside of you know a few use cases that may benefit the work environment but you know for the average consumer I don't think it's something that's really getting them going yeah who finances Dan Howley the tech DH if you will hear Dan appreciate the time breaking down and teeing up some of these earnings reports set to come out appreciate it and switching gears here everyone cutting ties Adidas has become the latest company to end its partnership with Yeh formerly known as Kanye West following his anti-semitic remarks the athletic brand says it will stop production of Yeezy branded products immediately along with all payments to Yeh and his companies Bernstein senior analyst Anisha Sherman joins us now to discuss alongside Yeh who finances Alexandra Canal Anisha great to have you here with us today help us really put this kind of into perspective on the business front $250 million net income short-term negative impact Adidas is saying that this is going to mean at a time when the brand was already seeing some of that waning popularity within their core consumer groups Yes this is coming at a tough time for the company they just have their second of two early earnings releases and guidelines for the year they're now expecting Q4 to come in negative profitability anyway you know ex this Yeezy impact and will this 250 million will further reduce the bottom line for Q4 the Q3 results have already been pre-released the Yeezy day which was in August counted towards Q3 performance and was quite successful however the launches that were slated for Q4 which were meant to come out in the kind of you know October November timeframe have now been completely pulled and thus the impacts of the sales and the bottom line and what's more important is Adidas is going to stop using the Yeezy label altogether although the company does own the rights to the product they're going to rebrand it as Adidas product and stop using the Yeezy brand label completely",https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LuX9IXzHLV4,8,2022-10-25 14:29:42
4028," the easy label altogether. Although the company does own the rights to the product, they're gonna rebrand it as Adidas product and stop using the easy brand label completely, which should take a haircut off the 2023 and beyond sales as well. Because that was quite a successful brand branchized for the company. And in Asia, there's no denying how successful the easy brand has been for Adidas, largely because it catered to Gen Z. It had that social currency with Yeh, who at the time of the partnership in 2013, he was at the top of his game. So what other types of partnerships or alternative revenue streams should Adidas consider exploring in order to cater to that Gen Z consumer base? Yeah, that's a good question. So Yeh, he has been one of their more successful franchises. But in recent years, they have tried to diversify that by adding a few additional franchises. We've seen them come out this year with launches, with Gucci and with Prada. The Gucci collection in particular was very successful and they view it as a multi-year partnership. They're continuing their partnership with Stella McCartney, which is also a multi-year long-term partnership. It's also premium product, higher margin product, and they're continuing their work with Beyonce with the Adi Part collection, which also released a new line this year and will continue to be a multi-year partnership. So they do have several other partnerships. This isn't their only one, but that being said, Yeh, Z has been, as you said, one of the more successful ones. So it will require a haircut to sales estimates as well as margins for the coming year or so. Andisha, why do you think it took so long for a deedist to make this decision? Because I do think it says a lot about the corporate governance of a company like that. Yeah, I mean, this debate has been going on since August. So it started when, actually Kanye West came out against Adidas, alleging that they had stolen his intellectual property. Adidas insisted that they own all the IP of the easy franchise that's been released today. And that's for kind of normal terms of when, you know, these kinds of partnerships. But this debate has continued for the last two months. They were trying to make amends and trying to make things work. They had a few years left on the contract, but it's been under review for the last couple of weeks. They probably could have come to an agreement sooner. I don't know the details behind their legal disagreements, but essentially, I mean, it's a big part of their revenue and profit print that this franchise is one of them more successful. So I think they were trying to figure out a way to break things off whether they would continue using the easy name, whether they had the right to continue, how that would impact both this years and ongoing sales and how they would kind of position the brand going forward, which is why it took a few days longer. And there's been increasing pressure on the company to drop him, as we've seen other companies drop him over the last couple of weeks, thanks to his all of his statements in the past few weeks. Relative to what's going on with Adidas at the moment and his Brad was saying, there's a lot of other issues at this company besides the just EA. How do you view the competitive landscape? Yeah, it's a tough year for sportswear in general because China has continued to be a very slow market, both partly due to macro concerns as people have been held back by COVID restrictions, but also due to a continued prominence of local brands of Chinese-owned brands that have taken share from the big Western brands. So that's been a market that's continued to be tough, particularly for Adidas, as they underinvested in the region in the past and are now trying to make up for lost ground. At the same time, North America, as I'm sure you know, is going into a pretty heavy inventory quarter as your guest speaker was talking about a few minutes ago, and that's going to impact them as well. So we have the bearish China outlook, the kind of short-term bearish North American outlook, and then Amia. Amia is also under pressure. The consumer continues to pull back on discretionary spend. So it's been a tough year overall for the competitive landscape in general. It's been a tougher year for Adidas because they've had specific challenges in China to get their brand back on track. And so even preceding this easy announcement, they were expecting net income to drop below 500 million for the year, and that number is now even lower. Do you believe that there's a trickle through here to the resale market as well, considering what led to the termination of this deal? Do people now go on a stadium goods who's owned by Farfetch, a publicly traded company, and say, I don't want to buy easy shoes? Do they go on a stock X and say, you know, I'm not...",https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LuX9IXzHLV4,9,2022-10-25 14:34:06
4029," will now go on a stadium goods whose owned by Farfetch, a publicly traded company, and say, I don't want to buy easy shoes. Do they go on a stock ex and say, I'm not any longer interested in buying this product? Yeah, I think that's a good question. I think if the product were continuing to be sold by Adidas, I would expect a general boycott of it. Now that the product is not going to be sold by Adidas, I think there might be a reversal of effect where this becomes the easy product becomes somewhat of a collector's item, maybe not right now or nobody wants to touch it. But in over the next couple of years, it becomes a limited edition collector's item that's sold in resale. But I think the decision to stop branding the easy brand was a good decision for Adidas because at the moment, that brand is associated very strongly with the creator, with the artist, and they want to cut the disassociate themselves completely. So I think what happens in the resale market is because of this restricted supply, it could continue to trade, but in the primary market, that was probably the right decision for that to do. And you said that the Yeezy line has been popular, almost it hit the market. And because of that popularity, I think an argument could be made, it has taken market share from a company like Nike. But now if that brand is no longer going to be, at Adidas is a Nike winner here. Yeah, I think they lose that portion of the market share, which was the Yeezy premium product. They are going to relaunch, they're going to continue to launch the designs. I mean, it's unclear where they're going to launch it as a sub brand or as just a kind of under the, Adidas and Brella overall, they obviously aren't going to use the Yeezy name anymore, but the sneaker heads and the loyal customers will know it's the same product as just being launched under the Adidas and brand and Brella. So I think they will retain some of those sales, they're not going to lose that entire kind of, you know, 1.5 to 2 billion worth of sales, but it will take a haircut because it's not being branded under that Yeezy brand anymore. It will probably seed some share to some of the other sneaker head brands, including Nike. The real sneaker heads will always know Anisha Sherman. Thanks so much for joining us here on the morning Bernstein Senior Analyst Anisha Sherman and Yahoo Finance's own, Allie Canal. Appreciate it. You guys coming up, turbulence guys, and expensive times for JetBlue shares of the company moving lower by about 6.5% after the company posted the profit in the last quarter. CEO, the CEO, excuse me, warning that every penny matters as cost, the support fuel, continue to rise. We've got the full breakdown from the other side.",https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LuX9IXzHLV4,10,2022-10-25 14:38:42
4030," a Welcome back everyone. Let's turn now to some market movers this morning. Let's start with JetBlueEarnings, ticker symbol JBLU. Shares moving lower by a little more than 6%. This is after the airline company reported earnings for the third quarter, missing estimates on the bottom line while beating out revenue expectations here. A few things to really consider here, the fact that many of the airline operators are still getting back to full capacity compared to 2019 for JetBlue. You've also got this near term deal and the finalization of that deal that is still very much just hanging in the balance waiting to be fully done and investors have had time to realize what that might mean to the balance sheets of JetBlue once that finally goes through. In the near term though, they are still being one of the beneficiaries of this north eastern alliance along with American Airlines too, which really helped them during the summer travel season. But in the near term, I believe that those fuel prices still being up, I think it was up 87% comparable to last year. That's something that American Airlines had also cited in their most recent earnings. And just like we were talking about, excuse me earlier Brad, between the now emerging different investing stories between a UPS and FedEx, I would argue, I put forth that same thesis on JetBlue. You talked to Delta CEO Ed Bastion, very good quarter, American Airlines, very good quarter. What was United reported to? Already? Strong demand. Strong demand, very good quarter. A little bit of different tone from JetBlue and it makes you wonder, are they going to get distracted or have they been distracted by trying to first solidify the spirit deal? And now, oh yeah, they're going to have to integrate it at some point if it gets approval. Yeah, and that integration, when you're thinking about updating an entire airline, everything from painting planes to try and get rid of that ugly yellow color all the way to making sure that you've just got a different aircraft that maybe doesn't feel like a canister in the sky. All of those things get taken into consideration. So updates of the fleets, also the integration of the teams and the operation. And it's also going to be a consideration around which actual flight gates that you're positioned at so that you can kind of condense what that operational space looks like at the hubs that you're working in and out of as well. They're all in on the anti yellow. They're in on the yellow. 100%. You're in. All right. Chairs of Tesla, they're up after surprisingly, bearers take from Morgan Stanley, the bank cutting, it's price target to $3 and $3 down from $350, sending a highly volatile economic environment and anticipating unexpected headwinds. And of course, this call comes from our friend of the show, Adam Jonas, over at Morgan Stanley, always a market mover on Tesla. He's still staying bullish, of course, on Tesla. He's been a long time bull in this company. He's really noting for what he, making, he's saying, quote, making room for unexpected, unexpected headwinds in the current economic environment, our argue Brad, some of those unexpected headwinds are coming out of China. When he talked about China was yesterday, Tesla cutting prices in that China market, that is a complete new term from what Tesla had been experiencing last year and even the first part of this year. Right. And for Tesla, they have to acknowledge what's happening in the region too. That sounded like when they were on the call that they didn't want to really discuss what is really taking place within that region in China. You have so much competition that is being brought online that much quicker, that is improving their capacity for production, improving their relations with customers in the region too, who have the propensity to buy some of the electric vehicles, either on the mass market side or on the more expensive side. And the propensity right now is leaning towards some of the homegrown brands in the region too. And it doesn't want to acknowledge that of course, they want to continue to focus on their products, but I think it still is a realization that has to be factored in to what their forecasts are actually looking like in the region too. Right. And I mentioned that X-PUN is really...",https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LuX9IXzHLV4,11,2022-10-25 14:42:47
4031," Still is a realization that has to be factored in to what their forecasts are actually looking like in the region too. Right. And on this too, you know, yesterday I mentioned that X-Pung is really going toe-to-toe with Tessel and China. And I got raked over the calls on Twitter for it. I do think folks, even the Tesla bulls pull up some of the specs on these X-Pung vehicles. They are very impressive. That technology package in that car is very, very impressive indeed. All right. For Tessel, let's stand all things industrial. UPS had a good quarter as CFO Brian Newman explained to us just moments ago that is just not the vibe over at rival FedEx. We'll talk to it one-allest downgraded FedEx recently. That's next. I saw a quarter from UPS this morning, but the company did reiterate full year guidance unlike its rival FedEx. You folks, to UPS CFO Brian Newman said the company has been working on new plans for the past couple of years. So, let's take a listen. We spend a lot of money in GNA. We've been tightening the belt there, but we've been doing that for a couple of years trying to right size the business. Carol introduced a better, not bigger strategy to the company and what that really is, optimize the volume that comes into the system. So, it's more profitable and then take the cost down. So, we have been certainly right sizing the business over the last couple of years, but no, we're not closing sorting facilities right now. We have the ability to take our variable and set every variable cost down should the case arise. And a little bit of set of different circumstances over FedEx, which led to Wells Fargo analyst, Alison Pliniaccusic to slash or rating on the stock. Alison joins us now. Alison, really a different tone between what UPS reported today and what has been happening over FedEx. Why do you think that's the case? Well, first good morning and it was clear, you know, I would say it's execution, right. And as Brian mentioned in the previous comments, they've been on this path, right. And right sizing the network, they're driving increased agility.",https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LuX9IXzHLV4,12,2022-10-25 14:47:18
4032," It was clear, you know, I would say it's execution, right? And as Brian mentioned in the previous comments, they've been on this path, right? They've been right sizing the network. They're driving increased agility in the network. BetX is maybe a couple of steps behind at this point. They laid out there, certainly their cross plan restructuring plan going forward to adjust to the current volume environment. Just the execution, I would say, you certainly saw that divergence is quarter. There's a differing strategy in terms of where these businesses are investing and perhaps one of those operational expenses that could change in the future for FedEx might be in even the employee classification. Do you think that there's going to be some successful push for unionization among the employee base at FedEx? Well, if you're looking to the ground, right? It's an outsourced objective, you know, potentially I wouldn't comment on the union piece about, you know, obviously EPS is unionized drivers at this point. BetX is certainly working with their providers on the ground piece domestically to adjust to the current environment. When might the FedEx investment thesis become just a little more stable? I think what they reported a couple weeks ago really shocked a lot of investors. When does that start to turn in the other way? And that was part of reason for our downgrade. You know, if you look to the pre-announcement relative to what our numbers were, you know, sense of the mis was really driven by revenue. A $1.50 that mis was operations. That's the piece that they're trying to attack today. And I would say just given the recent execution, our confidence in their ability to execute with the increasing headwinds is a little bit more relaxed at this point. So we're looking for, I would say, success at the execution initiatives, whether it's right sizing the aircraft network, bringing down facilities, you know, essentially just relining their network, not only for the current environment, but obviously for the, you know, the potential pivot chart. Well, as far as security is analysts, Alison Poliniac, Chris, thanks so much for joining us and breaking down your FedEx expectations going forward from here. We appreciate the time. You guys coming up, gotta catch all the McRibs from Pokemon Games. So McRib, Fairwell, tour who we're ending the show in high class fashion. That's always really here. Getting how it takes on the other side. Just love Peter. It's like a rons of toilet.",https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LuX9IXzHLV4,13,2022-10-25 14:51:38
4033," [""Deck No Welcome back everyone. It is time for Cretan Time. We've got three stories. One minute each. We start with this today, Warner Brothers says the cost of its scrapped shows and sitcoms it could total $2.5 billion. This is as it restructures itself financially. Now the thing to remember for so many of the production houses as they have been shifting into streaming, there's a ton more data that they're being able to leverage to really determine whether or not a show even before it goes to production is going to be successful. Which makes it even more alarming perhaps that there's a $2.5 billion hit that you could see when you are having that massive shift towards a streaming platform launching that streaming service and then actually forecasting what will perform well in that environment too. Yeah, look, there's just a continues to be a rapid changes in the environment, how content is consumed, of course led by the streaming movement and I just think a lot of these companies, legacy media companies are realizing there's still a lot of bloat inside of them. You have one person that reports to another person and they all report to one other person. There's just too many people in there given this changing dynamic. So again, I think you'll probably see more layoffs or more changes like this. And is there a change in the binging trends as well as the business of binge? Is that kind of the thing in the past now? No, we're all, we're still watching. We're all binging. We're still binging. Yeah, I'm definitely binging. All right, Mattel, catching the best Pokemon of their all, Pokemon of them all, the Toymaker securing a franchise deal to make Pokemon toys under license. This is, I would say, yet another big win for Mattel and CEO and on cries. They are going to report earnings to Nights. This has just been, you know, in addition to the revival of the Barbie brand, this is just another feather in the hat of a non in that team over there. This is just, I mean, it's a home run deal. Essentially, just really stealing it off from the nose of Hasbro. This is massive. You've got an international brand, one that has had so much success across gaming and some of the digital spaces as well has had a successful entertainment side of the business that directly dovetails into how many people want to buy the toys over time. And I was one of those kids growing up. I had these toys. That was your generation. That and Pokemon toys. And Power Rangers. Yes. They had one of the most virally successful AR apps in game experiences. You remember back in 2015, 2016? People would just stop in the middle of the street. People lawns trying to catch a virtual Pokemon. There you go. My generation, it was Bugs Bunny, you know, mid-80s, late 80s, Bugs Bunny on Saturday morning. It was Space Yard. Well, no AR. Oh man, the dark days of no AR. A parking pig. Yes. That's all folks. And Leslie here in McDonald's is bringing back the beloved Mick Rib pork sandwich for what it calls a farewell tour here. Oh gosh. Okay. You call this the Mick Heart or the Mick Shoulder because if you Google search what's in these? What's in that? It's not actual rib. I think McDonald's has said this in the past. That is not rib. It is a mashup of all these different parts of an animal slathered. And I will give this. You know, that barbecue sauce on the Mick Rib is very, very good. I'm hoping. I'm hoping, Brad. Yeah. They are going to pull this off the menu and start selling a real rib product like Arbises out there right now selling. Love me some Arbises rib. But you've been telling me that to this point the Mick Rib is actually a Mick Scrapple. Yeah. Essentially what it's telling me. If you go online you can see it's usually a stripe, heart and shoulder, all mixed together. I'm just reporting what's out there. Look, I mean, it is kind of tasty sometimes when you... It's on our Mick Heart flunch. Give me a Mick Heart. I mean, well, thank goodness for the fail world tour of the Mick Rib. We hope it's well received.

4035," Music Welcome to Yahoo Finance Live. It is 11 a.m. here in New York City. I'm Lake Ego from Gina. Here's what I'm watching at this hour. Stocks getting a tailwind as GM, UPS and Coca-Cola all beat the street. The NASDAQ pushing higher ahead of big results from Alphabet and Microsoft. So to the moon, we're going to ask D-Full about the $4,300 call on $4,300 call. I should say on the S&P. The corporate dropout, Adidas terminates this relationship with Kanye West and the Yeezy brand, saying it doesn't condone any form of hate speech. It sees a short-term negative impact on finances, but is there a bigger fallout to come? We've got a panel standing by to discuss. And return of the SPAC former House Speaker Paul Ryan backs his company all the way to the New York Stock Exchange. Listening, a listing will ask Kim about market choppiness and how he feels two weeks ahead of his all-important midterms. First though, let's check in on the market action right now. We are seeing green across the board. As we look at all three major indices right now, 90 minutes into the trading day. The Dow up about 175 points right now. The S&P 500 up 36 and the NASDAQ up 157. As always, or I should say, especially this week, the NASDAQ, the big one to watch with Microsoft and Alphabet on tap today after the bell. But we are kicking off this hour with General Motors. Out with better than expected earning today. And we are seeing that reflected in the shares up more than 3% as the auto manufacturer reaffirms its full-year outlook despite a challenging environment. GM reporting a record third quarter revenue of $41.9 billion, driving $3.3 billion of net income attributable to stockholders for a closer look at GM and the auto space. Let's turn to our very on-pros a supermanian. It does feel like they've kind of turned the corner in terms of those big headwinds they've been facing, whether it is the supply shortage inventory. Not quite up to where they want it to be, but it is headed in the right direction. Yeah, for sure. They had a record quarter revenue just barely below analyst expectations. Big profit here, 4.3 billion in adjusted net income. That's almost 50% higher than a year ago. Like you said, they were able to hit these sort of numbers. Demand is strong. Supply constraints easing. You saw that they reaffirms their EBIT clients for the year, which a lot of people thought they would maybe take that down because of the fact that maybe things are slowing down. Maybe there are some issues with supply and pricing. Mary Barra in her letter said that they reaffirmed the guys despite a challenging environment because demand continues to be strong for GM products and we're actively managing headwinds that we face. Also talking about how they captured 8% of the EV market share with the Bolt and Bolt EV doing really well. They're an increase in production of that car. And they're on track for their EV game plan. They're going to release the Equinox, the blazer, the Silverado next year. And they again maintain that they acquire materials enough materials for 1 million EV run rate in 2025. So a lot of good things here in this quarter for GM. Ford obviously the next one on tap to report their results. Is there anything we can take away from what GM reported today in terms of where things are headed in the car space particularly on EVs? Well it sounds like demand isn't an issue at least for US automakers and I think for the price of the same thing potentially tomorrow. Big question is are they going to also reaffirm their guides. We're not as lucky as sure. They're sort of hinting at they're having issues with kind of headwinds like.",https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LuX9IXzHLV4,16,2022-10-25 15:04:46
4036," to the same thing potentially tomorrow. Big question is, are they going to also reaffirm their guins? We're not as lucky as you're sure. They're sort of hinting at they're having issues with kind of headwinds like the pricing pressures they're facing. So could that take down their guinets or for profit guins? We'll see. But it sounds like demand is not a concern. Despite the fact that we have so many kind of the negative drum beat of is the global macro economy, economy kind of withering, is pricing coming down. I think what we're seeing is that it's not affecting demand for cars at least. Yeah, we've heard sort of the question, I guess the verdict still out, whether in fact we're at that tipping point with EVs gas prices creeping back up again. So we'll continue to watch the demand there. Thanks so much for that. Well, let's take a look now at more big name earnings starting with Coca-Cola, the beverage giant topping estimates in its latest quarter as well as raising its revenue outlook for 2022. Though unable to avoid the currency headwinds weighing on others shares just slightly there. Joining me now is Yahoo Finance, his brand, Sasi, itching to get into all those numbers. Where do we start? I think I start on pricing. It's been the theme of the morning. It's not just with a Coca-Cola. It's a UPSU name. But anyway, with Coca-Cola pricing up 12% in that third quarter, also Coke Zero. Coke Zero, up 11% in terms of sales. It's been, I think it was a blowout quarter for Coca-Cola. A little bit of a squishy guidance outlook from the company, but still very much mirrored what we heard from Pepsi Co. last week. Strong pricing, strong demand. Consumers not really blocking at these price increases. And I think the next big thing for Coca-Cola is this really next wave of innovation. More new flavors for Coke Zero. More new flavors for Costa coffee. That's a brand they bought. I believe two and a half years ago, I think the company is really winning high marks on the street after a quarter like this. UPSU, another name that you're watching really closely. There are FX headwinds yet again being mentioned like so many earnings calls. Really make me work today. But yes, UPSU, good quarter for UPS, strikingly different compared to what we heard from FedEx, which later real egg in terms of this earnings two and a half weeks ago. But look what CFO Brian Newman told us about FX challenges on its business in the third quarter. The currency impact in the quarter was about $82 million. So it is a meaningful headwind on our international business. But we're effectively offsetting that as we manage the portfolio across the domestic business and then across some of the other segments. And right up there we're pricing Kiko. It is the currency headwind, of course impacting UPS, but also heard Coca-Cola by 8% in terms of their sales in the most recent quarter. We talked to Beth Ann Bovino in the prior hour and the 10 o'clock hour. And these currency headwinds are likely to be around for some time. They're not going away in the fourth quarter. They might stick around into the first half of next year and likely continue to weigh on sales. Yeah, and something that we're tracking every day in terms of dollar strength. All right, we got you on set. We're going to keep working you, Brian. I know we're doing all right. G-E, let's do it. Let's go. G and 3M. All right, well G-E later, another dud. I'm surprised the stock is not completely falling off a cliff here. One of the hottest tickers on the out of finance platform here this morning. That is G-E and 3M. I'll start with G-E. They actually warned on their full year. And I think you could really tie to two things. First, the renewable energy segment was again a dreadful quarter. Orders down 43% operate at a loss on an adjusted operating profit base. Not a good quarter for them. And I do think this is a management team severely distracted by trying to split up its company into three businesses. GE Healthcare will be the first one out of the shoot as a public company in early January. And then 3M, like GE, lowering its full year outlook. And again, another one, just not some, I'm really surprised not see a stronger negative market reaction when you see a 3M warn, warn about currency, concerned about higher inflation in the supply chain. But again, two industrial giants right now, hot tickers on our platform, both warning for the full year. Not a great, I would say, read on the global economy. Yeah, you're right, not as big of a reaction with 3M down about 6. You want to do it anymore? Any more? You got it? I can keep going. You have to write like five stories, right? I'll count you, okay. Very fair. Go to Yahoo Finance.com. How about that? We'll pitch all your stories. All right, friends, as a thanks so much for that. And let's move on to our trending ticker. Terpilins for Jeff Blue shares in the airline carrier under heavy pressure after the company missed analyst estimates on its latest results. The company earned 21 cents a share on revenue of $2.5 billion. Revenue per available seat mile, which is a key metric we track. Increased by more than 23%, a strong travel demand and higher ticket prices helps offset those higher costs. Still though, Jeff Blue expects some of that demand to soften in the current quarter, but the president's a chief operating officer saying he expects capacity.",https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LuX9IXzHLV4,17,2022-10-25 15:08:58
4037," Price has helped offset those higher costs. Still though, JetBlue expects some of that demand to soften in the current quarter, but the president's chief operating officer saying he expects capacity to be up just one to 4% compared to pre-pandemic levels in 2019. Well, coming up, Yeezy doesn't. Adidas parts ways with the artist formerly known as Kanye West after a string of controversies. Because of the battle over his namesake brand, that had been poor. We've got a lot to discuss on this headline here. That's coming up on the other side. Well, stocks currently looking positive across all three major indices, right now with a Dow up, more than 200 points. There's a relief rally on their rise, and our next guest thinks so, and says the S&P could make its way back to 4,300 by April. That is barring outside factors. Joining us now is Barry Bannister, chief equity strategist at C. Fullbury. We could all use some positive news after the last month that we've had. Certainly, we have seen gains pick up over the last few weeks on this expectation, potentially, of a Fed pivot. What are you watching right now in terms of levels that really you think could push things in the right direction? Well, you know a lot of the bad news was known. And we had a violent sell-off in the first 10 months of this year. If you look at the nominal peak of the S&P 500 index, it was 4,800 on January 3rd, but the real inflation adjusted purchasing power peak was 5,100 on December 29th. So we fell about 31.5%, which if you look at the 14 bear markets since 1947, the Post World War II era really, the 14 bear markets associated with...",https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LuX9IXzHLV4,18,2022-10-25 15:13:39
4038," the 14 bear markets since 1947, in the post-World War II era, really, the 14 bear markets associated with recessions, the average and what we call the trend mean, taking out the highest and the lowest, was 31.7, so we had a bear market, a vicious mauling bear market due to fed policy, but when we analyze all the fixed income currency, futures, political, economic, geopolitical factors, we come up with a view that if the Fed is not turning the dial to tighten every single day, that's effectively a second derivative easing. In other words, not raising the volume is a form of lowering the volume. And I don't think the Fed gets tighter than what's embodied in futures. In fact, I think futures are probably over-stated in May of 2023 at nearly 5% on short rates, inflation is going to come down. Any first-year economic student in college could do what we did. All you do is break down inflation into its sub-components and all of them point down. All of them. So Barry, does that mean that you're in the camp that you think the Fed could potentially pause some of these rate hikes because you think that inflation is starting to show some signs of moderating and that the Fed can't move to aggressively? Well, we look at GDP on a quarterly annualized. So we take the most recent quarter, we annualize it, multiply it to the fourth power. We annualize GDP. Well, let's annualize inflation. So CPI inflation for the three months ended September annualized was only 2%. Yes, it's 2%. So the momentum of inflation has already turned down. If you take the core, it consists of services. And that is shelter services. So that would be housing related. Those are already turning down. Yes, there's a lag, but they are turning down decisively on rents, home prices. You saw the data today. You look at non-shelter services. Wages are the key driver. And wages such as the Atlanta Fed, wage tracker, and average hourly earnings year to year change. And hopefully, on the 28th, the employment cost index all points down. So again, you have to steer the ship with a long lead time. The Fed knows that. And they've done their job. They flatten the curve by end of year. The curve will be completely flat, if not inverted in some points, obviously, tend to twos. But as they do that, we have to be ahead of that. We have to think, OK, well, the Treasury is worried about bond market liquidity. Treasury Secretary Yellen, former chair Yellen of the Fed made a statement yesterday. The Treasury is intently focused on bond market risk due to liquidity and other concerns. So if the market is always ahead of reality, we have to get ahead of that. And so it looks to us like there'll be a rally October to about April. I wouldn't overstay the rally. There are a lot of tail risks later in 23. But again, the market is always looking ahead. And we're trying to keep up with it. And I admit, it's a really hard job. So Barry, you mentioned some key risks there that could derail that upwards climb to 4,300. One of them being oil shots. What's the big concern there right now? No. The G7 and the West collectively are desperately trying to establish what's called a buyer's cartel on Russian oil. And naturally, and you can't blame them, OPEC Plus, which is OPEC's many member states plus Russia, they don't want with their sellers cartel to have a competing buyer's cartel. So they're not cooperating. And they shouldn't cooperate. That would just be a logical to expect them to do so. So the early December, there is this planned cap on Russian oil. That could create tremendous volatility. Russia has a lot of avenues. I personally would be thinking they might target the CPC pipeline out of Kazakhstan to reduce flows without cutting their own production to drive the price up. And if oil rockets higher, oil is at the core of inflation. This is what the ESG people never understood. They don't think they could stop again from whatnot. That's why what the captain said and that the whole system of oil like?""",https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LuX9IXzHLV4,19,2022-10-25 15:17:36
4039," own production to drive the price up. And if oil rockets higher, oil is at the core of inflation. This is what the ESG people never understood. That all energy is, all GDP is the conversion of energy. And because of some of the dragging risks on GDP growth, demographics, debt, we don't have the kind of growth we used to have. And as a consequence, we need cheap energy. And so more expensive energy is not going to solve this problem. So if energy goes up, that's the core of inflation. That drives everything, including core CPI and core PCE. So we don't need an oil shock. And that's the risk here. You know, I remember the 1970s very well. We had a 73, 74 oil embargo. And then in 79, we had a second oil shock due to the shower around falling in Iran. We don't need that. And so geopolitically, I think we've got some very poor diplomatic policy out of Washington. And hopefully they don't drive us over the edge with a secondary oil shock, having already depleted the strategic petroleum reserve. Seinfeld Chief Equity Strategist, Barry Bannister, it's good to talk to you today. Appreciate the time. Thank you. Well, partnership over Adidas is ending its massive deal with Yee, artist formerly known as Kanye West. Following a series of anti-Semitic remarks, the shoemaker, the latest high profile brand to cut ties with the artist saying it will stop production of Yeezy branded products immediately, as well as all payments to Yee and his companies. Joining us to discuss the implications we've got Brad Smith as well as Alexis Keenan. And Brad, let's start with you because we are trying to figure out what the financial hit is likely to be. I mean, we talked about Yeezy. I mean, Kanye produced products of what, been driving 8 to 10 percent of the revenue. Yeah, for Adidas, they're saying near term, this could be upwards of $250 million to their net income, but you also think about some of the tertiary dollars as well. We were discussing just last hour with Bernstein, analyst, Anisha Sherman, and the resale community as well. This could also take a hit in the near term. You think about companies like Stadium Goods owned by a company Farfetch publicly traded FTCH, I believe, and with all of that in mind, and how so many of those companies have looked across the product lines that have been the most hype beast X. Yeezy has been squarely within the fold, same to the success of almost mirroring the success of how well Nike dunks have done. And so for a brand that has largely fallen out of favor and seen waning favor over a core consumer constituent in Millennials and Gen Z recently losing or having this type of instance that hits on the brand in concert with what's already taking place with the deterioration of the brand could have a much longer term impact as well. There's been a lot of criticism about how long Adidas took to make this decision. I wonder if we have any idea about the financial hit they did take or they're likely to take not necessarily of the resale side that you're talking about, but you know how many consumers that look I'm just not going to buy this based on his remarks. Well his remarks let's just lay it out on the table. It was antisemitic. He had even prior to that going on rants and war t-shirts that were saying white lives matter and kind of in throwing especially within the black community where black lives matter throwing that on its head almost. And so for a consumer group that you have co-zied up to for so many years to now go and do the exact opposite. And what I was saying within our show this morning is he is now kind of shifted his entire brand in this era of influencer economy and said I'm going to pander into such a different direction that is hurtful to so many consumers out there and the population more broadly that now if you're going to continue that pander you also have to be comfortable with knowing that brands are going to step away. It's Adidas. It is JP Morgan. It is a company in CAA the creative artist agency and they're you're seeing on the screen GAP which he had had the partnership with Balenciaga and so this is far more ranging than just the financial hit of Adidas. It's all of those other companies as well that are going to see some type of impact in the near future. And Alexis I know you've been looking at sort of the legal side of things you know who actually owns the rights to reproduce some of the things that Kanye just designed. I mean where does that stand right now because it was just what last week if you be so or you heard Kanye coming out and saying look they can't drop me. Right and also demanding and posting on social media.",https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LuX9IXzHLV4,20,2022-10-25 15:21:48
4040," Where does that stand right now? Because it was just what? Last week, a few of you were so reheard, God, I'm coming out and saying, look, they can't drop me. Right. And also demanding and posting on social media, expecting a $2 billion payout to terminate this deal. But look, I think we first need to put an umbrella on this situation to say, this is somebody who is outwardly expressed that they have mental illness since 2018. So these companies that are contracting with him as the sole owner of some of these brands, Yeezy in particular, they are contracting with a company whose chief is known to have expressed that he has bipolar. So there's some knowing this going into this. But look, that statement that you read going into the segment here with Adidas saying that after this review, they've decided to end production of the Yeezy branded products. Not necessarily the sale of them right now. It doesn't sound exactly like they're committing to that. But also saying that they'll stop all payments to Yee and his companies. It isn't a full blanket statement that they're ending it there, at least the way I read it. Now, these contracts, they're usually, in this case, there's a private contract. So we don't know what it says between Adidas and his company. But typically, they're licensing agreements where Yee is creating the designs. And then Adidas would own 100% of those designs. So all of the designs that would have been made under that contract, they would typically belong to Adidas. But I'll just caveat it and say, we haven't seen those actual words on that paper. We're not sure. These licenses, they can change hands, they can be sold, they can be assigned as well. Yeah, I mean, to your point about what he has said publicly about having bipolar, I mean, the whole conversation, I will say, just on a personal level, it's just a little uncomfortable, the word. I mean, not only the anti-Semitic comments that he's made, but you have seen a lot of these companies to your point, sort of understanding the situation, but going into an agreement, you know, knowing that there are still risks on this side. And I wonder, you know, bad or Alexis, both of you can weigh in on this. I mean, what is, you know, where does his brand go? His personal brand go beyond this. You could argue, you know, he moves away from the public eye, he gets some help. Who knows what's going to transpire, but compared to what we have seen in the past, I mean, this feels like the damage is really great. Yeah, and this is where it's a, if I may, the separation of a musician who has built up their brand on who they had been as a musician to what that actual brand has become as a result of the partnerships that move forward and the millions, billions of dollars that were thrown around to make his brand even more appetizing to a range of consumers, whether that be a range of consumers in apparel and fashion or whether that be in some of the other technological landscapes that we, he wants to operate. And this is still a person that's trying to buy parlor too. So his brand is clearly going in that direction right now with the commentary hurtful as it is, has been. And so he is fully delving his brand, fuller into that and even more full steam ahead into some of the hateful commentary that has been known to persist on a platform like that technologically. Well, and it runs counter, right, to the exact fan base that he builds. It's run counter to some of his own lyrics. Yeah, well, I mean, you're exactly right. When you go back and listen to some of his early albums, this is exactly what he real against and now he's become a part of that. So a story that really to your point sort of covers not just the music industry, the fashion industry, it has wide range of implications, but I may both continue to watch it.

Granite Ridge making its market debut today via a SPAC, the company backed by former House Speaker of Paul Ryan, rang the opening bell this morning and joining us to discuss we've got Paul Ryan, of course, former Speaker of the House and Chairman of the Executive Network Partner and Corporation SPAC. We've also got Luke Graniteberg, who's Granite Ridge CEO and it's great to have both of you on today. Speaker, I want to start with you first because it's been a rough patch coming here. We were just alluding to some of the big exodus that you saw in terms of investors when they saw that you were partnering up with Granite. Talk to me about how you're thinking about this as you mark this milestone moving forward. Yeah, well, it's a pretty tough market for any company trying to go public. So we were very careful in who we chose as partners because we wanted to get it done and stick to the landing like we did today. So that's why we're very excited to be partnering with these Granite Ridge guys. We wanted to find a business that had very good balance sheet. These guys are unlevered. They got good free cash flow and it's in a very, very attractive sector of oil and gas. They're non-operating oil and gas platform company. So we wanted to find someone that we knew should go public and would be able to make it through the distance so that we're really excited to partner with these guys. Luke, when you think about the space oil and gas, certainly been very lucrative this year. We have seen some of these big oil majors hit key records in earnings as we look ahead to the winter and looking at the headwinds, whether it's within the U.S. but globally on demand as well as supply. How do you think about the investment environment in this space right now? I think we're starting to see just a lot more positive investors sentiment than we had for quite some time. I think that the storyline about oil and gas is really changing and you're seeing that transition to how important energy security is, energy reliability, both on the national and even more so now on an international scale. So it's been great. I'd say investor in-bounds were quite quiet for some time. But we're starting to see that pick up and folks that are really more interested in what we're doing. And look at what extent you see that accelerating going into the winter where we're really expected to see it crunch and supply. Well, I think that it's a great question, Kiko. And I really think that this is a defining moment. But the fact of matter is a really cold winter will create immense...",https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LuX9IXzHLV4,22,2022-10-25 15:31:04
4042," Well, I think that it's a great question, Kiko, and I really think that this is a defining moment. The fact of the matter is, a really cold winter will create immense pressure on the global energy supply chain. And I think a lot of investors are looking at that, they want to prepare for it. And I hope that the takeaway is that this is something that we need to focus on for the long term, and that we're able to have some resilient investors in the space that are willing to stay in and truly understand what we can do in the big picture. And I think that we have to speak to the media, and we have to talk about the midterms, or what, just two weeks out exactly from where things stand. It felt like a month ago we were talking about this momentum for Democrats on some of the social issues, including abortion. The latest polls show a big swing in favor of Republicans and the economy. What do you think shifted in the last month? I think everybody knows we're in or headed to a recession. The last headline inflation numbers, core inflation numbers, were really high. So I think people got more concerned about their pocketbooks, about jobs, about what the economy is going to look like, than they were about social issues. I think you're right. I think the Democrats peaked probably in August, maybe early September. But now I think people are much, much more concerned about the direction of the economy. Democrats are not, they don't poll needle as well in the economy. I think they try to wreck it basically, with Bill Beck better. I'm not a big fan of the inflation reduction act. And they try to do much worse tax policy. They didn't. So I think what voters want to do is set a check on Washington. They don't want one party rule by the left. And that's why I really feel pretty confident in saying that we're going to win the House. And I think we got a really good chance to win in the Senate. And I think in large measure, because voters want to check on all this left-ward lurch, and they want some calm economic policies. And so that's why I think we're peaking at the right time. That's why I think the momentum is with us right now. And so yeah, two weeks out, I feel very good, much better than I felt, say back in August. Obviously, you know, we watched the midterms always to see a gauge of where things could go two years from now in the presidential election. We've seen some headlines recently where you said that you believe the former president Trump would be unelectable, come 2024. And yet we're looking at some very competitive races in places like Arizona, places like Pennsylvania, where there are Trump-backed candidates who are polling pretty well. So what do you make of that disconnect there? I mean, why do you think that's been the case if you don't know that? Not him. They are not him. And look, we lost the House, the Senate and the White House, in the span of two years with Trump. Never before is my party lost as much that fast. So my point is, come 2024, we want to win. We want to beat Biden or the Democrats, whoever they're running. And we know it's just a factual statement, polling wise, we are worse off with Trump as our nominee than with somebody else. So I just think it's going to be palpable in 2024 that because we want to win and beat the Democrats, we know as a party we're better off with somebody else to be our nominee, to more guarantee a victory because we know we lose with Trump. It's the suburban voter, they're the big difference maker. I can tell you in Wisconsin, 64,000 Wisconsinites voted for all the Republicans on the ballot and not Donald Trump. That gets translated across the country in the swing states. It's a huge difference maker. So I just think from just winning, we are going to want to win come 2024. And that means we need to elect somebody to be our nominee that's going to better deliver a victory. And I think it's going to be pretty well known at that time. Luke, when you think about what's been playing out in the energy space, there's been a lot made of some tensions between the Biden administration, as well as the oil and gas companies in terms of the lack of investment or at least as the White House sees it. If in fact these predictions hold, we're talking about a Republican majority in the House, potentially in the Senate. How do you see that shifting that strategy around energy moving forward? The goal and what we really hope to accomplish is just a rational conversation about energy. What you're seeing in particularly midterm season, you just have folks that are taking one extreme side, one of the other, either piter carbons need to go away forever or how do carbons need to stay forever. The fact of the matter isn't as Speaker Ryan has said this before. We needed all of the above strategy. And to get there, we just need a rational conversation. I'd say that's the most frustrating part for folks that are in the industry. You've got hundreds of thousands, millions of people that are coming to work every day working hard trying to create oil and gas to create energy to provide energy security and reliability.",https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LuX9IXzHLV4,23,2022-10-25 15:34:50
4043," For folks that are in the industry, you've got hundreds of thousands of millions of people that are coming to work every day working hard, trying to create oil and gas, to create energy, to provide energy security and reliability. And then you go out and the president of your country is condemning you for doing that. And it's not fun. I really hope that we can create a more practical conversation where we can have a real dialogue about what is the best way, 10 years, 20 years, 30 years, to power this country and to power the world and the growth of anticipated things. Yeah, I would just say, Kiko, look, American oil and gas producers are the cleanest producers, the most efficient producers. This is really good for American jobs. It's good for bringing inflation down and it's very good for foreign policy to be able to give our allies access to our oil and gas. And by the way, gas is a great bridge fuel to a lower carbon future. So I think it's an attractive sector. I think it's very good for America. And I do believe that my friends in Congress, when they take the majority, which I think they will, understand this. And they're going to bring some more common sense conversation to the whole energy discussion. Let's talk about one more thing that could potentially flare up again, depending on the outcome, we should say, of the midterms, the debt ceiling. This is another fight that could potentially emerge as a flashpoint, come 2023. You're a veteran of that. And I wonder how you're thinking about the Republicans using this as leverage. Do you think they should be, or is it time to abolish the debt ceiling altogether? I've been through so many debts. I can't even count how many debt ceiling fights I've been through. America is going to keep its full faith in credit. We're not going to re-knick on the debt. And yeah, always. Democrats have done this to Republicans. Republicans have done this to Democrats. It's a moment for a fiscal, it's a fiscal impasse moment where you should get a down payment on good fiscal policy. I was on the Bulls Simpson Commission, which Democrats held hostage in order to get a commission during the debt limit debate. So we've had spending caps on debt limit debates. We've had so many fiscal policies being attached to debt limit because you don't want to just keep rubber stamping more borrowing. You want to try and get some kind of policy in place to get the curve going in the right direction. Try and bend the curve on debt. We will have a debt crisis in this country in the not-to-distant future if we don't get our fiscal house in order. And so I think it's a very important point. Having said all of that, I'm very confident that the U.S. dollar is secure and that our bonds we paid and that the full faith in credit of the United States government is going to be intact in this divided government that we're likely to have in the future. Paul Ryan, former Speaker of the House and Chairman of the Executive Network Partnering Corporation SPAC and Luke Brandenburg, Granite Ridge CEO. Thanks to both of you today. Really appreciate the time. Thank you, Keith. Well, coming up, easing the pain, China Central Bank looks to capital inflows to shore up a slumping yuan, making it simpler for domestic companies to raise funds from overseas. But doesn't a strong dollar make it all mute anyway? You'll discuss on the other side. Thank you. Thank you. Thank you.",https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LuX9IXzHLV4,24,2022-10-25 15:39:01
4044," We are located on the versch first Volvo Jan6n That´s really cool This is the final Perfect the Welcome back to Yahoo Finance Live or some of you seeing some of those gains pick up here in the session with the Dow up nearly 300 points now for more on today's Friday's Friday market action. Let's go to Jared Blyckery at the Wi-Fi interactive and Jared, you've got your eyes on Bon Yield, especially on the shorter end of the curve. That's right. The shorter and the let's put this to the 13 week T bill yield. This has just been racing higher and that is because it tracks the federal funds benchmark and that is on the very short side. And so we know that the fed the Federal Reserve is going to raise rates at a faster clip than previously thought blah, blah, blah 75 basis points in November in another week 50 basis points in December. And let's check out the chart here. This is over the last three months. Now the rest of the yield curve heading down in a pretty quick fashion today. We'll show that in a second, but just wanted to show you the relentless trek higher here by the 13 week T bill yield and it has been doing this all throughout the month of October here. There was just a brief respite in the second half of September. And let me just show you a max chart. These are the highest levels that we've seen since October of 2007 coincidentally, that was when the stock market peaked about a year before the financial crisis, the global financial crisis. Now here's a five year T-note yield. We can see that is racing higher as well, although it is backing off 14 basis points. Huge volatility, by the way, in the bond market like we've been seeing 10, 15 basis points per day, that spills over to equities. It's very difficult to manage these highly leveraged positions in the currency and bond market and have stocks up. Nevertheless, stocks are up today. So you can see 30 year T bond yield, very similar story, all of these things coming off multi year highs. Now, let me also show you what's happening in the currency market because US dollar taking a little bit of a breather today. Let me show you all of this. If it's red, that means the dollar is down versus these various currencies. But we've seen this relentless trek higher by the US dollar versus, for instance, the Japanese yen. We have this big bank of Japan meeting this Friday that Kiko Yuenai have been talking about, Karota the head of the bank of Japan. He's out in April, but he's been saying he's gonna stand his ground. Nevertheless, 28% increase in the dollar versus the yen creates a lot of pressure over there. Another pair I've been watching is the Chinese Yuan versus Japan, the Japanese yen. That could get some kind of a reset here. So all kinds of things possible as we've been saying day after day in the currency market, spilling over to equities, but today everybody, at least on the equities side, looking green. Yeah, and we got that headline from the PBOC as well making it sort of easier to borrow from overseas and that points to the pullback that we have seen in the Yuan level as well, at least on short trade. Jared, thanks so much for that. Let's switch gears and go back to shares of general motors. A company we've been tracking all morning here. That stock is up three and a half percent after the company posted a big earnings beat but maintained its guidance for a deeper dive in the auto space. Let's bring an auto blog editor in chief, Greg Migliore, Greg, good to talk to you today. We were kind of diving through the numbers with our auto correspondent, Praz earlier, who said, look, it feels like at least with the GM story, things have started to turn the corner, things are looking a little better on supply chains, the chip shortage in terms of inventory. What was your big takeaway from the numbers we got this morning?",https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LuX9IXzHLV4,25,2022-10-25 15:43:48
4045," things are looking a little better on supply chains, the chip shortage in terms of inventory. What was your big takeaway from the numbers we got this morning? Sure, well, good morning. Thanks for having me back. General Motors had a record third quarter for revenue based on profitable sales. It trucks of SUVs in North America. They really got the supply chain under control, which quite simply allowed them to make and sell more vehicles. It really, you know, wasn't a rocket science. It all really came together for them in the last quarter. They also had a lot of good publicity too. They had the reveal of the GMC Sierra and the Chevy Equinox electric vehicles. Even the Chevy Bolt, which is their smaller electric crossover in car, had strong salesdubers. And it bounced back from some recall issues that they had had previously. So this is basically General Motors near-term strategy. Sell lucrative trucks of SUVs to fund the electric vehicle programs. And they do this while consumers and sort of the company figure out what's to come next as far as EVs. And how do you see demand shaping up, especially with some of those EV trucks that you say will be the revenue driver that accelerates the transition or the company's transition to all EVs? I think of the next couple of years, you're going to see demand really increase for some of these vehicles from General Motors. They're really targeting high-volume segments, like the Sierra and the Silverado. These are full-sized pickup trucks. They already sell a lot of vehicles with internal combustion engines in these segments. So quite simply adding some electric versions. I mean, it's really a part of the market where they can capture and grow market share. And that's actually what they did in the third quarter. They, their market share hovered around 16% which was up from about 13% a year ago. Now that might not sound like a lot, but in the auto industry, it's so competitive just to get even a sliver of market share. So to me, that was another sign that things are going in the right direction for General Motors. Looking ahead here, Greg, we're going to be watching for numbers out from four. This is another one of those legacy companies that has gone through a lot of transition in the process of going all electric, including staff cuts. How do you think that's going to be reflected in the quarterly numbers? I think it'll be a little too early to tell as far as some of the moves that they've made just in the last couple quarters, how that will shake out for Ford's bottom line. What's interesting to me is how they're setting up their electric vehicles and their internal combustion vehicles is almost like separate units. And they're going to break those out and display those numbers in the future. I think that'll be painted in an interesting picture as far as where Ford is right now and where they're going in the future. It's a very creative approach to accounting to reporting financial numbers. So we'll be looking to see how that lands. Okay, that's stock at least getting a lift from GM's numbers today to AutoBug Editor in Chief Greg Migliori. Good to talk to you today. What is now time for our chart of the day? And today, we are honing in on the West Coast as I like to call it the best coast. The state of California poised to overtake Germany as a world's number four economy moving up the ranks just behind the U.S., China and Japan with recent data and flying California's already $72 billion ahead of Germany when you account for the state's recent growth rate. Now this chart we're watching from Bloomberg points to the diverging paths. Europe's largest economy, the largest economy in the U.S. have taken. California has 379 companies with a market value of at least a billion dollars. Germany has just 155 when you look at the top 10 firms in each region. California companies, including Alphabet and Apple. Yes, a lot of those tech names have outperformed the German ones on every metric. On the macro front, California's economy is also ahead of Germany's with its unemployment rate at 3.9 percent compared to Germany's at 5.3 percent. We should point out by the way, California also the unemployment rate there coming down from Texas, which is of course second largest economy in the U.S. It's the first time that's happened since 2006. While coming up seeking AC's fire, 30 Democratic House members urge President Biden to shift his strategy on the Russia Ukraine conflict. All this comes just two weeks before the midterms.

4046," Two weeks before the midterms. I've been worrying. There will no longer be a blank check. That's next. � oblivious to the Come 2024 we want to win. We want to beat Biden or the Democrats, whoever they're running. And we know it's just a factual statement polling wise. We are worse off with Trump as our nominee than with somebody else. So I just think it's going to be palpable in 2024 that because we want to win and beat the Democrats, we know as a party we're better off with somebody else to be our nominee, to more guarantee a victory because we know we lose with Trump. That was former House Speaker Paul Ryan talking about their Republicans. Where the party stands going into 2024 elections before then, but before then we have to go first to the midterms, economic indicators that best predict the fate of the Democratic Party are pointing to a gloomy or outlook than desired. More on this we have Yahoo Finance, Rick Newman who's on top of the latest poll numbers. I mean exactly what the former House Speaker was also pointing to saying he's feeling pretty good. I guess the question is if the Republicans take the House, how big will that majority be? And we're getting closer to what might look like a red wave that seemed to be receding just a month or six weeks ago. Now it seems to be going the other way. So I saw an interesting piece of analysis. Everybody's been focused on gas prices. Us and everybody else, the Biden White House follows this almost by the minute. And those have come down that has worked out for a present by now around $380, well below $4 a gallon. Moody's Analytics has an interesting piece out and they say there's a strong correlation, not so much between gas prices, but between what happens with real disposable income. Real incomes adjusted for inflation a month or two or three before the election. And by this measure, things look terrible for Biden. Real incomes, depending on how you measure it, but on a year over year basis, almost at record lows. And there's some COVID distortion in there, but you can kind of factor that out. And what's happening is the rate of inflation is now 8.2%. Paychecks are only going up by about 5%. So inflation is just going up way more than pay. So people really are falling behind. Purchasing power is falling behind. That does not normally happen. oh, that could happen.",https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LuX9IXzHLV4,27,2022-10-25 15:52:31
4047," And paychecks are only going up by about 5%. So inflation is just going up way more than pay. So people really are falling behind. Purchasing power is falling behind. That does not normally happen. That's really unusual. And that is probably what voters mean when they say they're really concerned about the economy. Yes, gas prices, but a lot of other things too. Yeah, and it sort of comes down to, well, how much of my wallet is taking a hit every time I go out and buy groceries? Forget the fact that the labor market's strong. You know, it's not necessarily how voters sort of break things down. There's an interesting headline that came out yesterday, the progressive wing of the House Democrats putting out a letter, essentially calling for a shift in the stance for what's playing out between Russian, Ukraine, essentially saying that there should be a blank check. There should be some kind of negotiation. I mean, this is a shift from where the Biden administration has been pushing for. What's the strategy here? Well, I don't know if there is a strategy. This may have explode. It's ridiculous. And it's really stupid. And I think the 30 Democratic progressives who signed this really wish that they had this letter had never gone to the White House and they started walking it back right away. Basically what they're saying is, let's continue to think that there could be a diplomatic solution here and that we could somehow negotiate with Putin. Putin himself could have written that letter. And the reason is, Ukraine's army is kicking Russia's ass on the battlefields inside Ukraine. So of course, Putin would like to say, hey, before we lose any more territory, let's see if we can negotiate a solution here, which in theory would keep Russian forces occupying the parts of Ukraine they already have. And Ukraine has momentum and they've been making a lot of progress. The Russian army, by some measures, is falling apart in Ukraine. So no, this is not a time when you would negotiate with Putin who is dishonest and is a thief anyway. I mean, he wouldn't live it. So Putin would love to cement all his gains through some kind of negotiation with the United States. So what these 30 Democrats did is they kind of weakened President Biden's hand. And the moment this letter became public, you had a lot of other Democrats, mainstream Democrats saying, this is all wrong. Now, of course, Republicans are happy to sit back and let Democrats score an own goal, as you would say in soccer, two weeks before the midterm elections. This was just a completely foolish move. Yeah. Especially ahead of the midterms where we've already heard some of the Republicans saying that maybe we're not going to give a blank check to Ukraine. So a debate that will continue. Rick Newman, as always, thanks so much for that. Coming up on the other side, Warner Bros. Discovery could encourage as much as $4 billion in restructuring charges. So how much content could hit the cutting room floor? We've got Ali Canal on the story after the break. This is how the Party, especially the generation of four Democrats to sit back and really listen a lot to開心.

4048," natuurl Well, no question downsizing comes with a cost. Warner Bros. Discovery planning to incur between $3.2 billion and $4.3 billion in pre-tax restructuring costs for 2024. That's according to a new SEC filing. We've got Allie Canal on the story for us today. And Allie, the question is, after what's happened with Discovery, are there more projects that are going to be cut? Definitely, because a bulk of these charges are on the content side of the business between $2.5 billion are tied to restructuring that part. So, thank you, you know, the cancellation of the Back Girl movie that was supposed to be on HBO Max. That's gone. There's a lot of projects in development that they had to cut. They physically went and removed certain movies and shows from the platform. And ultimately, this is because David Zazov wants to keep his promise to Wall Street slash $3 billion worth of costs over the next two years. We've seen a significant amount of layoffs as a result of that. Most recently, the company's television studio cut 26% of its head count. So not the brightest picture heading into earnings next week, especially as we have this overhang of mechroconomic headwinds like foreign exchange pressures, as well as losses and subscribers for linear television. So a lot to think about for this company. Yeah, I've heard more and more from people who were saying I'm thinking about cutting some of my streaming content to save costs. So it'll be interesting to see what kind of commentary we hear on that front. Thanks so much for that, Ali. Let's do a final check of the markets before we let you go. We've been seeing all three majors in the green right now with a doubt up to 175 points, big tech earnings on tap after the bell today. Microsoft and Alphabet is what we're watching.

4049," The housing market and climbing mortgage rates could be pushing more perspective buyers back into the rental market. Our next guest says this makes it the perfect time to invest in residential areas of the commercial real estate market. Let's bring in Nouveau and real estate global chief investment officer Carly Trip. Carly, good to see you this morning. So where should investors look in this backdrop? You know, I think that with all the data coming out, we're looking at a moderated home price appreciation scenario. And I think especially with the chart you just showed and mortgage rates ending the week last week above 7%, so even higher than that chart shows. That's going to continue pressure on the ability to buy and sell a home. And so what that's going to do is increase the demand for rental housing. Wow. Okay, that's not good news for me, a renter. So with all of this in mind, on the existing home side, you've got this conundrum as well, because people aren't necessarily jumping to list their homes or add that inventory to the market knowing that there might not be prospective buyers out there right now because of the rising rate environment. 100%. I mean, inventory levels, keeping a cap on inventory levels is going to be the saving grace of the housing market no doubt. So the data that we saw last week, the data that's coming out this week, existing home sales, pending home sales, inventories, under units under construction, et cetera, percent increase just from one year ago. Carly, when we do get the sense of that Fed pivot, how does that change how you put money to work? The sense of the Fed pivot, if they start to temper back their rate hikes, what happens? I think is that the US is really, really strongly positioned right now to have a foothold in the global economy. So we took a much more hawkish stance on our central bank policy and what that's resulted in is this currency destabilization across major markets throughout the world. And I think given that the US is really able to export energy, we can supply our own food, we can supply our own manufacturing, we are the second largest manufacturer globally. That's setting up the United States to be well positioned to come out of whatever cycle we are going to see over the next 12 months. So as a real estate investor, I would definitely focus on the US and I would focus on more non-sickical inflation linked assets such as housing, industrial, healthcare, related assets, et cetera. So this home builder confidence from which you're tracking, is that starting to improve or show any signs of alleviation from the declines that we had seen because delivering a house fully at this point, given some of the logistics and supply chain challenges, that has been cited, that's been noteworthy and impacted that confidence. Yeah, absolutely not. Absolutely not. I do not expect home builder confidence to come back anytime soon. As you saw, it's plummeted and it's expected to continue to plummet with that will result in for investors like us as an opportunity actually to scoop up some new inventory and master plan communities. I think prices that will be well below what we could have seen last year. How long after the Fed sees what it needs to on the housing side and home ownership side, do you believe that it will take for actual rental prices to start to come down? I think rental prices are going to start to come down. So if you just look at certain simplistic stats, like home prices to wages, that index is well above a normalized mean. That is not a good indicator. I think that leads to a softening in rents. Also if you look at just inflation numbers, particularly score CPI, shelter accounts for 40% so an increase in shelter costs. So there is going to be continued pressure to get those prices down, particularly in the rental market and the home market. But I would say that if you look across your rental options, single family rental, we're really seeing a lot of tempering in new starts and under construction versus multi-family, which is continuing to outdo historical numbers. And have been real estate global, even.",https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LuX9IXzHLV4,30,2022-10-25 16:05:32

4051," DR especially e-commerce related offerings. There is an integration with Shopify. There are other others like that out there. That's what you have to prove. And you have to start monetizing these ventures where you are not seeing ads right now, especially Spotlight, which will draw some of these tick-tock budgets, you know, think about, you know, like also other video budgets coming live with respect to Netflix and Disney Plus and so on, which will draw a lot of the linear TV budgets over into digital and they are likely also going to end up in some of these social media networks. All of the social media networks right now are trying to become the shopping mall or at least replace them need for going to physical retail and drive more conversion. Can they successfully fill the void where perhaps that in-person shopping experience can be offset by that virtual shopping experience driven by interest and then actual purchase decisions. And do you see that actual amount of money that's going to be spent on this platform on these platforms improving over the near term as well? Yeah, I mean, I guess it's a few things that need to happen. First, we have to work on friction. Friction between looking at products, buying them, after-sale service with respect to messaging integrations and so on. And these platforms are working on that. You see that was picked to messaging functionality on WhatsApp, you know, in the meta universe, and we are going to see more of that. The second thing that we need to see is more integration of inventory. So literally everyone of these social media platforms has integrated with Shopify now. There are many more similar offerings like Shopify out there to think about like a WooCommerce, for example, and so on. These need to happen and need to be smooth as well. And you have to think about like combined baskets so that a checkout experience, you know, might work significantly easier than it is today. And then lastly, when you also think about all these ID headwinds that we're having and Apple's ATT is just the beginning, right? You have to think about like SDK runtime on Android, you have to think about cookies disappearing for many of these retailers. Both OmniChannel and smaller DTC brands, it is becoming significantly harder to track from an ad to a conversion if there is not an on-platform checkout functionality embedded into that. So the more we are going towards in that direction of IDs disappearing, the more likely we're going to see adoption of these on-platform functionalities and that should increase the shopping that we're seeing on these platforms. Okay, and so with so much of that focus on shopping, being either prompted by the consumer data that the companies, the social media platforms are looking at or just by the trends of how many people are just comfortable spending their money through a social media platform. Does that mean that there's an authenticity vacuum with legacy social media right now? If everybody's just trying to sell me on something and content creators, I know that they're in partnership with someone who wants to get my dollar at the end of the day, then where do I go to actually just have that valuable connection? Yeah, I mean, if you think about some of the larger retailers out there, right? So name Amazon, name Etsy, name eBay. All of these have an issue that they don't really have any social media connections or offerings on the side. Amazon might be with Twitch, but still small compared to other social media networks. But what all of them have and throw a Shopify in the bucket as well is they have huge audiences and they have huge intent and conversion data. And if that sort of data can be made actionable into these social media environments and that brings us into the discussion of clean rooms and privacy laws and so on, but if that data can be made actionable, then we're not going to be overloaded with shopping related ads and it's going to be likely significantly more targeted than we have seen it so far. Okay, all right. Perhaps just my own sugar in the night inserted there into the conversation. We're gonna take research, senior analysts, and Rocker Strauss, we appreciate your analysis of all these companies and breaking that down for us this morning.",https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LuX9IXzHLV4,32,2022-10-25 16:14:09
4052, you you all eyes are on big tech this week with apple amazon and meta plus alpha bed all set to report earnings but how will this impact ETF investors that if i head of research tod Rosenbluth joins us now to discuss okay so help us break this down i mean with regards to some of the ETF trends that we've seen thus far what are inflows looking like into tech sector ETFs well the technology sector has been relatively strong in 2022 we've seen over six billion dollars of money go into technology ETFs that's following on with some of the more defensive sectors so we've seen strong inflows into consumer staples strong inflows into utilities health care has actually been the leading sector whereas discretionary and communication services sectors have seen net outflows and as we tie into the big tech earnings that you talked about it really matters what ETF we're talking about and whether how it's classified tall where do you see investors gravitating to more specifically in the in the tech are they still staying clear of anything that owns a social media stock i think what the real focus for them is understanding what is inside these portfolios so we mentioned earlier meta and alpha bed are reporting results those are classified as communication services companies in many of the sector ETFs so you would find that in xlc which is a communication services selector spider ETF but you would not find meta or alpha bed within the technology selector spider which is xlk or the vanguard information technology ETF vgt because of those these sector ETFs are tied to the gix sector framework and s and p and msci classified companies like apple and microsoft as technology companies like meta and alpha bed as communication services companies and so the devil is in the details as to what's inside these portfolios so with regard to all of these big tech names it's still going to come down to what their free cash flow looks like and and where their mer maintaining margins within their businesses some of them very much advertising focused or all of their businesses advertising whereas some of them have a little bit more at play with regard to amazon there and so what would you be watching kind of throughout the tech earnings to see where they're maintaining some of those margins so i think the focus for all of these companies we're likely to see the currency headwinds happen all of these companies are multinational in nature it's different how their exposure happens to be but we've had a strong u.s dollar that is going to weigh down on overall profitability it just comes down to how profitable they were before the currency impact and so a company like apple which is again in the technology sector and part of vgt or xlk the demand for iphone is going to be important a company like meta of course it's tied to search you're going to have different impact uh... at search as well as social media you're going to have a different impact as well so i'm not an expert on individual companies but i do think investors are looking to get exposure to these companies through the diversification benefits of an ETF and they need to know what's inside those ETFs taught us anything surprised you this earnings season i think it's been better than,https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LuX9IXzHLV4,33,2022-10-25 16:18:23
4053," through the diversification benefits of an ETF, and they need to know what's inside those ETFs. Todd, is anything surprised you this earnings season? I think it's been better than we've seen and expected. I think financials has been relatively strong and you get exposure to financials through the financial selector, spider ETF and through bank oriented ETFs like the spider S&P bank ETF. I think that's been relatively strong. The bar tends to be set relatively low, heading into earnings season and companies have been exceeding that roadily low bar, but we'll see what happens. And again, ETF investors get the benefits of diversification across the sector as opposed to having to pick an individual winner heading into and after earning season. Do you expect that any of these companies will either revise downward their guidance or pull guidance? I don't think we're going, I don't have the expertise to be able to dive into individual companies, but what tends to happen when companies report results, they tend to beat the expectations and then the guidance takes a look at where we are from an economic perspective. And so the dollar is likely to continue to be strong or likely to see the impact of rising interest rates, impact the overall economy and recession has been top of mind for many companies. So they're more likely to lower the bar and again seek to exceed that during your earnings season, giving investors something else to watch beyond the current forecast, looking further into the future. I wish you were here Todd because the big energy is flowing on this desk between me and Brad, we are psych frapp earnings. This is a big, big week of earnings, always an exciting time for all of us. Vetify head of research Todd, Rosemblitz, good to see you. We'll talk to you soon. Thank you. All right, switching gears here. The Internal Revenue Service announced a welcome cost of living adjustments to the US's marginal tax rate that will increase the take home pay for many workers in 2023. Joining us now with more on the latest tax brackets is Blue Ocean and Global Wealth CEO, Margarita Cheng. Margarita, good to see you here this morning. So what do these changes mean to the average consumer? So this is actually a positive. Who would have thought inflation is positive, but because inflation has been at the highest level in 40 years, what that means is you could find yourself in a lower tax bracket because the IRS has raised the income level. So you could be earning the same if not slightly more and still end up in the same tax brackets. OK, so all right, help me understand this. Like how quickly does this go into effect? I mean, is this just immediate? Sure, I definitely can understand. So I know that we just finished taxes in April. There are some people who filed an extension so they just submitted their 2020 return October 15th. And I know we're in 2022. And 2022 is not over, but we are planning for 2023. So here's the takeaway. The US tax system is not a flat tax system. It is progressive. It's graduated. So there are. As you can see on the screen, there are seven tax brackets. The lowest is 10%. The highest is 37. So I want people to understand is if you find yourself a certain [""Why me unholy έlann dans le wi wrth van introduced sf futus laughing anh for the interest of b",https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LuX9IXzHLV4,34,2022-10-25 16:22:59
4054," on the screen there are seven tax brackets. The lowest is 10% the highest is 37. So I want people to understand is if you find yourself in the middle 24% tax bracket, that does not mean that you pay 24% on all to 364,000 dollars. You pay 10% on the first 11 then from 11 then it goes up. So that's what we mean by graduated from the last year. So my this does go into effect for 2023 and the reason why it is going into effect is the IRS has made adjustments. I don't need to tell you all that inflation is real and this is based on costs of goods and services for 80,000 items. Okay, and so with all of this in mind, how does this actually impact the real take home wages for people? Does does it? Assuming your income is the same and your income has not gone up, you very well could be in a lower tax brackets. The other takeaway is the IRS has raised the standard deduction. So they have raised the standard deduction for somebody who is single by $900 and they've raised the standard deduction for somebody who's married by $1800. So what that means is you certainly can have a higher tax rate of $1800. So if you're not able to get the standard deduction, what if your itemized deductions do not exceed the standard deduction, you'd be better off taking the standard deduction. So that's essentially how it can impact everyday individuals and families. Marguerio, since these changes have come to light, what are some of the biggest questions you've gotten from your clients? So the first question is, and this was surprising for folks. So what can we do about this? How does this affect me? So the first thing I've told people is that the IRS tax with holding calculator, just because you don't want to be unpleasantly surprised. So the first thing is check that out. And if you do need to adjust your withholding, you want to complete a W4. The other thing that people have asked about is the limits. The IRS has increased the 401k contribution limit by $2000. So that is a very significant increase. So for individuals under 50, they can now contribute $22,500. They can also contribute 500 more to an IRA or Roth IRA. They have also increased their contribution to a health care flexible spending account. The thing that has been shocking for people who have young children is the dependent care spending account amount has not been adjusted. It is still at $5,000. So this is how it has impacted individuals and families. All right. Our taxes. For retirees as well. There you go. Thank you so much for breaking this down. Taxes a place that we never want to be unpleasantly surprised at global wealth, blue ocean, global wealth, chief executive officer, Mark and Rita Chang. Rita, thanks so much for taking the time here with us today. Thank you. Thank you.",https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LuX9IXzHLV4,35,2022-10-25 16:27:04
4055," Well, it is shaping up to be a big week for the broader tech story with the likes of Apple, Amazon, and Metta all reporting in the coming days. Until now, a big revenue miss for Snap and signs of a dire online ad market has been the major warning sign for the space. The NASEC has plummeted over 30% since the start of the year outpacing declines for the S&P. The sector has also been contending with what my next guest calls a COVID hangover because of tech over investment. Let's bring in Erica Klauer, a Jemisin associate tech equity portfolio manager, a lot to get through to this week. But let's start by looking back to what happened last week. We saw the huge sell-off coming on the back of Snap that has accelerated concerns about a decline in online ad spend. How much of that are we going to see reflected, especially in Metta and Elphabet? Well, we talked a little bit about the fact that a lot of the advertising at SnapChat has basically been a result of share loss. I think relative share gainers will be companies like Google, like Facebook. Nevertheless, there is a lot more pressure in terms of justifying the price of advertising online that I think will persist throughout 2023. And so when you look at somebody like Elphabet, what we have learned, at least from the past few quarters, is that they are a little more diversified when it comes to this online ad spending. So obviously, it's not like Snap, where we're just talking about one particular app, you know, a specific market. Does that shield Elphabet for some of the headwinds that we've been seeing in a company like Snap? I think you're absolutely right. Google is much more diversified than a Snapchat is. And Sam goes for Facebook as well. What about Amazon? They have made making a lot of big in roads, especially in the advertising space. That's right. I think Amazon has done a very, very good job with its advertising assets. And I expect that that division will continue to outperform and gain share. So how do you think investors should be looking at that? We'll sort of break down Apple separately, obviously, that there's a lot to get into there. But when you talk specifically about the stocks that are really affected by digital ads, and we're seeing a pullback in general, who's best positioned? Who do you stay away from? Well, I think overall spending will be somewhat pressured because there is a need right now to really look at all costs amongst all enterprises. There is rampant inflation with regards to labor costs and also input costs. So clearly, people are going to be scrutinizing their advertising budgets more than ever. However, in that context, the companies that are really executing and gaining share would include Amazon, Google, and Facebook. Let's talk about Apple. There's the obvious numbers that we look for in terms of where their demand is on iPhones, how they're expanding in services. But there's a larger story that I think a lot of investors are looking at that puts Apple right in the middle. And that is supply chain movements. We were just talking about China and the concerns that persist around there. Apple has a big presence. They've been trying to move production into India away from China. And then there's this big tech control crackdown that the Biden administration has put forward that does affect Apple and where they source their chips. Well, if we take a giant step back, what we're looking at this week is accumulative 7 trillion amount and market value of companies reporting this week amongst the big tech players. The advertising companies are in one bucket and then of course, they're the hardware and software companies in the other bucket, including the likes of Apple. And what I would say about Apple is that the company is executing extremely well. But it is not immune to the the trends that you just mentioned. It took decades to basically consolidate all of their manufacturing in lower cost regions. That's being undone right now as the supply chain is being diversified. So ultimately, that is inflationary in its nature. And at the same time, we have a much more difficult demand environment where many people bought their smartphones. They bought their personal computers during COVID. So there's not that dramatic need that we've seen over the last three years to upgrade or even to attract the first time buyer. We can talk about the shift in where manufacturing is happening, where you source your supplies. What does that specifically mean in terms of inflation? Are we looking at higher prices down the road?",https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LuX9IXzHLV4,36,2022-10-25 16:31:35
4056," Explain me in terms of inflation, are we looking at higher prices down the road? Is it going to be cushioned by the company just given the cash pile that they have? How do you see that being reflected in the coming quarters? Well, there are companies that are just masters of their supply chain. Apple would be the poster child for that. However, I think that when one is thinking about duplicate efforts to ensure no disruption to supply chain, that inherently means higher costs. And so the company will have to really assert its pricing power in order to offset those higher costs. I think that's going to be a story over the next couple of years. Still the strongest name though in the big tech space? Absolutely. I think Apple is showing very strong gains in market share. Even now with its dominant position, it's still outpacing its peers in terms of adoption. Eric, a cloud-wide genocent associate, technology equity portfolio manager. It's good to talk to you today. Appreciate your time. Thank you. We are beginning this hour though.青回合 such as persistent COVID-19 curbs and global recession risks. We should point out that that stocks lower in greater China on investor fears of Xi's new term, favoring ideology, driven policies over growth, the Hang Seng and Hong Kong Capt. It's worse day since the financial crisis in 2008, and the Shanghai Comp also down about 2% there. Major Chinese tech names also falling into the red on concerns about Xi's embrace of state-owned firms versus private companies. We've got a panel for you to break it all down for us. We've got China-Bajibok co-founder and CEO Lila Miller alongside Keith Crack, his chairman of the Crack Institute for Tech Diplomacy at Purdue. Gentlemen, this great to have both of you on today. Lila, let me just start with you on the reaction that we got overnight in the Asia session here. Certainly, it looks like investors not feeling very comfortable with which direction China is now heading in with Xi securing his third term. What do you make of this sell off? Well, it's not altogether clear whether markets believe China's economic data this time around, but what's pretty clear is that nobody was very happy with the way that Xi packed the new leadership with loyalists. I think there was always a desire to see somebody who symbolized more market openings, disagreements in the top leadership, some sort of fulsome pushback against COVID-0. Look, you can read to leaves a million different ways here, but when you look at who he put up next to him, it looks like it's going to be the Xi show with very little pushback against him. I think that worries people who have watched the...",https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LuX9IXzHLV4,37,2022-10-25 16:36:00
4057," here, but when you look at who he put up next to him, it looks like it's going to be the she-show with very little pushback against him. And I think that worries people who have watched the crackdowns of the last two years. Leland, just to follow up there, I mean, this did seem very much like a focus more on sort of national security, not necessarily on economic policy. And I know we don't come to expect that at the party congress, but we're still looking at a growth rate here, well above that 5.5 percent target that was initially set out for the year. What does that tell you about where the economic priorities are for the third term for this president? I just think the economic priorities have completely changed from this time around. You know, we've been taught as China watchers to see the party as prioritizing growth above all. And that has been true for the last 5, 10, 15 years. It is not true anymore. Now, the China we're looking at right now led by Xi Jinping is one focused more on security. It's focused more on restructuring the economy, so there's fewer vulnerabilities for the party in terms of reckless credit expansion, the property sector, shadow, finance out of control. They want to take control of the economy, reroute the economic growth model. And to do that, they have to materially slow down the economy, stop pumping credit in. So things are changing dramatically. They're not forgetting about the economy, but the Chinese economic growth model, as we know, it is over. And they're shifting to a more realistic stance. Keith, certainly from the U.S. perspective, a lot to watch here in terms of the language that came out of the party congress. One thing, certainly those in Washington watching here, the changing in terms of the language with the party's constitution here, specifically on Taiwan, using the word strengthened, fighting spirit and ability, deterring any kind of separatists, or saying that they are, in fact, still moving in the direction of reunification. Why don't you take away from this party congress in terms of the timeline China is now thinking about in terms of reunification? Well, I don't think there's any doubt. Keith go that she is committed to that. You know, she is not only the most powerful dictator since Mao, but he's probably the most powerful dictator in the world since Hitler. And you know, he's probably even more dangerous. So I think a question for your viewers is not just what are, you know, what's the data, what's the analysis? Leeland is one of the great experts of the world on that. The question is, we know what's happening. There's no limit to his ambitions. So the question is, in terms of business boardrooms, what are you going to do about it? And what are the moral responsibilities? What are the fiduciary duties that shareholders have to mitigate risk with these board members have to mitigate that risk for their shareholders? And you know, I've spent a lot of time with the corporate boards out here in Silicon Valley. And all of these folks are putting together China contingency plans because they see the crackdown on the private sector. They see the draconian COVID lockdowns and they see no limit to his ambition for power. To what extent have those risks been elevated because of that consolidation of power that we saw over the weekend? When you said that you're talking to companies and their boards, what do those contingency plans now look like? Well, they cover a number of things. First of all, they cover supply chains because if there's any bottlenecks there, they all saw that during COVID. So that was a wake up call. The other big wake up call was when cheese totalitarian twin, put invaded Russia and 300 companies had to come out. They lost hundreds of billions. The China problems 10 to 20 time X that. So there's a conflict in Taiwan. It's not only disastrous for the business community. It's catastrophic for the tech business because of Taiwan's lock on semi-conduct. They also see the risk of cheap nationalizing firms, nationalizing, not being able to get their money out of there. But the also big question now that's popping up, Akiko is these crimes against humanity. They're committing in places like Xinjiang, United States and several other countries. I'll take a look.",https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LuX9IXzHLV4,38,2022-10-25 16:40:26
4058," in up a key goal is these crimes against humanity. They're committing in places like Shinjong, United States, and several other countries have labeled that genocide. So there's a real moral issue because they export that slave labor all throughout China. And we have already seen legislation here in the U.S. to crack down on some of that. Leland, last question to you. You know, as you know, these party congresses are very closely orchestrated every single detail. It is really, doesn't go without a hitch. And yet we saw what was kind of an awkward moment here, where we saw the former president, Hujin Tao, being escorted out. He's sitting right next to Shinjong Ping there. It appeared at least that he didn't want to go. And there's been a lot being made of that. You know, what exactly was the message Shinjong Ping was trying to send if it was, in fact, that? What was your read on that moment that we saw over the weekend? You know, it's hard to know for sure. You know, we know that it was a pretty big humiliation for who. But are we absolutely sure this is part of a public urge of the Communist Youth League faction, which barely exists anymore? That's not clear at all. Who's son was in the room? He's in the Paul Burrow. So I guess if we track his career over the coming months, we'll be able to get indications of whether this is something that was specific against who, or was some other dynamic. But very weird, was such a choreographed event. It is weird to have a spectacle like that that left people talking all weekend. So we're going to have to watch the politics the next couple of months to see what this was all about. OK. I appreciate you both joining us today, China-Bajibok, co-founder and CEO, Lila Miller, along with Keith Krock. He's chairman of the Krock Institute for Tech to Policy at Purdue. The biggest earnings week of the quarter is upon us, the What have we learned thus far? What have we heard from our business leaders? Yeah, I think that right now, business leaders are really focused, obviously, on the prospects of recession. And people are watching that very closely. See, looking for signs whether or not the economy is tilting into a recession. What we're seeing so far, though, is that consumer spending is held in really strongly. You're hearing from banks, especially at the beginning of the earning season, that consumers are still spending a bit consumer spending is up, double digits still year over year. And so there's strength in the economy at the most fundamental level, which is the consumer. And yet you have deteriorating company confidence, I think among the CEO is thinking that they need to be preparing for recession. So at a high level, that's what we're really saying right now. You just got into that point. I want to bring up what Goldman Sachs, the CEO David Solomon did say shortly after.",https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LuX9IXzHLV4,39,2022-10-25 16:44:46
4059," I was thinking that they need to be preparing for a recession. So at a high level, that's what we're really saying right now. It's gotten to that point. I want to bring up what Goldman Sachs, a CEO, David Solomon, did say shortly after the earnings were released. He said on the distribution of outcomes, there's a good chance that we have a recession in the United States comparing that to what we've heard from other bank CEOs, other executives. How does it stack up just in terms of the likelihood that we will see a significant slowdown? Yeah, that's a great question. I think David Solomon has probably been on the more bearish end of CEOs, bank CEOs, especially for the last several quarters. I think that it's easier to find a more negative comment from David than from some of the other ones. Obviously, Jamie Diamond has been notably bearish talking about a hurricane could be coming through the economy. And I would say that Brian Moynihan has been on the most bullish side at Bank of America, of any of the bank CEOs. And that has proven the same case during this earnings season as well. So Brian Moynihan was one who reminded that the consumer is still very strong, relatively Goldman Sachs and JP Morgan CEO David Solomon and Jamie Diamond were both a little bit more bearish. And I would say that David Solomon has been the most cautious of anybody, which maybe isn't too surprising because Goldman Sachs obvious has the largest capital markets business of those three, whereas Bank of America would be touching consumers more directly. Right, right. It's not just their interpretation. Some of them certainly have different business models. Let's move over to the consumer. And what we're learning from them, here's the MX CEO. We're confident. Look, the spending speaks for itself. I mean, just look at some of these numbers. You've got goods and services up 16%. Our US consumer is up 22%. Millennial spending is up 39%. Our teeny spending is up 57%. International spending is 37%. We haven't seen any change. And you can look at this quarter over quarter. And the reality is that, you know, S quarter was a record level quarter in terms of spending. And this is like, I don't know, billion dollars behind or something like that. But if you look at year over year growth, we're not seeing any changes in consumer spending behavior at all. A remarkable statement given inflation was that an outlier statement? Or does it really sum up what we're hearing? No, I think it sums up honestly with what we're hearing from consumer credit card companies, especially, which is really the most important indicator because credit card companies are obviously seeing all of the spend that consumers are doing, not just in certain categories. And the numbers that they're seeing are significant. So you heard an American Express talk about double-digit increases in some major categories. And so I think what's important and why we focus on what's going on at the credit card spending company, or the companies with credit card data, is that in some of the other areas of the consumer sector, we're seeing slowdown. And you're seeing this shift from goods back to services that still playing out post-pandemic. And the card companies are capturing all of that. But if you just listen to certain segments, you may see decline in good spending or boosts in service spending. But the card companies are encapsulating all of that. And it's got another big theme. Obviously, is this strong dollar? We've heard it not only this quarter, but of course over the past several quarters, when you take a look at the dollars jump up, nearly 17% this year alone. I want to play a quick clip from what we heard on Netflix's earnings call after the results. The FX drag is significant. We mentioned in the letter, if we look at, you can do the math on our four quarters now, when you kind of roll it out to a full year number, we're still holding to what we're calling FX neutral to the beginning of the year, January 1 of this year, to that 19 to 20% margin range. FX neutral, you'll see it's actually is in the mid to higher end of that range. But on a reported basis, it's just a little over 17%. So there's about two and a half points of FX drag in our margin that equates to about, it's about a billion dollars of revenue drag, about 800 million dollars of margin drag. That was Netflix, a CFO Spencer Newman. And Scott, we've heard it from a number of executives, IBM, one of the big companies, obviously.",https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LuX9IXzHLV4,40,2022-10-25 16:49:00
4060," Spencer Newman. And Scott, we've heard it from a number of executives, IBM, one of the big companies obviously outwiring about the strong dollar their CFO saying it's a big wild card to what's going to happen to the US dollar. Obviously having a huge impact on their business. I'm sure we'll hear it more this week when we hear from some of the larger tech giants. What's on your radar as we look out over the next couple weeks when it comes to the strong dollar? Yeah, I mean, I think the strong dollar is one component, one major component that's impacting earnings growth in this quarter. And I think that's one of the big things that we're seeing this quarter versus previous quarters is that you're really starting to see earnings growth get impacted by some of the headwinds that we've been seeing in the economy. So the dollar is one and Netflix pointed out there. Proctor and Gamble also talked about a nine point headwind just from currency in its most recent quarter. But then also Proctor and Gamble talked about a 27 point overall earnings growth headwind, which again, 27 points is a massive number in terms of the growth headwind. And that was not just in terms of strong dollar, but that was also just the general inflationary environment, both in terms of their input costs and then also their free and delivery costs. And so those things, you know, that what we've been talking about thematically in markets and capital markets for a long time, I think are starting to actually hit the financial statements of companies in this quarter. And that's really important for two reasons. Not only is it it's impacting and showing where the economy is going, but as we think about what multiples to give to stocks, to equities, and ability to repay debt for companies as well, capital markets can get get impacted a further lag here by by decreasing earnings and some of these dynamics finally flowing through. That's great stuff. The transcript editor and avidale asset management founder Scott Kraseloff, appreciate it man, thanks. Markets plunging today in Hong Kong after Chinese leader Xi Jinping solidified control over the ruling communist party and secured an unprecedented third term. Some of four founding editor at large Steve Clemens joining us now for the first time on Yahoo Finance. Steve Good to see you. Let's first talk about the context of US-China relations given that the Biden administration just really ramped up that trade war with trip restrictions to China. What does Xi's continued rule mean for US-China relations? Well, I think it means that we're at an inflection point and Xi Jinping is reading the global map as one in which he sees America in strategic contraction. That made it feel differently than how we see things in Washington or New York, but that's what he sees. And he sees this as a time when China's got to get back to ideological purity, back to territorial reacquisition of parts of China that had previously been with it like Taiwan. And that part of the message here is that while Deng Xiaoping, a previous Chinese leader, leader said it's good for China to be rich. Well, now China is rich and it's going to get",https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LuX9IXzHLV4,41,2022-10-25 16:53:22
4061," message here is that while Dunjiao paying a previous Chinese leader said, it's good for China to be rich. Well, now China is rich and it's going to get back to ideology and that is very uncomfortable for markets and many of the transnational firms that are based there. So I think from a US-China perspective, it means competition and challenge are coming. If we're not already in it actually, it's gonna be a fight over standards and we're gonna be fighting over that rising global middle class in the world. Steve, you mentioned the reaction that we're seeing in the markets and markets are certainly taking this news very hard. You look no further than some of the largest US-listed Chinese companies in terms of that reaction today. Do you think that's justified? Well, I think it's, you know, I think markets fall when there's not trust in the future and there's doubt and I think there's a lot of doubt right now on how much Xi Jinping is going to be friendly to this. You know, look, we all have this view and I did two at one point, a couple of decades ago that the more China got interwoven into the world trade organization, became dependent on Chinese trade. Hell, US debt, that it would become a better stakeholder in world affairs. Well, it turns out that equation has some wobbliness to it. And I think right now it looks like China is not going to be increasingly like us or the West. It's gonna set standards in a new and different way. And right now it's one of the reasons it explains why Xi Jinping is so focused on consolidating power. He does not want to be challenged. He knows it's gonna be rough and he's gonna be asking his people for a lot of sacrifices as he basically takes on the West, in my view, for more leadership in world affairs and more consolidation within China. None of those are friendly to markets. He has cracked down on big tech leaders there in China, our prior guest Linda Düsseld essentially said he does not care about the economy in the short term. Can you put that in context for us? How a president would not care about the growth of their economy? Well, I think right now he has been focused on corruption. He's been focused on other elements. And you know, at one level, you know Xi Jinping has this theory of what he calls great power relations or what it means for China to be great on the world stage. And that does not mean making Ali Baba rich. That means taking the power and assets of China, which he thinks are awesome. And basically throwing all of his support behind that. But he's a bit disdainful that China's power is dependent upon, you know, its assets and markets being managed all around the world. I saw him in Davos a few years ago and this was right when the Trump administration that came in and he gave a remarkable speech and which he said, don't worry world. I'm going to be the one to protect markets and the market trading system in the world and I'm going to be the one to save us all from climate change. And it turns out that part one, he's not living up to. So when you take a look at the fact that Xi Jinping has been so strict when it comes to COVID, the number of the COVID zero policy, the number of lockdowns that have been instituted in China over the last two and a half years. I guess though at what point will he need to start listening to the Chinese people, those that are sick of these types of policies and that and we're obviously seeing that play out in the economy today. Well, it's really interesting because he's just elevated a number of people that were responsible for that policy. So I don't predict any real weakening of that and I think it's going to be complicated for China as it tries to reopen next year. I mean, I think we have to be very careful of mirror imaging with China that we would say, don't they want to risk back? Don't they want their people back? Don't they want to have all of the benefits that come with transnational traveling, exchange and tourism? Sure at one level they do, but the obsession with state control, the obsession with making sure that you have to understand by basically shutting China off, it's also become much, much more vulnerable to a future variant or something. You do not have the antibodies, the natural immunity that has built up in places that have been hit hard by COVID. So just some degree, China's got a staggering problem ahead in that it is basically created a Galapagos Island problem for itself where its own population is now less prepared for a future variant from COVID than it might have otherwise been. And I don't know how they'll handle that. All I know is that this is a person very, very comfortable with asserting...",https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LuX9IXzHLV4,42,2022-10-25 16:57:41
4062," for a future variant from COVID, then it might have otherwise been. And I don't know how they'll handle that. All I know is that this is a person very, very comfortable with asserting a lot of control over people's lives. That's good stuff. What does the third term mean for Taiwan? And if they're to take Taiwan, they do it by force, they do it by economic blockade. Well, look, I think that we have to be careful with Taiwan. I do think there are things that we could do or they could do that could trip us into war and it would be a very, very nasty war. And there are geographic realities with Taiwan that are very complex. But look, I think that China is of the view that it's incremental growth, the increasing investment it's made in its military power, its naval power, it's looking at how it is focused on what it could do by way of a blockade and others. I think we have to be very careful and remember that Taiwanese themselves may not, in fact, want this show down, some do, but some don't. And I think we need to make sure that they're in the picture or 90% of the world's most advanced semiconductors come from Taiwan. China wants it back, but I think right now, we're basically trying to figure out is the era of strategic ambiguity over Taiwan, which has actually been stable. Is that coming to an end? And this is one of the areas that could lead to an actual kinetic collision between American forces and Chinese forces if we're not careful. And I think it is one of the real hot points in the world. And I think Taiwan is in a vice between them. And we don't have many Henry Kissinger's around to kind of put this deal back together. No, we do not. Speaking of competition, Steve, wanted to hear about your outlet, Semaphore. It's an interesting tech play. I'm just curious how you guys position yourself in an increasingly competitive media environment. Look, we love all of our sibling organizations are out there working in the new media space. We launched about a week ago. We had, I think, largely really good reception from across all the verticals we're doing. I help anchor and host the politics and policy division called Principles. So if you'll be to sign up. But look, the big thing we're trying to say is there is a crisis out there in trust and confidence in news. It's also a market opportunity, honestly. And if we can come back to educating and interacting with the American public and the global public, frankly. And so it's important to hear Steve Clemens' views on things, perhaps, or my analysis of the news scoop. But I've got to be responsible to the fact that there are alternative views and opinions out there. And we build that in. We build in a disagreement. We build in international perspectives into what we're doing. We show people that you can look at the facts in the scoop out there, but you can get a lot of different views out there and you should demand it and expect it in your media. And that is not, as you know, what is typically happening. You're able to do it in the broadcast format much, much better than the typical print and journalism world that we're in. And so by building in alternative reviews, by building this in, I think we'll have a richer and more trusted news form down the road. And I look, you know, I encourage people to check us out. Steve, you're talking to a guy who worked at Fox News and CNN, man. So I get it. And I appreciate very much what you're doing. Thank you. We do look forward to following some of them. Of course, I'm a feeling we will be talking much more about that in the future. Steve, great to have you. Thanks so much for joining us. In this episode of influencers, Hermitage Capital Management CEO, Bill Browder. Are we ready to go to war? Is the United States ready to go to war with Russia? I think that this is going to lead to a Russian depression. I can't imagine the strangle how the stranglehold doesn't really drive the GDP down, like 20%, 25%. It's remarkable. And we're just in the early stages of this game. The Ukrainians are not going to roll over. They're going to fight like hell. Hello, everyone, and welcome to influencers. I'm Andy Sherwer. And welcome to our guest, Bill Browder, CEO at Hermitage Capital and Head of the Global Magnitsky Justice Campaign. In the late 1990s and early 2000s, Browder's firm delivered stellar returns, to回來.",https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LuX9IXzHLV4,43,2022-10-25 17:02:14
4063," of the global Magnitsky Justice campaign. In the late 1990s and early 2000s, Browder's firm delivered stellar returns by exposing corruption at major Russian companies, bringing about company shakeups and boosting share prices. In 2005, Browder was denied reentry to Russia and later became a victim of a Russian government scheme to undermine his firm, he says. Sergei Magnitsky, a lawyer hired Browder to investigate Russian corruption, was arrested and died in Russian custody. Bill, welcome to influencers. Thank you so much for joining us. Great to be here. So much to get to right now. I want to ask you maybe first of all about Vladimir Putin. And have you ever seen Putin reverse course in 25 years of Washington closely? Can you see him changing his tack now in Ukraine? Now that he's committed to a full scale invasion. That's the most important question of our discussion. And the answer is definitive no. Vladimir Putin, can't you have to imagine his world is the world of a prison yard. In a prison yard, you can't show any weakness. If someone comes at you with a shank, you've got to shank them 10 times more and look around at everyone else and say, who else wants to be shanked? That's Vladimir Putin's mindset. That's how he operates. And so when he has embarked on this horrific military invasion, there's no chance. Anytime he announces peace talks, that's just a tactic to either split up the resolve of the West or to delay some action to resupply or something like that. And so he is going to move forward. He's going to escalate. There's no retreat. There's no compromise. There's no diplomacy. He's all in it for victory. However, he defines that. And so a lot of people use this phrase endgame bill, but I'll ask you. I mean, what is the endgame here, specifically with Ukraine first? And does he want to occupy it or how would this work in his mind? Well, this is really another important part of Vladimir Putin. There is no endgame. So what you have to understand is he is not there for all the reasons that he says he's there. You can't believe a word he says. He's an in-veterate liar. His credibility is zero. And so any words that he has used to describe what he's doing should be discounted. The reason that he is in Ukraine is because after 22 years as a dictator, he sees the writing on the wall. He sees the writing on the wall, meaning that the Belarusian dictator next door was almost overthrown 18 months ago by his people. The Kazakh dictator, again, and next door in a different direction was overthrown. And Putin realized that it was just a matter of time before the Russians overthrew him. And so pulling straight out of the dictator's playbook 101, he said, what do you do to not get overthrown? You start a war. And he's described Ukrainians as Nazis and drug dealers. And he's described NATO as an invading force and all sorts of things. He doesn't believe any of that. He's just trying to come up with a narrative to give the Russian people something to chew on in order for him to have a war. And his war is there to stay in power. And so when you say, what is his endgame, there is no endgame. His endgame is to move forward, to expand, to attack, to take territory, to declare victories. But he has to keep on going no matter what it is. And this is just part of that process. And it's not like it just started now. I mean, the most recent version of this just started now. He was feeling under pressure in 2008. And that's when he invaded Georgia in 2014, the same thing. He took Crimea. And so this is a long process of him trying to stay in power as a dictator. And the most scary part of this whole story is that I don't have any belief that he will stop. So let's just say that he's successful in Ukraine. And that's a very big...",https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LuX9IXzHLV4,44,2022-10-25 17:06:23
4064," story is that I don't have any belief that he will stop. So let's just say that he's successful in Ukraine. And that's a very big question because the Ukrainians are valuably fighting back. But let's say he was successful in Ukraine. That's not the end of his story. He would then go to other countries. Maybe the easy ones, maybe the hard ones, maybe grabs Moldova at some point. But his ultimate goal for him is to show up at the border with us, which means Estonia or Latvia, Lithuania or Poland. And then to test out something that has never been tested before, which is are we ready to go to war? Is the United States ready to go to war with Russia to protect Estonia, a country of a million people that probably 2% of Americans could locate on a map? Are we ready to do that? Or are we not? And he's taken the bad, but we're not. But isn't this going to be very difficult for him just to hold on to this real estate? I mean, look at Afghanistan, very different country, certainly, but look at Afghanistan under Brezhnev. I mean, there's a huge cost to occupying these countries, right? Absolutely. So I was just saying, I was saying, that's his assumption is just keep on pushing out. Now, let's talk about Ukraine specifically. So he's launched an invasion of Ukraine. We don't know the exact number of casualties, but I've read various reports to say that there's 3,000 soldiers have been killed in the first four days of their occupation. I don't know if that's true or not. Maybe it's wild the exaggeration. Maybe it's totally true. But let's just say for a moment, let's just take for a moment and say it is true. That's the total number of soldiers that died in the entire war with Chechnya. That's like a third, or between a quarter and a third of the total number of soldiers that died after nine and a half years in Afghanistan. And so he's paying a hefty price, even if it's just a fraction of the 3,000, he's still paying a hefty price for what he's done so far. And we're just in the in the early stages of this game, the Ukrainians are not going to are not going to roll over. They're going to fight like hell. Thankfully, now, after some resistance, all of the major Western allies are going to assist them with equipment to help them fight and and give them some decent chance. But at the end of the day, Vladimir Putin is way outgunned them. I mean, he's got all sorts of stuff. There was I mean, shocking military hardware that could really, you know, be unbelievably destructive and to the people in Ukraine.",https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LuX9IXzHLV4,45,2022-10-25 17:10:48
4065," you you you you and it and repeating it and repeating it. So by the time the Russians invaded, there was no alternative narrative. So the way the Russians normally do this, and they did this with Georgia, for example, there was like confusion to this day about who fired first in Georgia, and the Russian apologists said, well, it was the Georgians who precipitated and provoked this war and so on and so forth. There's no uncertainty about this. This was a war of aggression, and that's a very important term. A war of aggression is a term they use in the Nuremberg trials. This is a war of aggression that everybody can agree on. And so there's nobody who can know sort of natural Russian apologists, nobody who's got a lot of financial interest with Russia, who can say anything other than this is a brazen attack on a peaceful neighbor. And that's an extremely important part of the narrative that has allowed all the Western countries to lock arms and do the coordinated sanctions that have been done right now, which are causing enormous financial pain to Vladimir Putin. Let's drill down into that Bill sanctions. How effective are they right now? What grade would you give them, for instance, and what do we need to do from here? So I'm a sort of connoisseur of sanctions. It's such a thing exists. And so when they first started this sanctions program about a week ago, last Tuesday, I would have given the Western governments a two out of ten. It was all very, you know, too little too late. Then the atrocities started to happen and the sanctions started getting real when they added the major Russian banks, big oil companies, et cetera. By Thursday, it was an eight out of ten. Then they did Swift. That's a nine out of ten. And then they did Vladimir Putin and nine and a half out of ten. So there's still some gaps that need to be filled in. Swift is only done, so Swift means disconnecting the Russian banks from the international financial system. And they've only done 70% of the banks. And so logic would tell you that if 70% of the banks are disconnected, they'll just route all the payments through the 30%.",https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LuX9IXzHLV4,46,2022-10-25 17:14:51
4066," Russian banks from the international financial system, and they've only done 70% of the banks. And so logic would tell you that if 70% of the banks are disconnected, they'll just route all the payments through the 30% of the banks that aren't disconnected. That's just what anyone would do. And certainly the Russians will do that. And so we need to sanction the other 30% of the banks and a lot of people ask me why why are those banks protected. And I can imagine that there was some, you know, ugly backroom deal with, you know, in a smoky room where somebody said we have an interest there, don't do that. But so those other 30% of the banks need to be sanctioned disconnected from swift. And then the most important part of the whole exercise is that Vladimir Putin's own money needs to be hit. And his own money is held not by himself, but by oligarchs who look after it. And so we need to freeze the assets of the oligarchs in the West. And a lot of announcements have been made that that's that's the intention. A few oligarchs have been added to the various EU, US, UK sanctions lists. But that needs to be done in a much more coordinated manner. Because there's different oligarchs in the US that have been sanctioned in the EU and different ones in the EU than UK. And then a list needs to be expanded dramatically. So there's 50 or 60 or 100 of the most wealthy oligarchs in Russia sanctioned. And we get. God, let me interrupt. I'm sorry, Bill, but practically speaking, how would that be accomplished? Isn't that extremely difficult? You've got camons and, you know, countries like that. And I mean, the Spheres and them specifically, there are all sorts of money havens around the world. Nevermind, Switzerland, which is said that actually there, there are up against Russia at this point. But how would that be done practically. And it's actually not as complicated as you think. So the so it's not the government's job to necessarily track down the assets. So what happened the way it works in practical terms. As a person gets added to the sanctions list. Once they're on the sanctions list, then it's the job or the responsibility on the job, but the legal responsibility of a bank that holds their money to no no longer transact with that person. So that money gets frozen. Or a real estate agent not to not to sell their property or a broker not to sell their shares. And at that point, everything gets frozen. And so it actually gets crowdsourced. Now you made a good point, which is, you know, let's say their stuff is not in the United States or in the UK, but in the Cayman Islands. Well, guess what? The Cayman Islands is is a crown dependency. And as a result, every one of these, um, Gernsey, Jersey, the Isle of Man, Cayman Islands, British Virgin Islands, they copy the British sanctions list. And so you end up in a situation where, where whatever Britain does, all these offshore jurisdictions do. And so Britain is really punching way above its weight in terms of its importance in this, in this whole scheme. And so just coming back to the original thought you put a person on the sanctions list, they get sanctioned everywhere. And so, you know, the Cayman Islands, BBI UK, and if all the countries coordinate, then there's really no civilized place they can hide. Now, we're seeing oligarchs scrambling right now moving yachts. I read a story about one oligarch, whose park is yacht in Saudi Arabia. Okay, as he doesn't think that the Saudi Arabians will freeze his yacht. And, and their stories about mad scrambles of oligarchs trying to sell properties, give them away to family members and getting divorced from their wives. And they're giving them property, all sorts of interesting stuff. And that will happen and, and they will probably succeed in protecting some of their assets. But even if you don't get all their assets, just having a person on the sanctions list means that they're no longer that they're pretty much out of the game. They're benched in the world in the international financial world. Another remarkable development, or correct me if you think I'm wrong, Bill, is the, is the response by the private sector, both in Europe and in the United States. I mean, everything from Disney to Shell to the banks, curtailing or ending their financial relationships with Russia. What do you think about that? And is this effective? Well, in a certain way, I would almost argue it's more effective because, okay, so the, you know, the sanctions lists are important government activity is important. But if every Western company stops doing business with the Russians, it's, it's, it's some, it's really dramatic. I remember when I started my whole campaign for justice for sort of game, Magnitsky, my murdered lawyer, one of the first people people I met with, I was, I was in South Africa.",https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LuX9IXzHLV4,47,2022-10-25 17:19:23
4067," And remember when I started my whole campaign for justice for Surgay Magnitsky, my murdered lawyer, one of the first people I met with, I was in South Africa, and I met with a woman named Helen Zilli, who was one of the people involved in the, one of the main people involved in the anti-partied movement. I watched a movie called Cry Freedom, and she was one of the characters in the movie. And I met with her shortly after Surgay Magnitsky was murdered, and we talked, and we talked about how they ended the partied, and she said it was all about disinvestment. It was all about the US and Western Europe disinvesting from South Africa, that when they became financially isolated, that's when it became too much. And so I think this is really, really important. And I think this is probably, as I look at the next steps, what can we do next when we watch these atrocities unfold in Ukraine? I think it's just to pressure every single Western business to divest, to stop doing business, to stop supplying goods, to stop supplying services to Russia. Right. Are the sanctions enough to send the Russian economy into a recession? And is this an objective that we should try to achieve, even? Well, if you had asked me two months before this whole thing had started, I would have said, let's just go after the oligarchs and leave the Russian people alone. We have got no beef with the Russian people. They didn't do anything. They don't, the most Russian people don't want this. I would say, I would say the vast majority don't want this. They don't want to send soldiers into harm's way to be killed and mangled. They don't want to have to pay 100% more for food and imports, which they're not even going to get anymore, no more imports. I think the average Russian person doesn't want this. And so I wish that we had done this before, which, and possibly, you know, sent Putin a message, how costly this would be in a real way that he went to understand it. So he wouldn't have invaded. But we, he has invaded. And so now we have to say, okay, what's the strategy going forward? And the strategy has to be to raise the price as high as possible. And most importantly, to just deplete Vladimir Putin of resources so that this war becomes so expensive and he just doesn't have the money because the central bank reserves are frozen, the exports are not generating any income, no more foreign direct investment at all. And so we're in a situation where he just can't afford it anymore.",https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LuX9IXzHLV4,48,2022-10-25 17:24:15
4068, you you you you you I want to get to your personal background a little bit bill to have a fascinating story we talked about a little bit with your firm and and all of your trials and tribulations in in Russian investing there after you're ordeal battling the government in Russia you became a global champion of the Magnitsky Act which allows the U.S. and other countries to sanction foreign officials involved in human rights abuses validating or infuriating to see the need for such laws at a time like this both but but but but but most interestingly so we we pass the Magnitsky Act works for human rights abusers and corrupt officials it was passed in 2012 and and it completely blue Putin blue his top when he when he saw this happened and I mean really just like I mean and and and and the most emotional way he banned the adoption of Russian orphans by American families and retaliation in the the orphans that were being adopted were the the ones who were not well and Americans was still take these children back to America and nursing to health and they attended a die in the orphanage so he is effectively sent in orphans to death in his own country as a retaliation against the Magnitsky Act and everybody was crashing their heads and saying why is this guy reacting so harshly and the reason is we can see it today literally today which is that this was the basis for which all of future sanctions were controlled on asset freezes and travel bands and every say every person that's now going to be sanctioned will basically be sanctioned on the basis of the Magnitsky Act and the reason he was so upset was because he knew he's not stupid he knew that eventually the Magnitsky Act would come for his money and so there's a direct line between the murder of surge Magnitsky my campaign for the Magnitsky Act the sanctions that were put in place and the sanctions that are now going to go after Putin's money in 2018 Putin mentioned you by name during a press conference with then President Trump offering to allow us investigators to interview 12 Russian intelligence agents identified by Robert Mueller's probe in exchange for allowing Russian intelligence to question you and others close to you Trump and what are you called it an incredible offer what is your view of the way Trump reset US relations with Russia and do you think it affects the way the world approaches Russia today well thankfully I think that the Trump situation was an aberration not I don't think it was like a permanent damage to the relations between the United States and the rest of the world and I don't think it it certainly hurt the US credibility for a short period of time but we can see right now in the multilateral approach towards sanctioning Russia that,https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LuX9IXzHLV4,49,2022-10-25 17:27:58
4069," And I don't think it certainly hurt the US credibility for a short period of time. But we can see right now in the multilateral approach towards sanctioning Russia that things continue to work as they should. I mean, it's pretty horrifying the idea that an American president would hand over me and a bunch of US government officials to Putin because Putin asked for that. I mean, it's just unbelievable, really. And it also seems pretty unbelievable. It took him four days to walk it back. And it was only after the Senate planned had a vote, whether or not to hand us over. And they voted 90h0 about 20 minutes before the vote, Trump through his press secretary declined Putin's offer. But if Trump had been reelected, so that was during the Mueller probe. So if, yeah. And so he was sort of under the spotlight as far as Russia goes. If he was reelected, I wouldn't have been able to travel back to the United States because surely he would have handed me over to Putin. And so I, from a personal safety standpoint, I breathed an enormous sigh of relief when he was defeated. And final question, going forward, what sort of work do you see yourself doing? And what sort of legacy do you see yourself leaving? Well, the legacy that I'm in the process of leaving is a legacy where Sergei Magnitsky's name is on legislation, not just in the United States, but now in 34 countries sanctioning human rights abusers, not just in Russia, but all over the world. And so the Magnitsky Act now applies to Chinese officials involved in the genocide in Jingjiang is involved in sanctions, Iranians, Myanmar officials, all sorts of bad actors all over the world. And it creates a big disincentive to human rights abusers and to kleptocrats. And it also creates some redress for victims. And for me, the Sergei Magnitsky's murder is a burden of guilt that I carry with me everywhere because he was my responsibility and he was killed in my service. And so every day that I do something to enhance his legacy and to do that in a way that potentially will offer other victims' redress and save lives is sort of my project. And as more and more countries do this, then the next step is to have more and more countries use the Magnitsky Act against bad actors. And so Sergei Magnitsky will from the grave and from heaven be helping everybody else out in their terrible moments of distress.

We'll see you next time. Welcome back to Yow Finance. I'm Brian Saaz, alongside Brad Smith, Julie Heiming. Has the day off. It has been an earnings heavy morning. But let's lock in on some breaking news crossing the wires just about right now. As you see, all three markets up higher on this. That is consumer confidence, Brad, coming in from the conference board. Yeah, that's right. 102.5 is the reading that we just had come in from the conference board here. And as we're continuing to look through some of the data and get it all refreshed on our side, this is particularly interesting to see how the markets will react to this as we move on throughout the rest of the day right now. The Dow Jones industrial average is still seeing that hold on to gains, still net positive, by about half a percent, a little bit more than that. The S&P 500 still holding on to gains. That's up by about nine tens of a percent. And then that's that composite. That's been the leader largely throughout the day here. And that's up by about one and a half percent at this point in time. But again, consumer confidence coming in at a reading of 102.5 here this morning. We're going to continue to see if we get even more of the data that rolls in from this report. And we can add a little bit more context to this as well. Yeah, consumer confidence. Interesting, Brad, you look at these quarters from Coca-Cola, a Sherwin Williams, these companies are out there raising prices. And the consumers by and large, they've been able to withstand these prices. Yeah, but this is still a miss on what was actually estimated here. We were looking for 105.9. So coming in at 102.5, the markets right now still holding on to some of the move higher than",https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LuX9IXzHLV4,50,2022-10-25 17:32:26
4070," Missome, what was actually estimated here, we were looking for 105.9. So coming in out, 102.5 of the markets right now still holding onto some of the move higher and of course this is kind of permeated from yesterday's trading activity. And even last week with this little Bipity Bop bounce, if you want to call it that, where we have seen, of course, in this larger bear market, at least these bounces in the near term, and a larger question of where consumers sit within that and where the strength of the consumer is, where demand is actually coming in from. And I think that's a lot of really what's spelling out how competent the consumer really is at this point in time. You see demand is far different regardless of with the industries that we're looking at. Demand for travel, far different than demand for even Coca-Cola as we're talking about. Even though you may see it actually show up in the results and outpace some of the expectations, the expectations for the companies on the equity front have actually been lowered. So it's a question of where will the consumer continue to see some of that strength even as we're continuing to discuss the risk of recession too? All right, let's stay on all things economy and the consumer. Strikingly, different tone from shipping giant UPS this morning on its earnings report, compared to longtime rival FedEx. UPS showing good growth in the US and reaffirming its full year guidance ranges. This comes on the heels of FedEx badly whipping on earnings and on corking a fresh restructuring plan just a few weeks ago, UPS CFO Brian Newman just got off his earnings call and joins us now. Good to see you here, Brian, as always, just for the lay investor out there. These stories between a UPS and a FedEx are now strikingly different, like I just mentioned. Why do you think you and your team are out executing a FedEx? Hey, Brian, good morning. It's great to see you. Listen, we have a mantra around here, which is control, which you can control. And we've been really focused on doing that over the last couple of quarters. The macros have been challenging domestically and particularly internationally. But we've been focused on with softer volumes across the world, really. How do we ensure we drive the right pricing mix and dynamics and also control the cost by doing that? You protect your margins and deliver to the shareholders. And Brian, I just want to stand that before we jump onto the broader quarter. So you're not out there closing sorting facilities, laying people off. I just want to make sure I have it right. So we are tightening the belt. Certainly at the corporate, we spend a lot of money in GNA. We've been tightening the belt there, but we've been doing that for a couple of years, trying to right size the business. Carol introduced a better, not bigger strategy to the company and what that really is, optimize the volume that comes into the system. So it's more profitable and then take the cost down. So we have been certainly right sizing the business over the last couple of years. But no, we're not closing sorting facilities right now. We have the ability to take our variable and set every variable cost down should the case arise. And so where are you seeing continued strength within the business and the customers that you're servicing right now? That's a great question, Brad. The healthcare segment is a particularly strong one. We're doing very, very well there. The, as you think about the small and medium business, that's been a core focus over the last couple of years. We've been addressing the capabilities that those customers want. And by doing that, you create a wonderful environment for a very profitable customer. So we've been focused on the SMB, small and medium business, the healthcare segment. And then overall, trying to look at that international business because there's lots of growth opportunity there for us. We've been talking a lot about FX headwinds that companies are seeing right now. And when you think about that international business, of course, UPS is going to be rolling out some pricing increases. This also impacts the international segment in December, I believe, and that really going to be reflected as you finally get into 2023 as well. What is your anticipation around where the consumers and the strength that you were just laying out where they'll continue to take that price increase? So we announced a price increase for next year at 6.9%. That's supposed to be representative of a combination of inflation as well as the service we provide. So that will help drive the base rate in terms of the pricing equation. As we think about the currency impact that you mentioned, Brad, the currency impact in the quarter was about $82 million. So it is a meaningful headwind on our international business. But we're effectively offsetting that as we manage the portfolio across the domestic business and then across some of the other segments. Brian, I recently spoke to another Brian Cornell over a target for our all-market summit conference last week. He said the holiday season is, is season expecting to be pretty good. What's your read on things? So Brian and I used to work together at PepsiCoast. So I know him and target is a very important customer for UPS. I actually think it's going to be a...",https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LuX9IXzHLV4,51,2022-10-25 17:36:47
4071," Pretty good. What's your read on things? So Brian and I used to work together at PepsiCo. So I know him and Target is a very important customer for UPS. I actually think it's gonna be a decent peak season. We're ramping up right now. We're hiring. We hire over 100,000 people for the peak season to get ready. And with customers like Target, we're out there committing to them that we're gonna be there with the excellent service that UPS provides. So I think that Brian, the peak season, our peak season volume goes up 50, 60% from a normal run rate. So it is a meaningful increase. But as we think about peak this year, you don't have the low inventory levels that we saw last year, which drove an earlier peak. People were rushing out to buy because they were afraid the inventory wouldn't be there for the holiday season. This year, inventories are much higher at the retail stores. So I think it'll be a bit of a later peak, Brian. All right, competing against Santa Claus like efficiency there in the logistics business. When you think about some of the future investments as well, they're Brian and going out into next year and even beyond, what are the investments that you would like to see the company get right the first time in order to build a logistical network and a system that can really see its margins excel over the future. So it's a great question, Brad. The digital investments we're making, it's really shifting dynamic of UPS, old school package delivery. To now, it's more of an orchestrator of volume from end to end. We're putting investments into things like RFID technology so that every package in our system will have a code on it that we know where it is. And if there's nothing more frustrating for consumers or customers when they lose a package or they have an issue, they want to know where that package is by deploying this kind of technology, we're going to be able to tell people where are your packages and how can we recover and make sure we get them there on time for when the customers want them. And we do that at an incredible mid 90s percent in terms of on time delivery. Brian, I made this comment earlier in the show before you came on in. And I said, UPS is benefiting from, of course, having you as CFO, but also Carol too. Long time CFO, a home depot before she came to you. Am I off base there? Are you guys just looking at the quarter or your business differently than other big public companies? Brian, it's wonderful to have a boss who used to be a CFO because we have great conversations, but Carol's done an amazing job shifting the culture. So as we think about the future of UPS, yesterday's UPS is not going to get us tomorrow to where we want to be. We're 115 year old company, very proud of our past, but Carol is shifting the company to a place called Better and Boulder. The Boulder is growth and margin improvement. And so where is that going to come from? Areas of basically leaning into the most attractive parts of the market. I mentioned SMB. Margians are great. It's a very attractive area. Healthcare. That's a high growth, high margin area. International. We're actually number two and three and a number of markets overseas. So we're focused on stealing revenue share, value share as we call it, and going out there. So we're putting our investments in those areas that will be accreted from an investment perspective. UPS, CFO, Brian Newman. Thanks so much for joining us here this morning and breaking down the most recent quarter. Appreciate it. Thanks, Brian. Brian Brad, thank you. You got it. And everyone switching gears here, let's take a look at some of the market activity that we've been tracking here. Out of the gate this morning, the Dow Jones industrial average, at least about 38 minutes into trading, holding on to gains. And this after what was weaker than expected, consumer confidence reading from the conference board here this morning. But as of right now, the Dow Jones industrial average still up by about 110 points. Also, you've got the NASDAQ composite. That's higher by about 1.4%. And the S&P 500, you're seeing that hold on to gains to tune about 8% to 10% here. Also checking in on some of the other activity that we're seeing here on the day. We saw some electric vehicle, well, categories as electric vehicle earnings that have come out. But GM, really talking about their market share within this most recent quarter, shares are holding on to gains of about 2.4% that electric vehicle market share, reaching about 8%. They said in this most recent report, we're also going to get results out from Ford. And that's going to be coming later on this week as well. And so as of right now, holding on to gains of about 1.4% there for Ford 2. All right, thanks, Brad. Before we head to break, let's flag some cautious comments on Meta into its earnings report on Wednesday. From Jeffery's analyst, Brent Phil says, they'll, while Meta's stock appears sheet, we believe investors need four key levers to drive the stock higher. One, revenue growth above 2% and guidance of a possible acceleration in the fourth quarter. Two, flat or even declining year-over-year expense growth, three, increased focus on the core business away from the Metaverse and...",https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LuX9IXzHLV4,52,2022-10-25 17:41:13
4072," It's a possible acceleration in the fourth quarter, two, flat or even declining year-of-year expense growth, three, increased focus on the core business away from the metaverse, and four, the re-acceleration of share it repurchases, indeed, a tall order for meta on its earnings reports. Check the label on that dry shampoo before you use it. This morning Brad is back with today's top headlines next. The What's the most important! This is the first time I have done this. I think I am a little bit more excited. I am going to do my best. I am going to do my best. I am going to do my best. I am going to do my best. I am going to do my best. I am going to do my best. I am going to do my best. I am going to do my best. I am going to do my best. I am going to do my best. Russia's Courts denied American basketball star Brittany Reiner's appeal today, upholding her nine-year prison sentence and drug charges for carrying two cannabis vape cartridges and her luggage Reiner is now expected to be moved to a penal colony, the denial of her appeal. I likely see hope for a release shift to the potential of a high profile prisoner swap. President Biden previously told CNN that he will only speak to Russia's Vladimir Putin at next month, G20 meeting, if it's to discuss Reiner's situation. Unilever is recalling popular brands of Airseller Dry shampoo, including Dove after discovering contamination with the cancer-causing chemical benzene. The recall also covers brands such as Nexus, Swab, Tresame and Tiki, which makes rock, a holic, and bed-head dry shampoo according to a notice posted on the Food and Drug Administration's website. The recall is the latest of half a dozen so far this year with the cancer-causing chemical showing up in products including deodorant, sanitizer, and sunscreen. And ultra is jewel labs as in talks with two of its biggest investors, director Nick Pritzker and Riasvilani, regarding a bailout deal to keep tobacco and that giant out of vacuropsy. That's according to reports from the journal The Hyatt Hotel Air and California Investor are considering putting up funds to cover jewel labs.",https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LuX9IXzHLV4,53,2022-10-25 17:46:03
4073," And that giant out of bankruptcy. That's according to reports from the journal, the Hyatt Hotel Air and California Investor are considering putting up funds to cover jewels operations and near-term legal liabilities. The goal of a bailout would be to have jewel on stronger footing so it can pursue a dispute with federal regulators to keep its products in the US market. Though jewel has not finalized the deal and could decide not to pursue it at the end of the day. That's how it's done. SAP 500 NASDAQ are still in bear market territory. Meanwhile, several economic indicators, such as consumer sentiment manufacturing, continue to paint a gloomy picture for the US's economic outlook. But while Hawkeye Fed pulled the US into recession, and how is the business cycle playing out compared to previous recessions? SAP Global Rating's Chief Economist, Beth Ann, Bavino joins us now. Beth Ann always nice to get some time with you. This morning, we are waiting for a lot of earnings. You have Coca-Cola out here raising prices by 12%. We just talked to UPS and CFO saying, they don't really see any signs of per se a recession in their business looking for a good holiday season. Do you think we just avoid our recession? We have a baseline in our forecast for a recession. We think it's going to be a very shallow one. But a recession nonetheless is largely because of affordability issues, both because of still incredibly high prices, as you just noted, by the increase in final prices for US households, as well as affordability tied to interest rate hikes. So in both cases, we think the consumers will slow down dramatically, leading into a very shallow recession for early next year. Interesting. So with that in mind, where do you believe the mindset of the consumer would be by that point? Well, we're looking at the numbers from a consumer confidence a bit weaker than what we in market had expected. The idea is there that even that we expected a little bit not as extreme largely because we saw a bit of a pickup in the stock market, as well as pooling of gasoline prices. Well, that's not enough for consumers. They're still disappointed. And because it's not just about gasoline, it's about affordability and pretty much all aspects of society, particularly for shelter, not just who are purchasing a home, but also renting a home. And that means less money to spend elsewhere. People are squeezed and we do think they'll be fine with buckle. Bethan, I've really been surprised by how many, or how much price increases. A lot of these big companies have been reporting in recent weeks as they've come out with earnings. They continue to double-gint increases for products and services, really, for the second quarter in a row. When does it stop? When are we beyond these double-gint increases? Well, we're expecting to see eventually one of the reasons the good news about a recession, it also burns lower prices. And the big question of is, if consumers do slow down as we expect, that means there's going to be more inventory on businesses' books. So if we do it, do see a sleep, sleep, sleep, slow down for consumers, then we end up seeing as a lot of inventory used to be unloaded. And unfortunately, that inventory is unloaded at lower prices. So indeed, indeed, the fact gets us wish in the end. But of course, there's a cost to both businesses' consumers as well. We've got a lot of companies that have started reporting earnings fast and furious in this most recent quarter, but the forward guidance here is going to be the big question. What are your expectations for where companies will continue to either reiterate their guidance or, for some of them, we've already seen at least in the case of SNAP. No, a specific name, but where they might start to say, what we have to either pull back our guidance or just pull it in entirety. And what net impact would that have? Well, speaking from an economic position, again, I don't cover particular industries or companies. But I can say that given this environment, this is a classic over-heating situation for the United States, where the Fed has to come in and be incredibly aggressive. Understandably, we have core inflation still at a 40-year high on a year-over-year basis. So they have to move. And with that said, what I suspect we could see for those businesses that switched from just in time in inventory accumulation to just in case inventory of accumulation, that means that they're going to be squeezed. And so I suspect the forward guidance would be basically, what happens to profits when we have to unload all those inventories, that's where I suspect we could see some activity. Particularly for retail, the retail sector, who have been holding on to things, but I suppose other areas will be squeezed as well. Within your outlook, go.",https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LuX9IXzHLV4,54,2022-10-25 17:49:50
4074," inventory is that's where I suspect we can see some activity. Particularly for retail, the retail sector who have been holding on to things, but I suppose other areas will be squeezed as well. Within your outlook, Beth Ann, for a mild recession, is the economy shedding jobs? Are we talking about non-farm payroll reports where maybe there's 50,000 jobs should? In our business cycle barometer, the one indicator that is still showing positive, everything else is neutral or negative and extremely negative. But the one area that we're seeing still positive territories in that jobs market that you pointed to, we're looking at job openings coming down, slowing down, but still rather high. So the question is, are businesses canceling that job opening and still want to hold on to those workers? I suspect in certain areas that we're going to see the crunch. Retail, I mentioned housing. Also, I suspect we're going to see some kind of a cutting of jobs. But overall, we suspect a mild impact on jobs. And we do expect to see the unemployment rate rise, but we're looking at something that's going to be by 2024, about 5.5%. In normal times, that's what we used to get to. So indeed, we'll see a pickup, but nothing dramatically. Dramaticly so. Beth Ann, Bovino, S&P Global Ratings, US Chief of Commerce. Always good to see you. We'll talk to you soon. Big Arnie's reports from Microsoft in Google, Lark, our tech editor, Dan Halley is back with some analysis next. Early season rolls off at reports from Big Tech Giants, Microsoft and Alphabet, expected after the closing bell today. Y'all find it's tech editor Dan Halley, John, just now to preview what to expect. And Dan, it could be another interesting quarter for both of these companies. You have that strong dollar. You have growth slowing down. How do you see things? Dan Halley, we also have, you know, starting with Microsoft, obviously, their cloud business doing well. But then there's the drop in consumer spending on the.",https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LuX9IXzHLV4,55,2022-10-25 17:54:25
4075," Yeah, we also have, you know, starting with Microsoft, obviously their cloud business doing well, but then there's the drop in consumer spending on the personal computer front. So that could really sting Microsoft. Let's take a look at the numbers here. We have revenue estimates coming at 49.6 billion dollars. That's according to the streets consensus estimate and then EPS adjusted EPS we have that coming in at 229. We have the productivity and business processes revenue. That's 16.12 billion and then we have the intelligent cloud that's going to be at 20.31 billion. These are again all those estimates. And then the more personal computing at 13.09 billion that's a slight slight increase. So, you know, we're starting to see the effects on Microsoft's bottom line of this kind of pullback in consumer spending on those types of devices, not just because, you know, there's not enough on the market as there may have been during pandemic, but because so many people purchased during the pandemic, but there's no reason for them to go back out and buy computers again those usually last anywhere from three to five to seven years for some consumers. So there's really no reason for them to jump back out into the market and then you know on the Google front, we're looking at revenue X tack, which is traffic acquisition costs. That's at 58.18 billion or 58.2 billion and then we have EPS adjusted EPS estimated at $1.36. An advertising revenue is going to be the big issue here, whether or not they're stung similar to how we saw snap stung when it reported last week taking that huge one in their stock price after reporting those disappointing earnings. We're looking at potential revenue of 57 billion from advertising and then cloud services at 6.61 billion there still being kind of work through to try and improve those make it one of the larger offerings on the market still well behind Amazon and Microsoft, which are number one and number two. And then we also have the other bets at 204 million. We also had reports that Google was cutting back on some of its projects that may be visible in some of the earnings we'll have to see there. What be capex looks like so, obviously two important reports from two important companies, especially when it comes to both the cloud and the digital advertising markets. We also got meta up there on the screen too. They're expected to report you mentioned that you're going to be tracking across all of these companies where it does apply effects, cloud and ads. But what about the metaverse and the spending perhaps if I was to sum it up to that for all of these tech companies and how that should be in focus too. Yeah, I think for meta obviously the question is how much did it earn as far as ad revenue, how much has it been hurt as far as ad revenue and then how much is it continuing to spend on the metaverse project. We had Mark Zuckerberg talking it meta connect basically laying out what he sees as the future of the metaverse, how the company is going to kind of build that out and the different opportunities they're available focusing heavily on work environment, obviously Microsoft CEO, and the Dell had made an appearance for that and then on the gaming environment, but there has been calls obviously for there to be a reduction in spending on the metaverse. And there's been reports where the world that they're building just aren't exciting for customers and that the headsets they offer aren't something that people usually use as months after they purchased the one like gaming console or PC. So it'll be interesting to see what kind of the situation is like on meta as far as what the ad revenue is and then what that means as far as the metaverse goes and the spending there because they have been just plowing money into it and they're putting this as a long term goal, but for now it doesn't look like anybody's very much interested in it outside of a few use cases that may benefit the work environment, but for the average consumer, I don't think it's something that's really getting them going. Yeah, our finances Dan Howley, the tech DH, if you will here, Dan appreciate the time breaking down and teeing up some of these earnings reports set to come out, appreciate it. And switching gears here, everyone, cutting ties, Adidas has become the latest company to end its partnership with Ye formerly known as Kanye West following his anti-semitic remarks, the athletic brand says it will stop production of easy branded products immediately along with all payments to Ye and his companies. Bernstein, senior and",https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LuX9IXzHLV4,56,2022-10-25 17:58:20
4076," Intimedic remarks, the athletic brand says it will stop production of easy branded products immediately along with all payments to Yeh and his companies. Bernstein, senior analyst, Anisha Sherman joins us now to discuss alongside Yahoo finances, Alexandra Canal. Anisha, great to have you here with us today. Help us really put this kind of into perspective on the business front, $250 million net income, short term negative impact, Adidas is saying that this is going to mean. What a time when the brand was already seeing some of that waning popularity within their core consumer groups. Yes, this is coming at a tough time for the company. They just have their second of two early earnings releases and guide downs for the year. They're now expecting Q4 to come in negative profitability anyway, you know, ex this easy impact and will this $250 million will further reduce the bottom line for Q4. The Q3 results have already been pre-released. The easy day, which was in August, counted towards Q3 performance and was quite successful. However, the launches that were slated for Q4, which were meant to come out in the kind of October and November timeframe have now been completely pulled and thus the impacts of the sales and the bottom line. And what's more important is Adidas is going to stop using the easy label altogether. Although the company does own the rights to the product, they're going to rebrand it as a latest product and stop using the easy brand label completely, which should take a haircut off the 2023 and beyond sales as well. Because that was quite a successful brand franchise for the company. And in Asia, there's no denying how successful the easy brand has been for Adidas, largely because it catered to Gen Z. It had that social currency with Yeh who at the time of the partnership in 2013, he was at the top of his game. So what other types of partnerships or alternative revenue streams should Adidas consider exploring in order to cater to that Gen Z consumer base? Yeah, that's a good question. So EZ has been one of their more successful franchises. But in recent years, they have tried to diversify that by adding a few additional franchises. We've seen them come out this year with launches with Gucci and with Prada. The Gucci collection in particular was very successful and they view it as a multi-year partnership. They're continuing their partnership with Stella McCartney, which is also a multi-year long-term partnership. It's also premium product, higher margin product, and they're continuing their work with Beyonce with the Adidas Part Collection, which also released a new line this year and will continue to be a multi-year partnership. So they do have several other partnerships. This isn't their only one, but that being said, Yeh Z has been, as you said, one of the more successful ones. So it will require a haircut to sales estimates as well as margins for the coming year or so. And, Michel, why do you think it took so long for Adidas to make this decision? Because I do think it says a lot about the corporate governance of a company like that. Yeah, I mean, this debate has been going on since August. So it started when actually Kanye West came out against Adidas alleging that they had stolen his intellectual property. Adidas insisted that they own all the IP of the Yeezy franchise that's been released today, that's for kind of normal terms of when, you know, these kinds of partnerships. But this debate has continued for the last two months. They were trying to make amends and trying to make things work. They had a few years left on the contract, but it's been under review for the last couple of weeks. They probably could have come to an agreement sooner. I don't know the details behind their legal disagreements, but essentially, I mean, it's a big part of their revenue and profit print. This franchise is one of them more successful. So I think they were trying to figure out a way to break things off, whether they would continue using the Yeezy name, whether they had the right to continue, how that would impact both this years and ongoing sales and how they would kind of position the brand going forward, which is why it took a few days longer. And there's been increasing pressure on the company to drop him, as we've seen other companies drop, um, drop him over the last couple of weeks, thanks to his all of his statements in the past few weeks. Relative to what's going on with Adidas at the moment and has Brad was saying, there's a lot of other issues at this company besides just yay. How do you view the competitive landscape? Yeah, it's, um, you know, it's a tough year for sportswear in general because China has continued to be a very slow market, both partly due to macro concerns as people have been held back by COVID restrictions.",https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LuX9IXzHLV4,57,2022-10-25 18:02:48
4077," It's a tough year for sports we're in general because China has continued to be a very slow market, both partly due to macro concerns as people have been held back by COVID restrictions, but also due to a continued prominence of local brands, of Chinese-owned brands, that have taken share from the big Western brands. So that's been a market that's continued to be tough, particularly for Adidas as they've kind of under invested in the region in the past and are now trying to make up for lost ground. At the same time, North America, as I'm sure you know, is going into a pretty heavy inventory quarter as your guest speaker was talking about a few minutes ago, and that's going to impact them as well. So we have the bearish China outlook, the kind of short-term bearish North American outlook, and then Amia. Amia is also under pressure. The consumer continues to pull back on discretionary spend. So it's been a tough year overall for the competitive landscape in general. It's been a tougher year for Adidas because they've had specific challenges in China to get their brand back on track. And so even preceding this easy announcement, they were expecting net income to drop below 500 million for the year, and that number is now even lower. Do you believe that there's a trickle through here to the resale market as well, considering what led to the termination of this deal? Do people now go on a stadium goods who's owned by Farfetch, a publicly traded company, and say, I don't want to buy easy shoes? Do they go on a stock ex and say, you know, I'm not any longer interested in buying this product? Yeah, I think that's a good question. I think if the product were continuing to be sold by Adidas, I would expect a general boycott of it. Now that the product is not going to be sold by Adidas, I think there might be a reversal of effect where this becomes, the easy product becomes somewhat of a collector's item, maybe not right now or nobody wants to touch it, but in over the next couple of years, it becomes a limited edition collector's item that's sold in resale. But I think the decision to stop branding the easy brand was a good decision for Adidas because at the moment that brand is associated very strongly with the creator, with the artist, and they want to cut the disassociate themselves completely. So I think what happens in the resale market is because of which restricted supply, it could continue to trade, but in the primary market, that was probably the right decision for that to do. And you show that the easy line has been popular almost since it hit the market. And because of that popularity, I think an argument could be made, it has taken market share from a company like Nike. But now if that brand is no longer going to be, Adidas is a Nike winner here. Yeah, I think they lose that portion of the market share, which was the, you know, the easy premium product. They are going to relaunch, they're going to continue to launch the designs. I mean, it's unclear where they're going to launch it as a sub brand or as just a kind of under the Adidas umbrella overall. They obviously aren't going to use the easy name anymore, but, you know, the sneaker heads and the loyal customers will know it's the same product as just being launched under the Adidas and brand umbrella. So I think they will retain some of those sales. They're not going to lose that entire kind of, you know, 1.5 to 2 billion worth of sales, but it will take a haircut because it's not, it's not being branded under that easy brand anymore. It will probably seed some share to some of the other sneaker head brands, including Nike. The real sneaker heads will always know Anisha Sherman. Thanks so much for joining us here on the morning Bernstein senior analyst, Anisha Sherman and Yahoo Finance's own Alli-Can-Now. Appreciate it. You guys coming up, turbulence guys. And expensive times for JetBlue shares of the company moving lower by about 6.5 percent after the company posted the profit and they were just pulled up. CEO, the CEO, excuse me, warning that every penny matter that's cost the sports fuel continues rise. We've got the full breakdown from the other side.",https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LuX9IXzHLV4,58,2022-10-25 18:07:09
4078," будете Remove locksERE Ensure zas Use a residual tool and use it every 5 cocoff Welcome back everyone. Let's turn now to some market movers this morning. Let's start with JetBlue earnings, ticker symbol JBLU. Shares moving lower by a little more than 6%. This is after the airline company reported earnings for the third quarter, missing estimates on the bottom line while beating out revenue expectations here. A few things to really consider here, the fact that many of the airline operators are still getting back to full capacity compared to 2019. For JetBlue you've also got this near term deal and the finalization of that deal that is still very much just hanging in the balance waiting to be fully done and investors have had time to realize what that might mean to the balance sheets of JetBlue once that finally goes through. JetBlue in the near term though they are still being one of the beneficiaries of this northeastern alliance along with American Airlines too which really helped them during the summer travel season. But in the near term I believe that those fuel prices still being up, I think it was up 87% comparable to last year that's something that American Airlines had also cited in their most recent earnings. And just like we were talking about, excuse me earlier Brad, between the now emerging different investing stories between a UPS and FedEx, I would argue I put forth that same thesis on JetBlue. You talked to Delta CEO Ed Bastion, very good quarter American Airlines, very good quarter. What was United reported to? Already? Strong demand. Strong demand, very good quarter. A little bit of different tone from JetBlue and it makes you wonder are they going to get distracted or have they been distracted by trying to first solidify the spirit deal. And now, oh yeah, they're going to have to integrate it at some point if it gets approval. Yeah and that integration when you're thinking about updating an entire airline, everything from painting planes to try and get rid of that ugly yellow color all the way to making sure that you've just got a different aircraft that maybe doesn't feel like a canister in the sky. All of those things get taken into consideration. So updates of the fleets, also the integration of the teams and the operations. And it's also going to be a consideration around which actual flight gates that you're positioned at so that you can kind of condense what that operational space looks like at the hubs that you're working in and out of as well. They're all in on the anti yellow. They're in all yellow. 100%. You're in. All right. Chairs of Tesla, they're up after surprisingly bearers take from Morgan Stanley, the bank cutting, it's price target to $3 and $3 down from $350, sending a highly volatile economic environment and anticipating unexpected headwinds. And of course, this call comes from our front of the show. Welcome back. No way.",https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LuX9IXzHLV4,59,2022-10-25 18:12:00
4079," It's price target to $3.3 down from $350, sending a highly volatile economic environment and anticipating unexpected headwinds. And of course, this call comes from our friend of the show Adam Jonas over at Morgan Stanley. He's a market mover on Tesla. He's still staying bullish, of course, on Tesla. He's been a longtime bull in this company. But really noting for what he, making, he's saying, quote, making room for unexpected, unexpected headwinds in the current economic environment or argue, Brad, some of those unexpected headwinds are coming out of China. When we talked about China was yesterday, Tesla cunning prices in that China market, that is a complete new term from what Tesla had been experiencing last year and even the first part of this year. Right. And for Tesla, they have to acknowledge what's happening in the region too. It sounded like when they were on the call that they didn't want to really discuss what is really taking place within that region in China. And you have so much competition that is being brought online that much quicker, that is improving their capacity for production, improving their relations with customers in the region too, who have the propensity to buy some of the electric vehicles, either on the mass market side or on the more expensive side. And the propensity right now is leaning towards some of the homegrown brands in the region too. Tesla doesn't want to acknowledge that, of course, they want to continue to focus on their products. But I think it still is a realization that has to be factored in to what their forecasts are actually looking like in the region too. Right. And on this too, yesterday I mentioned that X-Pung is really going toe to toe with Tesla and China. And I got raked over the calls on Twitter for it. I do think folks, even the Tesla bulls, pull up some of the specs on these X-Pung vehicles. They are very impressive. That technology package in that car is very, very impressive indeed. So, let's say on all things in dust show, UPS had a good quarter as CFO Brian Newman explained to us just moments ago that is just not to buy over at rival FedEx. We'll talk to it one-hours downgraded FedEx recently. That's next.",https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LuX9IXzHLV4,60,2022-10-25 18:16:08
4080," We're looking for, I would say, success at the execution initiatives, whether it's right-sizing the aircraft network, bringing down facilities, essentially just relining the network, not only for the current environment, but obviously the potential pitch term. Well, as far as security is analysts, Allison, Polina, I appreciate it. Thanks so much for joining us and breaking down your FedEx expectations going forward from here. We appreciate the time. Coming up, gotta catch all the McRibs from Pokemon Games, so McRib, Farewell, tour who are ending the show in high class fashion to the year. How takes on the other side, Slough Peacock? From a couple years, how does it look, where does old temples run? Welcome back everyone. This is time for Cretan Time. We've got three stories. One minute each. We start with this today. Warner Brothers says the cost of its scrapped shows and sitcoms it could total $2.5 billion. This is as it restructures itself financially. Now, the thing to remember for so many of the production houses as they have been shifting into streaming, there's a ton more data that they're being able to leverage to really determine whether or not a show even before it goes to production is going to be successful, which makes it even more alarming perhaps that there's a $2.5 billion hit that you could see when you are having that massive shift towards a streaming platform, launching that streaming service, and then actually forecasting what will perform well in that environment too. Yeah, look, there's just a, it continues to be a rapid changes in the environment, how content is consumed, of course led by the streaming movement. And I just think a lot of these companies, media, legacy media companies are realizing there's still a lot of bloat inside of them. You have one person that reports to another person, and they all report to one other person.",https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LuX9IXzHLV4,61,2022-10-25 18:23:09
4081," I mean, moving and I just think a lot of these companies, legacy media companies are realizing there's still a lot of bloat inside of them. You have one person that reports to another person and they all report to one other person. There's just too many people in there given this changing dynamic. So again, I think you probably see more layoffs or more changes like this. And is there a change in the binging trends as well? Is the business of binge is that kind of the thing in the past now? Now we're all binge. We're still watching. We're still binge. Yeah, I'm definitely binge. All right, Mattel, catching the best Pokemon of their all. Pokemon of them all, the Toymaker securing a franchise deal to make Pokemon toys under license. This is, I would say, yet another big win for Mattel and CEO and on cries. They are going to report earnings to Nights. This has just been, you know, in addition to the revival of the Barbie brand. This is just another feather in the hat of a non in that team over there. This is just, I mean, it's a home run deal. Essentially, just really stealing it off from other nose of house, bro. This is massive. You've got an international brand. It has had so much success across gaming and some of the digital spaces as well has had a successful entertainment side of the business that directly dovetails into how many people want to buy the toys over time. And I was one of those kids grown up. I had these toys. That was your generation. That and power. We had the Poke Balls. Power Rangers. Yes. They had one of the most virally successful AR apps and game experiences. You remember back in 2015, 2016, people would just stop in the middle of the street. On people's lawns trying to catch a virtual Pokemon. There you go. My generation, it was Bugs Bunny, you know, mid-80s, late 80s, Bugs Bunny on Saturday morning. It was Space Star. Well, no AR. Oh, man, the dark days of no AR. A parking pig. Yes. That's all folks. And Leslie here in McDonald's is bringing back the beloved Mick Rib Pork Sandwich for what it calls a farewell tour here. Oh, gosh, okay. The Mick Heart or the Mick Shoulder because if you Google search, what's in these? What's in that? It's not actual rib. I think McDonald's has said this in the past. That is not rib. It is a mashup of all these different parts of an animal slathered. And I will give this. You know, that barbecue sauce on the Mick Rib is very, very good. I'm hoping. I'm hoping, Brad. Yeah. They are going to pull this off the menu and start selling a real rib product like Arbise is out there right now selling. Love me some Arbise rib. What you've been telling me, to this point, the Mick Rib is actually a Mick Scrapple. Yeah. Essentially, what you're telling me. If you go online, you can see it's usually a stripe, heart and shoulder, all mixed together. I'm just reporting what's out there. Look, I mean, it is kind of tasty sometimes. The Mick Heart. It's all on a Mick Heart lunch. Give me a Mick Heart. No. Well, thank goodness for the farewell tour of the Mick Rib. We hope it's well received. Perhaps among those who celebrate Mick Ribs out there in the world. Maybe with the Mick Calorie. Five or twenty calories here for the Mick Rib. Definitely not died, friendly. All right. We've been talking about earnings all morning long. Brad, let's give everyone our quick takeaways for me. It's definitely, it's pricing. Yeah. It's a UPS. It's a Coca-Cola. The calling out that they continue to successfully raise prices. Sure, a lot of these companies have seen volume hits, but still, I am just amazed by these double-digit price increase. A lot of these companies are calling out. It makes you wonder when is inflation going to come down back to the Fed's target range? You would think maybe sometime later in 2023, but, you know, corporate America continues to push through big prices increases. And I forgot to mention, sure, and Williams too, as well, pushing through big price increases. You know, mine is more of actually a preview here, especially as we've been talking about tech all day from our conversation with Liz Ann Saunders to kick off the show all the way through what the expectations might be, considering some of the pressures that we're seeing on advertising, the pressures that we're seeing on price as well. Their consumers are taking price where that demand is still holding up within consumer technology. And then even more, all of these companies are going to have to account for, as they've already reported in last quarter, the FX headwind that is going to be persistent. And that's not going anywhere anytime soon until you see a weakening of the dollar. And so with all of that in mind, I think that really tees up what we could see within tech in the persistent headwinds, especially in FX, but also just where that continues to compress on some of their margins as well. Yeah, I'm just looking at the three major intercies right now, Brad, reacting favorably to what has been buying large, a pretty good earning season now. A lot of blowups out there, of course, you had Snap, etc. But the market seems to be embracing some of these better than expected earning.",https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LuX9IXzHLV4,62,2022-10-25 18:27:20
4082," Favorably, to what has been buying large, a pretty good earnings season now, a lot of blowups out there, of course, you had snap, et cetera. But the market seems to be embracing some of these better than expected earnings. The markets just look in for some relief wherever we can find right now. Sure, over these past four or five sessions, we've looked pretty good, but think about what was taking place coming into the expats four or five sessions, precipitous declines, and it's going to be a question of, as we move on throughout the rest of this earnings season, where investors at least get an inkling of positivity from the equity market. Well, if you need some stomach relief, don't order that McMurray we were just talking about. Coming up, you'll find Ciccafajita has you for the next hour of trading. She will be joined by former speaker of the House Paul Ryan. Chad is the latest SPAC venture. They're moving midterm elections and all things DC that's an interview. You do not want to miss. We'll be right back. Welcome to Yakut Finance Live. It is 11 a.m. here in New York City. I'm Makiko Fujita. Here's what I'm watching at this hour. Stocks getting a tailwind as GM, UPS, and Coca-Cola all beat the street. The Nasdaq pushing higher ahead of big results from Alphabet and Microsoft. So to the moon, we're going to ask DeFull about the $4,300 call on 4,300 college to say on the S&P.

4083," doesn't condone any form of hate speech. It sees a short-term negative impact on finances, but is there a bigger fallout to come? We've got a panel standing by to discuss. And return of the SPAC former House Speaker Paul Ryan backs his company all the way to the New York Stock Exchange listening. Listing will ask him about market choppiness and how he feels two weeks ahead of his all-important midterms. First though, let's check in on the market action right now. We are seeing green across the board. As we look at all three major indices right now, 90 minutes into the trading day, the Dow up about 175 points right now, the S&P 500 up 36 and the NASDAQ up 157. As always, or I should say, especially this week, the NASDAQ, the big one to watch with Microsoft and Alphabet on tap today after the bell. But we are kicking off this hour with general motors. Out with better than expected earning today, and we are seeing that reflected in the shares up more than 3% as the auto manufacturer reaffirms its full year outlook despite a challenging environment. GM reporting a record third quarter revenue of $41.9 billion, driving $3.3 billion of net income attributable to stockholders for a closer look at GM and the auto space. Let's turn to our very own prize, a supermanian. Pros, it does feel like they've kind of turned the corner in terms of those big headwinds they've been facing, whether it is the supply shortage inventory, not quite up to where they want it to be, but it is headed in the right direction. Yeah, for sure. They had a record quarter revenue just barely below analyst expectations. Big profit here, $4.3 billion in adjusted net income that's almost 50% higher than a year ago. Like you said, they were able to hit these sort of numbers. The man is strong, supply constraints easing. You saw that they reaffirmed their EBIT guidance for the year, which a lot of people thought they would maybe take that down because of the fact that maybe things are slowing down, maybe there's some issues with supply and pricing. But Mary Barra in her letter said that, they reaffirmed the guidance despite a challenging environment because demand continues to be strong for GM products and we're actively managing headwinds that we face. Also talking about how they captured 8% of the EV market share with the bolt and bolt EV doing really well. They're an increase in production of that car. And they're on track for their EV game plan. They're going to release the Equinox, the Blazer, the Silverado next year. And they again maintain that they acquired materials enough materials for 1 million EV run rate in 2025. So a lot of good things here in this quarter for GM. Ford, obviously the next one on tap to report their results. Is there anything we can take away from what GM reported today in terms of where things are headed in the car space, particularly on EVs? Well, it sounds like demand isn't an issue, at least for US automakers. And I think Ford will price the same thing potentially tomorrow. Big question is, are they going to also reaffirm their guidance? We're not as lucky as sure. They're sort of hinting at their having issues with headwinds like the pricing pressures they're facing. So could that take down their guidance or for profit guidance? We'll see. But it sounds like demand is not a concern. Despite the fact that we have so many the negative drumbeat of is the global macroeconomic, economy, kind of withering, is pricing coming down. I think what we're seeing is that it's not affecting demand for cars, at least. Yeah, we've heard sort of the question, I guess the verdict is still out, whether in fact we're at that tipping point with EVs gas prices creeping back up again. So we'll continue to watch the demand there. Thanks so much for that. Well, let's take a look now at more big name earnings, starting with Coca-Cola, the beverage giant, topping estimates in its latest quarter, as well as raising its revenue outlook for 2022, though unable to avoid the currency headwinds weighing on others. Shares up just slightly there. Joining me now is Yahoo Finance, is Brian Sasi, itching to get into all those numbers? Where do we start? I think I start on pricing. It's been the theme of the morning. It's not just with a Coca-Cola. It's a UPSU name, but anyway, with Coca-Cola pricing up 12% in that third quarter, also Coke Zero. Coke Zero, up 11% in terms of sales. It's been, I think it was a blowout quarter for a Coca-Cola. A little bit of a squishy guidance outlook from the company, but still very much mirrored what we heard from Pepsi-Cola last week. Strong pricing, strong demand, consumers not really blocking at these price increases. And I think the next big thing for Coca-Cola is this really next wave of innovation. More new flavors for Coke Zero. More new flavors for Costa Coffee. That's a brand they bought. I believe two and a half years ago, I think the company is really winning high marks on the street after a quarter like this.",https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LuX9IXzHLV4,64,2022-10-25 18:36:00
4084," More new flavors for Costa coffee. That's a brand they bought. I believe two and a half years ago, I think the company's really winning high marks on the street after a quarter like this. UPS, another name that you're watching really closely. There are FX headwinds get again being mentioned like so many earnings calls. Really make me work today. But yes, UPS, good quarter for UPS, strikingly different compared to what we heard from FedEx, which later real egg in terms of this earnings two and a half weeks ago. But look with CFO Brian Newman told us about FX challenges on its business in the third quarter. The currency impact in the quarter was about $82 million. So it is a meaningful headwind on our international business. But we're effectively offsetting that as we manage the portfolio across the domestic business and then across some of the other segments. And right up there with pricing, Kiko, it is the currency headwind, of course, impacting UPS, but also heard Coca-Cola by 8% in terms of their sales in the most recent quarter. And we talked to Beth Ann Bovino in the prior hour and the 10 o'clock hour. And these currency headwinds are likely to be around for some time. They're not going away in the fourth quarter. They might stick around into the first half in next year and likely continue to weigh themselves. Yeah, and something that we're tracking every day in terms of dollar strength. All right, we got you on set. We're going to keep working you, Brian. All right, G.E. Let's do it. Let's go. G and 3M. All right, well G.E.E. later, another dud. And I'm surprised the stock is not completely falling off a cliff here. One of the hottest tickers in the aisle, funnets, a platform here this morning that is G.E.E.N.3M. I'll start with G.E. They actually warned on their full year. And I think you could really tie to two things. First, the renewable energy segment was, again, a dreadful quarter. Order is down 43%. Operate at a loss on an adjusted operating profit base. Not a good quarter for them. And I do think this is a management team severely distracted by trying to split up its company into three businesses. G.E.Healthcare will be the first one out of the shoot as a public company in early January. And then 3M, like G.E.E. lowering its full year outlook. And again, another one, just not some, I'm really surprised not seeing a stronger negative market reaction when you see a 3M warn warn about currency, concerned about higher inflation and supply chain. But again, two industrial giants right now, hot tickers on our platform, both warning for the full year, not a great, I would say, read on the global economy. Yeah, you're right. Not as big of a reaction with 3M down about 6.10. You want to do it anymore? Any more? You got it? Good. I can keep going. You have to write like five stories, right? OK. Fair enough. All right. Go to YahooFinance.com. How about that? We'll pitch all your stories. All right, friends, how's it? Thanks so much for that. And let's move on to our trending ticker. Turbulence for JetBlue shares in the airline carrier under heavy pressure after the company missed analyst estimates on its latest results. The company earned 21 cents a share on revenue of $2.5 billion. Revenue per available seat mile, which is a key metric we track. Increased by more than 23%, it's strong travel demand and higher ticket prices help offset those higher costs. Still though, JetBlue expects some of that demand to soften in the current quarter, but the president's chief operating officer saying he expects capacity to be up just one to 4% compared to pre-pandemic levels in 2019. Well, coming up, Yeezy doesn't. Adidas parts ways with the artist formerly known as Kanye West after a string of controversies. Could the battle over his namesake grant end up in court? We've got a lot to discuss on this headline here. That's coming up on the other side.utes next week.",https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LuX9IXzHLV4,65,2022-10-25 18:40:44
4085," LOL We'll talk about that in a little bit. Well, stocks currently looking positive across all three major indices right now with a Dow up for the 200 points is a relief rally on the horizon. Our next guest thinks so and says the S&P could make it could make its way back to 4,300 by April. That is barring outside factors joining us now is Barry Bannister, chief equity strategist at Seifold. Barry, we could all use some positive news after the last month that we've had. Certainly we have seen gains pick up over the last few weeks on this expectation potentially of a Fed pivot. What are you watching right now in terms of levels that that will really you think could push things in the right direction? Well, you know a lot of the bad news was known and we had a violent sell-off in the first 10 months of this year. You know, if you look at the nominal peak of the S&P 500 index, it was 4,800 on January 3rd, but the real inflation adjusted purchasing power peak was 5,100 on December 29th. So we fell about 31.5% which if you look at the 14 bear markets since 1947 in the post-World War 2 era really the 14 bear markets associated with recessions, the average and what we call the trim mean taking out the highest in the lowest was 31.7%. So we had a bear market, ambitious malling bear market due to Fed policy. But when we analyze all the fixed income currency, futures, political, economic, geopolitical factors, you know we come up with the view that if the Fed is not turning the dial to tighten every single day, that's effectively a second derivative easing. In other words, not raising the volume is a form of lowering the volume. And I don't think the Fed gets tighter than what's embodied in futures. In fact, I think futures are probably overstated in May of 2023 at nearly 5% on short rates. Inflation is going to come down. Any first year economic student in college could do what we did. All you do is break down inflation into its sub components. And all of them point down. All of them. So Barry, does that mean that you're in the camp that you think the Fed could potentially pause some of these rate hikes because you think that inflation is starting to show some signs of moderating and that the Fed can't move to aggressively. Well, we look at GDP right on a quarterly annualized. So we take the most recent quarter. We annualize it, multiply it to the fourth power. We annualize GDP. And we have a new fund for the third generation of inflation. So CPI inflation for the three months ended September. Analyzed was only 2%. Yes, it's 2%. So the momentum of inflation.",https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LuX9IXzHLV4,66,2022-10-25 18:44:58
4086," lies inflation. So CPI inflation for the three months ended September, annualized was only 2%. Yes, it's 2%. So the momentum of inflation has already turned down. If you take the core, it consists of services and that is shelter services, so that would be housing related. Those are already turning down. Yes, there's a lag, but they are turning down decisively on rents, home prices you saw the day that today. You look at non-shelter services, wages are the key driver, and wages such as the Atlanta Fed, wage tracker, and average hourly earnings year to year change. And hopefully, on the 28th, the employment cost index all points down. So again, you know, you have to steer the ship with a long lead time, the Fed knows that, and they've done their job. They flatten the curve by end of year, the curve will be completely flat, if not inverted in some points, obviously, tenditudes. But as they do that, we have to be ahead of that. We have to think, okay, well, the Treasury is worried about bond market liquidity. Treasury Secretary Yellen, former chair Yellen of the Fed made a statement yesterday. The Treasury is intently focused on bond market risk due to liquidity and other concerns. So if the market is always ahead of reality, we have to get ahead of that. And so it looks to us like there'll be a rally October to April. I wouldn't overstate the rally. There are a lot of tail risks later in 23. But again, the market is always looking ahead. And we're trying to keep up with it. And I admit it's a really hard job. So Barry, you mentioned some key risks there that could derail that upwards climb to 4,300. One of them being oil shocks. What's the big concern there right now? The G7 and the West collectively are desperately trying to establish what's called a buyer's cartel on Russian oil. And naturally, and you can't blame them, OPEC Plus, which is OPEC's many member states, plus Russia. They don't want with their sellers cartel to have a competing buyer's cartel. So they're not cooperating. And they shouldn't cooperate. That would just be a logical to expect them to do so. So the early December, there is this planned cap on Russian oil. That could create tremendous volatility. Russia has a lot of avenues. I personally would be thinking they might target the CPC pipeline out of Kazakhstan to reduce flows without cutting their own production to drive the price up. And if oil rockets higher, oil is at the core of inflation. This is what the ESG people never understood. That all energy is, all GDP is the conversion of energy. And because of some of the dragging risks on GDP growth, demographics, debt, we don't have the kind of growth we used to have. And as a consequence, we need cheap energy. And so more expensive energy is not going to solve this problem. So if energy goes up, that's the core of inflation. That drives everything, including core CPI and core PCE. So we don't need an oil shock. And that's the risk here. You know, I remember the 1970s very well. We had a 73, 74 oil embargo. And then in 79, we had a second oil shock due to the shower of Iran falling in Iran. We don't need that. And so geopolitically, I think we've got some very poor diplomatic policy out of Washington. And hopefully they don't drive us over the edge with a secondary oil shock, having already depleted these strategic petroleum reserves. Steve, well, chief equity strategist Barry Bannister, it's good to talk to you today. Appreciate the time. Thank you. Well, partnership over. Adidas is ending its massive deal with yay. Artist formerly known as Kanye West. Following a series of anti-Semitic remarks, the shoemaker, the latest high profile brand to cut ties with the artist saying it will stop production of Yeezy branded products immediately, as well as all payments to Yee and his companies. Joining us to discuss the implications we've got Brad Smith as well as Alexis Keenan and Brad, let's start with you because we are trying to figure out what the financial hit is likely to be. I mean, we talk about Yeezy. I mean, Kanye produced products of what been driving 8 to 10 percent of the revenue. Yeah, for Adidas, they're saying.",https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LuX9IXzHLV4,67,2022-10-25 18:48:51
4087," But the financial hit is likely to be. I mean, we talked about Yeezy. I mean, Kanye produced products of what been driving 8% to 10% of the revenue. Yeah, for Adidas, they're saying near term, this could be upwards of $250 million to their net income. But you also think about some of the tertiary dollars as well. We were discussing just last hour with Bernstein, analyst, Anisha Sherman, and the resale community as well. This could also take a hit in the near term. You think about companies like Stadium Goods, owned by a company Farfetch, publicly traded FTCH, I believe. And with all of that in mind, and how so many of those companies have looked across the product lines that have been the most hype beast ex. Yeezy has been squarely within the fold, same to the success of almost mirroring the success of how well Nike dunks have done. And so for a brand that has largely fallen out of favor and seen waning favor over a core consumer constituent in millennials and Gen Z recently losing or having this type of instance that hits on the brand in concert with what's already taking place with the deterioration of the brand could have a much longer term impact as well. There's been a lot of criticism about how long Adidas took to make this decision. I wonder if we have any idea about the financial hit they did take, or they're likely to take, not necessarily of the resale side that you're talking about. But how many consumers said, look, I'm just not going to buy this based on his remarks. Well, his remarks, let's just lay it out on the table. It was antisemitic. He had even prior to that going on rants and wore t-shirts that were saying white lives matter and kind of throwing especially within the black community where black lives matter. Throwing that on its head almost. And so for a consumer group that you have cozyed up to for so many years to now go and do the exact opposite and what I was saying within our show this morning is he is now kind of shifted his entire brand in this era of influencer economy and said, I'm going to pander into such a different direction that is hurtful to so many consumers out there and the population more broadly that now if you're going to continue that pander you also have to be comfortable with knowing that brands are going to step away. It's Adidas. It is JP Morgan. It is a company in CAA, the creative artist agency. And there you're seeing on the screen Gap, which he had had the music partnership with Balenciaga. And so this is far more ranging than just the financial hit of Adidas. It's all of those other companies as well that are going to see some type of impact in the near future. And Alexis, I know you've been looking at sort of the legal side of things. You know, who actually owns the rights to reproduce some of the things that Kanye just designed. I mean, where does that stand right now? Because it was just what last week a few of you saw where he heard Kanye coming out and saying, look, they can't drop me. And also demanding and posting on social media, expecting a $2 billion payout to terminate this deal. But look, I think we first need to put an umbrella on the situation to say, this is somebody who has outwardly expressed that they have mental illness since 2018. So these companies that are contracting with him as the sole owner of some of these brands, Yeezy in particular, they are contracting with a company whose chief is known to have expressed that he has bipolar. So there's some knowingness going into this. But look, that statement that you read going into the segment here with Adidas saying that after this review, they've decided to end production of the Yeezy branded products, not necessarily the sale of them right now. It doesn't sound exactly like they're committing to that. But also saying that they'll stop all payments to Yeezy and his companies. It kind of isn't a full blanket statement that they're ending it there, at least the way I read it. Now, these contracts, in this case, is a private contract. So we don't know what it says between Adidas and his company. But typically, they're licensing agreements where Yee is creating the designs. And then Adidas would own 100% of those designs. So all of the designs that would have been made under that contract, they would typically belong to Adidas. But I'll just caveat it and say, we haven't seen those actual words on that paper. We're not sure. These licenses, they can change hands. They can be sold. They can be assigned as well. Yeah, I mean, to your point about what he has said publicly about having bipolar, I mean, the whole conversation, I will say, just on a personal level, is just a little uncomfortable to watch. We're not a f*****.",https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LuX9IXzHLV4,68,2022-10-25 18:53:19
4088," Yeah, I mean, you know, to your point about what he has said publicly about having bipolar. I mean, the whole conversation I will say just on a personal level is just a little uncomfortable. The one. I mean, not only the anti-Semitic comments that he's made, but you have seen a lot of these companies to your point sort of understanding the situation but going into an agreement, you know, knowing that there are still risks on the side and I wonder, you know, bad or lexas, both of you can weigh in on this. So, what is, you know, where does his brand go? His personal brand go beyond this. You could argue, you know, he moves away from the public eye, he gets some help. Who knows what's going to transpire, but compared to what we have seen in the past, I mean, this feels like the damage is really great. Yeah, and this is where it's a, if I may, the separation of a musician who has built up their brand on who they had been as a musician to what that actual brand has become as a result of the partnerships that move forward and the millions, billions of dollars that were thrown around to make his brand even more appetizing to a range of consumers, whether that be a range of consumers in apparel and fashion or whether that be in some of the other technological landscapes that he wants to operate in. This is still a person that's trying to buy parlor too. So his brand is clearly going in that direction right now with the commentary hurtful as it is has been. And so he is fully delving his brand, fuller into that and even more full steam ahead into some of the hateful commentary that has been known to persist on a platform like that technologically. Well, and it runs counter, right, to the exact fan base that he builds. So, it's run counter to some of his own lyrics. Yeah. Well, I mean, you're exactly right. When you go back and listen to some of his early albums, this is exactly what he reeled against and now he's become a part of that. So, a story that really to your point sort of covers not just the music industry, the fashion industry. It has wide range of implications, but I know both continue to watch it. Coming up, return of the SPAC for my house speaker Paul Ryan, bringing the bell as energy group, Brandon Ridge, lists on the New York Stock Exchange today.

Thank you. Thank you. Thank you. Welcome to Yahoo Finance Live on this Tuesday afternoon. I'm Sean Smith along with Dave Briggs. Let's get you up to speed on some of the buying that we're seeing play out in the broader market. You can see all three of the major averages holding on to gains as we enter the final hour of trading assistance right now. Dow up 264 points. You'll get the Nasdaq up nearly 2% Nasdaq leading the gains today. I'm not saying that that's one of the first and three points that are still in the market. There's more than 1,000 that's also in the green today. Up just around a 2.6%. Now there's risk on sentiment that we're seeing play out in the equities. We want to take a look at the bond market because yield pulling back for the second day in Iraq. You see the 10-year note. Up just around 13 basis points back at 4.11.30 on deck after the bell this afternoon will be hearing from alphabet and Microsoft those two names in the green.",https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LuX9IXzHLV4,70,2022-10-25 19:02:26
4090," 26 taking look at some of the gains that we're seeing more specifically. Let's start with the Nasdaq because we have a couple of big tech earnings on deck after the bell this afternoon. We'll be hearing from Alphabet and Microsoft those two names in the green ahead of those results. Google up just over 1% will hear from Apple and Amazon later this week as well as Meta. You can see Meta up nearly 6% today. Taking a look at the sector action here all I guess 10 of the 11 sectors in the green today energy is the outlier that's off just around 6 10s of a percent. Let's take a look at some of this risk on action. You see that playing out in a number of the meme stocks you have game stop up nearly 10% to your AMC up another 6.5% bedbath and beyond soaring today as well. You can also see the buying playing out in the crypto market Bitcoin back above 20,000 for the first time since October 7th. We're also seeing ether up another 11% this afternoon. Dave crypto, meme stocks. Winning today makes a lot of sense. Thank you, Shadda. Let's catch up speed now on housing. The latest numbers very much in the eye of the beholder category home price growth cooled at a record pace but again it's still growth. Price is up 13% in August from the year prior that's according to today's case Schiller index. A much smaller jump in the 15.6% growth in July and 18% jump in June. Nonetheless the drop between July and August was the largest since at least 1987 when they began tracking that data. The biggest increases Miami and Tampa, Florida both up 28 plus percent and Charlotte, North Carolina up 21% price growth as you might imagine by those numbers strongest in the southeast. The chicken with Jared Blickery now gets up to speed on some earlier earnings. Jared? Yes well let's take a look at the general market here. We have the S&P 500 up over 1%. I believe this is going to make three days in a row as doing a little study earlier today and that poor 10 some strength. However if you bought those two signals earlier in the year would not have worked out three six months down the line. However historically going back there is something to this. I'll get into that towards the close of the bell. Just wanted to point everybody's attention to the Yahoo Finance Trending Takers and Shana you were taking a look at the meme stocks and also some of the other fringe elements to the stock universe. I want to go over some earnings and do it democratically but I got to scroll down for general motors here. People focused on a lot of things here today. So first of all the stocks up about three four percent here and I want to focus on some of the analyst commentary. RBC which rates it in outperforms saying after the Ford pre-announced with that was negative and some GM volume data some investors were concerned about a miss. 2022 guidance reaffirmed but this leaves a pretty wide range for implied fourth quarter levels. Midpoint of the implied fourth quarter EPS below the street but full your street view is closer to the low end of 675 versus 650 to 750 would not be surprised to see fourth quarter numbers creep a little higher. Let me just take a quick look at the stock here. You can see that's today's performance. Here is a year to date and you can see after basing for several months we are now testing those lows as our number of stocks but importantly hasn't exceeded those as a number of the indices have. Now scrolling down here one to get to at least one more earnings that alphabet is after the bell and so we're going to take a look at Coca-Cola. Here we go. That is up two and a half percent today. You can see racing off of those recent lows and I do have some commentary by the street. Here we go. Wells Fargo, Chris Carrey showing third quarter showed that KO's momentum has sustained as we approached 2023 and the initial currency outlook for next year is less bad than feared getting down to those currency feared stronger dollar. Not a concern today but overall it has been guys. All right, Jared. Thanks so much for bringing that down. Let's talk a little bit more about the buying action that we're seeing play out in today's market. For that we want to bring in Brent, a shooting, Northwestern Mutual Wealth Management's Chief Investment Officer Brent. It's great to see you again. So we're looking at stocks trading higher for the third day in a row. Nasdaq leading the way today up nearly two percent. What do you make of the buying action? And I guess do you think the gains that we've seen recently do they have staying power? I do and certainly the markets kind of gone back and forth and I expected to remain volatile but the big component of today was the sticky inflation narrative continues to fall by the wayside. And so I know that backwards inflation numbers still look elevated but housing was brought up early.",https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LuX9IXzHLV4,71,2022-10-25 19:06:19
4091," was the sticky inflation narrative continues to fall by the wayside. And so I know that backwards inflation numbers still look elevated. But housing was brought up earlier in the segment. The housing market is important because the quote sticky inflation right now is in the services side of the economy. Housing and rents make up 32% of the 56% of the sticky inflation in services. Housing market is weakening. That housing market weakening, that rent market weakening, shows up with a 12 month lag in the CPI number. And as you saw today, housing prices aren't going up, they're going down. As are rents. And so if you think about that in the future, sticky inflation will be coming down because that housing market data, which is now faltering, that rent data, which is now faltering in current rents, that will begin showing up in the inflation number. And that will combine with goods prices, which are also falling, and commodity prices, which many people aren't talking about. But commodity prices are flat on a year of your basis. And so I guess to kind of tie it all together, you are seeing inflation, forward looking inflation measures coming down. That has stabilized the bond market. And when you stabilize the bond market, you stabilize the stock market. And that is why you are seeing upward pressure on both stocks and bond prices today. Leading you, Brent, to believe the Fed is going to do what? When? I think they probably tighten 75 basis points by next week they take it. They want to get to a place where they believe monetary policy is tight before job loss is started croering. So if you think about that, they didn't want to be tightening at the same time the job market is weakening. One other data point that came out today is that the jobs market, which is believed to be tight, we've noted this bit in the past. In the conference ford, there is a question to questions. Are jobs easy to get or are they hard to get? This has an incredible, the diffusion between these two, has an incredible correlation with the unemployment rate. That fell again today. We're 15 points off the high. If I look back in prior cycles when this happens, you start seeing the unemployment rate rise and actually start seeing negative jobs reports. And so believe it or not in today's environment, that is actually a positive because it shows that some of these forces that have led inflation higher are starting to abate, which has been the market's big problem and the Fed's big problem. And that means the Fed will eventually be able to stop. We'll hopefully after they do 75 basis points this time. So, Brent, you don't think they're going to raise rates in in December? I think they would say they're dependent. If we've learned anything, they're incredibly reactionary. Keep in mind at the beginning of the year, the Federal Reserve thought they'd raised rates by 0.875% this year. And the quote-unquote outlier on the dot plot was 1.1%. This is why the market's been so volatile is because the Fed has been chasing this and been wrong for some time. Hopefully they are able to stop. Hopefully they're able to see the inflation number coming down. They want to see that first before they stop tightening so that you don't believe they're not on the job. But hopefully we'll start seeing that in the coming months data. Despite all that, recessionary fears remain high. And Bank CEO after CEO is added to that suspicion. And then Jamie Dimitz did something interesting. Davos in the desert in Saudi Arabia. Let's listen to that and get your reaction. But there's a lot of stuff in the horizon, which is bad. And could, it doesn't necessarily, but could put the United States in a recession. That's not the most important thing for what we think about. We'll manage right through that. I would worry much more about the geopolitics of the world today. I think the most important thing is the geopolitics is going in Russia, Ukraine, America, China, you know, the relationships of the Western world. And that would have to be far more concerned than whether it's a milder, slightly severe recession. Always interesting comments from Jamie, your reaction, Brent. Well, I said a few comments lately about economic storms and hurricanes and whatever else it may be. So he's been kind of all over this place. Look, I've said it for a while. I'll say it again, we are going to have a mild recession, at least I believe so. We have never seen leading economic indicators where they're at today and not been in a recession or had a recession. I don't think that's necessarily so important because I don't think inflation survives a recession. And I do believe the recession would be mild because overall, despite the narrative, the consumer remains in great shape. And so what I'm hopeful for is that we have this pullback. We've free up a little labor market slack, the Fed stops, and then we're able to come on the other side of this with inflation falling and we kind of return to a normal environment. Geopolitics are definitely a cause for concern. We own gold because of that. And so I'm suggesting that maybe you should think about hedging a little bit of your portfolio, but please don't overdo it because I don't know for certain notice anybody what happens with run.",https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LuX9IXzHLV4,72,2022-10-25 19:10:42
4092," We own gold because of that. And so I'm suggesting that maybe you should think about hedging a little bit of your portfolio, but please don't overdo it because I don't know for certain in order to see anybody what happens with Russia and Ukraine. So, interesting. You're allocating some of your portfolio at least to gold. What else are you doing with your portfolio at this point? So we did lengthen our bond portfolio. We did that last week. If you think about bonds, and this is where you've had a reprising the bond market, which has caused reprising the stock market, especially in those names that you mentioned to open up. You mentioned growth stocks. You mentioned meme stocks. You mentioned things that rely upon zero interest rates. At the beginning of the year, the Barclays Agria bond index yielded 1.5 to 1.75%. It now yields 5.2%. Longer bonds provide a hedge against a downturn, potentially a recession, and they provide a hedge against other bad and adverse actions such as geopolitics. And so I think I'm fearful that investors now think they should hide in cash, they should own the front end of the curve. They should extend their duration out just a bit. Second and third, we continue to like things in the US that are cheap. We like US small caps, as represented by the S&P 600, which are rallying heavy today, and are actually one of the best performers here today, as well as US mid caps. Those parts of the market are cheaper than large caps, and they've discounted the potential for earnings declines already, and they will do better on the opposite side. And so that's all in all kind of where we position our portfolio overall. All right, that's good stuff. Northwestern Mutual Wealth Management Chief Investment Officer, Brent Shuddy, good to see you, sir. Thank you. Just getting started here on Yahoo Finance Live, coming up the Deedas. Finally, cuts ties with Kanye West. What took him so long? Amazon is rolling at a new payment option for its US customers just in time for the holiday season.

4093," 🎵 What's your name? Shares of Adidas, as you can see down, just over 3% on the German exchange after the huge news that Adidas had indeed finally cut ties with Kanye West, who also goes by yay over a string of anti-Semitic remarks. The company saying this morning in a news release quote, Yees recent comments and actions have been unacceptable, hateful, and dangerous and they violate the company's values of diversity and inclusion, mutual respect and fairness. Joining us now for a discussion on all this, Anjali Jenshundani, practitioner and resident, Sath University of New Haven and Sam Poser, Williams trading senior equity analyst, nice to have you both. Anjali will start with you. Why do you think it took Adidas so long to make what appeared to be an obvious move? You know, I think the financial implications really had their team thinking of how do they resolve this. We're in the fourth quarter. Everyone's racing to get to December and sales are really stressed. We have the holiday sales. We have aging inventory and this may have been their priority before they made the decision to really communicate what their brand values are and where they stand. Sam, you see the stock off just over 3% today, Adidas without the Yeesy partnership. What does that look like from a business perspective? Well, I mean, I thought when Kanye left Nike that really, Kanye wanted the keys to the castle at Nike, Adidas decided to give it to him and probably at the end of the day, it'll be better for Adidas, even though in the short term, likely, you know, they're going to lose some revenue. Are you surprised the stock is down just 3% Sam and you think the hesitation had something to do with the CEO transition, which happens early next year? I mean, the estimates are that I think it's about $2 billion that Kanye brings in and if that's accurate, I mean, I don't think those decisions are difficult. And I think as somebody mentioned earlier, they were one of the first ones to put it under root to put their agreement with him under review. I'm really messaging or reputation. Let's start there means everything to a brand. When you take a look at what that messaging then should be from Adidas at this point, since it did take them so long to respond, what are the next steps that they need to take in order to win back? Maybe some of the customers who don't necessarily trust them right now? Well, that's what it's all about is they've really broken trust with their customers and now they're really going to have to repair that, being able to communicate and communicating immediately and getting in front of the crisis is important. And when it comes to crisis management with any brand working with a celebrity, you need to have this in place crisis management. You can't control what a celebrity is going to say, but you need to know what your action will be and your leadership needs to be aligned on what messaging will be. Hope for the best plan for the worst. Okay. Sam, want to ask you about another statement that was part of Adidas announcement and it said it was interesting that lead you to wonder what's coming. Adidas is the sole owner of all design rights to existing products as well as previous and new color ways. Under the partnership, we may not know more until November 9th when they report. Does that lead you to believe Adidas may try to keep this brand alive under some different name and is there a legal challenge ahead? I was starting with the last question. I don't know. There already are, if you look at the website, some interpretations of some of the Kanye product under the Adidas logo. And I believe that may have been one of the reasons why Kanye was potentially trying to sever that relationship prior to today's announcement anyway.",https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LuX9IXzHLV4,74,2022-10-25 19:19:18
4094," other reasons why Kanye was potentially trying to sever that relationship prior to today's announcement anyway. So yeah, I mean these agreements that were made and the one with Nike and so on, the designs belong to the company, not to Kanye. So you know, what they're going to do and how that'll be received, I think are, you know, to be determined. And my guess is given that this is looking for a new CEO, that's not going to be an upcoming earnings revelation. I'm going to put a similar question to you, but what do you think from a branding perspective, from a marketing perspective, that they should do with the designs that they have from the easy collection and how they should address that then with the public? You know, I think they need to expand their portfolio. They really need to look to other influencers and other partnerships that can support them. The whole premise with working with him was to really attract a young customer. Gen Z, Gen X, millennials, they were attracted to this type of merchandise. If they have a gap in their portfolio, they need to think long term and they need to look at a strategy that'll be beneficial, not rely on a personality or celebrity. And how they do that, they'll really need to think about how they really reinvent their in-house design team. Ajali, for other companies, let's just say in this sector, what is the lesson here in terms of crisis management? Crisis management, your brand is your hero. So that is your voice and that's your messaging. So if you're going to do any type of partnership, you need to really evaluate the risk at hand. You need to be able to have a plan and understand what that roadmap looks like. Branding is about creating a value proposition. And when you are messaging anything, everything communicates. So really focus on your brand as the hero. Your product is the hero, and your messaging is what pulls customers in. That's what people are attracted to. Your brand values and your voice. Sam, you cover Foot Locker and the note that you just put out this morning, you said that Adidas cutting ties with Kanye will have an immediate effect, further increase challenges facing a footlocker today. What does that look like? Well, I mean, so Nike, we believe that Nike has reduced their allocations to Foot Locker. We think it's in the 800 million to a billion dollars at cost. And they also plan to expand their business with Adidas over the next few years to about two billion dollars. The only sort of instant sell out rapid sell out category of shoes they had from Adidas was Kanye. So that's a lot of business gone right away. And from what we understand, other parts of Adidas aren't doing quite as well. And as I wrote in the note, Foot Locker has a lot of open to buy dollars to buy things other than Nike. The question was and probably is more magnified today is do the consumers have the open the open to purchase when all that new product shows up that's not Nike. And that given what happened with Kanye today, that just got a lot worse for Foot Locker. It's certainly a challenging landscape before them. Sam Pozer, Angelie John Gendoni, thank you so much for joining us this afternoon. All right, coming up next, Elon Musk, reportedly taking another step in his bid to buy Twitter. We have the latest details. And just in time for Black Friday, Amazon, we'll start taking Venmo payments. What users need to know next.",https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LuX9IXzHLV4,75,2022-10-25 19:23:33
4095," One millimeter longmanuel AM muita kasih om separ, a Elon Musk has pledged to close the deal with Twitter by Friday. He did this on a conference call with the bankers helping to fund the acquisition. Of course, if you can't keep that promise, the trial between the tech billionaire and the social media platform will resume in Delaware courts. Now Musk is getting backlash from current Twitter employees after the Washington Post reported a plan to cut Twitter staff by 75 percent. Twitter has since denied that claim. The worried employees have reportedly penned an open letter asking the company to preserve the current headcount. Taking a look at Twitter stock today, moving to the upside you see shares by just around 2.8 percent. So Dave, when you take a look at the stock reaction, Wall Street getting more on board, I think a little bit more confident that this deal is going to happen. We did see Tesla shares give up some of its earlier gains shortly after this report from Bloomberg broke. But it does seem like at least a step in the right direction. 5 pm Friday though. That's the least there's a light at the end of the tunnel that this drama is finally open over. That letter that Time Magazine got a hold of that letter that's circulating inside Twitter that says a threat of this magnitude is reckless. Underminds our users and customers trust in our platform and is a transparent act of worker intimidation. So even though that drama is over, a whole new drama appears to be starting over and we begin to ask those questions, what does Elon Musk have in store for Twitter, how does he build them into a profitable company once he takes them private. And there is, let's just agree, no way he can fire 75% of employees and turn it into a profitable private company. Yeah, I don't think so. But I don't know, let's just say to assume the drama's not over, right? Drama's certainly not over. We will see more than 75% of the work hours from now. All right. We need to take a quick break.",https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LuX9IXzHLV4,76,2022-10-25 19:28:18

We have closed our doors with a tent. This is my cooldesb with a screen on me. And tonight's distribution show. Following this provided little bit. We decided to press the screen according to episode 18. If we don't upgrade the screen then you won't something else. I've talked to most of everyone in the industry. clock and you don't want to go this way. another way for customers to pay just in time for the holiday season. Tech reporter Din Halley is here with the details. Dan, what do we need to know? That's right, Sean. There's going to be a new payment option available for Amazon users. They're rolling Venmo into the payment option offerings there. Once you start to finish up your potential shopping spree, you'll just be able to add your Venmo account there. You'll have to authorize it. And then once it's there, you can use that as one of your default purchase settings. Now, it's going to be rolling out slowly. It will be available by Black Friday for all users in the US. But you may start to see it as an option to add to that checkout portion of Amazon. And this obviously a big deal for PayPal. Venmo is owned by PayPal. So shares of PayPal are up more than 7% on the day as a result. And so this is, I think, just another way for Amazon to ensure that, however users want to pay, they'll be able to pay. They've added other options in the past. So this is just another extension of that effort going forward. Are there other platforms that accept the Venmo payment? Is there more coming down this road? Oh, yeah, there's plenty of other businesses that accept Venmo as a payment option. I think this is probably, obviously, one of the largest as far as commerce and e-commerce goes. But there's plenty of others out there. A lot of small shops actually use it as their primary means of payment. I mean, if you live in an apartment, chances are your landlord allows you to use Venmo as a payment option, although mine doesn't, and they need to get on that. But yeah, it is something that you're going to see.",https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LuX9IXzHLV4,77,2022-10-25 19:32:24
4097," Heyman, I mean, if you live in an apartment, chances are your landlord allows you to use Venmo as a payment option, although mine doesn't, and they need to get on that. But yeah, it is something that you're going to see go across more e-commerce platforms as we continue to see Venmo just really take over as a payment option for people in Gen X, Gen Z and millennials. Excited for that. CVS Uber, they allow a credit card. So I think a lot of us have been waiting for this. Dan Howley, good stuff. Thank you. The latest victim of inflation and rising rates is the Wall Street bonus. Wall Street profits are down over 50 percent in the first half of this year. And according to a report from the New York State Comptroller, that could mean a 22 percent drop in bank or payouts. Taking the biggest toll on these bonuses are investment banking fees, which plummeted from a record high in 21 as volatile markets in an uncertain economic outlook put an end to the surge in mergers and IPOs we saw during the pandemic. They have flat out disappeared, some stunning numbers, Shana, from the Wall Street Journal. Traditional IPOs have raised $7 billion this year. That is down more than 90 percent from last year and when did they come back? Exactly. I think that's a big question now as we look out over the next couple of quarters. Certainly seems like these challenging economic environment that we are currently in is going to last for quite some time. When you take a look at the average compensation last year for Wall Street, obviously a totally different scenario. But the average pay for bankers last year in New York City was $516,000 up from $438,000 the year before. That's more than five times the average private sector salary worker, including an average bonus of $257,000. So again, it was the highest bonus that we had seen paid since 2006, here just in terms of the numbers that we had seen recently. So a slowdown I think has been forecasted now for quite some time. That 22 percent drop though really shows how big of a slowdown we have seen in the economy and how they're simply like you said, no appetite out there at least for right now for the M&A and IPO deal. Yeah, the IPOs we've heard about may be happening. Clowna and Instacart eventually did not happen in terms of M&A activity. $504 billion in the quarter was the slowest we'd seen in five years with one exception. Q2 2020 when the pandemic was just getting underway. So yeah, it looks like this is here to stay and could last throughout the year and some on Wall Street paying that bill. All right. Coming up next, the backlog of ships at the Port of Los Angeles has dropped dramatically since the start of the year. We'll find out why.

Now, in the Trans-Pacific Theater, running from Asia to the United States, most of that business is contracted annually, and some decided to go multi-year on their agreements. The spot market is not a majority of the business, but it does have an influence when these rates drop like they have, on what folks are gonna be looking at in the quarters upcoming. And Jim, we've talked a lot about the shortage of truckers in the past, also the headwinds when it comes to some of the rails and the ability to get some of the product out. Where do those headwinds stand? Are they still a big challenge for the port of LA? Yeah, the supply chain is always in need of improvement, constant movement forward. What we've seen right now is that earlier this year, the rail volume increased by sixfold, and we collectively as an industry have had trouble keeping up with that. Until the recent eight weeks, we've seen rail volume idling at the port of Los Angeles dropped by more than 50%, same with those aging containers. I think we finally had the breakthrough on the rail that we finally needed. Truck volume has moved in really well. The time a container sits at the port of LA before it moves out by truck is at pre-pandemic times, meaning it's moving very fast. Circling back to the labor agreement which expired in July, what are the big holdups? When do you expect a deal to get done? Collective bargaining is hard. This is really tough work. You're not only trying to put a coast wide contract together for all 22,000 workers and the 29 ports that they support, but with those 29 ports, you have all local issues that must be solved in parallel with the big coast wide agreement. There's gonna be continued work. We've got season professionals at the table on both sides and as I mentioned, the service level has not deteriorated one Iota. We'll keep moving this cargo and let these folks concentrate on getting this deal done. We'd like to see it done now so we can send that market signal that we're ready. Are you confident though you'll get a deal before your end? That remains in question and we're gonna continue to work with all stakeholders I know from the Biden administration through Governor Newsom's office, Los Angeles Mayor Eric Arsetti and all of us pushing both sides to stay at the table and chip away at these issues. The sooner, the better for the American economy. Gene Sieroka, great having you in studio. Thanks so much for venturing out to the East Coast. We really appreciate it. Wonderful to see you both, Sean. A day thanks to you. Well, coming up, shares of Weber are assuring at this afternoon find out why.

4099," every NHL do Time for a triple play. Three stocks that we are watching here in the final 15 minutes of trading. We have Weber GM and Canopy Growth process on set to help us break down some of today's big movers. Let's start with my play and that is Weber. The stock shooting higher today shares are soaring on a takeover bid from BDT capital. You can see the stock up 29% right now. The offer is to buy the shares that it doesn't already own for 625 a share. It's a 24% premium to Weber's closing price last night. You can see a trading just above that value today. City out with a note this morning saying that this bid could go even higher given where the stock was trading at the end of the summer. Wells Fargo more positive on the stock upgrading it to equal weight from underweight on the heels of this news despite today's jump though. Still trading well below its IPO price of $14 back in August of 2021 and process also bring up Weber today because there seems to be a lot of progress. There's just refocus on some of those mean trades. Weber has been grouped in with the mean trades over the last couple of months now. We have been beyond surging today. Game stop up nearly 10%. It seems like some of these trades are back in investors' favor at least. I heard Jared talking to you earlier about the mean trade back in Vogue. Weber a nice Chicago company that's run from some kind of partial to them. They had a nice run with the pandemic right. That was a big boom outdoor grilling things like that. Now seems like they're going back to be being a private company with this LBO or whatever this take going private. So interesting to watch there. Also sizzling around fire. I'm watching GM stock here jumping in the back of a big profit beat along with record revenue around 42 billion for the quarter. GM seeing the supply constraints easing and the automaker reaffirmed its ebit guidance of 13 billion to 15 billion for the year. CEO Mary Barrett said they were doing this reaffirmation because despite a challenging environment because demand continues to be strong for GM products. Also the EV game plan appears to be on track. They have materials in place for about one million units of annual EV capacity by 2025. Very optimistic. And then tomorrow we turn our attention to Ford and you wonder how much of the bad news is already baked in that stock down what I think 40 plus percent year to date because of that pre-announcement that they'd take a billion dollar hit, a surcharge and had 45,000 cars parked. You expect what are your expectations tomorrow? I think the big concern is that are they going to reaffirm their ebit guidance that they did last time because they need to follow GM. GM saying we're in a strong place. We've got strong demand. We're weathering these components shortage. We're in a good spot. So if we can Ford actually do that with the little warning of higher prices. Looks like GM may be the leader for now. My play in the pot stocks. Let's start with CGC at Trending Ticker right now on Yahoo Finance. Can it be growth? Speeding up its entry into the US market by consolidating its US assets into a new holding company.

Perhaps it's some polling yesterday from Monmouth University showing two thirds of Americans favor legalizing marijuana. And they keep part of that polling, Sean, 76 percent of Democrats and 52 percent of Republicans favor legalization. And once you get over the majority of Republicans, you start to get optimistic.",https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LuX9IXzHLV4,81,2022-10-25 19:49:44
4100," 76 percent of Democrats and 52 percent of Republicans favor legalization. And once you get over the majority of Republicans, you start to get optimistic about federal legalization and maybe some pressure on Republican senators. Maybe this will be the pressure that they do need because we know that that has remained stalled in Congress now for quite some time. They haven't had, at least to date, the necessary votes that they do need to pass it on a federal level, on a state level. The recreational use is going to be on the ballot in five states. We know it's already legal in 19 states, so that will be interesting to watch as we count down more about two weeks now from the midterms. So maybe if we do see more states pass a recreational use of marijuana, maybe we could see these stocks at least in the short term get another bump from here. I still say 2028. I'm pushing that way off. Still not overly optimistic for federal legalization, just too much opposition in the Republican Senate. Good to have you, Prost. Thanks for jumping in. A tough winter is coming for the media industry. New data showing layoffs are beginning to tick up again and more could be on the way. Yahoo! Finance is Alexandra Canal. It's here with the details. And, Ali, when you take a look at the media landscape, certainly changing over the last several years to say the least now it looks like some of those head ones that we've seen in over the last couple of months is going to continue into next year. Yeah, I think it's safe to say that media is an evolving business right now. There's that search for profitability. And then we have a lot of macroeconomic challenges as well. For an exchange pressure, losses of subscribers and linear television that slow down in ad spending and when you're looking to cut costs, layoffs is one strategy that a lot of these companies gravitate towards. We've seen many media companies from Netflix to CNN lay off employees. A reported 3,000 media jobs have been cut with more than one third coming from news media. I mentioned Warner Brothers Discovery. There's another major company that's dealt with intense cost-cutting measures. Most recently, it's television studio cut 26% of its head count. And what you're seeing on your screen now is the news that we got yesterday in an SEC filing the company plans to incur between $3.2 billion and $4.3 billion in pre-tax restructuring costs through 2024. The bulk of these charges between $2.2 billion and $2.5 billion are tied to restructuring the content side of the business, so think the cancellation of the nearly completed backgirl film. We're moving a lot of that content that was in production in development. And ultimately, this is because David Zazov wants to keep that promise that he made to Wall Street slash $3 billion of costs over the next two years. Not the best picture, though, heading into earnings next week. What you want to see that, that girl? Everybody wants to see that movie and to see how bad it was, but they literally wrote it on. And that has been crazy. You know Warner Brothers Discovery is saying, was this worth the tax right all? It would smash if they released it because we all want to see how bad it is. Meanwhile, Game of Thrones, the spin-off, the numbers are in. What are we learning? Yeah, the prequel coming in, 9.3 million viewers in its season one finale. That's according to Warner Brothers Discovery. Now, that includes both linear viewers and HBO Max streams. And it's the most watched finale for an HBO series since Game of Thrones. That secured 19.8 million viewers in 2019. So didn't quite reach those levels, but still this is a brand new show. It's a rookie season. It's garnered a lot of critical acclaim. And on Sunday, there was a lot of competition. We had Sunday night football. We had the ALCS playoff baseball game, which, you know, go Phillies. If anyone has a lot of goals. I knew I am rooting for in the World Series, but still, this is great news for House of the Dragon. And Warner Brothers Discovery too. They really needed this to be a hit. So Phillies of the UNI will be watching those games very closely. Allie, while we have you, we also got news, Disney announcing its newest seasons of BBC's Doctor Who is going to actually be streaming on Disney Plus. How do you think that this or do you think it's going to significantly help grow that viewership? I think it's important when we think about the global reach of Disney Plus. This is definitely a global play since global audiences outside of the UK and Ireland are going to be able to watch this show on Disney Plus beginning in late 2023. Now, previously in the US, it aired on BBC America in recent years. I'm not sure if you guys are a fan of this show, but just judging off of the chatter that I saw online, it looks like worldwide. This does have some appeal. And as Disney is looking to expand its reach over...",https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LuX9IXzHLV4,82,2022-10-25 19:53:58
4101," But just judging off of the chatter that I saw online, it looks like worldwide, this does have some appeal, and as Disney is looking to sort of expand its reach overseas, this could be a good move for them. This one really surprised me. I was shocked to see a trending. Is this a big deal, kids? It is. It has a very, very loyal fan base, I will say that. I will say that. Yeah. And then you could also point to the fact that that could then be a huge win for Disney Plus, because I think people that loyal fan base will be willing to pay the extra subscription costs, but we have been debating when you're going to cut it off when you're not. I think all these. It's all about these. Yes, this viewership base will actually upgrade. I think about something like Squid Game's for Netflix. You know, some of that international IP can translate and really have this cross appeal in the US as well. So we'll have to see how this does. Yeah, there's been a lot of that. Ali, can now good stuff. Thank you very much. Good to have you. All right, with about 20 minutes to go until the closing bell, let's check in on the action, heading into the close text docs outperforming. And look at the green on the board, the Dow up 337 points more than 1%. Continuing a hot streak from last week, the S&P 500 gained 4.7% last week. And now just continues to roll up 60 points. And look at the tech-heavy Nasdaq. I had all these big earnings we are expecting in just a couple of minutes, Shana, expectations we're seeing the Nasdaq pop. Yeah, exactly. Microsoft is going to be one of the big reports that we are going to be watching very closely. The company is expected to post its flow of sales growth that we have seen since 2017, a weakening economy, obviously, a strong dollar there. Potentially hurting the numbers that we're going to get from Microsoft Alphabet is also going to be in focus. Keybank cutting its price target on at the stock. I had these results. Exciting some skepticism of revenue growth, also the mounting concern out there about a downturn and what exactly that will mean for Alphabet over the coming quarters. Rate of growth is going to be something that the street is watching very closely advertisers pulling back on spending. We saw that in SNAPs report just last week. So I think the attention is really going to be on Alphabet in particular and also meta tomorrow to see if that slowdown also translated to those two companies. I have to imagine meta has more of a SNAP problem than, of course, Alphabet. Search seems to be holding up pretty strong in this environment. Interesting ahead of these earnings to see the NASDAQ holding on so strong. Coming up, we're counting down to the closing bill on Wall Street, stay with us right here, on Yahoo Finance Line.到了",https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LuX9IXzHLV4,83,2022-10-25 19:58:33

And let's take a look at our some of our leaders today, cannabis stocks, that is MJ. That ETF is up over 8.5% followed by ARC, followed by meme stocks, IPOs, solar, home builders, retail, internet stocks, all of those really in the leadership position. You can get a pretty good picture here of what's going on by just looking at our meme stock board. We've seen this picture before at the beginning of some of these big flashy bear market rallies. We see a lot of movement into some of these fringe markets. Could be what we're seeing here again today. We'll check out the EV space, Tesla getting a lot of love. That's up 5% Elon Musk expected to close that transaction with Twitter on Friday going to cost him a lot, but hopefully he's done selling Tesla shares in order to cover that transaction cost. Also, God just got a tweet from somebody at Bloomberg that says that Elon Musk's personal is going to help sell some of that bank debt that they are taking on in order. So nice guy there. Let's take a look at the bank stocks. We see those largely in the green. Energy has been flagging a bit today. Mix picture here. Here's your closing bell on Wall Street. Markets. What you got to like with you seeing on the board, the Dow up 337 points on track for his best month since 2020, go figure up 337 points in the day and the S&P. We've been strong for the last seven days now. 62 points up 1.6%. The NASDAQ ahead of, excuse me, Alphabet and the Microsoft earning, surging 2.2% 246 points. We will bring you those earnings as they come in. But first, let's bring in Keith Loner, true as Co-Chief Investment Officer, and Chris Constantino's Riverfront Investment Group Chief Investment Officer. Nice to see you both, Keith. Let's start with you. What do you make of this continued rally? Well, first, great to be with you as always. Our view is heading into October. This market was the most oversold since the June lows. And we've been looking for relief. So I think what we're seeing here is some relief from an oversold condition, position in his light, as you head into a seasonal period. Now think about it, David, if you, we've had a really tough year. And if you're a money manager going into the end of the year, and you miss out on a fourth quarter rally, that's not acceptable. So I think just some anxiety. But our picture view hasn't really changed. Even though we've been expecting some type of rally here, we think the next 6-12 months are still more challenging. And as we move up to say 4,141 on the S&P, for those investors that are overweight risk, we would use that as an opportunity to become more defensive. Chris, what do you think, do you agree? Chris, Chris. Lead and hold off tema.",https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LuX9IXzHLV4,84,2022-10-25 20:03:16
4103," Chris, what do you think? Do you agree? I don't know. It's not that it happened to Chris. Chris, can you hear us? I lost you guys there for a second, but you're back now. I'm sorry. Yeah, I was just jumping in. I was asking you just what you make of the rally that we've seen over the last three days. The gains really that we've seen over the last month or so. Does that do you think have staying power? Yeah. And also, thanks for having me. I have to say I agree with Keith here that one of the histories of bear markets, if you study them going back 30, 40, 50 years is generally in a prolonged bear market. You have pretty dramatic bear market rallies and they can be pretty frequent. And I think we experienced one from mid June to August. And we're probably getting another one now. Doesn't mean it doesn't isn't going to have staying power and doesn't mean it can't persist for some time. But color me a little bit skeptical that the overall complexion of this market has changed meaningfully. Because at the end of the day, the fed put is pretty much gone in our opinion. And the Federal Reserve has to prioritize getting inflation under control over pretty much everything else, including protecting the wealth of fact. Chris, what is your expectation that the next two fed meetings? I think they have to continue to walk the tightrope that they've been walking, right? I think it's they have to talk really tough on inflation because at the end of the day, I think that Chairman Powell wants to go down in history as the fed chairman that allowed the inflation genie out of the bottle 1970 style. So you have history working against in there in order, you know, so I think he has to stay pretty aggressive, pretty hawkish tone. But you want to, if I'm a fed chairman, you also want to keep the door open for, you know, for the chance you might overshoot in the financial conditions might tighten too much and you have to back off the fierce rhetoric. So they're going to have to walk that tightrope, but I expect, I mean, 75 basis points, I think are in the bag. And I think you have to expect between 50 and 75 the next one after that. At the end of the day, that is nothing even approximating an easy monetary policy. And I think we have to keep that in mind. Keith, what's your assessment of how much headway the fed has made up into this point? Well, they've had the most aggressive tightening policy in about 40 years. The issue is, you know, they started ultra loose. So, you know, they've been playing catch up the whole time. So I think they've come a long way. But, you know, if you think about it, I point of view is similar and so far as that we think the fed has caught issue now because of this inflation. That's happened the last year. So they're likely, you know, the best we can hope for is that they move rates up, you know, 75 basis points, maybe 50 or 75 and then hold them there. And the other one to point out is, you know, there's a part of this rally is an energized by what happened on Friday. Some, you know, speak that maybe the fed's going to become less aggressive. Well, our view is that would sparkle rally. But if you go back to 2000, 2007, again, we're not saying this is the same environment. Just because the fed's cutting rates doesn't mean that the market rally will be sustainable. A big, you know, a big point of view has to come down to whether we see recession or not. So I still think recession risk in 2023 is relatively high, especially when you look at the inverted yield curve leading economic indicators down for six months. Housing is the business cycle. Housing is soft and quite a bit. And even if we sidestep a recession, we just think at, you know, at 16 times earnings today on earnings that likely have downside pressure that the upside is likely capped around the 17 multiples. You know, five or 10% upside from here is likely the cap. So I trust even if we have a kind of a, you know, a soft land in which is not a base case, we think the upside for the market is somewhat capsule. You just have to be more tactical in this environment in our view. And that's what we've been doing this year. Chris, can we avoid a recession in your thoughts on Jamie Diamond over at the Davos in the desert in Saudi Arabia saying he's less concerned about a potential recession than he is about geopolitical events most notably the Russia Ukraine war. And of course, US China relations. Sure. So whether we can avoid a recession or not, the thing I'm really mostly focused on is corporate earnings. And if you look at the 1970s, what was kind of fascinating about the 70s is you had three or four recessions between the early 70s and the early 80s. But corporate earnings pullbacks during those recessions and nominal terms actually wasn't they weren't that dramatic. Nothing approximating the kind of earnings collapse who had in 2008 or even the brief one we had in 2020.",https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LuX9IXzHLV4,85,2022-10-25 20:06:57
4104," for earnings pullbacks during those recessions and nominal terms actually wasn't, they weren't that dramatic. Nothing approximating the kind of earnings collapse we had in 2008 or even the brief one we had in 2020. So what we may end up with is some sort of mild recession where corporate earnings stay a little bit more resilient than we're used to in the recessions of the past 20 years. And that's probably the most optimistic way you could see the market shaping up and how you might guess that some are between here and 10 percentage points lower than here is probably a pretty big longer term buying opportunity for the market. And that's about as optimistic as I can sound right now. We are, as Keith mentioned, we're in a very similar position that we've been very tactical this year. We are in risk management mode. We are underweight equities. But that is the way that I could see this shaping up without having to go through a prolonged 40% plus down two-year type of bear market like we saw on O8. To your question on geopolitics, I think geopolitics are filtering into the story around recession, story around corporate earnings, right? For me, the two geopolitical hotspots here, we have a hot war in Europe, which is contributing to the inflationary pressures the Fed's trying to fight. And that's not good for the market. And then the second piece of this is the cold war we have between the China and US, which in my eyes is only intensifying with the rhetoric coming out of China that we saw from the Communist Party Congress earlier this week. So those two pieces together have real market implications. And neither one of those is potentially a really great setup for the market. All right, we have to leave it there. Chris Kahn's and Tinos and Kepler and thanks so much for joining us. We have some breaking news. Microsoft earnings are out. Dan Halley has a number to say, Dan. That's right, Toronto. We saw a beat for the top M bottom line here for Microsoft revenue came in at 50.1 billion versus 49.6 billion expected. We saw earnings per share of $2.35 versus $2.29 expected. We also saw beats in the productivity business and processes, a in line with the intelligent cloud business. And then we also saw more personal computing actually beat with 13.33 billion in revenue. That was compared to 13.1 billion in revenue that was expected. This all comes as we've seen a collapse in the spending on DCs across the spectrum. We've seen Intel obviously struck by this, AMD struck by this in video struck by this cloud spending, though, for Microsoft was at 20% growth in Q1. That is a drop from 31% growth in Q1 last year. And we've seen that kind of continue to fall. It was 31% in Q1 2022. This is their fiscal Q1, obviously. 26% in the Q2 and Q3 and then down to 20% growth in Q4. So we're seeing that kind of growth really kind of continuing to fall year over year and staying stable, quarter over quarter, but a little bit lower than prior quarters for Microsoft there. So the cloud business doing all right, but not having that kind of growth that people are expecting. And as a result, we're seeing shares down around 1.5%. Yeah, as your revenue growth, Dan, 35% in the most recent quarter, that was compared to 40% growth in the previous quarter. Taking look though at the headline numbers, EPS and revenue, both beating the streets estimates day 50.1 billion on revenue, 235 on EPS, but cloud, it was a focus going into these results. And obviously the focus here and the big reason, like Dan said, why shares are falling that miss in terms of what the street was looking for when it comes to cloud is what's weighing on shares right now. Yeah, the big surprise there. We certainly all expected that to be strength leading strength there with the Erzur, but not the case. PC sales have been overall just a bit of a headwind there down 18%. And it's really surprising, I think, especially when we're going to get to Alphabet here in a moment, but surprising considering what we're seeing for them versus expectations. The strength of the dollar will be interesting to hear the commentary on the call to hear how the strength of the dollar did impact their overall numbers. We do have a quote from Sundar Pinchai, the CEO of, oh, that's no, we're going to get that from Alphabet here coming up after we get to Jared Blicker. So let's go ahead and do that.

You know, taking a look at some of these numbers here, restaurants that the company opened during the most recent quarter, 43 new locations, all but five, including a Chipotle, that's dry through lanes, reserved for the digital order pickup, which is becoming a larger part of the business for the fourth quarter, Chipotle predicting same store sales growth in mid to high single digits, like I said before. But by the end of 2022, it's forecasting that's going to open between 235 to 250 new restaurants by the end of the year. For next year, the company projecting to open another 255 to 285 new locations there. So I also want to point out Chipotle's board approving an additional 200 million to buy back. To buy back its shares here. Again, the stock moving higher after hours, Dave, shares up just around 3%. We want to go get more on alphabet earnings. Take a look at how the stock is reacting shares. Still off, I think, after hours we want to bring in Ali Moghrabi. His morning starts senior equity analyst. And Ali, when you take a look at alphabet shares here, off just around a 5%, what do you make of this report? Yeah, it's to a certain extent. It was disappointing. What I would point to is mainly the YouTube ad revenues. It was actually a decline year of year. Part of that, of course, was the foreign currency headwinds or foreign exchange headwinds. But that's a little bit disappointing. On the bright side, of course, the cloud side of the business is doing very, very well. Their rate of growth, I think, was a little bit higher than what Microsoft reported earlier. So I think what you're basically seeing is with the economic downturn, a lot of advertisers are becoming more hesitant. They're maybe holding back a little bit of their head spending, but at the same time, even during an economic downturn, you're seeing the importance of that digital transition, of that cloud migration, which continues to happen, from which, of course, we've seen Microsoft and Google up to now benefit. What's your reaction to the cloud number? I think it was pretty impressive. I think the market had expected a little bit more of a slowdown in terms of the growth, but the growth was still very, very strong. And again, as I said before, I think what that really indicates is that even within an economic downturn, possibly coming along, the businesses continue to see the long-term cost savings, which with regards to migrating to the cloud. Holly, when you take a look at some of the comments here from Asun Dupertai in this report, working to realign resources to high growth, sharpening focus on a clear set of priorities to you, what do those priorities include? I think it includes further monetization or more effective monetization of YouTube. They've launched YouTube shorts, and some of those viewing numbers are actually pretty impressive. But in terms of attracting the advertisers to that at inventory that YouTube shorts continues to increase, or I should say, create, they're probably having a little bit of difficulty on that front. So I think what they need to focus on or what they are probably planning to focus on is the main side of the business, which is advertising. Let's monetize the huge user base that we have, even more effectively. Search, of course, continues to do well, so that's not an issue. And in the other one, of course, is let's continue to diversify our business as consistent land as effectively as we have last few years, which is push for further cloud business growth and continue to attract enterprises onto the platform. Sounded talked about what Sundar Pinchai said today, but rewinding back to what he said about a month ago about the company need to become 20% more productive, kind of looms over this report. How do they get there? Yeah, I think a few ways. One, of course, is to slow down increase in that headcount. They have another one is which we've seen historically with a lot of technology companies. One thing to keep in mind is that the technology industry is very disruptive. So companies that continue to dominate.",https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LuX9IXzHLV4,89,2022-10-25 20:24:15
4108," We have a lot of technology companies. One thing to keep in mind is that the technology industry is very disruptive. So companies that continue to dominate the markets that they're in, such as an alphabet or a Google, still need to invest in innovation coming up with new ideas, possibly new business models. So I think one part of this change in strategy would be, let's, again, as I mentioned before, focus more on what is currently working and what we're ahead of, which is the advertising side and business and, of course, the cloud side. So you could see less R&D on innovation or on products and or business models that probably will be generating revenue nor, of course, within the next five to seven years. So taking those steps, I think, will allow them to operate a lot more efficiently and, of course, will necessary push them to continue to increase take count at the rates they have during the last five years. So, Lee, here we are after hours of stock and out trading right around a 98-14, if it does, in fact, open where we are trading after these results. You have a fair value on the stock at 169. What needs to happen in order for Wall Street to get more on board here with Alphabet's new vision? Well, it's, I think for Alphabet specifically, it's more of a macro issue. So again, as I mentioned, the economic downturn is impacting at, at spending overall. And of course, these days, most of it is digital at spending. So I think this problem, this name requires a lot of bit of patience. But in terms of, you know, remaining a cash gap continue to remain profitable. And of course, making headway on the B2B side of the business, which is cloud, I think they continue to do very, very well. Questions for the call if you had one? Sure. What I would ask is that is what I would be interested in is, is YouTube shorts actually impacting engagement time on regular YouTube? And the reason I'm asking that is because management of snaps at that earlier last week. So it would be interesting. And if that's the case, then we should expect Google to even more aggressively try to monetize YouTube shorts and or of course, sell the ad impressions that they continue to generate. And we, I knew you mentioned some of those macroeconomic headwinds here, a strong dollar. We've heard that from a number of companies here, how big of a headwind do you think this is specifically for alphabet? For the short to, for the short to medium term, it is a headwind. I mean, there's no question. Again, ad spending is dependent on overall economic growth. But in the long term, as we see turn around in the economy, I think these guys will be back on track and will continue to lead the way when it comes to digital ad spending. All right, Ali Mourabi, always great to have you. Thanks so much for having me here for instant reaction and alphabet shares off just around a 6%. Coming up next, Chipotle's stock, moving to the upside here after the strong results that we just got from the company shares up, 3.6% will get an analyst take on the numbers that we're getting when we come back. Do do do or do what we said, That's. I'm going to do a little bit of the same. I'm going to do a little bit of the same. I'm going to do a little bit of the same. I'm going to do a little bit of the same. I'm going to do a little bit of the same.",https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LuX9IXzHLV4,90,2022-10-25 20:28:39
4109,"'t All right, back with another earnings alert. You see shares of Chipotle up almost 4% on their Q3 earnings earnings per share, 951 versus 921 expected revenue, 2.22 billion narrow mists from the 2.23 billion expected net income, 257 million up from 204 million a year earlier, same store sales, up 7.6%. Let's take a deeper dive into these Chipotle numbers. Let's bring in Morningstar Equity, analyst John Dunlop. Yahoo, finances, Rook Depauma's here with us as well. Nice to see you both, so Sean, your reaction to the numbers. Yeah, I think broadly positive. You know, clocked in more or less on the money with sales a little bit ahead of us on EPS. And it's starting to look like it may be time to call the bottom on restaurant margins. The company is being able to price through, you know, mid-single digit to high-single digit on pricing. You saw Comp Sales clock in at 7.6%. So even as we're starting to see a bit of a traffic return to the office, the company didn't see a massive drop-off in traffic, which is encouraging. On the development side, 43 net new units maintained guidance for the year, and it looks like 8.5% or so at the midpoint for next year. So I'd say net positive all around. And let's take a step back. Morningstar highlighted that Chipotle was one of the best recession performers. Back in 0809, here we're seeing shares rising in after hours training, the CEO noting consumer discretionary spending tightening a bit. But do you think Chipotle ultimately stands as a recession-proof stock once again here? Yeah, recession-proof might be a little bit of a misnomer, but it's certainly recession-resistant. And I think what you see is a lot of consumers that might trade out of higher-priced full-service menus will trade down into fast-casual or QSR-plus, which is sort of that niche that Chipotle sits in. So even though they'll have a subset of consumers that may trade towards relative value, like a QSR pizza or like McDonald's, you've got another subset that's stringed back down into the category. So net net then ended up being a lot less sensitive than you would think at first blush. And one thing that really drove this quarter ultimately was those higher prices. In August, they took higher pricing for the third time in 15 months. Do you see that continuing higher prices continuing to the end of the year? And how do you see the consumer willing to put up with those higher prices at a fast-casual chain, like Chipotle? Hi. Yeah, it's a great question. So I believe that took price in the middle of August. And that was the last planned price increase for the year, but you're still looking at ballpark 8 to 9 percent price in that fourth quarter. And as you hold that against guidance for comparable store sales, you can see that the implication is that traffic and average check combined are probably about flat. So there's sort of two levers there. One, you're seeing a return to sort of downtown urban markets, which means that you're seeing a lot more single-on-trade orders. And that's going to pull your average check down. The good news is that means that traffic may continue to be positive in terms of total transaction counts. So net net, the consumer continues to bear it, but definitely something that we're monitoring as we move forward.",https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LuX9IXzHLV4,91,2022-10-25 20:33:09
4110," news is that means that traffic may continue to be positive in terms of total transaction counts. So net net, the consumer continues to bear it, but definitely something that we're monitoring as we move forward. What is your reaction to digital sales? And is there any surprise to the downside in this report to you? Yes, digital sales, obviously, declined a little bit on a linked quarter basis. We're down around 37% from I believe 39% last quarter. That's not totally unusual. About 20% of Chipotle's sale makes ties to delivery sales to higher cost channel and a lot of the time those customers trade out of the category entirely rather than down the menu. So we actually we saw that we saw similar results with dominos earnings a couple of weeks ago. And also I want to highlight when we spoke to Chipotle CEO last week, we also touched on that fast act recovery act that's happening over in California that could impact higher wages, expansion in California. How do you think that sort of plays in after seeing these results in Chipotle's expansion plans and also on that hourly wage? Yeah, two really good questions. It's the fast act. You're talking about about a $22 wage floor and of our publicly traded restaurant company, Chipotle is the most exposed one because they own their own restaurant units. It's not really a franchise concept. And then two because 15 to 20% of the unit count sits in California. So historically there's not really been a close tie between average wages and restaurant profitability. But the problem is that restaurants are so much more dependent on hourly labor relative to grocery stores or sea stores that we may start to see a little bit of a mixed shift that that's the real issue with the fast act. So I've sitting that a little bit on the growth narrative side. It's nice to see the success we've seen in rural areas. Hopefully the firm's able to lean into that a little bit and defray some of the explosive pressure there. For 2023 they're projecting 255 to 285 new location openings back to Brooks question. Do you think paying that additional labor charging California could hamper those expansion plans? Yeah we certainly haven't modeled in yet and we haven't heard anything from restaurants themselves. But it would make sense all else equally. You've got higher labor costs. You've got soft unit economics that the payback periods would lengthen and maybe it would be more appropriate to look for investments outside of that market. Really with the fast act the long-term implication for investors ties to more if that happens anywhere else. If we see that sectoral bargaining extend beyond California to maybe in Illinois or in Oregon or some of the more progressive states. They're betting big on Chipotle's here. We saw 43 new restaurants, 38 locations including a Chipotle. You highlighted in your note that those ultimately drive higher sales. Are you encouraged that most of these new units include that drive through? And do you think that term Chipotle is really sticking here? Yeah it's a good question and I think they would shy away from using the term drive through because they actually have certain zoning restrictions that are tied to those drive through units that Chipotle is trying to circumvent. So it lets you put in what's tantamount to a drive through in a lot of pads that wouldn't necessarily permit that otherwise. Basically the thrust you know 88% of net new units had Chipotle in this quarter. The economics are better. They do about 10 to 15% more sales. You have a higher volume of digital sales, about 50 to 55% relative to 40 to 45% for a normal unit. And then those those tend to be the highest profit margin sales those order ahead and pick up in store sales. So what's not to like I guess you come right down to it. The cash and cash returns are about 60 to 65%. Meaning you get your money out of those in less than two years. Still never seen at Chipotle in myself broke. I don't know about Sean. I go to there all the time. Never seen it. Sean I know you got a jump to the call but what do you want to hear on this call coming up? Yeah I'd like to hear the reiterate that commitment to unit growth for the longer term. I've got that 8 to 8% to 10% annual target. And then I'd also like a little bit more color about what drove sort of the the flat price mix and traffic because if it is traffic then you start to see a little bit of concern with consumer trade down. Indeed good stuff Sean. Dunlap appreciate you being here. Brooke DiPoma as well. Thank you both. Alright coming up Microsoft is moving to the downside just more than 2% after its Q3 earnings we'll take a closer look at what's driving it down after the break.",https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LuX9IXzHLV4,92,2022-10-25 20:37:17
4111," music the market. Let's take a look at Microsoft. Look at that shares of a 2% right now despite beating on both the top and bottom lines here to break this down. We want to bring in Rishi, Julia, RBC capital markets, software equity analysts. Rishi, it's great to see you so that softer cloud revenue really seems to be weighing on shares. What's your take away from the results that we're getting this afternoon? Yeah, and always great to be back here. Look, I think that's your absolute right. That's what's driving on the cloud. I think that's what we're getting this afternoon. We're getting this down a little bit. You know, there were worries heading to the quarter on PC weakness and stuff, but really, especially in earnings, this name is driven by the cloud number and very specifically Azure. And I look Azure came maybe about a point light of where, you know, the company had guided last quarter. And so I think people are looking at that. People are looking at commercial bookings and kind of expecting things to slow down further from here. Now, the tone on this name could turn in on a dime. So, it's a little bit more about the number of sales that you're going to get. And so they provide guidance that talks about better Azure growth for next quarter. But right now, because Azure was a little bit light, I think that's what's driving the stock down in the aftermarket, in spite of the top line and bottom line beats. And what you read into the how much the PC sales impacted earnings? Yeah, I think that was probably where the gross margins were a little light was because of the weak PC sales because remember, with PC sales, windows OEM is a big driver that's a very high gross value for the PC sales. And we've all seen the data points to it. That's probably what drove the miss on the gross margins. Now, I think it was really encouraging that their operating margins were kind of in line and at a good place. And, again, we got the EPS because gross margins were a little light. I think that's directly attributable to the windows OEM. When you take a look at this demand for the cloud computing business, really starting to taper, I mentioned the fact that Azure here, cloud services revenue, growth of 35% compared to 40% growth in the previous quarter, what do you think Microsoft needs to do in the future?",https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LuX9IXzHLV4,93,2022-10-25 20:42:17
4112," the fact that Azure here, cloud services revenue, growth of 35% compared to 40% growth in the previous quarter. What do you think Microsoft needs to do in order to maybe get back some of the momentum? Or will we maybe never see that 40 to 50% growth that we have become accustomed to? Yeah, I don't want to say never, but I think the fact of the matter is we are heading into whether we want to call it a recession or not. We're heading into a softer or tighter macro environment where you're going to hear this on the call, you hear this from all the software vendors. There's just more layers of approval to making buying decisions. Azure, remember, is primarily on a consumption model and consumption models are where the slowdown is going to show up first, rather than your typical kind of seat based subscription model. So I think because the macro is deteriorating, I think that is going to continue to weigh on Azure numbers going forward. I also think as we kind of get visibility into an economic recovery, we're going to see Azure maybe even reaccelerate coming out of that. So I don't want to say that that 40% type growth number is off the table, right? And Azure still grew 42% constant currency, right? Like, remember, we got to consider the foreign currency headwinds here. So 42% is still pretty healthy growth. I just don't want to say that number continue to decelerate too much. To that point, how much does the strength of the dollar impact the report today? Yeah, it was about a 5% headwind growth, right? Which was kind of in line with how they talked about, you know, with the name, it's not surprising. The US dollar is going to continue to get stronger, especially if you look at what's going on in the macro picture in Europe in the UK, in Australia, in Japan. So I think currency will continue to be a weight on everything. I think the good news though is investors by now have gotten conditioned to look at everything on a constant currency basis, right? Strip out the impact of a strong dollar or maybe in the future, a weak dollar and look at kind of what is going on with the underlying business. Frisci, when you take a look at the revenue from sales of Windows licenses, dropping 15% year over year worse. And that outlook that we initially got from Microsoft, what do you make of the significance of that drop? Yeah, I mean, to me, the big significance is just it's a matter of the weak PC demand, right? And that's not a surprise. Part of it is, remember, you had strong device demand as a result of COVID and the initial outlay of work from home. At some point, we knew that was going to fade. So I think we're starting to see the impact of that as well as just, you know, tightening of IT budgets. There's also the impact of, you know, even though we're at full employment, we know headcount growth is definitely starting to slow down if we look at the public job posting data, especially at tech companies. Not to mention there are some with actual layoffs going on. So I think that's what's contributing to that and why we're seeing weak PC data and it flows through to the, you know, Windows OEM business. And again, that's just hits on the gross mark inside. But, you know, ultimately, the strength of Microsoft is, I think, really going to be driven by the cloud computing. And so as long as Azure continues to put up good numbers as long as office continues to put up good numbers, I think this name can hold in well. Well, you want to hear what's the one thing you're looking for to hearing about more on the call? Yeah, to me, the one thing I want to point to or what I want to hear is they continue to strengthen Azure, right? Because that's where all the fears are is that Azure on this consumption model is going to slow down further from here. If, you know, sat the on Amy, get on the call and talk about Azure being more resilient than people expect and give a guidance that, you know, starts at the forehandle for Azure for next quarter on a constant currency basis. I think that would, that would make me very happy. If I were an investor, I think I would be very pleased with that. Appreciate you taking a look at the performance so far this year, Microsoft of 26% comparing that to the S&P, which is off between 19 and 20%. What's it going to take to turn it around? Because like you said before, the macroeconomic headwinds here is proving very challenging, not only for Microsoft, but obviously for a number of its competitors as well. Yeah, and, and, and you bring up a great point, which is we actually think, and this is one of the reasons Microsoft is one of our top picks to be defensive in this environment, is we think Microsoft can actually consolidate budgets, right? There's going to be a lot of point solution vendors beat on the productivity side or insecurity where Microsoft can really consolidate budget and actually emerge stronger coming out of the recession than they've been right now. But in terms of what it takes, I think two things need to happen. Number one, investors need to gain confidence that, you know, numbers aren't going any lower.",https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LuX9IXzHLV4,94,2022-10-25 20:46:02
4113," out of the recession than they've been right now. But in terms of what it takes, I think two things need to happen. Number one, investors need to gain confidence that numbers aren't going any lower, which is obviously a tricky balancing act. And I think number two is interest rates are still impacting everything in software and really everything in tech. And so when we get to a point where interest rates kind of plateau and we know interest rates are gonna keep going up 50, 7,500 Bips, I think that could be really when Microsoft starts to work. All right, good stuff. We'll have to leave it there, Rishi Jalori. I appreciate you being here. Thank you. All right, take a look at shares of Warner Brothers Discovery down less than 1%.

That's meant the street was for 7.4 billion. Off nearly 6% after hours year to date shares off 27%. Moving on to Microsoft, that stock under pressure as well, despite beating on the top and bottom lines. What Wall Street is focused on is that cloud revenue growth that disappointed during the quarter that suffered an expected cloud revenue weighing on shares here. Azure revenue growth of 35% was down from 40% in the previous quarter. Taking a look at the intelligent cloud business overall revenue there. Tilling 20.3 billion Microsoft shares off nearly 1.7% now in extent to trading year to date off 25%. Taking a look at Spotify, you see shares selling off there after hours weaker than expected forecast. For fourth quarter growth margin, that's what's weighing on the stock was shares off just around 6% third quarter numbers revenue coming in line 21% growth on year over year basis. A monthly active users a key number here 456 million that's up 20% year over year and better than expected despite that though. Stock off a 6% over the past three months you're looking at a drop of just around 12% year to date. Let's pull it up there off 58% taking a look at Mattela another decline here after hours shares off nearly a 5% lower full year profit guidance larger hit from the stronger dollar that is weighing on the stock here for a third quarter sales or flat profit also decline concerning here as we head into the very important as we are in the very important a holiday sales period. Look at year to date stock off just around 8% comparing that to the broader market Mattela is actually fair relatively well and rounding out with Texas instruments here you see the stock off just around 5% fourth quarter revenue and EPS guidance coming in light the company saying that they see weakness brought into the industrial market they expect most markets to decline sequentially there obviously that's reflected in the after hours move inventory below desire level also see order cancellations increasing during the current quarter taking look year to date Texas instruments off just around 14% extended trading after these numbers broke shares off about 5% day lot of losses here across the board.

4115," Inflation is already hit your grocery list and certainly your gas tank and with Halloween less than a week out, candy prices are now equally frightening. According to data company Clover, many of your favorite Halloween classics are up well more than 10% this year, Reese's peanut butter cups. The goat, we're up 14% this year, or Hershey's bar is up 15%. Bag of skittles up 10% kind of chocolate eggs are up 16% and twizzlers up 9% shrink flation. And also part of the equation as well with manufacturers downsizing products as ingredients, labor and transportation costs of skyrocketed. In this case, look, they could probably get a lot of pricing power here. Those are inflation recession proof. We're going to pay whatever they do. Yeah, exactly. I don't think people have a lot of choice, especially if you want trick or treaters for Halloween, if it's not just for yourself, if you're looking to give it out, you have to pay or you're more inclined to pay, I think those higher prices. We take a look at the overall spending that we're expected to see on candy this Halloween. It's expected to reach an all time high, a 3.1 billion we've talked about in the past, a record 10.6 billion dollars could potentially be spent on Halloween this year. Davey mentioned peanut butter cups as the goat greatest of all time. I do agree with you on that number two. We can agree on that. Across the US, the second favorite and you agree and we also agree with the rest of America. I came in at number one. Second top favorite Skittles, M&Ms at three hot tamales though. Number five kind of took me a little bit by surprise when we take a look at these types of prices here, more and more expensive. Maybe people aren't going to be curtailing their spending as we head into Halloween. Post Halloween though, we could potentially see a big drop in candy sales. The real test is what do you hand out? Do you go full size? Because I know Halloween is big in your hood. It is really big in my hood. You know, yeah, my husband will probably want to get out the full size candy bars knowing him. I'm probably going to have to rain it in just a little bit, especially with these prices. It's not the most financial sound advice, you know. Yes, we're always out trick-or-treat. We leave out the bucket, the first two kids show up, they empty it into their bag and... And it's all downhill from there. All right, well that does it for us today. I'm Yahoo Finance Live.

Yeah, we shall see. Alright, Chipotle is out with an earnings beat, but also with a warning about store traffic and we'll dig into the results which Chipotle CFO jack heart on next. Ah smells so good in times of looking at minds. And those people don't care so much. And just the way it is. bullying is out with an earnings beat as its higher income clientele was able to absorb higher prices for burritos and burrito bowls. The company did warn on two fronts. Store traffic and spending trends among lower income consumers. Chipotle, CFO, Jack Hartung joins us now to discuss. Jack, always nice to see you. On the conference call last night, I thought you guys were defending the price increases that you have pushed through noting the high big portion sizes and what you do in terms of cutting ingredients. Do you think, or are you just concerned about some of the price points on some of the products now? No, you don't probably. We watch this very, very closely. When we've raised prices over the last couple of years, and let's face it, it's been a high inflationary period. It's been the highest inflation I've seen in my entire career. When we take prices, we've looked at a number of things. We look at what our competitors are charging. We look at what happened the last time we took a price increase, and are we seeing any evidence that customers are either trading down or if they're reducing their transactions. Everything we see looks good. I know this is an environment where we have macro challenges. We talked about on the call that we do have some of our lower income consumers. Are appearing back on their dining out experiences, including at Chicole, but our higher income customers are actually coming more often. We're not seeing any kind of change in their behavior based on any of the pricing action that we've taken over the last year and a half. Jack, you know what I mean? I go to Chipotle all the time, but are you concerned that a portion of the",https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hqIy-Q36neE,1,2022-10-26 13:49:01
4121," behavior based on any of the pricing action that we've taken over the last year and a half. Jack, you know, you know me, I go to Chipotle all the time, but are you concerned that, you know, a portion of the US is getting shut out of that really good Chipotle experience? And that now maybe you need to touch that third rail and do a value meal or maybe cut the bull in half and do $5 bull to get consumers in. Yeah, you know, we had this exact discussion the last time during the Great Recession where we saw consumers did start to, you know, reduce their dining experiences. And with Chipotle, during that time, even though our comms held up better than every other restaurant company, we stayed positive throughout that entire time. Our transactions were actually slightly negative, but negative. So we did see some transactions actually dip. As the recession was starting to end, our transactions came roaring back and we had double digit comms from there. So we've seen this before and during that time, we did talk about should we offer value meals? Should we offer a bundled meal where the consumers can eat for at the time it was less than $5. Our customers said, great idea. Go ahead and do it. And then when we tested it in restaurants, nobody bought it because everyone said, well, I love my chicken bredo. So I'm coming from my chicken bredo or my steak bredo. So we don't think Chipotle is the brand that somebody's looking for a dollar menu or a bundled meal. They come to look for customization, real culinary, and they create the food that most customers get the same exact on-treat every single time. And that's what they crave. And so, and when we look at our chicken bredo, which is what more than half of our customers get compared to competitors, we're under $9 for chicken bredo. And when you get a chicken on-treat at other fast casuals, you can't find any for under $10 and typically it's in that $11 to $13 range. So we still think we're at great value. Jack, what about the people that come to Chipotle for lunch particularly? And when it relates to that traffic, how you're looking through where some of the office occupancy that still isn't at pre-pandemic levels and is still in some cases data from castles suggesting it's lower than 50% of that pre-pandemic level and really only expected to take up sometime in 2023. What would you be tracking with regard to the relation of return to work or return to office and how that plays out for Chipotle going into next year? Yeah, when we look at our urban restaurants and we've, urban restaurants are a relative minority of our entire portfolio of over 3000 restaurants. So we've got somewhere in that 100 to 150 restaurants that are true urban. When we look at that cohort compared to all of the restaurants, they've been outcompanying the rest of the system for the last year or year and a half or so. And that makes sense based on people are returning to the office. Now it's not all the way back, but I would say it's within kind of 10 or 15% in terms of where the urban restaurants are compared to non-urban. So it's not all the way back, but it's not, it's not like it's anywhere near. You mentioned that 50% occupancy. We're doing way better than that. Hey, Jack, it's Julie here. So transactions down by about 1% last quarter. Do you have any sense of what that number could be this quarter? And I guess I'm trying to get a feel for where you think we are in the cycle. We're all grappling this morning looking at big tech earnings about how much worse things could get from your perspective. How are you thinking about that question? Yeah, we have a unique challenge in the fourth quarter because we introduce as a limited time offer brisket last year in the fourth quarter. And it was highly, highly successful. So we're comparing against that very, very difficult comparison. So contributing to the quarter is it's going to be a little bit more negative transactions. We think it's going to move from the 1% down that you mentioned in the third quarter to somewhere in the low to maybe the mid-single digit, you know, transaction being down in the fourth quarter. But as we move away brisket, we actually could only secure enough supply to run that promotion through the middle. And I remember that's how successful it was. Once we get past that, we think that the comparison will get a little bit easier. But we do think from a macro standpoint that the lower end consumers are dining out less often. So we do think that that's going to be a challenge for not just to pollate, but I think the restaurant industry for probably the next few of net several quarters. Jack, I don't know if you can see, but my out-of-fiance team never sees it to amaze me. We have some of the photos. There I am right there about a week ago in the base short, Chipotle. I got my usual order that is all for me. Two bowls right there. I ordered the same thing last night. I went to pick it up $48.23. Now I could double me. I understand. But do you think you could put... Let's see some guac on there. There's a lot going on there. I get it. But do you think you could push through more?",https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hqIy-Q36neE,2,2022-10-26 13:53:05
4122, in twenty three cents and i get double me and i understand but do you think you can walk on their is not going on that i i get it but do you think you could push through more price uh... i'm still shopping in there i'm still going to polly but do you still have more room to push through more price increase in the fourth quarter next year you think i think we do brian win i mean listen to how many people eat like you do i think that tribute to i don't know if your exercise or team but the fact that you can eat two balls like that you look as good as you do i appreciate that's why we have to always have you but but i don't think we have room but we don't have any plans right now to raise prices again it depends on commodities but what i do know is that when we look at competitors others have raised prices to our last couple years so the gap in terms of value for to put the compared to the others still exist but right now if commodities behave themselves we don't have any plans to take any more price for a while okay and so in the near term then because you still got the affluent consumers are the people that are ordering double guac double meat like when you think about the ticket sizes that you're seeing is there there is zoomed in is there a material difference in ticket size even among the outsized affluent consumer that you're seeing make up the majority of the revenues right now it's it's not huge there there is like a mid-single to get difference it's a slight difference really the difference is and this is what tells us it's more about a macro it's not that people are resisting you know when we raise prices it's 4% on a eight or nine dollar breeder it's 30 40 cents so we don't think that consumers are affected by that 30 or 40 cents within consumers are deciding can i eat out at all or if i'm gonna eat out do i have to you know maybe go down to another class to traditional qsr because it's just a different category for them jack good to see you to pull at least a foe jack heart town talking us through the quarter and what's beyond thanks so much thank you guys well coming up political debates across the country continue with midterm elections around the corner Rick Newman is going to share the details next huh,https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hqIy-Q36neE,3,2022-10-26 13:57:37
4123," The midterm election is only weeks away and last night included some heated debates in both Pennsylvania and New York. Democrat John Federman and Republican Mehmet Oz clashed during a testy Pennsylvania Senate debate last night. The two disagreed over many issues including the economy and abortion. Young finances, Rig Newman joins us now with some of the takeaways. This is one of the, I think, one of the most watched races, right, around the country. What was your impression of the debate last night? One of the most watched races for two reasons. Number one, it could determine who controls the Senate, Republicans or Democrats, and also because of John Federman's health. He had a stroke earlier this year and I think a lot of people who watched last night just wanted to know how was he going to do? So mixed reviews on that. I watched it. I thought he held up pretty well and I know how draining an experience like that can be for somebody recovering from a stroke, but the reviews were pretty weak. He did stumble over words. He got some things wrong. Some of his responses just were not very well developed. But on the other hand, he was somewhat coherent. So the real question is, could this guy do the job if he gets elected to the Senate? And one of the most interesting things about this race Julie is going to be how much does his health actually factor in? Will voters in Pennsylvania will they will they be inclined to vote against him because of health concerns or will they say no, they don't really worry about that. So quite interesting. And as you mentioned, it did clash on the issues over abortion and fracking and some things like that. So very interesting race in Pennsylvania. Yeah, only one of them actually lives in Pennsylvania as well. So that's a great noting. Rick, additionally here, we know you're following the races in New York. What was taking place there on the debates? Well, that was the governor's race between Kathy, Hocal, the incumbent and Lee Zeldin, the Republican congressman who's challenging her. You would think Hocal is is a lot of a talk in this race, but this has also been tightening. Again, abortion was one of the big topics last night. So if Zeldin is able to to win and become a Republican governor, York, that would that would be an upset for sure. And if we were to see that, I mean, that would be indicative of a complete wipeout for Democrats. There is some new, there are some new forecasts suggesting that the Democrats are going to do better in the house than expected. The Cook Political Report, which is one of the top forecasters now saying they could pick up something like 25 seats or more in the house. That's up from their forecast, their prior forecast. So at the last minute here, things seem to be breaking in favor of Republicans. Y'all are finances on Rick Newman. Rick, thanks so much for breaking this all down. Get an eye on the political spectrum. Coming up, everyone, on the other side of this show, break chairs of Alphabet. They are lower by them. What is 7% right now? After YouTube revenue, took a hit in the third quarter, our VC Capital Brad Erickson joins us next to discuss. Peek Brad.",https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hqIy-Q36neE,4,2022-10-26 14:01:44
4124," MUSIC Welcome back to Y'all Finance. I'm Brian Sasi here with Julie Hyman and Brad Smith. Smith, mixed action in the markets on this Wednesday morning on the beak of back, beak, back of weakest earnings reports from tech giants, Google and Microsoft. At least right now we're pushing the dow up about 91 points, the S&P 500 Nazx slightly in the red. Here's what we have on tap for you this hour. The Google pullback, RBC's Brad Erickson, stops by for a take on Google's less than stunning quarter and outlook. And maybe not so playful holidays, but tell Surf's up a mixed outlook due to the economic slowdown, we'll chat shortly from Telsio, Inan Kriz. And the newest meme stock leader, Bed Bath Beyond, gets a new CEO, sort of, will have details. But first, over to Inez Faray, at the Wi-Fi Interactive. Inez? Yeah, Brian. And we're taking a look at new home sales for the month of September because we just got that data that came in. New home sales fell 10.9% to 603,000. That's an annualized rate. Now that did come in though higher than the expected that what economists had been expecting. Remember that in August, we saw a surprise to the upside for new home sales. September, though, was a month where you had the mortgage rates rising by more than 100 basis points. So that is expected to impact the slowing housing market. And why do we talk so much about the housing market? Well, because as housing goes, so does the economy. There are many jobs that are linked to the housing market. There are durable goods that are linked to this. Let's take a look at XHB. That is down 3 tens of a percent. But it had been down the home builder ETF. More than 1 percent before this data came out. But I just want to point out the year-to-date chart here. You can see the losses for the home improvement and home builders. Taking a look at where we're at with the sectors. We are seeing technology that is lower right now. We're also taking a look at consumer discretionary that's lower. And this has to do with big tech, which has been reporting, earnings started reporting, earnings yesterday with Microsoft and Google both down more than 7%. You've got meta, which will be reporting that's down 3%. And you've got Amazon down 4% guys. Yeah, finance is on a nest for a over there at the Wi-Fi Interactive. Thanks so much for tracking all that and that's appreciated. And everyone getting to some of those tech earnings that Annette's was mentioning. Let's give it off with Alphabet here. Missing Wall Street estimates for the third quarter as slow revenue growth and a dip in YouTube advertising. Wade on the search giant. But with its scale and diversified tech portfolio, is it positioned to weather disruption in the digital ad space? Joining us now to discuss and weigh in. We've got RBC capital markets, internet equity analysts Brad Erickson, pleasure to welcome another Brad into the chat here. So Brad, first and foremost, your takeaways from Alphabet here, especially considering some of the different parts of the business. I mean, this is still 7%.",https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hqIy-Q36neE,5,2022-10-26 14:06:16
4125," on the Brad into the chat here. So Brad, first and foremost, your takeaways from alphabet here, especially considering some of the different parts of the business. I mean, this is still 79% in advertising based business here. Yeah, that's right. And I'll do my best. Brian, I got to tell you, I'm still reeling from how on Earth you spend $48 at Chipotle. But let's not Google since that's what I'm here for. Yeah, it was a tough quarter all around. They missed top and bottom line relative to the street. And then I think the Q4 commentary was particularly ominous. They spoke to seeing a basically broader pullback in ad spending within that business. And then surprisingly, there's no layoffs at Google. Apparently, they're actually adding employees half the rate that they have been. So it's a little bit slower. But I think that caught people by surprise as well. And so you're seeing earnings estimates in particular come down enormously here this morning. And obviously reflecting that in the stock. I want to ask about YouTube in particular. Is there something that Google can be doing out that can be doing with YouTube that it's not doing? Or is it just sort of subject to competition from TikTok, for example, plus the macro environment? And are there more levers that can pull there? Yeah, I mean, I think there's a couple of drivers, right? First and foremost, YouTube, because it is a social platform and does rely on third party measurement through IDFA, right? It was exposed to the Apple downturn. So there's absolutely been headwinds there. And I think they've somewhat abated from a year over year perspective, meaning we've lapped them. But I think there's probably still a bit of leakage going on there. And then sure, competitively, we all know TikToks over the last year, too, has sucked a lot of the oxygen out of the room for those in the social space. And so one of the comments management made last night on the call was someone asked about whether the short form video that YouTube shorts increased usage if that was incremental to the YouTube or if it was a makeshift. And they kind of insinuated that it was a makeshift. And so that's your evidence that TikTok is continuing to have an effect on that business. Going forward, performance max is their product, which basically, if you don't know where to spend, be it search or YouTube or elsewhere, performance max is an AI tool that allocates your spend automatically. We do think that's going to be super important as they start layering spend into YouTube shorts. YouTube ad spend, I'm a monetization in YouTube shorts. But that's still early days. And so that's probably not going to show up in the numbers till next year. Brad, how severe do you think these cost cuts will be at alphabet? Well, to date, I mean, like I said earlier, we're not really seeing evidence, at least, directionally of cost cuts, right? Like they said, they're going to, from a net ad perspective for headcount, they're going to cut that in half. But that means they're still adding roughly 6,000 employees quarter of a quarter, which is a lot of heads. I think as we get through to next year, the CEO kind of reiterates some other comments previously around trying to squeeze out more efficiency on a per head count basis. So clearly they're pointing to more cost efficiencies there. But yeah, I think people are a little concerned that, hey, these guys are seeing a downturn. They're speaking to it qualitatively here going forward. And that's not being reflected in the cost base. Now, flip that. Maybe let's just take devil's advocate for a second and say that's positive. It could reinforce the view that maybe Google is just viewing this as a temporary transitory type of thing. A lot of confidence in the business longer term and they don't need to go there. So you could argue it both ways, but certainly for today and where margin estimates are going, it's a negative. And on the hardware side, it doesn't seem like they could even afford to lose out on an install base that they would see come in from the number of phone devices or smartphone or handheld devices, even with a waiting PC market, even with some of the slowdowns and add, it seems like they would need to continue to produce regardless of what the margins would look like on that side of the business. Yeah, I mean, hard.",https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hqIy-Q36neE,6,2022-10-26 14:10:23
4126," It seems like they would need to continue to produce, regardless of what the margins would look like on that side of the business. Yeah, I mean, hardware is obviously a tertiary part of this model, but it certainly popped up, or flared up, I should say a little more in the core, with the launch of the Pixel 6A. Obviously that has a normal cost of billi-materials and gross margin profile for hardware product, which is substantially below the ad revenues. And so that weighed on the model to some degree in the quarter, but I don't expect that to be sort of a sustained headwind as we move forward here. So. RBC Capital Partners, Internet, Equity, Analyst, Brad, Ericsson, good to see you. We'll talk to you soon. You as well, thanks. All right, before we head to break, we have to check on shares of Bedbet to Beyond after the company announced, Sue Gove will soon the role of CEO after serving as interim CEO for four months. This comes in the middle of an attempt to turn around the brand following several quarters of slipping sales and really a very long period of operating losses. You see the stock down slightly today about 3%. Intel's mobile I spin off gets a disappointing IPO valuation Julie's back with today's top headlines next. Thanks for opportunity. Let's get down to business now. Look at some of the other headlines that we are watching. Intel is set to debut its self-driving unit Mobileye at $21 to share during its anticipated IPO, this according to the Wall Street Journal. Now, price represents a premium. From its expected range, the unit, which focuses on driver assisting and self-driving technologies like sensors and microchips, comes both as driving aids become increasingly critical to portfolios of automakers. And as the market for public debut continues facing a dry spell, I should say it's above the range that was reported or is originally being below the initial range. So I guess it's somewhere in the middle. The shape of the shape continues.",https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hqIy-Q36neE,7,2022-10-26 14:15:00
4127," A dry spell, I should say, it's above the range that was reported or is originally being below the initial range. So I guess it's somewhere in the middle. The shape of the shake-up continues at Warner Brothers Discovery. The media empire announcing that James Gunn and Peter Safren will be the new co-heads of DC Comics, which oversees iconic properties like the Batman and Justice League franchises. This after reports that the company had taken a write-off of up to $4.3 billion on canceling projects like CNN Plus, and that girl, as well as layoffs, across the WBD company. And an Apple executive has confirmed for the first time that the company will comply with the EU's mandate for mobile devices to use USBC during a tech event. The EU standard was enacted to help consumers simplify charging and cut down on e-waste. Apple senior vice president marketing didn't give away any more details on the commitment. But said the company would have approached the problem differently, the company had previously remained mum about whether it would honor EU regulations over the charging standard. Apple first introduced a lightning port in its iPhone 5. It's not officially hinted at what might place that port. Sauce? All right, let's check back in now on the broader markets as the Fed juggles the balancing act of Kermit inflation and a verdict, a recession. Where does that leave investors seeking to balance the two risks for more on this? We have BlackRock's Tony Disparito. Tony, good to always get some time with you. I think let's start on the today's market action because I think what we're seeing is pretty interesting, you know, Julie highlighted earlier on the show. Some pretty not good quarters from Microsoft and Google, yet stocks are hanging in there. Are we watching the bottoming process in markets take place? Yeah, so I think look, there's some short-term and long-term drivers here. And certainly if you kind of look year-to-date, you know, the market has gone down dramatically and all of it has been multiple contraction, right? We've gone through a multiple that was 22 at the beginning of the year to about 16, 17 today. Meanwhile, earnings have mostly picked up, although they're starting to roll over. And the market's dealing with the risk of a recession. So from my perspective, I like the valuation. I think the valuations have come back down to the normal range. I'm still concerned about earnings, and that's what we're seeing is a bumpy ride with respect to earnings. And I see more volatility in the short run because if you think about the Fed, the Fed just started hiking in March of this year, seven months ago. And that was a 25 basis point hike, by the way. And when you think about Fed interaction with the economy, those rate hikes typically take at least six months to have any impact. And the full impacts felt more like 18 months down the road. So we still haven't felt the full impacts of those rate increases. That's going to impact economics. That's going to impact earnings. And so I still see some bumpy ride ahead. And I think what investors should do is prepare their portfolios to be more resilient. All right. So within that bumpy ride, who is sitting on the wheel or who's sitting in perhaps the most insulated part of the bus as we're continuing to watch the Fed and for their mandate, them trying to meet some of those benchmark expectations. For some sectors, they're going to experience this a little bit harder than others as we've seen both pullbacks and consumer discretionary real estate's been hit hard. And then additionally, you mentioned tech a moment ago. Yeah. So I think an active manager can really add value here, both through industry sector as well as stock selection. And I kind of look at the world in terms of sickle goals and more stable learners. I think there's value to be added on both sides in terms of sickle goals in the fund eye run. We're really favoring energy and financials as they both benefit from the inflationary impulse. Certainly energy. That's a long history there. And then on financials, you have the benefit of rising short-term rates, expanding net interest margin. And then on the more stable side, I'm really in favor of health care. Health care is certainly as stable as utilities and staples historically from an earnings perspective. Yet has a better long-term growth dynamic in the valuations today are significantly more compelling. And so that's how I see the opportunity to add value for investors. What about a place like technology? And if you talk about stable earnings, I mean, even though it's slowing the earnings growth from many of the companies that we heard from late yesterday, it's so relatively stable. So I wonder how you're thinking about that group. So I do think that they're real.",https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hqIy-Q36neE,8,2022-10-26 14:19:03
4128," the case that we heard from late yesterday, it's so relatively stable. So I wonder how you're thinking about that group. So I do think that there are real pockets of technology where there's real good opportunity. And I'd even put it in that stable bucket, kind of a new staple, if you will. And that just because there's a recession, it doesn't mean you can slow down on your text back. Right, and so we're still seeing cloud grow. It's growing a little bit more slowly than maybe it has historically. But it's still growing by leaps and bounds, 40% plus in the quarter as we look at recent reports. And so I do see really clean balance sheets and technology. So these are things we're emphasizing. The clean balance sheets, the companies that have more stable like earnings. And then you've got to be, look at evaluations. Make sure you're not overpaying for that collection of good business with good earnings power. Tony, you mentioned energy in that sector. We've already seen this have composed some of the best performers year to date. So is that trade already missed? I don't think so. And for a couple of reasons, there is a long term supply demand mismatch there. And the mismatch is really coming from restrained supply. That sector went into, I'll call it a recession back in 2014 where there was significant excess capacity. And since then, you've seen CAPEX come down dramatically and stay down. And that's really important. And so when you look at companies today, even with high oil prices, you're not getting that supply response. And in fact, you're seeing good discipline out of OPEC, they just cut and saying, look, the economy is slowing. We need to cut supply. And then also when you look at the strategic petroleum reserve, we've been releasing about a million barrels a day. That's 1% of demand. Doesn't sound like a lot. But in the market like oil, that's normally very steady. 1% means a lot. And so we're about done with those releases come December. And so that's going to be another thing that's going to put a floor under price. Tony, I appreciate the time here today. BlackRock, Tony Disparito joining us this morning. Thanks so much.

4129," export Microsoft beat on the top end bottom lines yesterday, but the company's guidance fell short after the company reported software than expected cloud revenue. CEO, Satsun Nadella, says that cynical trends are weighing or cyclical trends are weighing on the stock's consumer business, but could the company's plan to moderate expenses boost its stock joining us now to weigh in? It's probably percent. There's Internet equity analyst Brent Braseland. Brent, great to have you here with us this morning. For Microsoft, some of the larger headwinds that they had laid out, FX, PC, which of these do you see actually being able to abate in the near term of all of the headwinds that they mentioned? How can Microsoft successfully navigate this period? Sure you bet. Clearly, you're starting to see the macro pressure start to erode into the growth outlook for Microsoft. If you look at the cloud business, it's actually still pretty healthy, slowing, but we still expect the cloud business to grow north of 20 percent this year, a little slower than we thought originally six months ago. It's really the more economically sensitive parts of Microsoft. That's still a big business. That's still a $100 billion business. It has been growing across windows and PCs and surface devices and gaming. That's a $100 billion plus business that has been growing 4 percent plus for the last two, three years. It could actually decline double digits this next quarter. It's really where we're seeing that the slow down in those more cyclically sensitive areas, more of the consumer areas, the commercial still holding up pretty well. That's sort of in line with what we've been hearing from the commentary we've been getting ahead of the earnings season from the likes of a sales force, for example, that have seemed to indicate that business spending is holding up pretty well, but how long does that last? If the cyclical stuff is rolling over, can we expect it at some point to also affect the more enterprise spending? Absolutely. And you're just now starting to see small cracks in the cloud growth rate. If you look at Azure, it's one of the fastest growing parts of the cloud business for Microsoft. That growth profile is decelled by about 9 percentage points in about three quarters. So you absolutely are seeing slow down. It's still good growth, right? 37% in constant currencies with the guided to this coming quarter. That's down from 47% over the last couple of years. So it's slowing. We're seeing signs of maybe some budgetary pressure on the enterprise side. That's going to flow through into next year as well. So we certainly wouldn't say enterprise software cloud is immune to the macro. And we're now starting to see cracks. Brent, clearly a challenging quarter for Microsoft outside of your coverage universe or outside of Microsoft. Are there other companies that you think will be impacted to the same extent as Microsoft? Sure. We actually took numbers down on 22 stocks last week, including cutting numbers by Microsoft by 3 billion. Clearly wasn't enough. We took another $7 billion cut to our Microsoft numbers this morning. But yeah, we think there really isn't a safe haven in software. I think the macro pressures will eventually impact growth rates for most of the enterprise software names that we cover. So I think the good news is valuation.",https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hqIy-Q36neE,10,2022-10-26 14:27:42
4130," and surely impact growth rates for most of the enterprise software names that we cover. So, you know, I think the good news is valuations are started at bottom. So I think there's no longer a valuation risk. The challenge fundamentals have not bottomed yet. So we still have a bottoming process to go through on the fundamental side. We need to see growth expectations for next year reset. And we're getting close, but certainly have to go through a fundamental trough before you start to see stabilization. What type of growth profile would you give at this point to Microsoft's cloud business, considering the pull forward and demand that we'd seen over the past couple years? Yes, so it's interesting. We look at the broader cloud market. The cloud 100, if you will, growth was 33% in 2021. We're modeling about 22% cloud industry growth in 2022. That's similar to where Microsoft Cloud is at. Next year, we're actually sub 20% growth for industry, about 19.5% industry cloud industry growth expectations. That's essentially, I think, directionally where Microsoft's headed as well. High teens growth in a recessionary environment seems like a good, kind of landing spot for this industry. That's down from 33. So that is a material slowed down, but still really good growth for an industry that could be north of $300 billion in 2023. With valuations sitting where they are right now, do you think that Microsoft, especially within this cloud landscape, needs to make a key acquisition and strike while the opportunity might be there to go after a company that could help it grow out of its portfolio in the cloud a little bit better? Listen, Microsoft's still the cloud king. It's the only cloud company north of $100 billion in revenue. It's still growing, poised to grow 20% in consequences. So could they do more? Absolutely. Should they do more? Absolutely. Do I think they will do more? Absolutely. So $17 billion in cash, $65 billion in cash flow. Microsoft's not done from an M&A standpoint in cloud. We expect them to be active next year. Absolutely. Times three. Thanks so much, Brandon. Appreciate it, Brent Braseland, a FIPER-SANDLER equity research. Appreciate it. Coming up next, we'll get a pulse check on the state of telecom with AT&T Executive, Jen Robertson. Don't want to miss it.",https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hqIy-Q36neE,11,2022-10-26 14:32:13
4131," Cause you never know when started to get your lifeง Jan. Team up, good news. You'll get that in a second. Raymond James, the most recent analyst o'plod, 18 T's recent quarter. Take your simple T with a boost to strong buy from Al perform this after the US telecom reported its third quarter numbers last week, including a net gain of 708,000 pre paid subscribers joining us to talk about the company and economic environment is Jen Robertson, AT&T, mass markets, executive vice president and general manager. Jen, thanks for being here. Thank you. So as we look at these subscriber numbers, what I'm curious about is where they are coming from. In other words, are they coming from your competitors, which competitors and what is it costing you in terms of promotions? Yeah, we're really proud of the subscriber growth we've been delivering and we're sitting at nine quarters now in a row of 600,000 post paid voice net ads or more and delivering near record levels. So it's been an exciting time to be in the industry, proud of how we're standing up against competitors, 2.000,000 net ads year to date through the third quarter and expecting that to be an industry leading position as we move forward. So holding strong there and certainly delivering that from a higher demand for connectivity, it is a resilient product and looking at customers and delivering value. And so yes, there are promotional offers, but we are meeting customers where they want to be. We have distribution expansion that's occurred. We're meeting customers where they want to shop. A lot of trends that came out of the COVID pandemic that have carried forward and changed how people want to interact with us and we're proud of how we've simplified our product and pricing construct and met customers where they want to be. When you think about the advancements in the network too, one thing that we've heard over the course of this earnings season from telecommunications and communication services companies is where those investments are being made and boosting up the network. Where, how soon do you see that beginning to really play out for so many of the customers that you're serving too? Right. So we've made investments, significant investments in the 5G wireless network, proud to be moving towards 130 million subscribers and customers that will be covered with our CBAN spectrum by the end of this year, 200 million and more covered by 5G. And certainly the country's largest investor in fiber. And so putting those investments there because it's the connectivity that customers want, it is the technology that will meet the next decade plus of demand for customers both on usage and on speed. And so that's why you see us really doubling down and putting our focus in those two network technologies. It was talked a lot about the earnings call Jen, just improved value perception. So what are you doing specifically on pricing? You're cutting prices of plans, you have any more plans to drop them even further. I think actually we raised prices earlier this year on our legacy plans. And what I am really proud of the team for doing was taking a customer-centered approach to it. We looked at what customers wanted and candidly they want simple plans, they want choice and they want to get more value. And so even as we raised prices in some areas, we had customers choose to move to our newer unlimited plans and upgrade their service and pay a higher price point because they saw the value exchange that was included in there. We allow customers to mix and match plans in our unlimited your way offerings. We allow customers to write size it for their household. We allow customers to have 5G included. So certainly a value to a customer where they even-",https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hqIy-Q36neE,12,2022-10-26 14:36:35
4132," So they can write size it for their household. We allow customers to have 5G included. So certainly a value to a customer where they felt, yes, I'm getting something for this exchange. I think people are still trying to figure out what 5G is and does for them, right? We've been talking about it for a couple of years now. Full disclosure, we were owned by a phone company. We've rivaled phone company before. We heard a lot about 5G. Like if I have 5G on my phone, is there a noticeable difference in how that phone is performing for me? We absolutely, as we deploy our CBAN spectrum, there is an absolute difference in speed and higher speeds that customers can experience. I think it's interesting. 4G technology had such a leapfrog in the use cases for customers that as 5G came out, I think our media cycle was earlier on the 5G hype and consumers and businesses looking at, okay, now how do I get the use cases out more quickly? And we forget that we're still in the process of deploying the network. There are certainly business use cases that are coming to life, manufacturing, health care. A lot of opportunity there is UCS lean in, connected car being one. From the everyday consumer right now, it is absolutely a speed increase. Let's just say, I use a competitor service from my phone full and fair disclosure and 5G for me doesn't pop up everywhere. What is it like on your service? Do you still see dead spots for 5G? Yeah, I think it comes back to we deploy the spectrum in phases and that takes time. And so you'll see 130 million people covered by the end of this year with our 5G CBAN, where you'll have a noticeable speed. You know, just lastly what we have here, we think about the areas of the economy that have like these little luxuries that consumers will continue to buy in, even during an economic downturn, is your phone service, your cellular service, is that a little luxury that you're seeing people continue to spend higher for just because of all the different things that we use our devices for on a daily basis right now too? Right, I think what we see it is not a luxury, it's a requirement. Customers need connectivity for personal use, for business use, for learning and commerce. And so it's actually a very resilient product. And customers are purchasing up, it's why our RPU was up in the third quarter. All right, let's see what they are, Jen Robertson, AT&T, Mass, Markets, EVP and General Manager. Good to see you, thanks for coming to our studio. Appreciate it. Thank you. All right, coming up, we'll chat with Mattel, Celia, and not cries as the toy maker gears up for the peak holiday shopping season. We'll be right back. Good looking mess around up here and we've come back. Good looking mess around. Good looking. Right.",https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hqIy-Q36neE,13,2022-10-26 14:40:51
4133," metallic Tienbok Party Shares of Mattel aren't focused after the toy maker trimmed its full year guidance in its third quarter earnings report last night saying market volatility and other macroeconomic risks has forced it to reformulate its expectations. Patel Chairman and CEO Anon Krauss joins us now to discuss. No, I know he's great to get some time with you. Your top takeaway on the quarter. Thank you, Brian, for inviting me. Well, this was a good quarter for Mattel. The ninth straight quarter of year of year growth in constant currency. Look, as you know, we are in the midst of a challenging economic environment, but our year-to-date results of double-digit growth in net sales, adjusted EBITDA, adjusted operating income and adjusted EPS, showed that we are successfully navigating a complex landscape and our strategy is working. We believe our fundamentals are strong and we are very confident about our multi-year growth trajectory. Anon, I've been covering you and the turnaround story Mattel for a good bit now. I wasn't used to that tone on that conference call last night just highlighting some slowing you're seeing in the market. How severe is that gun? Look, there's no, it's not a secret that the economy, the broader economy, is currently challenging. But our year-to-date result do show and do demonstrate that we are on the right track. We are maintaining guidance for full-year growth in net sales in constant currency of 8 to 10 percent and look forward to the holiday season. We modestly revised our profit expectation to allow and accommodate for the inflation that we're seeing, but we still expect a growth year for Mattel, both at the top line and the bottom line and also expect 2023 to be a growth year, both top line and bottom line. So we are very confident about our trajectory. Brands are resonating, thriving with the continued engagement and cultural impact and we're very confident about our strategy and execution. You did highlight the need that there might be a little more promotions in the holiday quarter than I think a lot of investors may be expected. How much discounting do you expect to be doing? According to date, consumer demand is a non-with expectation and we're pleased with our performance. Shoppers are returning to traditional purchasing patterns closer to the holiday and we expect demand to accelerate. We are working closely with our retail partners to meet the anticipated demand. We have more advertising and promotion. We secured more shelf space and retail of support compared to last year and we also expect to and also we have great holiday toilies representation and much stronger in stock. So yes, we are going to increase promotion and activity, but we are well positioned for the fourth quarter in the holiday season, which is why we are maintaining a full year guidance of net sales growth in 8% to 10% in constant currency. No, I'm old. I'm not as close as I used to be. What are some of the top toilies in the holiday season? Well, Mansahai is going to be a very exciting offering as we prepare for the global launch next year. Hot Wheels Car Wash, Lightyear products, Fisher Price has a great musical toy called Bouncing Beats and the Dreamhouse. Of course, we will always be on the top of the toilies for every holiday season.",https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hqIy-Q36neE,14,2022-10-26 14:45:04
4134," I saw some great musical toy called bouncing beats and the dream house, of course, will always be on the top of the toilet for every holiday season. So an exciting, broad offering across a pretty large spectrum of product that we're very excited about. I remember having one of those car washes as a kid, and I got to send your photo exists somewhere, but these are some cool toys. That is an interesting stuff. And how is the pricing on these compared to last year? Do you plan to take more pricing? Look, we increased pricing in the second half of this year. We were able to successfully implement those increases and it's too early to tell, but so far, we haven't seen a meaningful impact on consumer demand. Important to say that as it relates to inflation, we are beginning to see some improvement in the course of ocean freight and materials. We expect inflation to moderate in 2023. And in addition to the savings that we're looking to generate of $250 million by the end of 2023, we expect the combination of pricing and cost savings to more than offset cost inflation and contribute to margin expansion over time. So we are proactively managing our business in this environment to ensure that we are set up for long-term success. You may be the first CEO that we've talked to to really highlight a peak in inflation and things cooling off a bit. I certainly, certainly that is good to hear in a different tone. Let's go on to Barbie because Barbie's been an interesting story the past year or two here. Real growth mechanism for the company. What's on tap for that brand next year? Oh, very confident about the long-term growth trajectory of Barbie. Barbie was the number one global dollar property in the third quarter and year to date. Year to date, Barbie is up, which is an excellent achievement when compared to last year, which was the highest on record for Barbie of all times. We look forward to next year, which will have an exciting innovation pipeline, new content slate with Netflix. And of course, the highly anticipated Barbie movie, our first theatrical release that will come out this summer. Also important to know that Barbie doubled in size over the past five years and was the number one global toy property overall, not just in dollars, but overall in the last two years. And we really see that as a proof point to the strength of this incredible franchise, very confident about Barbie and proud to have it as our leading franchise. It does seem like a nine. And we've talked about this in the past. You've all the seeds that you have plans in terms of content. And of course, you highlight the Barbie movie or now coming to fruition. This will start to hit the market next year and beyond. How much will you spend on content next year? Well, we employ a capital-wide strategy. We are not spending money on content. We are leveraging our brands. We collaborate with the best filmmakers and content creators out there, both not just film, but also in television. And partly with major studios to create, produce, distribute and commercialize our brands on the big screen and also in episodic content. We have a very exciting slate of 14 additional movies other than Barbie that we currently developing with some of the best and most prolific creators of this generation. And this is going to grow up because we have more in the pipeline that we haven't announced. And likewise, Mattel television is thriving with 12 series and specials that will be on air this year, so to speak, because some are actually by streaming. Eight of those are new for a returning. Months-to-high-love action television movie musical, just launch an ecology and we grinlit the second movie. And we continue to roll out more content, such as Thomas and friends, polypocket, fireman Sam, DeepAnerNoop, more Barbie product, Piccenaerie Game Show, and the list goes on and on. So exciting to see how our brands resonate with...",https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hqIy-Q36neE,15,2022-10-26 14:49:19
4135," and a new, more Bobby product, a dictionary game show, and the list goes on and on. So, exciting to see how our brands resonate with consumers and attract creators to collaborate with us, because like us, they're also very excited to reimagine and create an expression of our product in content. Once the Pokemon movie hitting it on, well, we licensed recently the Pokemon brand, which is one of the strongest franchises this year for mega, for building sets. It's been a great driver for us, and we're very proud to work with the Pokemon company in expressing their IP in combination without product. So, it's a great partnership. And this really speaks to how we elevate to become the partner of choice for the major entertainment companies, and where we bring our capabilities, our global scale, our innovation, our supply chain, and commercial capabilities collaborate with other owners, other franchises, and take them to the next level, and create evergreen franchises, just like we do with our own. And I'm just being flagged before I let you go. And there was just a new Pokemon movie, Detective Pikachu. That's how you know you're getting old, but you do not realize those types of movies are in the market. We'll leave it there for now. Good luck this holiday season. Mattelcio and I'm cries. We'll talk to you soon. Thank you so much. All right, coming up, we'll zero in on some more key earnings reports from Visa, Haliburne, and Skechers. Looking forward to sharing that now. So that's next. Gosh. Welcome back everyone, it is time for Cup for Time. We've got four stories today. One minute each. Hello with this, Visa the tracking tick or symbol GO on the day of days.",https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hqIy-Q36neE,16,2022-10-26 14:53:59
4136," Welcome back everyone. It's time for Cup for Time. We've got four stories today. One minute each we're going to start with this visa tracking ticker symbol V on the day. It's up by about 5.6 percent right now. This is after beating on Q3 earnings. The payment company says it still sees strong consumer spending. Payments volume. That grew 10 percent in the quarter while transactions grew 12 percent. And this comes back to the type of spending that consumers are more prone to do at this point of time leaning towards some of the card products and card services out there versus just saying yeah I'll pay with cash. They're trying to hold on to some of that cash. Yeah and all this travel that we're talking about right how are people paying for that they're you know they're putting it on their card. So again this this speaks the idea that we're not seeing and across the board everything's slowing down at once right. It is very uneven here and visa's results I think are a good example of that. American Express good quarter last week visa could quarter I'm not depressed. Well and on the travel front as you mentioned American Express had cited global travel or corporate travel especially given that American Express has so much of the corporate T&E that they kind of account for within that landscape but for visa that clearly playing out for them too. Yeah all right Halliburne so earnings double in the last quarter as demand for crude oil increases leading to an upgrade from most Fargo take which is sending shares higher the bank upgrade the stock from underweight to overweight so pretty simple analysis here oil prices up good quarter for Halliburne. Yeah although it's not always as straightforward as that right you need the demand for oil services as well and not just the increase in oil prices I mean the price chart get jump on coming from Roger Readover Wells Fargo is pretty impressive to $52 from $33 so he's looking for a lot more upside. So are a lot of investors we speak to right we just talked to Tony Despirodo over at BlackRock he mentioned energy as an area that he likes right now and he's not the only one even after the climb that we saw in energy stocks especially in the first half of the year. Yeah I mean it's really a story as well though within all of this up pricing they're pricing increased in North America and international markets they're saying that the strength of their strategy and action was really kind of resulting in this revenue growth of 6% sequentially there and really led by some of that pricing and the macro environment right now too. On the other end of the spectrum we have sketchers the footwear manufacturer seeing shares dipping today after missing third quarter estimates give a down be outlook for the current quarter the shares up 4.5% and I'm seeing the love analyst concerned being expressed over the margins and the target for margins as well for sketchers so again here illustrating the lumpiness in consumer spending right people maybe you're traveling maybe people are buying some shoes still but they're not buying as many sketches and it's costing the company more to get them out there and maybe to move them out the door too. Inventory up 21% right flag but it still comes back to the core consumer that sketchers is going to go after here we've seen them move more into some of this sport or leisure activity category they've got a number of PGA tour some now live golfers I believe that are still on the roster and so with that it's this larger question of when you've got a millennial and Gen Z population that have clearly shown what their brand of entities are Nike, Lulele lemon and then additionally crocs as well as one of the kind of growth areas that we've seen in some of the more kind of comfortable shoes where to sketch your sit within that too I think that's a larger question that the brand is still going to have to answer for. All right now we're looking at wingstop shares a wingstop taking flight today after the fast food chain announced prices of bone and chicken wings are actually decreasing the falling prices prompted wingstop to raise its full year gone and so this is what we've heard for wingstop in recent quarters deflation and chicken wing prices really one of the only fast food companies that I can think of actually seeing deflation in parts of their business wingstop benefiting from that. They just got into the chicken sandwich game madly that's the analysis. Well they may be seeing deflation in chicken wings but they're probably not seeing deflation in labor costs right I mean that's something I think that is still we're seeing upward pressure on that across the board for anybody within the food business specifically because people still don't want to come back and work in that business. No it's true and at the same time where wingstop is also still trying to navigate with that direct correlation or that direct touch point with the consumer is while many of those consumers have options on the table.",https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hqIy-Q36neE,17,2022-10-26 14:58:00
4137," At the same time where Wingstop is also still trying to navigate with that direct correlation or that direct touch point with the consumer is, while many of those consumers have options on the table to get delivery through some of the other third-party sources as well for their chicken wings. However, falling chicken prices help them that out. All right. We are seeing a stock sound mix right now and coming up at Kiko Vegeta, we'll continue our coverage of earnings from Tech giants out of that Microsoft with technologists research president Bob O'Donnell. Welcome to Yahoo Finance Live. It is 11 a.m. here in New York City. I'm Kiko Fujita. Here's what I'm watching at this hour. Big misses for big tech, the results season serves up some uncomfortable questions for the global economy underwhelming reports from Microsoft, Alphabet and Texas Instruments all wing on sentiment this morning. Too strong for too long. The greenback, the dominant currency for most of 2022, but a broad move against the dollar takes place in global FX. So the question here, are we at peak hawkishness? We're going to ask global ETFs Morgan Del Done later in the show. And in this economy, Intel's mobile I price is its long-awaited IPO above the targeted range. Could stripe an Instacart B-next. We're going to get into that conversation later this hour. So as always, we are checking the markets right now. 90 minutes into the trading day right now. 10 minute to go.",https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hqIy-Q36neE,18,2022-10-26 15:02:39
4138," It's Stripe and Instacart V-Nex. We're going to get into that conversation later this hour. First though, as always, we are checking the markets right now. 90 minutes into the trading day right now. The Dow is up about 240 points. The Nasdaq, the big one we're keeping a close watch on on the back of those big tech reports. Of course, we're going to be breaking down Microsoft as well as Alphabet, meta on tap after the belt today. One we're going to be watching closely. Taking a look at where the bond markets are right now. We have seen a bit of a pullback here, but the shorter end still well above that 4% level, five year at 4.2, and the benchmark 10 year just right about at 4%. Well, shares of Alphabet are sliding into the red after missing estimates on the top and bottom lines. The tech giant's revenue growth slowed to 6% from 41%. The prior year is at spending continues its downward trend. Lapping from a strong third quarter last year, for some tough comps across Alphabet's portfolio, including search and YouTube. Take a listen to what we heard from Google and Alphabet CFO Ruth Porat on the earnings call. And YouTube and Network, the sequential deceleration of year-on-year growth in the third quarter, versus the second quarter, primarily reflects further pullbacks in advertiser spend. In the fourth quarter, the very strong revenue performance last year will continue to create tough comps that will weigh on the year-on-year growth rates of advertising revenues. Joining us to break this all down. We've got Bob O'Donnell, Technologist Research at President Chief Analyst for more on-the-impact top companies. We're starting to feel from an economic slowdown. Bob, we've got you in the flesh. I'd so great to be back alive in the studio. It's crazy. Certainly a good day to break this all down. We're going to start with Alphabet because we were saying before the show that it's interesting to see how significantly they were affected, especially in digital ads. When you think about the last quarter, there's a bit of a divergence between the social media companies. Alphabet has a bit more of a diversified portfolio, but they weren't shielded this time around. No, I mean, because obviously Alphabet gets searched and we're always going to search and people are always going to do that. And so they always have that that they can fall back on as part of the advertising side. But the social media side and the YouTube side of things, that's where they took the hit and that's because we're seeing, obviously, overall advertising going down in those places. And the other challenge that you've got with Alphabet is it's not really that diversified a company, right? There's so much dependence upon advertising. I mean, look, they do have Google Cloud, which they didn't really talk too much about that, but they have a few things that are bubbling up, but they're still small. I mean, I saw the other day that other bets, remember, when they used to talk about other bets, it's 0.3% of the company's revenue. So I mean, I think that's one of the ongoing challenges. They're going to favor these things out. They are building their business not only on the enterprise side. I should say not only for Google Cloud, but also Google Workspace, some of their other services where they compete with Microsoft. And that's been growing and that continues to grow. It's going to take a while before it becomes a huge contributor to the bottom line, but there are these elements that are in play and that are moving forward for them. What was your takeaway, though, from what we heard in terms of where things are headed? And it seemed like they were sort of setting things up for an even more significant downturn. And to your point, yes, it's not as diversified as a company like Microsoft, but in terms of where the ad revenue and where they compete in, it is a little more diversified than the likes of Meta or stuff. Yes, no, it definitely is. And look, I think what we're seeing in a lot of ways across tech is a sense of the things that people expected to happen at the beginning of the pandemic didn't and now they kind of are. It's sort of like it's a two and a half year delay of the big impact that people thought was going to have. I think in general, we're seeing that tech companies having weathered so well are now facing the challenges that other parts of the market have faced. And it's just that's the reality. Growth is going to slow down. And on the advertising side, of course, that's a reflection of overall macroeconomic trends. And there's not a whole lot they can do about that. And I think that's a challenge. Obviously, there's not many more places they can go. I mean, Google is everywhere and there's stuff is everywhere. So it's really going to be dependent upon how the general macroeconomic does so that those companies then feel more confident.",https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hqIy-Q36neE,19,2022-10-26 15:06:44
4139, order places they can go i mean google is everywhere and their stuff is everywhere so it's really going to be dependent upon how the general macroeconomic does so that those companies and feel more confident there are advertising i should say feel more confident in spending the money with uh... a platform like google let's talk about microsoft obviously as your spend the big growth driver there and you have said in your notes that because it is more enterprise state of facing they are a little more shielded and yet what we heard yesterday i think it was on the call from google saying essentially yes companies are still investing in the cloud but they're taking a little longer and maybe thinking a little hard about how much they want to invest so are we likely to see further headwinds for microsoft even if as your the driver i think we will and you know the issue is it's easy forget that only about i i think the numbers last number of her group fifteen to twenty percent of companies have moved their workloads to the cloud or i shouldn't say of companies of of the potential workloads and so there's still this huge potential upside to move to cloud computing from all the big platforms and the other thing to bear in mind is we've had these incredibly strong growth rates for cloud computing across the board you know a w s obviously microsoft and at some point that's it can't last right it's the law of big numbers you run into a certain point where it's it's very difficult the thing is even as things start to slow down a bit a lot of companies started big initiatives during the pandemic that are cloud computing based and they are going to continue those like you said in as the commentary said some of those projects are going to slow down a little bit they're not quite as high priority perhaps as they were but they're still going to do it because it's still part of these companies really kind of trying to transform their businesses and that's an essential part of survival you know in the next decade we're still waiting on numbers from meta we've got alphabet or amazon and apple later on in the week you know it's sort of interesting to see how the narrative around tech has changed because for a while it was about the social media companies and yet when you think it where we are in the current court it feels like we're going back to sort of these established players if we can call that it is come down to apple it comes down to microsoft and how are you looking at your portfolio of those tech names and where are the safe bets yeah no i mean i think we are falling back to the most trusted tech brands and the big names are going to be the ones that are going to i think well you know make it through this the other thing is again these companies over the years have become increasingly diverse diversified now in the case of meta i think it's a challenge right obviously very advertising focused uh... very consumer based advertising focus so likely it's going to be tough you know apple everybody loves to say well one of these days something's going to catch up to apple but what apple magically manages to do every quarter is somehow get different elements of the puzzle to add together there have been rumblings that iphone 14 sales for example have been lower than expected so they've you know apparently cut the production and so people say i will see iphone is going to be down but remember now that iphone is less than 50% of the revenue they've built up this huge install base they continue to sell services right everything from apple tv and all the other services they have that's driving their growth they're also doing more obviously with airpods and the watch and other elements of their ecosystem so they've managed to create this you know i think pretty diverse story similar to amazon right i mean amazon is you know very dichotomy you've got a w s which just cranks out revenue and cranks out uh... you know dollars and then you've got the online sales business which realistically is probably going to you know take a hit if it's going to be like any the other retail environments but the question is is there enough on the you know a w s i'd offset some of that i it's it's hard to tell for sure but again it's that story of diversification that these big tech companies have done over the years and i think we're going to start to see the benefits of that but clearly at more of a reduced kind of a normal rate yeah not the huge uh... multiples that they've gotten yeah a lot of investors are going to be parsing those numbers are breaking down those numbers closely uh... but great to have you in studio so i think you can go great to be here Bobo Donald technologist research president and chief analyst well macro headwinds no doubt taking a toll on corporate results we've been talking about an underwhelming numbers for big tech pointing out some glaring weaknesses in the global economy major data points held above water for some time but is a slow down we've been fearing so long finally here,https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hqIy-Q36neE,20,2022-10-26 15:11:02
4140," Some glaring weaknesses in the global economy. Major data points held above water for some time, but it's a slowdown we've been fearing so long, finally here. We've got an S for A and Julie Hyman. Julie, making an appearance on the other side of the show. Let's start with the earnings because we just went through the big tech ones there, but there's another one that I know in as you've been watching, and that's Texas Instruments. Yeah, that's right. And Texas Instruments is important because their chips go into everything from home appliances to missiles. So the scope of where their chips go is very significant here. And Texas Instruments basically saying that they are seeing softness, especially also going into the industrial segment. So that industrial segment that seemed to be immune to sort of a softness in the chip space, a slowdown in chip space, that is notable. Now, analysts have been talking about that we would see a slowdown in the chip space, especially in the second half of the year. But again, that scope, you also have, of course, the Biden administration restrictions when it comes to chips and China that's also weighing on here. But the bottom line from what I can glean from this is that basically this slowdown that we're seeing, it's not going to be a quick turnaround. Julie, your thoughts on that? Well, it's interesting what's going on with Texas Instruments. It seems like everything's slowed except autos. It's what analysts were pointing out. That was actually a bright spot because that's a spot where the automakers are sort of in an arms race where that is concerned. So for me, the takeaway is that this is very lumpy. And this is something we were talking about in the last hour, not just within chips, but within everything, right? Because if you look at results from something like visa, which was out with its numbers as well, from there, the indication seemed to be that consumer spending is still relatively strong on things like, perhaps, travel, right? So it's not that businesses and consumers are not spending. It's that the spending is on different things. They're spending, perhaps, less, maybe overall. Certainly, companies seem to be judging by the results from Microsoft, for example. But it's not sort of across the board, things falling off a clip. It's this sort of lumpy slowdown. But doesn't that go back to sort of like, how do we look at what the macro picture looks like? I mean, we've been talking so much about how there's this divergence between where consumer sentiment is, versus where consumers are actually spending, and that it, yes, there are concerns about higher prices, and yet when you look at the broader labor market, things are still pretty tight. And this sort of seems to add to that idea of it being a little noisy and trying not being able to have a very clear picture on where things are headed. Yeah, definitely. And if you also look at the home data, for example, I've been also watching that because as housing goes, so does the economy. This is another area where we are seeing September, New Home Sales were down in September, and you saw also in September the mortgage rates, those climbed up to, by 100 basis points. That's huge amount in one month. So now it's just sitting just around 7%. You are going to see a slowdown in this, in the housing market, we are already seeing it, and keep in mind the housing is a lagging indicator. So when we're talking about these different areas of the consumer, how the consumer feels, where it's spending its money, housing is a huge component of the economy. It encompasses so many jobs from construction to mortgage lending, and then it also encompasses the durable goods. So, diswashers, everything that has to do with building a home and what you put inside the home. I think that there's different areas, as you mentioned, of the economy. It is a little bit lumpy, and it's just, which areas do you want to focus on, and which are lagging, which are the ones that indicate? Well, in going back to what we've been learning from earnings, when Chipotle is kind of an interesting story, they raise prices a lot of companies have to offset the cost. They did beat expectations, and yet it does seem to suggest that there are trade-offs that are happening among consumers. Well, and they talked about that the lower income consumers are not coming in as often. Transactions actually fell at Chipotle by a percent. They're going to fall by a higher percentage in the current quarter, according to the CFO Jack Carton, who we spoke earlier today. And so not only are you getting lumpiness among what consumers are spending on, there's a lot of differentiation amongst consumers. So whereas a higher-end consumer might still go out and spend a house, even though a buy house, maybe they're spending less on that house. Likewise, you're going to have a...",https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hqIy-Q36neE,21,2022-10-26 15:15:26
4141," Shows amongst consumers. So whereas a higher end consumer might still go out and spend a house even though a buy house Maybe they're spending less on that house Likewise, you're gonna have a big differentiation between higher and lower end consumers and what they're buying where they're Traveling etc. Well, I mean even that if even if you know, so lower income Customers aren't coming through the doors much higher income maybe spending more bit even for higher income That is a trade down right? Yeah, it could be definitely if they're buying chipotle and not capital grill I don't know you know, like I don't know where they live I'm right exactly, but yes, there could be some decisions being made and we know that inflation impacts the lower and The lower income consumer as well. So that is expected These are I mean we've seen it with other with even the the dollar stores in the previous earnings where they they show where consumers are spending and they're maybe not spending on the t-shirts There's now spending on food on on the consumable products. Yeah, something we've heard from other retailers to groceries over other purchases Good to have both of you on next in that's for Angelie Heimann Well coming up I on the prize of Fedhockishness is peaking does that mean the IPO market can get back to its feet Intel's plans for its autonomous driving unit should help boost sentiment that discussions on the other side You You You Well Balancing act Elon must deal to buy Twitter slated to close this Friday Bloomberg reporting that the Tesla CEO Confirmed that in a video conference with bankers funding the deal The timing though making some people nervous with less than two weeks to go until the midterms There are growing concerns about social media companies and how well they're equipped to handle disinformation and Content manipulation. Let's bring in Yahoo Finance is Alexis Keenan who's following that story for us into number one We're looking at this timing potentially a little clearer if",https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hqIy-Q36neE,22,2022-10-26 15:19:42
4142," and content manipulation. Let's bring in Yahoo Finance, is Alexis Keenan, who's following that story for us. And to number one, we're looking at this timing, potentially a little clearer if it closes on Friday. How quickly, that's a big if. How quickly can Elon Musk move to change the platform as some have speculated he would? So I've heard some legal experts say, and whether they're the right ones or not, but they say it could happen immediately. Look, it's gonna be a private company. He could turn this thing on a dime. So this makes it a very interesting and delicate time, really, for Elon Musk to be taking over this company, because you do have midterm elections coming up, November 8th, and these companies, social media companies, Twitter, and the rest of the major US companies, they're all tasked with having a really robust content moderation policy around leading up to elections and after. Certainly that's been an expectation ever since the report came out, the Congressional bipartisan reports in 2016. So also though, Musk is working to sustain demand on the Tesla side. So he's got to balance this, but also he is having to keep that demand up with Tesla stock being down since the acquisition, about 31%. And I'll tell you why in a second, but first let's hit the fact that neither Tesla nor Musk have responded to explain exactly what is going to happen with content moderation on Twitter, once and if the deal really gets done here, that deadline being Friday at 5 o'clock, though Twitter has for its part in August, reaffirmed its position, its policy is called the Civic Integrity Policy, and what it does is it offers prompts to users that direct them to information that the company deems accurate, and it also adds labels to content that it deems misleading. So that policy in effect, but maybe not so much after Friday. But also it's been raised by some of the legal experts I've been talking to concern about Musk straddling not just the work responsibility of SpaceX, Tesla, his other companies, and then bringing Twitter in, but really trying to manage and be the arbiter of what lives and doesn't live on Twitter when it comes to world leaders. We've seen in the past a lot of discord about labels that have been put on lawmakers content, both in the U.S. and abroad, that's still going on recently with lawmakers in Ukraine, in the Russia-Ukraine conflict. And so, does Musk want to be in that position? That's a question that I hope he answers soon. It's going to be a difficult balancing act once he is faced with those decisions. You have to wonder what his feed is going to look like too. I mean, you're talking about global leaders. And he has sort of meddled in or weighing it, weighed in on what happens with Russia-Ukraine. He gave that interview with the Financial Times where he talks about what should be done with Taiwan. When you are leading that very platform where the discussion is happening, do the rules change? And the larger question everybody keeps asking is, what does it mean? Those people who were kicked off the platform like Donald Trump, are they going to instantly be reinstated? We don't know. But yes, it could end up being a problem that Elon Musk doesn't want to handle. And yes, could he push these responsibilities off to others who are running the company? Sure. But at the end of the day, the buck kind of does stop with Elon Musk so long as he is the sole owner of this company. We'll have to see how it plays out, but certainly he's going to have to continue to try to curry favor in China, in Germany, and other places where Tesla is operating and make sure that he's pleasing world leaders people of power on the content moderation level. And we don't know for sure that he wants to be the CEO and he's going to be running. We do not know. So all to be determined there, Alexis, thanks so much for that. Well, Intel's self-driving car unit mobile I priced its initial public offering at $21 a share late Tuesday. That's above the $18 to $20 range. That values the company at roughly $17 billion, more than the $15 billion, Intel paid for the company back in 2017, but a ways off from the $50 billion valuation it sought last year. Let's bring in Yahoo finances, Dan Halley, who's been watching that for us and Dan. There's a few questions that come with this. Number one, given where the IPO market has been, does the fact that Intel prices at a higher range suggests the appetite is back there again.",https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hqIy-Q36neE,23,2022-10-26 15:24:03
4143," is that come with this number one, given where the IPO market has been, does the fact that until prices at a higher range suggest the appetite is back there again? Yeah, I think that's really the big question for this kind of listing, right? This is mobile eye, just to give you some background. This was a company that was originally developing technology to be able to provide a computer vision for self-driving cars. Obviously it's gone heavy into self-driving until picked it up some years ago at around the $15.3 billion mark. And now, as you said, according to these reports, it's, IPO is being priced at $17 billion. But that's below, again, as you pointed out, that $50 billion that was originally being looked at. And this all has to do with just the IPO market kind of falling off after a big 2021, big 2020, big 2019, where we saw some of these mega companies and hit the public markets. Now, we haven't seen very many that are doing a billion dollars more in their IPO or more in their IPO. We have mobile eye here barely touching a billion dollars. But I think it does point to some interest in this kind of company and the long-term growth perspective, excuse me, perspective for something like this, where there is still a lot of work to be done in self-driving cars in computer vision when it comes to vehicles. And so if mobile eye goes public and can get some clients under its belt, then I think that just means that the opportunity really is there for growth. Now, when we talk about self-driving cars, obviously, the discussion ends up pointing towards something like a Tesla GM. What those companies are offering really are just drivers' system technologies. It's not really self-driving, no matter what they call it. It's just still drivers' technology. So the self-driving will still take years to kind of shake out. So there are ample opportunities for companies like mobile eye to kind of really fully establish themselves in the space and they become really the main client for some of these larger automaker brands and see where they can bring the technology going forward. Dan Halley is always seeing on top of the big tech stories for us today. Thanks so much for that. Well, coming up, Green Champions, California leading the charge on clean, tech, and sustainable innovation. But the question is, are those investments being made in an equitable manner? We're going to hear from one man who is ensuring that's the case at least in Los Angeles. That discussion is on the other side. So",https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hqIy-Q36neE,24,2022-10-26 15:28:43
4144," Let's go! The Biden administration has set out to deploy more than half a million EV charging stations by the end of this decade. It's part of a larger ambition to slash the number of all gas powered cars in the U.S. by half by 2030. Making that transition equitable though could be a challenge with a majority of charging stations deployed in predominantly white neighborhoods. And our next guest is trying to change that through a unique incubator in Los Angeles. Let's bring in Matt Peterson. He is the CEO of LA Clean Tech Incubator. The segment presented by BMW Matt. Good to talk to you again. You know, it's interesting in preparing for this. I was looking at a map of where all the charging stations are right now. And it's really glaring to see how concentrated they are in predominantly wealthy white neighborhoods. I mean, can you talk about what the landscape looks like in LA where we have seen significant transition to EVs? Yeah, we'll great to see you, Kiko. Thanks for having me on. You know, when we look at new markets and emerging markets, obviously the signals from policymakers in California really put the investment into electric vehicles and the charging infrastructure that makes it possible. Now, what that means is that the early adopters have predominantly been on what we call the West Side of Los Angeles, in our case, which is predominantly white. And what we are doing is an organization through our transportation electrification partnership to seeing how we can accelerate investment into long-come disadvantaged communities, including those communities that have socioeconomic challenges, disinvestment, ruglining, historical and institutional barriers to really get access to the services they need, whether it's adequate transit or transportation, let alone electric vehicles. So by doing pilots and advocating for policies like we successfully advocated for a statewide zero-emissions vehicle advocate for disadvantaged communities or equity advocates, we called it. And the governor is going to point that person for California to help address some of these inequities. But in the meantime, we're working on putting in charging and EV car sharing into places like public housing, where we know populations, people that live there don't have access to adequate transportation, suffer from worse air quality, and really can benefit from these kinds of solutions right there available exclusively for them. Matt, can you talk a bit more about the structure of Lacey? I mean, it's interesting to see how you're sort of playing this from both sides. You're obviously investing in some of these startups that are addressing those very issues you talked about, but you're also deploying these charging stations into more low-income communities and exposing them to them so that there's not as big of a divide in terms of going from a gas-powered car to an EV. Yeah. I think we're helping entrepreneurs in one end, particularly black brown and female entrepreneurs, who have a tougher time getting access to capital. So how do we provide them additional resources and support to get access to capital funding from our own venture fund and, excuse me, debt fund that we provide low-cost financing to them for capital access and working capital? But at the same time, how do we work with local governments and city officials to bring the charging where it needs to go? So our utility partners like Edison and LLEDVP are making programs available to invest in chargers and lower income neighborhoods, but how do we accelerate that? So we're doing a pilot in a community under the Sunson Gardens that's going to be a fast charger at the street near multi-family buildings, a predominantly low-income neighborhood, so that we can then educate people about electric vehicles, make public charging available to them and debt fund.",https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hqIy-Q36neE,25,2022-10-26 15:32:40
4145," near multi-family building, so predominantly low income neighborhood, so that we can then educate people about electric vehicles, make public charging available to them and demonstrate where it is, and how do we also target people that drive Uber and Lyft? How do we get TNC drivers behind the wheel of an EV, and that kind of public fast charging is going to be critical? Well, we'd then work to get level two charging, slower charging inside of multifamily building, so as people can take advantage of the UZD tax credit and the inflation reduction act to buy more affordable EVs that they have a place to charge. Finally, Matt, California has kind of been on the front lines of this transition to go all electric. You've been working very closely with the mayor, Garcetti, there on the ground in shaping LA's policy. Now that you see where the federal government in this administration is trying to take it, I wonder if there are any lessons learned from California slash LA's transition. If you think there is a glaring missing piece when you look at federal policy to address this issue? Well, not every state has a utility pursuing aggressive targets based on public policy or their own utilities commitment to the market for electric vehicles and the charging needed. Not every state has the rebates and additional incentives that California has. So how does the federal government go and provide support directly to cities as much as they can? So through the competitive grant program through the bipartisan infrastructure package, some cities will be able to access those dollars for charging directly. There's state energy offices may not be as interesting deploying those charging stations with funding from federal government equitably into lower income neighborhoods so that people can access the benefits of electric vehicles by having the charging infrastructure in their backyard. Another thing is making sure that those chargers are working. So if you drive an ED sometimes you may experience such a charger that doesn't work and 80% of the time that it does not, it's a non-electrical issue. It means that the Wi-Fi connections down, something like a software issue. So we have a company that we think you've been called Charger Help that's out there making sure we have uptime. So the federal government can make sure those that benefit from the federal government dollars make sure those chargers are working 95% of the time and that there's a company like Charger Help making sure those chargers are working, diagnose them, fix them, keep them up and maintained. Yeah, it's certainly been great to watch the progress of everything you've done over at Lacey. Matt, good to talk to you today. Matt Peterson, CEO of Lacey. Well, coming up, King Dollars Crown slips a touch. UFD ticks lower against major counterparts as investors reassess the outlook for rate high tax on pulling data. We'll look at the impact of policy on the other side of the Atlantic. Thanks.",https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hqIy-Q36neE,26,2022-10-26 15:37:12
4146," if The results in his seeing the likes of Coca-Cola and Microsoft's IPH impact of the strong dollar. But has the story seen its peak? Let's bring in Yahoo Finance's Jared Blikery who's taking a closer look at some of the key charts we should be watching, Jared. Let's start with the Dixie. This is US Dollar Index. It is heavily weighted to the euro. Some people consider it an agronistic but nevertheless a very good overall gauge. It is down 1%. And you got to keep tabs of who's rooting for a lower US dollars just about everyone. Anyone who likes higher risk markets and here we have a three month chart. Indeed, we are testing the lowest levels here since about one month ago. And if we take a look at a longer term trend line, this is going to be your to date. You can see we broke through to the downside a couple days ago. This is a rather steep interpretation. You can also see on a technical basis there is another trend channel which is in play here. Also not shown is a 50 day moving average. Suffice to say the US dollar, the Dixie at a critical level here. Also want to show you and we're going to get back to currencies in a second that we have volatility coming down. We have the Fed in a blackout period. We have earnings season underway. We have mega cap earnings and focus, Meta's after the bell, Apple's a big one. Everything setting up for a potential rally into the end of the year also based on factors such as the November election. That's just around the corner as well midterm seasonality coming into play. Here is the VIX of the VIX. We can see this second derivative. Maybe it's a third of stock option volatility. This is testing the lowest levels since July. And you take a look at the VIX which is a little bit closer. This is what people usually look at. This is trending down as well. So let's take a look at what's been happening in currencies in a Kiko. You and I follow the Japanese yen on almost a daily basis. The yen is offered by the dollar about 1% today. But I've been looking at the Chinese yuan. This, the Ren Mimbi is down 1.35%. It doesn't seem like a lot, but on an offshore basis, this is the onshore, the offshore, which has been trading since about 2011. This is the steepest decline. I believe on record. So we can see that the US dollar has been strengthened inconsiderably. And we have been concerned that the Chinese yuan may be devalued in a disorderly fashion. That's what happened in 2016 at the very beginning of the year. We'll have to see if there's a repeat of that. But so far, if the mega caps, I believe, can participate here. We do have the impetus for a wrist rally. But we've got to see that US dollar ease and continue to ease as well. Okay. Thanks so much for that, Jared. We're going to stay with the dollar next guest. She believes the greenback is poised to stabilize. I mean, more aggressive ECB and BOE hiking paths toward the end of the year. It comes in a growing evidence that Fed tightening has started to weigh on the US economy, fueling expectations of central bank will temper the pace of its rate hikes. Joining us in studio, we've got Morgan Deldon. She's global ex ETFs head of investment strategy for Europe. Morgan gets a talk to you today. It's certainly fitting when we've started to see a bit of a pullback in the dollar. I was thinking back to even a month ago where we had guests on who were saying it's going to remain high for a very long time. It feels like we made a pivot pretty quickly. Absolutely. I think we are in a turning point because when you look at the rate differential going forward and looking at the past, the...",https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hqIy-Q36neE,27,2022-10-26 15:41:33
4147," It's like we made a pivot pretty quickly. Absolutely. I think we are in a turning point because when you look at the red differential going forward and looking at the past, the ECB and the Bank of England are taking as an aggressive, at least as aggressive as the Fed or even more in the near term, the red differential won't lead to stronger dollar. Then you look at the US economy starting to fill the higher interest rates and probably going to a soft landing scenario. So overall from an economic standpoint, interest rate standpoint, it seems that the dollar is posed to stabilize with increasing downward pressures. What's the expectation on your end? How exactly the Fed moves next? I mean, yes, to your point, there's been sort of slowly this expectation building in about the Fed maybe at least pausing or slowing those rate hikes, but we've got another meeting just around the corner. What are you anticipating then? I think it's really too early to say that the Fed is going to pose like on its hit rate hikes. I do think that the main input for the Fed's decision to continue to prescribe 75 basis points is coming from inflation data. And I do see a case that the Fed continues at this pace until it sees a real inflection point in the CPI numbers, which is not yet materialised. So I do think that the Fed is going to continue to hike 75 basis points next week and potentially in December. But then we'll be not far off the 5% mark, which is probably that or very close to the pick for the Fed's front rate this cycle. The Fed has really been leading the way in terms of how quickly they move, how aggressively they move. When you look at major central banks around the world, you mentioned the ECB, the BOA, of course, the Bank of Japan. In Europe, though, we've already seen a pullback. In the expectation seems to be going into the winter, things could get even worse when you think about where energy prices are going. How aggressively do you think the ECB, for example, will need to move as a result of that? Because they have been moving just a little step behind the Fed. I think we have already passed the peak pessimism across Europe. I think now the economic outlook is becoming more stabilised, which also will help stabilising the Euro-adol currency pair. Because I think when you look at the reserves in terms of energy, we are 88% for. We have very little leverage left on Russia in terms of gas imports. There's about 9% now of what we consume. You also look at the economic data. They haven't reflected a massive downturn. They are looking at some softness, but nothing that is critical. So looking ahead with all this fiscal stimulus coming in continental Europe, and it really gives the ECB the power to step up in terms of interest rate highs and bearing in mind that they are starting from a much lower base than the Fed. So playing catch up there, I think. Finally, really quickly, I know you're focused on Europe, but the Bank of Japan increasingly in focus here. We've seen two interventions as far as we know, in terms of the currency markets, you've got the governor there, Karota stepping down in April. And yet, there's still questions about whether in fact they're going to pull back on this yield curve control given where rates have moved. How big of a risk, when you look at from the European perspective, how big of a risk does what's happening over in Japan, Pau? I think it's so far, the Bank of Japan has kept its accumulative stance despite all the central banks increasing. So I don't think there will be a massive U-turn in Japan. And I think if you look at toward the end of the year, the risk of having a more ockish stance from the Fed, Bank of England and ECB has reduced dramatically, which will help potentially reduce the risk of Bank of Japan having a surprising moving in the coming months. Let's look at the flow a bit. Morgan Deldone, global XETF's head of strategy there. Good to have you on today.

4148," ETFs head of strategy they're good to have you on today. Well coming up spending digital funds as another crypto debit card hits the market and trying to navigate spending limits, regional restrictions and even knowing if staking is needed. We'll discuss with blockchain.com CEO Peter Smith on the other side. We'll check in on the crypto market. We'll see Bitcoin back above 20,000. Well, Ether is back above the $1,500 level, the rally fueled and part by investor optimism. After UK lawmakers voted to recognize crypto as a regulated financial instrument, although the bill still has a way to go before it is passed into law. The crypto market by the way, topping $1 trillion after three weeks under that level. So what is a crypto holder to do with these gains? Our next guest may have an option. Joining us now we've got Yahoo Finance exclusive Peter Smith CEO of blockchain.com joining us as well as Yahoo Finance crypto reporter David Hollerith and Peter you're of course here to announce or debut this new debit card that you're launching in partnership with Visa, also powered by Marquetta. Walk us through how this all works. Yeah, sure. So the idea is that you can take your card. It looks like this. It's a fun little design and you can easily spend from any balance inside your blockchain wallet. So you can spend from your dollar balance, your euro balance, your Bitcoin balance, your Ethereum balance, any of the sort of 30 plus assets inside of your blockchain wallet. And you can toggle between which asset you spend from sort of at any time. We're launching that in the US now and then we'll expand out to you early next year. Peter, we chatted yesterday about why blockchain.com was issuing this debit card now and you said that it came down to a lot of customer demand. But I was curious to just talk more about that and explain exactly how you see customers using crypto to spend on real world goods and services. Because I think there's obviously a lot of questioning about where spending is for crypto. Yeah, so I think you know, as customers, we.",https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hqIy-Q36neE,29,2022-10-26 15:50:13
4149," Because I think there's obviously a lot of questioning about where spending is for crypto. Yeah, so I think as customers become more and more crypto-centric, so they're starting to think about their spending patterns and their financial health from a crypto first angle. They want to be able to spend their assets, their net worth, in daily life. And right now, one of the most challenging parts about being a crypto user is the fact that it's really hard to spend your money to spend your wealth in daily life. Because the links between the crypto system and the traditional banking system are quite tough and frankly slow. And so the reason that we're excited about the card is because it allows people to keep their assets and it keeps their funds inside of the crypto ecosystem, but to be able to spend them in everyday life. Peter, you know this comes out of time and we're sort of seeing the shakedown in the space, trying to figure out who's getting in, who's getting out. From a demand perspective, what does that look like for your card right now? And what does that tell you about where the interest is in the space? Yeah, so we had the wait list open for a really short period of time and we had about 50,000 people sign up for it. And so I think, you know, there's still a lot of demand for crypto products, but you're seeing that demand shift away from sort of trading and more towards folks that are interested in using DeFi, using their balances. You know, right now stablecoin use is growing really quickly on our platform. And so when you look at the assets that people are holding inside of their accounts, you're seeing people hold a lot of stablecoin and big coin frankly. So you're really seeing like a pullback towards quality of crypto assets. Blockchain.com CEO Peter Smith and thank you so much for joining us today and I think to David Hollerith as well for joining in on the conversation.

4150," Welcome back to Yahoo Finance Live. The Chlorox company has announced a recall on some of its multi-surface and all-purpose cleaners that the company says may contain some bacteria. The products recalled by the California-based firm include scented Chlorox propine, propine sole, all-purpose cleaners and Chlorox professional pine sole, lemon fresh cleaners. According to the US Consumer Product Safety Commission, the audience recalled may contain a bacteria that's found widely in soil and water, the Commission's advised consumers to take pictures of the bottles if you have them, throw them away, and contact the company for a refund. When we are getting back into the swing of earnings season, tech is certainly a big focus with Amazon now set to announce their third quarter results Thursday after the bell, from what to expect. Let's bring in Yahoo Finance's Ali Garfinkle. And Ali, we always look to AWS as a big driver for Amazon, but certainly a lot of people want to be looking on the e-commerce site to see to what extent demand has waned. Exactly, Akiko. It's a tense moment for tech earnings overall, and honestly, the read through for Amazon from the other days, Bad Firmetta, which is reporting today, but the read through from Google didn't look good either yesterday. So, you know, there are kind of a couple of things that are analysts are looking for for Amazon right now. The first is you said it, AWS. It's a stalwart of the business. It always went growth at AWS is good for Amazon every single time. The figure I saw was 30% growth is even possible. The second thing that I think is really big is yes, the e-commerce side. We had those prime events, if those prime events generated sales that actually hit the bottom line for Amazon, that could be a big win and go a really long way in getting them to the place where they prove they can be resilient in this really difficult marketplace for tech. And finally, the other question that's always kind of looming in the background with Amazon is this big push we have seen for unions. But we're getting some reports here about at least the push to unionizing California sort of backing off. What's going on there? So, Kiko, I've actually confirmed with the NLRB that union workers at Amazon in Southern California have withdrawn their petition for an election. They were seeking representation by the Amazon Labor Union, which lost the election year Albany last week. So, it's a setback for the unionization effort to be sure. The thing that I've heard from a couple of experts was that for Amazon, big win, for ALU, big loss, however they're not expecting to necessarily see organizing stock in the inland empire in Southern California or across the country. It's a matter of what it looks like. Some momentum has been stripped away, but you also don't only have the Amazon Labor Union operating here at Kiko, right? The other thing to consider is that you do also have, for instance, the teamsters who actually led that walk out in San Bernardino a few weeks ago too. So, it's important to consider there are the unionization efforts. The momentum has stalled a little bit, but I don't expect to see it stop. And it will be looming over earnings and for Amazon for some time still. Okay, Thursday after the bell. It's going to be a busy one for you. Ali, thanks so much for that. Let's do a final check of the markets before we let you go. Ali's just talking about Amazon earnings on Thursday, but today we're going to be looking for the big one meta after the bell and the NASDAQ already down on some of those earnings we got yesterday with Microsoft and Alphabet. Disappointing, at least for investors, that is down about 32 points right now. The Dow up 274 points. That does it for me in this hour. We've got much more to come here on Yahoo Finance Live.

4151," [♪ appeared090 Now I own futures ahead of the opening bell here. We've got just about 15 minutes until the start of trade futures. Currently mixed at this point. The NASDAQ is the lone gainer while you've got the Dow on the SB 500 in negative territory. So question is, has the bear market hit its bottom yet or will we continue to see short lived rallies like last weeks for that? Let's bring in Charles Schwab Chief Investment Strategist Liz Ann Saunders. Liz Ann, great to speak with you as always and get some of your insight around it. So I guess that's the question that we tee up once again. And I feel like we've discussed this time and time again of whether or not we have actually seen a bottom. But if there are three things that would actually indicate that we've hit that bottom, what would that be from your perspective? Well, so we did check a positive box somewhat recently when the market was retesting and ultimately went through its or mid-June lows. There were certain breadth indicators that actually got better. So there were fewer stocks at new lows, even though the overall index was at a new low. That was a positive sign. Unfortunately, as the market is rallied, breadth looks kind of mediocre. So I would have liked to have seen better breadth both on the upside too. I think sentiment had gotten pretty washed out. That establishes a better outlook. But from a more macro perspective, I think what needs to stabilize probably for the worst to be in the rear view mirror would be the housing market. I would specifically look at the NIHB housing market index yields, I think, have to stabilize PMIs and then forward earnings estimates. So from a more macro perspective, that's what I'd look for to get a sense that the worst is over both for the market and the economy. Well, as I know, you're an avid earnings watcher and we're right in the thick of things here. What has been your assessment so far? So weaker than the second quarter, both including energy. So right now, the blended consensus, which is inclusive of companies that have already reported, so that's their actual numbers blended with the consensus for those that are left to report. That's up about 3%. That's down from about 8.5% in the second quarter. If you exclude energy, you go into negative territory about minus 4%, versus minus 2% in the second quarter. So a deceleration. The beat rate is decent, but I think that's in large part due to the much lowered bar that analysts put on consensus since what was the peak in estimates for the third quarter back in the...",https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hqIy-Q36neE,32,2022-10-26 16:03:24
4152," The peak rate is decent, but I think that's in large part due to the much lowered bar that analysts put on consensus since what was the peak in estimates for the third quarter back in the late spring. Listen, I love one of the charts that you actually shared this morning on your Twitter, and particularly it was around the US dollars impact. And particularly within this, this foreign exchange FX headwind that's continued to be cited by companies over the course of this earnings season. I mean, how many earnings periods do you believe that this could still be one of those headwinds that has to be navigated by companies? Well, if the dollar continues, it's a cent than I would say the impact on earnings, which is being felt in earnest in the third quarter, doesn't go away. If for whatever reason you see a retreat in the dollar stabilization, I think it becomes less effective, then you also have the possibility of companies deciding whether or not to hedge. That comes into play, but it's being felt right now. About 40% of S&P revenues and sales are directly tied to overseas sources for big cap tech as a sort of a monolith. That's closer to 60%. And you started to hear more commentary from companies about FX impact, the strength of the dollar impact in the second quarter. Now it's even a greater force, both in terms of the hit for the third quarter, but also forward looking commentary. Are you surprised that expectations around rate hikes by the Fed, they look to be beginning to roll over a bit? They are a bit. I think the estimate is starting to move down for 50 basis points in December versus 75 basis points. I think 75 basis points next week is a lock. It does show you that trend and rate of change always matters. No one would ever look at a 50 basis point hike in isolation as a more diverse stance, but it's all relative to the series of 75 basis point hikes. I think that that's natural for us to be at the point where we start to anticipate, pause or at least a step down. I'm happy that the market is no longer focused on pivot to rate cuts, which was the narrative in play when the market started rallying in mid June. Frankly, I think that narrative made no sense because the conditions to give a green light for the Fed to cut rates, I think, would be much more dire economic environment and or much more significant deterioration in the labor market. So I think this shift back to, okay, maybe a step down to a pause is what we should focus on near term. That seems to me to be more appropriate. By the time that we actually are in a recession and of course it would be well after that perhaps that the NVER would actually determine that we were or have incurred a recession. But all of that considered the market's going to try their best to price that in as far ahead as possible. So when does that kind of market pivot happen even ahead of a Fed pivot, even ahead of a recession actually taking place? I think what makes this a cycle a bit different. Yeah, so market peaked out on January 3rd of this year and we went into a bear market so that obviously does reflect the combination of monetary policy tightening and the impact of tighter financial conditions on the economy regardless of whether or not the NVER ultimately declares it a recession. I think what makes it trickier this time and could maybe elongate the process for the market digesting the economy is the rolling nature of what's been happening in the economy, almost a rolling recession where we're clearly in it with housing and many of housing related things, but the services side has been a positive offset. That's just the nature of the pandemic because the demand surge fueled by stimulus had to be funneled into the good side of the economy because services were not accessible. That was the breeding ground for the inflation problem with which we're still dealing, but we're already seeing disinflation and weak demand on the good side with the offset on the services side. So I think there's this elongated rolling nature to the economic downturn which makes it a bit trickier. It's always tough to call the market as it relates to the economy, but trickier because of the rolling nature of this. It just doesn't get any easier.

Let's stay on all things economy and the consumers. Strikingly, different tone from shipping giant UPS this morning on its earnings report compared to longtime rival FedEx. UPS showing good growth in the U.S. and reaffirming its full year guidance ranges. This comes on the heels of FedEx badly whipping on earnings and on courking a fresh restructuring plan just a few weeks ago, UPS CFO Brian Newman just got off his earnings call and joins us now. We need to see you here. Brian is always just for the lay investor out there. These stories between a UPS and a FedEx are now strikingly different, like I just mentioned. Why do you think you and your team are out executing a FedEx? Hey, Brian. Good morning. It's great to see you. Listen, we have a mantra around here, which is control, which you can control. We've been really focused on doing that over the last couple of quarters. The macros have been challenging domestically and particularly internationally. We've been focused on with softer volumes across the world, really. How do we ensure we drive the right pricing mix and dynamics and also control the cost by doing that? You protect your margins and deliver to the shareholders. I just want to stand that before we jump onto the broader quarter. So you're not out there closing sorting facilities, laying people off. I just want to make sure I have it right. So we are tightening the belt. Certainly at the corporate, we spend a lot of money in GNA. We've been tightening the belt there. But we've been doing that for a couple of years trying to right size the business. Carol introduced a better, not bigger strategy to the company and what that really is optimize the volume that comes into the system. So it's more profitable and then take the cost down. So we have been certainly right sizing the business over the last couple of years. But no, we're not closing sorting facilities right now. We have the ability to take our variable to set up a variable cost down should the case arise. And so where are you seeing continued strength within the business and the customers that you're servicing right now? That's a great question, Brad. The healthcare segment is a particularly strong one. We're doing very, very well there. As you think about the small and medium business, that's been a core focus over the last couple of years. We've been addressing the capabilities that those customers want. And by doing that, you create a wonderful environment for a very profitable customer. So we've been focused on the SMB, small and medium business, the healthcare segment. And then overall trying to look at that international business because there's lots of growth opportunity there for us. We've been talking a lot about FX headwinds, that companies are seeing right now. And when you think about that international business, of course, UPS is going to be rolling out some pricing increases. This also impacts the international segment in December, I believe. And that really going to be reflected as you finally get into 2023 as well. What is your anticipation around where the consumers and the strength that you were just laying out where they'll continue to take that price increase? So we announced a price increase for next year at 6.9%. That's supposed to be representative of a combination of inflation as well as the service we provide. So that'll help drive the...",https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hqIy-Q36neE,34,2022-10-26 16:12:01
4154," increase. So we announced a price increase for next year at 6.9%. That's supposed to be representative of a combination of inflation as well as the service we provide. So that will help drive the base rate in terms of the pricing equation. As we think about the currency impact that you mentioned, Brett, the currency impact in the quarter was about $82 million. So it is a meaningful headwind on our international business, but we're effectively offsetting that as we manage the portfolio across the domestic business and then across some of the other segments. Brian, I recently spoke to another Brian. Brian Cornell over a target for our all market summit conference last week. He's the holiday season is he's expecting to be pretty good. What's your read on things? So Brian and I used to work together at PepsiCoast. I know him and target is a very important customer for UPS. I actually think it's going to be a decent peak season. We're ramping up right now. We're hiring. We hire over 100,000 people for the peak season to get ready. And with cart targets, customers like target, we're out there committing to them that we're going to be there with the excellent service that UPS provide. So I think that Brian that the peak season, our peak season volume goes up 50, 60% from a normal run rate. So it is a meaningful increase. But as we think about peak this year, you don't have the low inventory levels that we saw last year, which drove an earlier peak. People were rushing out to buy because they were afraid the inventory wouldn't be there for the holiday season. This year, inventories are much higher at the retail stores. So I think it'll be a bit of a later peak, Brian. All right, competing against Santa Claus like efficiency there in the logistics business. When you think about some of the future investments as well, they're Brian and going out into next year and even beyond, what are the investments that you would like to see the company get right the first time in order to build a logistical network and a system that can really see its margins excel over the future? So that's a great question, Brad. The digital investments we're making, it's really shifting dynamic of UPS, old school package delivery. To now, it's more of an orchestrator of volume from end to end. We're putting investments into things like RFID technology so that every package in our system will have a code on it that we know where it is. And if there's nothing more frustrating for consumers or customers, when they lose a package or they have an issue, they want to know where that package is by deploying this kind of technology. We're going to be able to tell people where are your packages and how can we recover and make sure we get them there on time for when the customers want them. And we do that at an incredible mid 90s percent in terms of on time delivery. Brian, I made this comment earlier on the show before you came on in. And I said, UPS is benefiting from, of course, having you as CFO, but also Carol too, long time CFO, a home depot before she came to you. Am I off base there? Are you guys just looking at the quarter or your business differently than other big public companies? Brian, it's wonderful to have a boss who used to be a CFO because we have great conversations, but Carol's done an amazing job shifting the culture. So as we think about the future of UPS, the yesterday's UPS is not going to get us tomorrow to where we want to be. We're 115 year old company, very proud of our past, but Carol is shifting the company to a place called Better and Bolder. The bolder is growth and margin improvement. And so where is that going to come from? Areas of basically leaning into the most attractive parts of the market. I mentioned SMB. Margians are great. It's a very attractive area. Healthcare. That's a high growth, high margin area. International. We're actually number two and three in a number of markets overseas. So we're focused on ceiling revenue share, value share as we call it and going out there. So we're putting our investments in those areas that will be accreted from an investment perspective. UPS CFO, Brian Newman. Thanks so much for joining us here this morning and breaking down the most recent quarter. Appreciate it. Thanks, Brian. Brian Brad. Thank you.",https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hqIy-Q36neE,35,2022-10-26 16:16:20
4155," you For employees with low hourly income and low earned income with no impact. What percentage of healthcare services are now trained and patient areas have been addressed and big, targeted but moderate the US's economic outlook. But we'll hawkish Fed, pull the US into recession, and how is the business cycle playing out compared to previous recessions? SAP Global Ratings, Chief Economist, Beth Ann, Bavino joins us. Now, Beth Ann always nice to get some time with you. This morning, we are waiting for a lot of earnings. You have Coca-Cola out here raising prices by 12%. We just talked to UPS and CFO saying, they don't really see any signs of per se a recession in their business looking for a good holiday season. Do you think we just avoid our recession? We have a baseline in our forecast for a recession. We think it's going to be a very shallow one. But a recession nonetheless is largely because of affordability issues, both because of still incredibly high prices, as you just noted, by the increase in final prices for US households, as well as affordability tied to interest free hikes. So in both cases, we think the consumers will slow down dramatically leading into a very shallow recession for early next year. Interesting. So with that in mind, where do you believe the mindset of the consumer would be by that point? Well, we're looking at the numbers from a consumer confidence a bit weaker than what we in market had expected. The idea is there that even that we expected a little bit not as extreme, largely because we saw a bit of a pickup in the stock market, as well as pooling of gasoline prices. Well, that's not enough for consumers. We're still disappointed. And because it's not just about gasoline, it's about affordability and pretty much all aspects of society, particularly for shelter, not just home purchasing a home, but also renting a home. And that means less money to spend elsewhere. People are squeezed and we do think that we'll find we'll buckle. Bethan, I've really been surprised by how many or how much price increases, a lot of these big companies have been reporting in recent weeks as they've come out with earnings. I continue to double-gen, double-gen increases for products and services, really for the second quarter in a row. When does it stop? When are we beyond these double-digit increases? Well, we're expecting to see eventually one of the reasons the good news about a recession, it also brings lower prices. And the big question of is, what if consumers do slow down as we expect? That means there's going to be more inventory on businesses' books. So if we do do see a sleep, sleep slow down for consumers, then we end up seeing as a lot of inventory used to be unloaded. And unfortunately, those at that inventory is unloaded at lower prices. So in a deep, indeed, the fact gets us wish in the end. But of course, there's a cost to both businesses and consumers as well. We've got a lot of companies that have started reporting earnings fast and furious in this most recent quarter. But the forward guidance here is going to be the big question. What are your expectations for where companies will continue to either reiterate their guidance or for some of them? We've already seen that, at least in the case of SNAP. No, a specific name. But where they might start to say, you know, what we have to either pull back our guidance or just pull it in entirety. And what net impact would that have? Well, speaking from an economic position, again, I don't cover particular industries or companies. But I can say that given this environment, this is a classic overpeeding situation for the United States, where the Fed has to come in and be incredibly aggressive. Understandably, we have core inflation still at a 40-year high on a year over your basis. So they have to move. And with that said, what I suspect we could see for those businesses that switched from just to...",https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hqIy-Q36neE,36,2022-10-26 16:20:39
4156," for inflation still at a 40-year high on a year over your basis. So they have to move. And with that said, what I suspect we could see for those businesses that switched from just in time in inventory accumulation to just in case inventory of accumulation, that means that they're going to be squeezed. And so I suspect the floor of guidance would be basically what happens to profits when we have to unload all those inventories. That's where I suspect we can see some activity, particularly for retail, the retail sector, who have been holding on to things. But I suppose other areas would be squeezed as well. Within your outlook, Beth Ann, for a mild recession, is the economy shedding jobs? Are we talking about non-farm payroll reports where maybe there's 50,000 jobs should? In our business cycle barometer, the one indicator that is still showing positive, everything else is neutral or negative and extremely negative. But the one area that we're seeing still positive territories in that jobs market that you pointed to, we're looking at job openings coming down, slowing down, but still rather high. So the question is, our business is canceling that job opening and still want to hold on to those workers. I suspect in certain areas that we're going to see the crunch retail I mentioned, housing. Also, I suspect we're going to see some kind of a cutting of jobs, but overall, we suspect a mild impact on jobs. And we do expect to see the unemployment rate rise, but we're looking at something that's going to be by 2024, about 5.5%. In normal times, that's what we used to get to. So indeed, we'll see a pickup, but nothing dramatically. Dramatically so. Bethan Bovino, S&P Global Ratings, US Chief of Combs. Always good to see you. Talk to soon. We'll talk to currently looking positive across all three Great thunderstorms that are here. side factors joining us now is Barry Bannister, Chief Equity Strandis at C. Fullbury. We could all use some positive news after the last month that we've had. Certainly we have seen gains pick up over the last few weeks on this expectation potentially of a Fed pivot. What are you watching right now in terms of levels that that really you think could push things in the right direction? Well, you know a lot of the bad news was known and we had a violent sell-off in the first 10 months of this year. If you look at the nominal peak of the S&P 500 index, it was 4,800 on January 3rd, but the real inflation adjusted purchasing power peak was 5,100 on December 29th. So we fell about 31.5%, which if you look at the 14 bear markets since 1947, in the post-World War II era really, the 14 bear markets associated with recessions, the average and what we call the trend mean taking out the highest in the lowest was 31.7%.",https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hqIy-Q36neE,37,2022-10-26 16:25:01
4157," The trend mean taking out the highest and the lowest was 31.7. So we had a bear market, an ambitious malling bear market due to fed policy. But when we analyze all the fixed income, currency, futures, political, economic, geopolitical factors, we come up with a view that if the Fed is not turning the dial to tighten every single day, that's effectively a second derivative easing. In other words, not raising the volume is a form of lowering the volume. And I don't think the Fed gets tighter than what's embodied in futures. In fact, I think futures are probably overstated in May of 2023 at nearly 5% on short rates. Inflation is going to come down. Any first year economic student in college could do what we did. All you do is break down inflation into its sub components and all of them point down. So Barry, does that mean that you're in the camp that you think the Fed could potentially pause some of these rate hikes because you think that inflation is starting to show some signs of moderating and that the Fed can't move to aggressively. Well, we look at GDP right on a quarterly annualized. So we take the most recent quarter, we annualize it, multiply it to the fourth power. We annualized GDP. Well, let's annualize inflation. So CPI inflation for the three months ended September, annualized was only 2%. Yes, it's 2%. So the momentum of inflation has already turned down. If you take the core, it consists of services and that is shelter services. So that would be housing related. Those are already turning down. Yes, there's a lag, but they are turning down decisively. On rents, home prices, you saw the data today. You look at non-shelter services. Wages are the key driver and wages such as the land to Fed, wage tracker and average hourly earnings year to year change. And hopefully, on the 28th, the employment cost index all points down. So again, you know, you have to steer the ship with a long lead time. The Fed knows that and they've done their job. They flatten the curve by end of year. The curve will be completely flat if not inverted in some points, obviously, 10 to 2s. But as they do that, we have to be ahead of that. We have to think, okay, well, the Treasury is worried about bond market liquidity. Treasury Secretary Yellen, former chair Yellen of the Fed made a statement yesterday. The Treasury is intently focused on bond market risk due to liquidity and other concerns. So if the market is always a head of reality, we have to get ahead of that. And so it looks to us like there'll be a rally October to April. I wouldn't overstate the rally. There are a lot of tail risks later in 23. But again, the market is always looking ahead and we're trying to keep up with it. And I admit, it's a really hard job. So Barry, you mentioned some key risks there that could derail that upwards climb to 4300. One of them being oil shots. What's the big concern there right now? The G7 and the West collectively are desperately trying to establish what's called a buyer's cartel on Russian oil. And naturally, and you can't blame them, OPEC Plus, which is OPEC's many member states plus Russia, they don't want with their sellers cartel to have a competing buyer's cartel. So they're not cooperating and they shouldn't cooperate. That would just be a logical to expect them to do so. So the early December, there is this planned cap on Russian oil. That could create tremendous volatility. Russia has a lot of avenues. I personally would be thinking they might target the CPC pipeline out of Kazakhstan to reduce flows without cutting their own production to drive the price up. And if oil rockets higher, oil is at the core of inflation. This is what the ESG people never understood. That all energy is, all GDP is the conversion of energy. And because of some of the dragging risks on GDP growth, demographics, debt, we don't have the kind of growth we used to have. And as a consequence, we...",https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hqIy-Q36neE,38,2022-10-26 16:29:20
4158," of energy. And because of some of the dragging risks on GDP growth, demographics, debt, we don't have the kind of growth we use to have. And as a consequence, we need cheap energy. And so more expensive energy is not going to solve this problem. So if energy goes up, that's the core of inflation. That drives everything, including core CPI and core PCE. So we don't need an oil shock. And that's the risk here. I remember the 1970s very well. We had a 73, 74 oil embargo. And then in 79, we had a second oil shock due to the shower around falling in Iran. We don't need that. And so geopolitically, I think we've got some very poor diplomatic policy out of Washington. And hopefully they don't drive us over the edge with a secondary oil shock, having already depleted the strategic petroleum reserve. Steve Fultc chief equity strategist Barry Bannister. It's good to talk to you today. Appreciate the time. Thank you. Let's switch gears and go back to shares of General Motors. A company we've been tracking all morning here. That stock is up 3.5%. After the company posted a big earnings beat, but maintained its guidance for a deeper dive in the auto space. That's bringing an auto blog editor in chief. Greg Migliore. Greg, good to talk to you today. We were kind of diving through the numbers with our auto correspondent, Praz earlier, who said, look, it feels like at least with the GM story, things have started to turn the corner. Things are looking a little better on supply chains, the chip shortage in terms of inventory. What was your big take away from the numbers we got this morning? Sure. Well, good morning. Thanks for having me back. General Motors had a record third quarter for revenue based on profitable sales. It trucks of SUVs in North America. They really got the supply chain under control, which quite simply allowed them to make and sell more vehicles. It really wasn't a rocket science. It all really came together for them in the last quarter. They also had a lot of good publicity, too. They had the reveal of the GMC Sierra and the Chevy Equinox electric vehicles. Even the Chevy Bolt, which is their smaller electric crossover in car, had strong sales numbers. It bounced back from some recall issues that they had had previously. So this is basically General Motors near-term strategy. Sell lucrative trucks of SUVs to fund the electric vehicle programs. And they do this while consumers and sort of the company figure out what's to come next as far as EVs. And how do you see demand shaping up, especially with some of those EV trucks that you say will be the revenue driver that accelerates the transition or the company's transition to all EVs? I think of the next couple years, you're going to see demand really increase for some of these vehicles from General Motors. They're really targeting high-volume segments like the Sierra and the Silverado. These are full-size pickup trucks. They already sell a lot of vehicles with internal combustion engines in these segments. So quite simply adding some electric versions. I mean, it's really a part of the market where they can capture and grow market share. And that's actually what they did in the third quarter. They their market share hovered around 16%, which was up from about 13% a year ago.",https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hqIy-Q36neE,39,2022-10-26 16:33:41
4159," actually what they did in the third quarter. They, their market share hovered around 16%, which was up from about 13% a year ago. Now that might not sound like a lot, but in the auto industry, it's so competitive, just to get even a sliver of market share. So to me, that was another sign that things are going in the right direction for general motors. Looking ahead here, Greg, we're gonna be watching for numbers out from four. This is another one of those legacy companies that has gone through a lot of transition in the process of going all electric, including staff cuts. How do you think that's gonna be reflected in the quarterly numbers? I think it'll be a little too early to tell as far as some of the moves that they've made just in the last couple quarters, how that will shake out for Ford's bottom line. What's interesting to me is how they're setting up their electric vehicles and their turtle combustion vehicles is almost like separate units, and they're gonna break those out and display those numbers in the future. I think that'll be, that'll paint an interesting picture as far as where Ford is right now and where they're going in the future. It's a very creative approach to accounting to reporting financial numbers. So we'll be looking to see how that lands. Okay, that stock, at least getting a lift from GM's numbers today too. Audible, editor, in chief, Greg Migliori. We're good to talk to you today. We'll be now to the New York Stock Exchange, oil and gas investment vehicle, Granite Ridge making its market debut today via a SPAC, the company, backed by former house speaker Paul Ryan, Ranging the opening bell this morning and joining us to discuss. We've got Paul Ryan, of course, former Speaker of the House and Chairman of the Executive Network Partner and Corporation SPAC. We've also got Luke Brandenburg, who's Granite Ridge CEO. And it's great to have both of you on today. Speaker, I want to start with you first because it's been a rough patch coming here. We were just alluding to some of the big exodus that you saw in terms of investors. Well, they saw that you were partnering up with Granite. Talk to me about how you're thinking about this as you mark this milestone moving forward. Yeah, well, it's a pretty tough market for any company trying to go public. So we were very careful in who we chose as partners because we wanted to get it done and stick to the landing like we did today. So that's why we're very excited to be partnering with these Granite Ridge guys. We wanted to find a business that had very good balance sheet. These guys are unlevered, they got good free cash flow. And it's in a very, very attractive sector, oil and gas. They're not operating oil and gas platform company. So we wanted to find someone that we knew should go public and would be able to make it through the distance. So that we're really excited to partner with these guys. Luke, when you think about the space oil and gas certainly been very lucrative this year. We have seen some of these big oil majors hit key records in earnings as we look ahead to the winter and looking at the headwinds, whether it's within the US but globally on demand as well as supply. How do you think about the investment environment in the space right now? I think we're starting to see just a lot more positive investors sentiment than we had for quite some time. I think that the storyline about oil and gas is really changing and you're seeing that transition to how important energy security is, energy reliability both on a national and even more so now on an international scale. And so it's been great. I'd say investor in bounds.",https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hqIy-Q36neE,40,2022-10-26 16:38:15
4160," Seeing that transition to how important energy security is energy reliability, both on a national and even more so now on an international scale. And so it's it's been great. I'd say investor in-bounds were quite quiet for some time, but we're starting to see that pick up and folks that are really more interested in what we're doing. And so it's it's certainly something that's great to see on the day that you're bringing the bell in the exchange. And look to what extent do you see that accelerating going into the winter where we're really expected to see a crunch and supply? Well, I think that it's a great question, Kiko. And I really think that this is a defining moment that the fact of the matter is a really cold winter will create immense pressure on the global energy supply chain. And I think a lot of investors are looking at that. They want to prepare for it. And I hope that the takeaway is that this is something that we need to focus on for the long term. And that we're able to have some resilient investors in the space that are willing to just stay in and truly understand what we can do in the big picture. Speaker, now that we have you on, we do have to talk about the midterms or what just two weeks out exactly from where things stand. It felt like a month ago we were talking about this momentum for Democrats on some of the social issues including abortion. The latest polls show a big swing in favor of Republicans and the economy. What do you think shifted in the last month? The economy, I think, years look everybody knows we're in or headed to an inflation to a recession. The last headline inflation numbers, core inflation numbers were really high. So I think people got more concerned about their pocketbooks, about jobs, about what the economy is going to look like than they were about social issues. And I think you write. I think the Democrats peaked probably in August, maybe early September. But now I think people are much, much more concerned about the direction of the economy. Democrats are not, they don't pull nearly as well on the economy. I think they try to wreck it basically with bill back better. I'm not a big fan of the inflation reduction act. And they try to do much worse tax policy. They didn't. So I think what voters want to do is set a check on Washington. They don't want one party rule by the left. And that's why I really feel pretty confident in saying that we're going to win the House. And I think we got a really good chance to win in the Senate. And I think in a large measure because voters want to check on all this left-word lurch. And they want some calm economic policies. And so that's why I think we're peaking at the right time. That's why I think the momentum is with us right now. And so yeah, two weeks out, I feel very good, much better than I felt, say back in August. Obviously, you know, we watched the midterms always to see a gauge of where things could go two years from now in the presidential election. And you made some headlines recently where you said that you believe that former president Trump would be unelectable, come 2024. And yet we're looking at some very competitive races in places like Arizona, places like Pennsylvania, where there are Trump-backed candidates who are polling pretty well. So what do you make of that disconnect there? I mean, why do you think that's been the case if you don't know that? They are not him. They are not him. And look, we lost the House, the Senate and the White House, in the span of two years with Trump. Never before is my party lost as much that fast. So my point is, come 2024, we want to win. We want to beat Biden or the Democrats, whoever they're running. And we know it's just a factual statement, polling wise, we are worse off with Trump as our nominee than with somebody else. So I just think it's going to be palpable in 2024 that because we want to win and beat the Democrats, we know as a party we're better off with somebody else to be our nominee, to more guarantee a victory, because we know we lose with Trump. It's the suburban voter. They're the big difference maker. I can tell you, in Wisconsin, 64,000 Wisconsinites voted for all the Republicans on the ballot and not Donald Trump. That gets translated across the country in the swing states. It's a huge difference maker. So I just think from just winning, we are going to want to win come 2024. And that means we need to elect somebody to be our nominee that's going to better deliver a victory. And I think it's going to be pretty well known at that time. Luke, you know, when you think about what's been playing out in the energy space, there's been a lot made of some tensions between the Biden administration, as well as the oil and gas companies in terms of, you know, the lack of investment or at least as the White House season. If in fact, these predictions hold, we're talking about a Republican majority in the House, potentially in the Senate. How do you see that shifting that strategy around energy moving forward? I think that the goal and what we really hope to accomplish is just a rational conversation about energy. What you're seeing in particularly midterm season.",https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hqIy-Q36neE,41,2022-10-26 16:42:32
4161," You just have folks that are taking one extreme side, one of the other. Either pider carbons need to go away forever or how do carbons need to stay forever. The fact the matter isn't, and Speaker Ryan has said this before, we needed all of the above strategy. And to get there, we just need a rational conversation. I'd say that's the most frustrating part for folks that are in the industry. You've got hundreds of thousands, millions of people that are coming to work every day working hard, trying to create oil and gas, to create energy, to provide energy security and reliability. And then you go out and the President of your country is condemning you for doing that. And it's not fun. I really hope that we can create a more practical conversation where we can have a real dialogue about what is the best way, 10 years, 20 years, 30 years, to power this country, and to power the world and the growth that we anticipate seeing. Yeah, I would just say, Kiko, look, American oil and gas producers are the cleanest producers, they're the most efficient producers. This is really good for American jobs. It's good for bringing the inflation down and it's very good for foreign policy to be able to give our allies access to our oil and gas. And by the way, gas is a great bridge fuel to a lower carbon future. So I think it's an attractive sector. I think it's very good for America. And I do believe that my friends in Congress, when they take the majority, which I think they will, understand this. And they're going to bring some more common sense conversation to the whole energy discussion. Let's talk about one more thing that could potentially flare up again, depending on the outcome, we should say, of the midterms, the debt ceiling. This is another fight that could potentially emerge as a flashpoint, come 2023. You're a veteran of that. And I wonder how you're thinking about the Republicans using this as leverage. Do you think they should be, or is it time to abolish the debt ceiling altogether? I've been through so many debt. I can't even count how many debt ceiling fights I've been through. America's going to keep its full faith in credit. We're not going to re-knick on the debt. And yeah, always. Democrats have done this to Republicans. Democrats have done this to Democrats. It's a moment for a fiscal, it's a fiscal-impasse moment where you should get a down payment on good fiscal policy. I was on the Bulls Simpson Commission, which Democrats held hostage in order to get a commission during the debt limit debate. So we've had spending caps on debt limit debates. We've had so many fiscal policies being attached to debt limit because you don't want to just keep rubber stamping more borrowing. You want to try and get some kind of policy in place to get the curve in going in the right direction, try and bend the curve on debt. We will have a debt crisis in this country in the not-to-distant future if we don't get our fiscal house in order. And so I think it's a very important point. Having said all of that, I'm very confident that the U.S. dollar is secure and that our bonds we paid and that the full faith in credit of the United States government is going to be intact in this divided government that we're likely to have in the future. All right, and former Speaker of the House and Chairman of the Executive Network Partner Incorporations Pack and Luke Brandenburg, Granite Ridge CEO, thanks to both of you today really appreciate the time. Thank you, Keith. It really is nice to be cheering you. you you The company saying this morning in a news release quote, yees recent comments and actions.",https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hqIy-Q36neE,42,2022-10-26 16:46:57
4162," Kanye West also goes by yay over a string of anti-Semitic remarks. The company saying this morning in a news release quote, Yees recent comments and actions had been unacceptable, hateful, and dangerous and they violated the company's values of diversity and inclusion, mutual respect and fairness. Joining us now for a discussion on all this, Anjali Jenshin Donate, practitioner and residence at the University of New Haven and Sam Pozer, Williams trading senior equity analyst nice to have you both. Anjali will start with you. Why do you think it took Adidas so long to make what appeared to be an obvious move? You know, I think the financial implications really had their team thinking of how do they resolve this. We're in the fourth quarter. Everyone's racing to get to December and sales are really stressed. We have the holiday sales. We have aging inventory and this may have been their priority before they made the decision to really communicate what their brand values are and where they stand. Sam, you see the stock off just over 3% today. Adidas without the Yeesy partnership, what does that look like from a business perspective? Well, I mean, I thought when Kanye left Nike that really, Kanye wanted the keys to the castle at Nike, Adidas decided to give it to him and probably at the end of the day, it'll be better for Adidas. Even though in the short term, likely, you know, they're going to lose some revenue. Are you surprised the stock is down just 3% Sam and do you think the hesitation had something to do with the CEO transition, which happens early next year? I mean, the estimates are that I think it's about $2 billion that Kanye brings in and if that's accurate, I mean, I don't think those decisions are difficult. You know, I think as somebody mentioned earlier, they were one of the first ones to put it under root to put their agreement with him under review. I'm really messaging or reputation. Let's start there means everything to a brand. When you take a look at what that messaging then should be from Adidas at this point, since it did take them so long to respond, what are the next steps that they need to take in order to win back? Maybe some of the customers who don't necessarily trust them right now? Well, that's what that's what it's all about is they've really broken trust with their customers and now they're really going to have to repair that. Being able to communicate and communicating immediately and getting in front of the crisis is important. When it comes to crisis management with any brand working with a celebrity, you need to have this in place crisis management. You can't control what a celebrity is going to say, but you need to know what your action will be and your leadership needs to be aligned on what messaging will be. What for the best plan for the worst? Interesting. Sam, I want to ask you about another statement that was part of Adidas announcement and it said it was interesting that lead you to wonder what's coming. Adidas is the sole owner of all design rights to existing products as well as previous and new colorways under the partnership. We may not know more until November 9th when they report. Does that lead you to believe Adidas may try to keep this brand alive under some different name and is there a legal challenge ahead? I was starting with the last question. I don't know. There already are, if you look at the website, some interpretations of some of the Kanye product under the Adidas logo and I believe that may have been one of the reasons why Kanye was potentially trying to sever that relationship prior to today's announcement anyway. These agreements that were made in the one with Nike and so on, the designs belong to belong to the company, not to Kanye. What they're going to do and how that will be received, I think are to be determined. And my guess is given that Adidas is looking for a new CEO, that's not going to be an upcoming earnings revelation. I'm going to put a similar question to you, but what do you think from a branding perspective, from a marketing perspective, that they should do with the designs that they have from the easy collection?",https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hqIy-Q36neE,43,2022-10-26 16:51:27
4163," the partnerships that can support them. The whole premise with working with him was to really attract a young customer. Gen Z, Gen X, millennials, they were attracted to this type of merchandise. If they have a gap in their portfolio, they need to think long-term and they need to look at a strategy that'll be beneficial, not rely on a personality or celebrity. And how they do that, they'll really need to think about how they really reinvent their in-house design team. Onjali, for other companies, let's just say in this sector, what is the lesson here in terms of crisis management? Crisis management, your brand is your hero. So that is your voice and that's your messaging. So if you're gonna do any type of partnership, you need to really evaluate the risk at hand. You need to be able to have a plan and understand what that roadmap looks like. Branding is about creating a value proposition. And when you are messaging anything, everything communicates. So really focus on your brand as the hero. Your product is the hero and your messaging is what pulls customers in. That's what people are attracted to, your brand values and your voice. Sam, you cover footlocker and the note that you just put out this morning, you said that Adidas cutting ties with Kanye will have an immediate effect further increase challenges facing a footlocker today. What does that look like? Well, I mean, so Nike, we believe that Nike has reduced their allocations to footlocker. We think it's in the $800 million to $1 billion at cost. And they also plan to expand their business with Adidas over the next few years to about $2 billion. The only sort of instant sell out rapid sell out category of shoes they had from Adidas was Kanye. So that's a lot of business gone right away. And from what we understand, other parts of Adidas aren't doing quite as well. And as I wrote in the note, footlocker has a lot of open to buy dollars to buy things other than Nike. The question was and probably is more magnified today is do the consumers have the open to purchase when all that new product shows up that's not Nike. And that, given what happened with Kanye today, that just got a lot worse for footlocker. With the phrase, Not every day that law's Angela's gets news of less traffic, but that is indeed the case. Unfortunately, it won't help you with your morning commute much. Check out the view of the Port of Los Angeles in 2021, massive backups of container ships, the marine exchange of Southern California posting this picture just last week showing a relatively clear view. Read you understand that this concept of insurance performs a lot of naming",https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hqIy-Q36neE,44,2022-10-26 16:56:07
4164," the marine exchange of Southern California posting this picture just last week showing a relatively clear view. Jeans Rok, a port of Los Angeles executive director joining us now in studio. Good to see you, sir. Thanks for being out here on the other coast. It is dramatic. 109 ships in January. Seven this week is as good news or bad. No, it really is good news and good afternoon to you both. We went from 109 down to 20 by the month of June down to single digits by July all while breaking records five of the first seven months of the year, nearly going box for box with our record setting 20-21. The difference, getting that cargo off the terminals and into the American economy. So Jeans, this doesn't have anything to do then with a pullback and consumer spending, weakening economy, anything like that. Is that factoring in at all here? Not really. Just a few months we've seen a softening for two main reasons. One, importers brought in their cargo a little bit earlier than normal. June and July were our peak season months this year. They didn't want to get in the backups that they had witnessed in the last couple of years. And two, our dock workers negotiation on a new coast wide contract with their employers' association is going on a little bit longer and slower than many would like. And importers have shifted cargo to the east and Gulf Coast where we're now unfortunately seeing backups of ships. I do want to return to the employment labor status and moment, but you're not seeing an overall lower demand internationally. No, not really. And here's why. July, August and September, consumer spending numbers were flat, but still elevated compared to 2019. We as consumers are still buying at a fairly high clip compared to what we've normally been used to doing, even though we're spending more on restaurants, movies and the airplanes are very full. Gene, you mentioned volumes are cooling some of those cargo ships now being directed to the southern ports or to the eastern ports. What are you doing or are you doing anything to try and recapture some of those, some of that demand? Oh, thousand percent. Both the employers and the union have put out two media releases jointly signed, unprecedented from my view point, saying that we will not strike, we will not lock out our workers, have confidence that these gateways will still work and they are productivity has never been higher. So we're out knocking on doors, beating on the drum, making sure that folks know we've got a short amount of time left before the all important retail holiday season. We've got to get the goods to market. LA is open for business. What are you seeing in the reduced costs of shipping globally? Really now it's getting interesting because that spot market rate has declined precipitously over the last several months. Now in the Trans-Pacific theater running from Asia to the United States, most of that business is contracted annually and some decided to go multi-year on their agreements. The spot market is not a majority of the business but it does have an influence when these rates drop like they have on what folks are going to be looking at in the quarters upcoming. And Jim, we've talked a lot about the shortage of truckers in the past, also the headwinds when it comes to some of the rails and the ability to get some of the product out. Where do those headwinds stand? Are they still a big challenge for the port of LA? Yeah, the supply chain is always in need of improvement, constant movement forward. What we've seen right now is that earlier this year, the rail volume increased by six fold and we collectively as an industry have had trouble keeping up with that. Until the recent eight weeks, we've seen rail volume idling at the port of Los Angeles dropped by more than 50 percent, same with those aging containers. I think we finally had the breakthrough on the rail that we finally needed. Truck volume has really moved in really well. The time a container sits at the port of LA before it moves out by truck is at pre-pandemic times, meaning it's moving very fast. Circling back to the labor agreement which expired in July, what are the big holdups? When do you expect a deal to get done? Collective bargaining is hard. This is really tough work. We're not only trying to put a coast-wide contract together for all 22,000 workers and the 29 ports that they support, but with those 29 ports you have all local issues that must be solved in parallel with the big coast-wide agreement. There's going to be continued work. We've got season professionals at the table on both sides and as I mentioned, the service level has not deteriorated one Iota.",https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hqIy-Q36neE,45,2022-10-26 17:00:11
4165," In your work, we've got season professionals at the table on both sides. And as I mentioned, the service level has not deteriorated one Iota. We'll keep moving this cargo and let these folks concentrate on getting this deal done. We'd like to see it done now so we can send that market signal that we're ready. Are you confident though you'll get a deal before your end? That remains in question. And we're going to continue to work with all stakeholders I know from the Biden administration through Governor Newsom's office, Los Angeles Mayor Eric Arsetti, and all of us pushing both sides to stay at the table and chip away at these issues. The sooner, the better for the American economy. In this episode of influencers, SEC chair Gary Gunsler. I come with a deeply markets background. I really believe in markets. I think markets are critical part of our economy, but regulated markets. Events in Eastern Europe just, you know, sort of highlight once again the importance of cyber resiliency. If you're raising money from the public, the public's anticipating some profit based on the efforts of those folks raising the money, that comes within the definitions of a security and the securities laws. And it's it's kind of straightforward. Hello, everyone, and welcome to influencers. I'm Andy Sirware and welcome to our guest Gary Gunsler, chair of the Securities and Exchange Commission. Gary Gunsler was sworn into office as the 33rd chair last April. And in a little under a year in office, he's pushed the SEC right into the middle of the conversation surrounding cryptocurrency, meme stocks, and other issues as well. Chair Gunsler, thanks so much for joining us. Andy, it's so good to be with you and your viewers. Thank you. Whole lot to get to, but I want to start with the news in Ukraine, especially the reaction from the business community, the New York Stock Exchange recently moved to temporarily halt trading for Russia based companies. Have you been monitoring that and should it be a permanent ban? So just stepping back from any one circumstance, the staff of the SEC are monitoring markets as we do through these times, through throughout the whole time that I've been at the agency, it's not just about the geopolitical events in Eastern Europe. But yes, they're monitoring. We're staying close to those events. We're talking to our colleagues at the US Department of Treasury and across the financial regulatory complex, the Federal Reserve, and other regulators, as well as globally to regulators. And the banking and the securities fields across the globe, just to stay close and monitoring events with these really unusual events out of Eastern Europe and war in Ukraine. Do you feel you have enough transparency into US corporate exposure to Russian assets and the Russian economy? Do you have worries about hidden US connections as the Russian economy may be headed for recession or worse? Well, and I'm going to stick to our remitt at the Securities and Exchange Commission, which is about overseeing yes, $100 plus trillion capital markets, and ensuring that they're fair and orderly, efficient, and in these unusual times, we're monitoring for that. But I do feel that we've had good dialogue with major market participants in the fund area, broker dealer area, the exchanges, the clearing houses, and at least for these handful of days so far, the market functions have been operating relatively well. But what comes tomorrow, what comes in the future, we're monitoring against.",https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hqIy-Q36neE,46,2022-10-26 17:04:26
4166," relatively well, but what comes tomorrow, what comes in the future, we're monitoring against, you know, events as they come. I understand it's not straight ahead into your remit, but obviously as you suggest yourself, there are implications potentially and potential even systemic risk to the global macro system. One last question here, Chair Gensler, about that though, are there other actions the SEC is taking or considering taking in response to what's going on in Ukraine and Russia. Again, we're staying alert and monitoring, we're staying close with the rest of the financial stability oversight, council agencies and our colleagues around the globe. If you look at funds under management, the total multiples of tens of trillions of dollars of assets under management here in the US, only a very small percentage well, we've measured well below 1%, in fact, only a fraction of 1% are invested in Russian securities or ADR has traded overseas and things like that. Yes, we're going to continue to monitor, especially stay alert for any cyber risks or any other market functioning risks. But I think that's that's that's what our role is and then to ensure for our three part mission investor protection capital formation and then that in the middle, the fair orderly and efficient markets. Sounds good. Let me ask you about crypto, which is part of your purview, I guess, increasingly and something you've been considering a lot lately. I know last time you were on with Yahoo Finance, the prospects for a spot Bitcoin ETF came up and you had a lot of questions about how investor protection would work there have your concerns been alleviated is approval coming, do you think. We at the SEC are technology neutral, but we're anything but public policy neutral and so this investment class, a little less than $2 trillion of assets, a valuation in crypto currencies, if you wish, or crypto tokens, Bitcoin and all the other tokens is a is a highly investable asset at this point in time, many tens of millions of people around the globe have chosen to put some of their savings into this space. And so it's every bit is important to have investor protection for crypto exchanges for the lending platforms where people are transacting, buying and selling crypto tokens and have appropriate disclosure about the tokens themselves and protect the public from fraud and manipulation. And that's that's really what we're looking at. And yes, as you said, the SEC has a role to play other agencies do as well, but the SEC has a role to play because Congress painted with a broad brush. And if you're raising money from the public, the public's anticipating some profit based on the efforts of those folks raising the money that comes within the definitions of a security and the securities laws, and it's it's kind of straightforward. And I remember saw that that was an opportunity to mislead the public to sell a to sell a shame transaction to that the public could make a decision the basic bargain the public gets to decide on their investments, as long as those promoters raising money are giving full and fair disclosure. And there's basic laws about protecting against fraud in essence lies about what's going on. And sort of following up there, you also told us that you hope this this year crypto trading exchanges.",https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hqIy-Q36neE,47,2022-10-26 17:09:01
4167," would come within the public policy perimeter. Yeah, look, we had just a couple of weeks ago, working with one of the larger lending platforms, where a platform was taking money in, it's public, it's BlockFi, 600,000 or so, retail accounts and institutional accounts, people putting their crypto assets at risk with BlockFi, BlockFi then saying we'll give you a return on an account. And we were trying to bring those parties in, in that case that was, they were not following the securities laws, the securities laws, investment company laws and the securities act laws. So does that mean though that the exchanges will come under SEC regulation, strictly speaking to you? So it's just, just do a little bit of probability here. I'm sort of a math guy. I was when I was a kid, my identical twin brother and I, you know, that's kind of who we were and everything. But these platforms often have not just dozens, but hundreds or thousands of tokens on their platforms. And these tokens back to the securities laws, many of them, without prejudging any one of them, many of them may well be securities. Probabilities or that these platforms, there's 10 or 15 large platforms, these crypto trading platforms have 75 to 5,000 tokens on them, probabilities or they have securities on them. Our laws are straightforward. We're supposed to register as an exchange where people are buying and selling those securities. And yes, many tokens, many crypto tokens have been found in the past to be securities. And I'm not trying to prejudge any one token, but probability weighted. There are many of these tokens on these platforms.",https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hqIy-Q36neE,48,2022-10-26 17:13:32
4168," you you both so what's the probability then if you waving a wand and saying okay you guys are now I don't think you the law is clear yeah the law is clear it's not about waving a wand congress talk about this in 1934 they amended these laws multiple times since over nine decades and a platform that has securities wanted is in exchange it's question whether they're registered or they're operating outside of the law and I'll leave it at that Are you concerned chair gensler about the decrease in the number of public companies in the US and I know there's arguments about how extreme that decreases nonetheless that is there look fewer today in the were 20 years ago and then the fact that private companies grow into deck of unicorns and our great investments perhaps but they're unavailable to ordinary investors they're only available to the people on sand hill road and how that might be exacerbating inequality in this country so I think that we have vibrant capital markets this hundred plus trillion dollar capital markets that are kind of the envy of the world frankly I think anyone who's honored to be in the role I'm in as you said Andy the 33rd chair and there'll be others you know for decades to come in this great agency well central to our roles as chairs past chairs and future chairs is to ensure that we continue to be the envy of the world that we have the leading capital markets and we have a vibrant public capital markets and vibrant private markets we are taking up a lot of projects here at the SEC about those private markets to bring greater transparency greater efficiency if we have more efficiency and yes competition in the middle that's better for those private companies whether they're small startups or the unicorns and it's better for the investor so we're trying to drive efficiency in the middle we're also trying to drive for greater transparency particularly as it relates to financial stability risk emanating maybe out of hedge funds and the like so we've got a lot of projects driving competition and transparency but part of part of our markets is both public markets and private markets speaking of the envy of the world what is the future of Chinese stocks listing in the United States does the SEC have a role or a position in this situation one way or the other so we do so we're blessed in the US again with such robust and strong capital markets that between 1,500 foreign companies actually list their shares here in the US it's not just China companies but a lot of Europeans Asian South American African Australian company it just from all around the globe but there's some basic understandings that if you want to list in the US you need to comply with our investor protection rules and one of the key things that came out 20 years ago one of the key things was that if you want to be issuing and raising money in the US that you have to be not only audited that the company has to be audited but the auditors have to be open to inspection kind of simple idea audit the auditors and Paul Sorbaine's a Maryland senator who I had the honor to work with chairs sorbaine's past that",https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hqIy-Q36neE,49,2022-10-26 17:17:46
4169," who I had the honor to work with, chairs, sorbains, passed that law 20 years ago. Bipartisan with Republicans on the Hill, which Senator Mike Oxley and with President Bush. 20 years later, 50 plus jurisdictions around the globe have allowed US entity called the public company accounting oversight board to audit the auditors, but China has not. So Congress weighed in again two years ago, or year and a half ago and said, no, that's not right. And they put a clock that had to happen. So where are we today? I think it's really, we've had some good discussions with our counterparts from China, the public company accounting oversight board has had some good discussions, but it's really up to the officials in China. If they allow the auditing firms in Beijing and Shanghai and elsewhere to be inspected and that their work papers are actually shared and not with a lot of redactions, but actually shared. And their auditors actually allow themselves to be, give interviews and testimony like 50 other countries have done. Right, then there's a path forward. Otherwise, Congress has spoken about 250 Chinese companies in this three year clock, potentially as early as 2024 would have to suspend trading here. Another proposal on the works is specifically in response to last year's meme stock craze. I believe it would shorten the amount of time it takes to clear trades. How would last year have played out differently had that rule been in place? So the events around the meme stops or as you know, the game stop led to a review by the SEC and we came up, the staff came up with four areas we should take a look at. And we have in two of those areas put out proposals too, we've working on some more. So one is what you talked about is the basic plumbing. Shortening how long it takes for money to move and stock to move. It's called settlement period from two days to one day. We've also done something around transparency around short selling and made a proposal last week around that as well. Shortening the settlement cycle lowers the risk in the system as the old saying goes, time is money. Right now if you do a trade on a Monday, you don't move the money or the stock until Wednesday. You shorten that to Tuesday less risk. In the middle of that January, the faithful January around the game stop events, a number of online brokers and broker jobs said we can't let retail public access the market. And that's just that access to the market is so fundamental that part of the issue, part of the issue was this settlement cycle thing, but it's not the only thing. And as I say, we have four projects we've proposed to, the other two looking at really the equity market structure itself and payment for order flow and the dark pools of capital that are flowing without transparency. That's a major project that I'm hoping staff will make recommendations and we'll move forward. And lastly was this thing called gamification or what we've come to call digital engagement practices. The Wall Street Journal is reported the SEC is looking in recent sales by Tesla CEO Elon Musk and his brother Kimble, whether they violated insider trading rules. I know you can't comment on a pop. I'm glad you said that for your viewers. I just hope that you're where you're heading. Oh, that's so I'm going somewhere. I'm going somewhere to your against look. All right, I know you can't comment. I'm gonna be able to comment. On a possible investigation, but have you talked about the need for stronger insider trading rules generally? How big an issue has been in your first year is insider trading a problem that you're focusing on? It is login Rapid browser str playback DVD.",https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hqIy-Q36neE,50,2022-10-26 17:22:15
4170," is insider training a problem that you're focusing on? It is. It is from our enforcement side or terrific enforcement efforts headed up by director of gray wall, Sanjay Wadwa, the whole team, just terrific team. But it's also from the policy side, we've even done something about insiders. When can corporate executives sell their shares and there was something put in place about 20 years ago, which was called a safe harbor, if you might. And we came on board and thought there's too many gaps in this area that the in-senior management might be trading stock when they're in receipt of material non-public information. And we put this proposal out in I think was December or so about these so-called 10B51 plans. And so both from really vigorous enforcement, but also from the policy side about insiders, we're taking it up in both ways. And I think it's a really important part because it comes out of trust in our capital markets and trust that there's a level playing field that when you're in the markets that somebody doesn't have an information and banage from material non-public information.",https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hqIy-Q36neE,51,2022-10-26 17:26:46
4171," What are your feelings about the debate on Capitol Hill right now about lawmakers being able to trade stocks? My understanding is that SEC employees have pretty tight restrictions with some stocks being off limits and trades needing to be pre-approved. Is that fair? I mean, should it be the same for everyone in all different branches of the government? I'm going to leave that as you can imagine to Congress to think through or certainly or willing and able to give them technical assistance on that. The stock act that was passed about 10 years ago by Congress and set certain reporting obligations on members of Congress and also certain limitations as well, we as an agency actually have a role to play in that stock act. And that's ongoing discussions I know up on Capitol Hill and wherever they come out, we stand ready to help implement our part of that if they change those laws. And finally, Chair Gansler, other recent SEC chairs, including Jake Clayton and Mary J. White came to the job for more of a legal background. You worked as a banker at Goldman once upon a time ago. How has that background and the insight you garnered there changed how you approached these issues and running the commission? Is it any different? Well, I'm honored to be in this job. I mean, the then president-elect Biden asked me to do it. It's one of the greatest honors of my life. I got up there with my three daughters, I guess, with my three daughters, maybe higher honor. And the wonderful woman I was married to. I would say this. I'm the fifth chair of those 33 that is a non-mawyer from the first chair, Joe Kennedy, the president Kennedy's father, Arthur Levin, William Donaldson, some really, really fantastic chairs. Look, we all come with different backgrounds, different perspectives, different experiences. I come with a deeply markets background. I really believe in markets. I think markets are a critical part of our economy, but regulated markets. I think that the laws put in place in the 1930s in this eight, nine decade period of the SECs that what Franklin Delan Roosevelt laid out and many really wonderful people at the SEC and on Capitol Hill, too, have augmented is we've enhanced economic growth because when you enhance trust, this basic concept that if you investors get to decide, but they get full and fair disclosure and we're protecting them against fraud, that the exchanges have to register, but there's a basic rules of investor protection and this three-part mission to facilitate capital formation investors and the efficient markets in the middle. I think that's a really great bargain. Now, for me, I've also had the great honor to share another agency. So along with Mary Shapiro, Mary and I are two people that have shared both the commodity futures trading commission and the SEC. So, it's great to talk to my former chairs. There's eight, I think of eight or nine now that are still alive and I call them on a regular basis, I check in and there's just a terrific, terrific group of commissioners, my fellow commissioners, Alison Lee, Hester Perst and Caroline Crenshaw. So, and we all bring a little bit different skills and perspective and we bring it together. Gary Gensler, chair of the Securities and Exchange Commission. Thank you so much for joining us.

4172," awe Welcome back to Yacht Finance. I'm Brian Sazzi here with Julie Hyman and Brad Smith. Smith mixed action in the markets on this Wednesday morning on the beak of back beak back of weekish earnings reports from tech giants Google and Microsoft. At least right now we're seeing the Dow up about 91 points the S&P 500 Nazx slightly in the red. Here's what we have on tap for you this hour. The Google pullback RBC's Brad Erickson stops by for a take on Google's less than stunning quarter and outlook and maybe not so playful holidays but tells serves up a mixed outlook through the economic slowdown will chat shortly from tell CEO Inan Kriz. And the newest meme stock leader Bed Bath Beyond gets a new CEO sort of will have the details. But first over to an S for right at the Wi-Fi interactive. And this yeah Brian and we're taking a look at new home sales for the month of September because we just got that data that came in new home sales fell 10.9% to 603,000 that's an annualized rate. Now that did come in though higher than the expected that what economists had been expecting. Remember that in August we saw a surprise to the upside for new home sales. September though was a month where you had the mortgage rates rising by more than 100 basis points. So that is expected to impact the slowing housing market and why do we talk so much about the housing market. Well because as housing goes so does the economy there are many jobs that are linked to the housing market there are durable goods that are linked to this. Let's take a look at XHB that is down 3 tens of a percent but it had been down the home builder ETF more than 1% before this data came out. But I just want to point out the year to date chart here you can see the losses for the home improvement and home builders taking a look at where we're at with the sectors we are seeing technology that is lower right now. We're also taking a look at consumer discretionary that's lower and this has to do with big tech which has been reporting earnings. Starting reporting earnings yesterday with Microsoft and Google both down.",https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hqIy-Q36neE,53,2022-10-26 17:35:31
4173," Also taking a look at consumer discretionary that's lower and this has to do with big tech which has been reporting earnings started reporting earnings yesterday with Microsoft and Google both down more than 7%. You've got meta which will be reporting that's down 3% and you've got Amazon down 4% guys. Yeah, finance is on a nest for a over there at the Wi-Fi Interactive thanks so much for tracking all that and that's appreciated. And a dip in YouTube advertising weighed on the search giant but with its scale and diversified tech portfolio is it positioned to weather disruption in the digital ad space joining us now to discuss and weigh in we've got RBC capital markets Internet equity analyst Brad Erickson pleasure to welcome another Brad into the chat here. So first of all, first of all, you take away from alphabet here, especially considering some of the different parts of the business. I mean, this is still 79% and advertising based business here. Yeah, that's right. And I'll do my best. Brian, I got to tell you I'm still reeling from how on earth you spend 48 bucks at Chipotle, but let's let's not Google since that. I'm here for. Yeah, it was a tough quarter all around. They they missed top and bottom line relative to the street. And then I think the Q4 commentary was particularly ominous. They spoke to seeing a basically broader pullback in ad spending within that business. And then surprisingly, there's no layoffs at Google. Apparently they're actually adding employees half the rate that they have been. So it's a little bit slower, but I think that caught people by surprise as well. And so you're seeing earnings estimates in particular come down enormously here this morning and obviously reflecting that in the stock. I want to ask about YouTube in particular. Is there something that Google can be doing alphabet can be doing with YouTube that it's not doing? Or is this is it just sort of subject to competition from TikTok, for example, plus the macro environment? And are there more levers that can pull there? Yeah, I mean, I think there's a couple of drivers, right? First and foremost, YouTube, because it is a social platform and does rely on third party measurement through IDFA, right? It was exposed to the Apple downturn. So there's absolutely been headwinds there. And I think, you know, they've somewhat abated from a year over your perspective, meaning we've lapped them. But I think there's probably still a bit of leakage going on there and then sure, competitively, we all know TikToks over the last TikTok over the last year or two has sucked a lot of the oxygen out of the room for those in the social space. And so, you know, one of the comments management made last night on the call was. Someone asked about whether the the mix shift they were seeing or sorry, the short form video, the YouTube shorts increased usage if that was incremental to YouTube or if it was a mix shift, and they kind of insinuated that it was a mix shift. And so that's your sort of evidence that TikTok is continuing to have an effect on that business going forward, you know, performance max is their product, which basically, if you don't know where to spend, be it search or YouTube or elsewhere, performance max is an AI tool that allocates your spend automatically. We do think that's going to be super important as they start layering spend into YouTube shorts. YouTube ad spend, I'm monetization in YouTube shorts, but that's still early days. And so that's probably not going to show up in the numbers till until next year. Brad, how severe do you think these cost cuts will be at alphabet? Well, to date, I mean, like I said earlier, they're we're not really seeing evidence at least directionally of cost cuts, right? Like they said, they're going to from a net ad perspective for headcount. They're going to cut that in half, but that means they're still adding roughly six, 7,000 employees quarter of a quarter, which is a, which is a lot of heads. I think as we get through to next year, the CEO kind of reiterates some other comments previously around trying to try to squeeze out more efficiency on a per head count basis. So clearly they're pointing to more cost efficiencies there. But yeah, I think people are a little concerned that that pay these guys are seeing a downturn. They're speaking to it qualitatively here going forward. And that's not being referred.",https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hqIy-Q36neE,54,2022-10-26 17:39:30
4174," But yeah, I think people are a little concerned that, that hey, these guys are seeing a downturn. They're speaking to it qualitatively here going forward. And that's not being reflected in the cost base. Now, flip that. Maybe let's just take devil's advocate for a second and say that's positive. It could reinforce the view that maybe Google is just viewing this as a temporary transitory type of thing. A lot of confidence in the business longer term and they don't need to go there. So you could argue it both ways, but certainly for today and where margin estimates are going, it's a negative. And on the hardware side, it doesn't seem like they could even afford to lose out on an install base that they would see come in from the number of phone devices or smartphone or handheld devices, even with a waiting PC market, even with some of the slowdowns and add. It seems like they would need to continue to produce, regardless of what the margins would look like on that side of the business. Yeah, I mean, hardware is obviously a tertiary part of this model, but it certainly popped up or flared up, I should say a little more in the quarter, with the launch of the Pixel 6A. Obviously that has a normal cost of billi-materials and gross margin profile for hardware product, which is substantially below the ad revenues. And so that weighed on the model to some degree in the quarter. But I don't expect that to be sort of a sustained headwind as we move forward here. So. RBC Capital Partners, Internet Equity, Analyst, Brad, Ayrx and good to see you. We'll talk to you soon. You as well. Thanks. All right, before we head to break, we have to check on shares of BedBath Beyond after the company now in Sugof, well, soon the role of CEO after serving as interim CEO for four months. This comes in the middle of an attempt to turn around the brand following several quarters of slipping sales and really a very long period of operating losses. You can see the stock down slightly today about 3%. Intel's mobile ice spin-off gets a disappointing IPO valuation Julius Beck with today's top headlines next. The",https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hqIy-Q36neE,55,2022-10-26 17:44:04
4175," Let's get down to business now. Look at some of the other headlines that we are watching. Intel is set to debut itself driving unit mobile eye at $21 to share during its anticipated IPO this according to the Wall Street Journal. Now price represents a premium from its expected range, the unit which focuses on driver assisting and self-driving technologies like sensors and microchips comes both as driving aids become increasingly critical to portfolios automakers and as the market for public debuts continues facing the dry spell I should say it's above the range that was reported or is originally being below the initial range. So I guess it's somewhere in the middle. The shape of shakeup continues at water brothers discovery the media empire announcing that James Gunn and Peter Safren will be the new co-heads of DC comics which oversees iconic properties like the Batman and Justice League franchises. This after reports that the company had taken a write-off of up to $4.3 billion on canceling projects like CNN Plus and Batgirl as well as layoffs across the WBD company. And an Apple executive has confirmed for the first time that the company will comply with the EU's mandate for mobile devices to use USBC this during a tech event. The EU standard was enacted to help consumers simplify charging and cut down on e-waste Apple senior vice president marketing didn't give away any more details on the commitment. It said the company would have approached the problem differently. The company had previously remained mum about whether it would honor EU regulations over the charging standard Apple first introduced a lightning port in its iPhone 5 it's not officially hinted at what might place that port. Sauce? All right let's check back in now on the broader markets as the Fed juggles the balancing act of Kermit inflation and a verdict a recession. Where does that leave investors seeking to balance the two risks for more on this we have BlackRock's Tony Disparito. Tony good to always get some time with you. I think let's start on the today's market action because I think what we're seeing is pretty interesting you know Julie highlighted earlier on the show some pretty not good quarters from a Microsoft and Google yet stocks are hanging in there are we watching the bottoming process in markets take place. Yeah so I think look there's some short term and long term drivers here and certainly if you kind of look year to date you know the market has gone down dramatically and all of it has been multiple contraction right we've gone through a multiple that was 22 at the beginning of the year to about 1617 today meanwhile earnings have mostly picked up although they're starting to roll over and the market's dealing with the risk of a recession so from my perspective I like the valuation I think the valuations have come back down to the normal range I'm still concerned about earnings and that's what we're seeing is a as a bumpy ride with respect to earnings and I see more volatility in the short run because if you think about the Fed the Fed just started hiking in March of this year seven months ago and that was a 25 basis point hike by the way and when you think about Fed interaction with the economy those rate hikes typically take at least six months to have any impact and the full impacts felt more like 18 months down the road so we still haven't felt the full impacts of those rate increases that's going to impact economics that's going to impact earnings and so I still see some bumpy ride ahead and I think what investors should do is prepare their portfolio to be more resilient all right so within that bumpy ride who is sitting on the wheel or who's sitting in perhaps the most insulated part of the bus as we're continuing to watch the Fed and for their mandate them trying to meet some of those benchmark expectations for some sectors they're going to experience this a little bit harder than others as we've seen both pullbacks and consumer discretionary real estate's been hit hard and then additionally you mentioned tech a moment ago yeah so I think an active manager can really add value here both through industry sector as well as stock selection and I kind of look at the world in terms of sickle goals and more stable learners I think there's value to be added on both sides in terms of sickle goals in the fund I run were really favoring energy and financials as they both benefit",https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hqIy-Q36neE,56,2022-10-26 17:48:12
4176," I think there's value to be added on both sides in terms of cyclicals. In the fund I run, we're really favoring energy and financials as they both benefit from the inflationary impulse. Certainly energy that's a long history there and then on financials you have the benefit of rising short-term rates, expanding net interest margin. And then on the more stable side, I'm really in favor of healthcare. Healthcare is certainly as stable as utilities and staples historically from an earnings perspective, yet has a better long-term growth dynamic and the valuations today are significantly more compelling. And so that's how I see the opportunity to add value for investors. What about a place like technology? I mean if you talk about stable earnings, I mean even though it's slowing the earnings growth from many of the companies that we heard from late yesterday, it's so relatively stable. So I wonder how you thinking about that group? So I do think that there are real pockets of technology where there's real good opportunity. And I'd even put it in that stable bucket, kind of a new staple if you will. And that just because there's a recession, it doesn't mean you can slow down on your techs that. Right? And so we're still seeing cloud grow. It's growing a little bit more slowly than maybe it has historically, but it's still growing by leaps and bounds, 40% plus in the quarter as we look at recent reports. And so I do see really clean balance sheets and technology. So these are things we're emphasizing. The clean balance sheets, the companies that have more stable like earnings. And then you got to be look at valuations. Make sure you're not overpaying for that collection of good business with good earnings power. Tony, you mentioned energy in that sector. We've already seen this have composed some of the best performers year to date. So is that trade already missed? I don't think so. And for a couple of reasons, there is a long term supply demand mismatch there. And the mismatch is really coming from restrained supply. You know, that sector went into, I'll call it a recession back in 2014, where there was significant excess capacity. And since then, you've seen CAPEX come down dramatically and stay down. And that's really important. And so when you look at companies today, even with high oil prices, you're not getting that supply response. And in fact, you're seeing good discipline out of OPEC, right? They just cut and you know, saying look, the economy is slowing. We need to cut supply. And then also when you look at the strategic petroleum reserve, right? We've been releasing about a million barrels a day, that's 1% of demand. Doesn't sound like a lot, but in the market like oil, that's normally very steady. 1% means a lot. And so we're about done with those releases come December. And so that's going to be another thing that's going to put a floor under price. Tony, I appreciate the time here today. BlackRock, Tony Disparito joining us this morning. Thanks so much. Thank you. Coming up, Microsoft shares. They are on the move, but lower by about 7% here. After its cloud revenue came in short of expectations for the first quarter. 5% there's Brent Braseland joins us next.",https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hqIy-Q36neE,57,2022-10-26 17:52:35
4177," MUSIC Microsoft beat on the top end bottom lines yesterday, but the company's guidance fell short after the company reported software than expected cloud revenue. CTO, excuse me, Satsun Nadella, says that cynical trends are weighing or cyclical trends are weighing on the stock's consumer business, but could the company's plan to moderate expensive boost its stock joining us now to weigh in? It's probably percent there's internet equity analyst Brent Braseland. Brent, great to have you here with us this morning. For Microsoft, some of the larger headwinds that they had laid out, FX, PC, which of these do you see actually being able to abate in the near term of all of the headwinds that they mentioned and how can Microsoft successfully navigate the spirit? Sure you bet. So clearly, you know, you're starting to see kind of the macro pressure start to erode into the growth outlook for Microsoft. If you look at the cloud business, it actually is still pretty healthy, slowing, but we still expect the cloud business to grow north of 20 percent this year, a little slower than we thought originally six months ago. It's really the more economically sensitive parts of Microsoft. That's still a big business. That's still a $100 billion business. It has been growing across windows and PCs and surface devices and gaming. That's a $100 billion plus business that has been growing 4 percent plus for the last two, three years. It could actually decline double digits this next quarter. So it's really, that's really where we're seeing that the slow down in those more cyclically sensitive areas, more of the consumer areas, the commercial still holding up pretty well. So that's sort of in line with what we've been hearing from what the commentary we've been getting ahead of the earning season from the likes of a sales force, for example, that have seemed to indicate that business spending is holding up pretty well. But how long does that last? If the cyclical stuff is rolling over, can we expect it at some point to also affect the more enterprise spending? Absolutely. And you're just now starting to see small cracks in the cloud growth rate. If you look at Azure, it's one of the fastest growing parts of the cloud business for Microsoft. That growth profile is decelled by about 9 percentage points in about three quarters. So you absolutely are seeing slow down. It's still a good growth, right? 37% in constant currencies with the guided to this coming quarter. That's down from 47% over the last couple of years. So it's slowing. We're seeing signs of maybe some budgetary pressure on the enterprise side. That's going to flow through into next year as well. So we certainly wouldn't say enterprise software.",https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hqIy-Q36neE,58,2022-10-26 17:56:58
4178," Maybe some budgetary pressure on the enterprise side. That's going to flow through into next year as well. So we certainly wouldn't say enterprise software, cloud is immune to the macro. And we're now starting to see cracks. Brent, clearly a challenging quarter for Microsoft. Outside of your coverage universe or outside of Microsoft, are there other companies that you think will be impacted to the same extent as Microsoft? Sure, we actually took numbers down on 22 stocks last week, including cutting numbers by Microsoft by 3 billion. Clearly wasn't enough. We took another $7 billion cut to our Microsoft numbers this morning. But yeah, we think there really isn't a safe haven in software. I think the macro pressures will eventually impact growth rates for most of the enterprise software names that we cover. So I think the good news is valuations are starting to bottom. So I think there's no longer a valuation risk. The challenge fundamentals have not bottomed yet. So we still have a bottoming process to go through on the fundamentals side. We need to see growth expectations for next year reset. And we're getting close. But certainly have to go through a fundamental trough before you start to see stabilization. What type of growth profile would you give at this point to Microsoft's cloud business, considering the pull forward and demand that we had seen over the past couple of years? Yeah, so it's interesting. We look at the broader cloud market. The cloud 100, if you will, growth was 33% in 2021. We're modeling about 22% cloud industry growth in 2022. That's similar to where Microsoft cloud is at. Next year, we're actually sub 20% growth for industry. About 19.5% industry cloud industry growth expectations. That's essentially, I think, directionally where Microsoft's headed as well. High teens growth in a recessionary environment seems like a good kind of landing spot for this industry. That's down from 33. So that is a material slowdown, but still really good growth for industry that could be north of $300 billion in 2023. With valuations sitting where they are right now, do you think that Microsoft, especially within this cloud landscape, needs to make a key acquisition and strike while the opportunity might be there to go after a company that could help it grow out of its portfolio in the cloud a little bit better? Listen, Microsoft's still the cloud king. It's the only cloud company north of $100 billion in revenue. It's still kind of growing. Poise to grow 20% in consequences. So could they do more? Absolutely. Should they do more? Absolutely. Do I think they will do more? Absolutely. So $17 billion in cash, $65 billion in cash flow. Microsoft's not done from an M&A standpoint in cloud. We expect them to be active next year. Absolutely. Times three. Thanks so much, Brandon. Appreciate it, Brent Braseland, a Fiper Sandler equity research. Appreciate it. Coming up next, we'll get a pulse check on the state of telecom with AT&T Executive, Jen Robertson. Don't want to miss it. What's up Zielına, what's the case with Natal breast cancer? Nobody's here. Why are we keeping it in line? Why are we keeping it in line? Why aren't we keeping it in sync? All right. We're keeping it in line. We need to check what we want to see. petals to the buds.

4179," Testing Teeing up, good news. You'll get that in a second. Raymond James, the most recent analyst, Oplod, AT&T's recent quarter. Take your simple tea with a boost to strong buy from Alp performance after the U.S. telecom reported its third quarter numbers last week, including a net gain of 708,000 pre-paid subscribers joining us to talk about the company. And the economic environment is Jen Robertson, AT&T, mass markets, executive vice president and general manager Jen, thanks for being here. Thank you. So as we look at these subscriber numbers, what I'm curious about is where they are coming from. In other words, are they coming from your competitors, which competitors, and what is it costing you in terms of promotions? Yeah, you know, we're really proud of the subscriber growth we've been delivering and we're sitting at nine quarters now in a row of 600,000 post-paid voice net ads or more, and delivering near-record levels. So it's been an exciting time to be in the industry. Proud of how we're standing up against competitors, 2.000,000 net ads year to date through the third quarter and expecting that to be an industry leading position as we move forward. So holding strong there, and certainly delivering that from a higher demand for connectivity, it is a resilient product. And looking at customers and delivering value. And so, yes, there are promotional offers, but we are meeting customers where they want to be. We have distribution expansion that's occurred. We're meeting customers where they want to shop. A lot of trends that came out of the COVID pandemic that have carried forward and changed how people want to interact with us. And we're proud of how we've simplified our product and pricing construct and met customers where they want to be. When you think about the advancements in the network, too, one thing that we've heard over the course of this earnings season from telecommunications and communication services companies is where those investments are being made and boosting up the network. Where how soon do you see that beginning to really play out for so many of the customers that you're serving, too? Right. So we've made investments, significant investments in the 5G wireless network, proud to be moving towards 130 million subscribers and customers that will be covered with our C band spectrum by the end of this year, 200 million and more covered by 5G. And certainly the country's largest investor in fiber. And so putting those investments there because it's the connectivity that customers want, it is the technology that will meet the next decade plus of demand for customers, both on usage and on speed. And so that's why UCS is really doubling down and putting our focus in those two network technologies. It was talked a lot about in the earnings call, Jen, just improved value perception. So what are you doing specifically on pricing? You're cutting prices of plans. You have",https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hqIy-Q36neE,60,2022-10-26 18:05:37
4180," from my phone full and fair disclosure and 5G for me doesn't pop up everywhere. What is it like on your service? Do you still see dead spots for 5G? Yeah, I think it comes back to we deploy the spectrum in phases and that takes time. And so you'll see 130 million people covered by the end of this year with our 5G C band where you'll have a noticeable speed. You know, just lastly what we have here, we think about the areas of the economy that have like these little luxuries that consumers will continue to buy in even during an economic downturn is your phone service, your cellular service. Is that a little luxury that you're seeing people continue to spend higher for just because of all the different things that we use our devices for on a daily basis right now too? Right, I think what we see it is it's not a luxury, it's a requirement. Customers need connectivity for personal use, for business use, for learning and commerce. And so it's actually a very resilient product and customers are purchasing up. It's why our RPU was up in the third quarter. All right, let's see what they are. Jen Robertson, AT&T, Mass, Markets, EVP and General Manager. Good to see you. Thanks for coming to our studio. Appreciate it. Thank you. All right, coming up we'll chat with Mattel, CEO and not cries as the toy maker. Here's up for the peak holiday shopping season. We'll be right back. Here's up for the peak holiday shopping season. Shares of Mattel are in focus after the toy maker trimmed its full year guidance in its third quarter earnings report last night saying market volatility and other macroeconomic risks has forced it to reformulate its expectations. But tell Chairman and CEO and not cries joins us now to discuss. No, I know he's great to get some time with you. Your top takeaway on the quarter. Thank you, Brian, for inviting me. Well, this was a good quarter from Mattel. With the ninth straight quarter of year of year growth in constant currency. Look as you know.",https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hqIy-Q36neE,61,2022-10-26 18:12:21
4181," Fighting me. Well, this was a good quarter for Mattel with the ninth straight quarter of year of year growth in constant currency. Look, as you know, we are in the midst of a challenging economic environment, but our year-to-date results of double-digit growth in net sales, adjusted EBITDA, adjusted operating income and adjusted EPS showed that we are successfully navigating a complex landscape and our strategy is working. We believe a fundamental is a strong and we are very confident about our multi-year growth trajectory. And Anna, I've been covering you and the turnaround story Mattel for a good bit now. I wasn't used to that tone on that conference call last night just highlighting some slowing you're seeing in the market. How severe is that gun? Look, there's no, it's not a secret that the economy, the broader economy is currently challenging, but our year-to-date result do show and do demonstrate that we are on the right track. We are maintaining guidance for full-year growth in net sales in constant currency of 8 to 10 percent and look forward to the holiday season. We modestly revised our profit expectation to allow and accommodate for the inflation that we're seeing, but we still expect a growth year for Mattel, both at the top line and the bottom line, and also expect 2023 to be a growth year, both top line and bottom line. So we are very confident about our trajectory, brands are resonating, thriving with the continued engagement and cultural impact, and we're very confident about our strategy and execution. You did highlight the need that there might be a little more promotions in the holiday quarter than I think a lot of investors may be expected. How much discounting do you expect to be doing? Look, according to date, consumer demand is a non-with expectation and we're pleased with our performance. Shoppers are returning to traditional purchasing patterns closer to the holiday and we expect demand to accelerate. We are working closely with our retail partners to meet the anticipated demand. We have more advertising and promotion. We secured more shelf space and retail support compared to last year and we also expect to and also we have great holiday toilies representation and much stronger in stock. So yes, we are going to increase activity, promotional activity, but we are well positioned for the fourth quarter in the holiday season, which is why we are maintaining a full year guidance of net sales growth in 8 to 10 percent in constant currency. No, I'm old. I'm not as close as I used to be. What are some of the top toils in the holiday season? Well, Mansahai is going to be a very exciting offering as we prepare for the global launch next year. Hot Wheels Car Wash, Lightyear products, Fisher prices, a great musical toy called Bouncing Beats and the Dreamhouse, of course, will always be on the top of the toilies for every holiday season. So an exciting broad offering across a pretty large spectrum of product that we're very excited about. I remember having one of those car washes as a kid. I've got to send your photo exists somewhere, but these are some cool toys. That is an interesting stuff. How is the pricing on these compared to last year? Do you plan to take more pricing? Look, we increase pricing in the second half of this year. We were able to successfully implement those increases and it's too early to tell, but so far we haven't seen a meaningful impact on consumer demand. Important to say that as it relates to inflation, we are beginning to see some improvement in the course of ocean freight and materials. We expect inflation to moderate in 2023. And in addition to the savings that we're looking to generate of 250 million dollars by the end of 2023, we expect the combination of pricing and cost savings to more than offset cost inflation and contribute to margin expansion over time. So we are proactively managing our business in this environment to ensure that we are set up for long-term success. You may be the first to you that we've talked to to really highlight a peak in inflation and things cooling off a bit. I certainly, surely that is a good to-",https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hqIy-Q36neE,62,2022-10-26 18:16:23
4182," Sure that we are set up for long-term success. You may be the first CEO that we've talked to, to really highlight a peak in inflation and things cooling off a bit. I certainly, certainly that is good to hear in a different tone. Let's go on to Barbie, because Barbie's been an interesting story the past year or two here. A real growth mechanism for the company. What's on tap for that brand next year? Oh, very confident about the long-term growth trajectory of Barbie. Barbie was the number one global-doll property in the third quarter and year to date. Year to date Barbie is up, which is an excellent achievement when compared to last year, which was the highest on record for Barbie of all times. We look forward to next year, which will have an exciting innovation pipeline, new content slate with Netflix. And of course, the highly anticipated Barbie movie, our first theatrical release that will come out this summer. Also important to know that Barbie doubled in size over the past five years and was the number one global toy property overall, not just in dollars, but overall in the last two years. And we really see that as a proof point to the strength of this incredible franchise, very confident about Barbie and proud to have it as our leading franchise. It does seem like a nine. And we've talked about this in the past. You've all the seeds that you have planted in terms of content. And of course, you highlight the Barbie movie or now coming to fruition. This will start to hit the market next year and beyond. How much will you spend on content next year? Well, we employ a capital-lite strategy. We're not spending money on content. We're leveraging our brands. We collaborate with the best filmmakers and content creators out there, both not just film, but also in television, and partner with major studios to create, produce, distribute and commercialize our brands on the big screen and also in episodic content. We have a very exciting slate of 14 additional movies other than Barbie that we currently developing with some of the best and most prolific creators of this generation. And this is going to grow because we have more in the pipeline that we haven't announced. And likewise, Mattel television is thriving with 12 series and specials that will be on air this year, so to speak, because some are actually by streaming. Eight of those are new for a returning. Months-to-high-lab action television movie musical, just launch an ecology and we grinlit the second movie. And we continue to roll out more content, such as Thomas and friends, polypocket, fireman Sam, DeepAin and Oop, more Barbie product, Pictionary Gameshow, and the list goes on and on. So exciting to see how our brands resonate with consumers and attract creators to collaborate with us, because like us, they're also very excited to reimagine and create an expression of our product in content. Once the Pokemon movie hitting it on. Well, we licensed recently the Pokemon brand, which is one of the strongest franchises this year for mega, for building sets. It's been a great driver for us, and we're very proud to work with the Pokemon company in expressing their IP in combination without product. So it's a great partnership. And this really speaks to how we elevate material to become the partner of choice for the major entertainment companies, and where we bring our capabilities, our global scale, our innovation, our supply chain and commercial capabilities, collaborate with other owners, other franchises, and take them to the next level and create evergreen franchises, just like we do with our own. And I'm just being flagged before I let you go. And there was just a new Pokemon movie, Detective Pikachu. That's how you know you're getting old, but you do not realize those types of movies are in the market. We'll leave it there for now.",https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hqIy-Q36neE,63,2022-10-26 18:20:43
4183, in flag before let you go and on there was just a new poking on movie uh... detective peaked through that's how you know you get an old but you do not realize those types of uh... movies are in the market believe it there for now good luck this holiday season to tell CO non-cryze will talk to you soon thank you so much are coming up with your own some more key earnings reports from visa haliburn and sketchers looking forward to sharing that now so that's next uh... welcome back every one of this time for a couple times four stories today when we're going to start with this visa tracking ticker symbol v on the day it's up about five point six percent right now this is after beating on q3 earnings the payment company says it still sees strong consumer spending payments volume at group ten percent in the quarter while transactions grew twelve percent and this comes back to the type of spending that consumers are more prone to do it this one time leaning towards some of the car products and card services out there versus just saying yeah pay with cash that trying to hold on to some of that cash for yeah and all this travel that worth talking about right how are people paying for that they're you know they're putting on their card so that again this this is the idea that we're not seeing across the board everything slowing down at once right it is very uneven here in visas results i think are a good example of that american express good quarter last week visa could quarter i'm not surprised well and on the travel for as you mentioned american press had cited global travel or corporate travel uh... especially given that american express has so much of the corporate tn that they kind of account for within that landscape of the visa that clearly plan out for them to alright haliburn so earnings double in the last quarter as demand for crude oil increases we need to upgrade from most far protect with sent which is sending shares higher the bank upgrade the stock from underweight to overweights so pretty simple analysis here all prices up good quarter for haliburn you know it's a conceited,https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hqIy-Q36neE,64,2022-10-26 18:25:20
4184," the bank upgrade, the stock from Underweight to Overweights. So pretty simple analysis here. Oil prices up. Good quarter for Halberd. Yeah, although it's not always as straightforward as that, right? You need the demand for oil services as well, not just the increase in oil prices. I mean, the price chart get jump on, coming from Roger Readover, Wells Fargo, is pretty impressive to $52 from $33. So he's looking for a lot more upside. So are a lot of investors. We speak to, right? We just talked to Tony Desperado over at BlackRock. He mentioned energy as an area that he likes right now. And he's not the only one. Even after the climb that we saw in energy stocks, especially in the first half of the year. Yeah, I mean, it's really a story as well, though, within all of this up pricing. Their pricing increased in North America and international markets. They're saying that the strength of their strategy and action was really kind of resulting in this revenue growth of 6% sequentially there and really led by some of that pricing and the macro environment right now too. On the other end of the spectrum, we have sketchers, the footwear manufacturer seeing shares dipping today after missing third quarter estimates, give a down-be outlook for the current quarter, the shares are 4.5%. And I'm seeing a lot of analysts concerned being expressed over the margins and the target for margins as well for sketchers. So again, here, illustrating the lumpiness in consumer spending, right? People maybe you're traveling. Maybe people are buying some shoes still, but they're not buying as many sketchers and it's costing the company more to get them out there. And maybe to move them out the door too. Inventory of 21%, right flag. But it still comes back to the core consumer that sketchers is going to go after here. We've seen them move more into some of this sport or leisure activity category. They've got a number of PGA tour some now live golfers, I believe, that are still on their roster. And so with that, it's this larger question of when you've got a millennial and Gen Z population that have clearly shown what their brand and their identities are. Nike, Lou Lemmon, and then additionally Crocs, as well as one of the kind of growth areas that we've seen in some of the more kind of comfortable shoes. Where does sketchers sit within that too? I think that's a larger question that the brand is still going to have to answer for. All right. Now we're looking at Wingstop. Shares a Wingstop taking flight today after the fast food chain announced prices of bone and chicken wings are actually decreasing. The falling price is prompted. Wingstop to raise its full year gone. And so this is what we've heard for Wingstop in recent quarters, deflation and chicken win prices. Really one of the only fast food companies that I can think of actually seeing deflation in parts of their business, Wingstop benefiting from that. They just got into the chicken sandwich game. Madly. That's the analysis. Yes. Well, they may be seeing deflation in chicken wings, but they're probably not seeing deflation in labor costs, right? I mean, that's something I think that is still we're seeing upward pressure on that across the board for anybody within the food business specifically because people still don't want to come back and work in that business. No, it's true. And at the same time, where Wingstop is also still trying to navigate with that direct correlation or that direct touch point with the consumer is, while many of those consumers have options on the table to get delivery through some of the other third party sources as well for their chicken wings. However, falling chicken prices help them that out. All right. We are seeing a stock sound mix right now. And coming up at Kiko Fijita, we'll continue our coverage of earnings from Tech Giant to Alphabet and Microsoft with technologists research president Bob O'Donnell.

4185,"ending Welcome to Yahoo Finance Live. It is 11 a.m. here in New York City. I'm Akiko Fujita. Here's what I'm watching at this hour. Big misses for big tech, the results season serves up some uncomfortable questions for the global economy underwhelming reports from Microsoft, Alphabet and Texas Instruments all winged on sentiment this morning. Too strong for too long. The greenback, the dominant currency for most of 2022, but a broad move against the dollar takes place in global effects. So the question here, are we at peak hawkishness? We're going to ask global X ETFs, Morgan Del Done later in the show. And in this economy, Intel's mobile I price is its long awaited IPO above the targeted range. Could stripe an Instacart V-next. We're going to get into that conversation later this hour. First though, as always, we are checking the markets right now. 90 minutes into the trading day right now. The Dow is up about 240 points. The Nasdaq, the big one we're keeping a close watch on on the back of those big tech reports. Of course, we're going to be breaking down Microsoft as well as Alphabet, meta on tap after the belt today when we're going to be watching closely, taking a look at where the bond markets are right now. We have seen a bit of a pullback here, but the shorter end still well above that 4% level, five year at 4.2. And the benchmark 10 year just right about at 4%. Well, shares of Alphabet are sliding into the red app for missing estimates on the top and bottom line. The tech giant's revenue growth slowed to 6% from 41%. The prior year is at spending continues its downward trend. Lapping from a strong third quarter last year, for some tough comps across Alphabet's portfolio, including search and YouTube. Take a listen to what we heard from Google and Alphabet CFO Ruth Porat on the earnings call. Joining us to break this all down, we've got Bobo Donald, technical.",https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hqIy-Q36neE,66,2022-10-26 18:34:08
4186," We'll continue to create tough comps that will weigh on the year on year growth rates of advertising revenues. Joining us to break this all down, we've got Bob O'Donnell, technologist research at President Chief Analyst for more on the impact tough companies are starting to feel from an economic slowdown. Bob, we've got you in the flesh. I'd so great to be back. Live in the studio. It's crazy. Certainly a good day to break this all down. We're going to start with the alphabet because you know we were saying before the show that it's interesting to see how significantly they were affected, especially in digital ads. When you think about the last quarter, there's a bit of a divergence between the social media companies. Alphabet has a bit more of a diversified portfolio but they weren't shielded this time around. No, I mean because obviously alphabet gets searched and we're always going to search and people are always going to do that and so they always have that that they can fall back on as part of the advertising side. But the social media side and the YouTube side of things, that's where they took the hit and that's because we're seeing obviously overall advertising going down in those places. And the other challenge that you've got with alphabet is it's not really that diversified a company, right? There's so much dependence upon advertising. I mean, look, they do have Google Cloud which you know they didn't really talk too much about that but they have a few things that are bubbling up but they're still small. I mean, I saw the other day that you know other bets. Remember when they used to talk about other bets it's 0.3% of the companies revenue. So I mean, I think that's one of the ongoing challenges. They're going to figure these things out. They are building their business not only on the enterprise side. I should say not only for Google Cloud but also Google Workspace, some of their other services where they compete with Microsoft and that's been growing and that continues to grow. And before it becomes a huge contributor to the bottom line but you know there are these elements that are in play and that are moving forward for them. What was your takeaway though from what we heard in terms of where things are headed? I mean, it seemed like they were sort of setting things up for an even more significant downturn. And to your point, yes, it's not as diversified as a company like Microsoft but in terms of where the ad revenue and where they compete in, it is a little more diversified than the likes of Meta or stuff. Yes, no, it definitely is. And look, I think what we're seeing in a lot of ways across tech is a sense of the things that people expected to happen at the beginning of the pandemic didn't and now they kind of are. It's sort of like it's a two and a half year delay of the big impact that people thought was going to have. You know, I think in general we're seeing that tech companies having weathered so well are now facing the challenges that other parts of the market have faced. And it's just that's the reality. Growth is going to slow down. And on the advertising side, of course, that's a reflection of overall macroeconomic trends. And there's not a whole lot they can do about that. And I think that's a challenge. Obviously, there's not many more places they can go. I mean, Google is everywhere and there's stuff is everywhere. So it's really going to be dependent upon how the general macroeconomic does so that those companies then feel more confident, their advertisers, as I should say, feel more confident in spending the money with a platform like Google. Let's talk about Microsoft. Obviously, Azure has been the big growth driver there. And you have said in your notes that because it is more enterprise-safed facing, they are a little more shielded. And yet what we heard yesterday, I think it was on the call from Google saying essentially, yes, companies are still investing in the cloud, but they're taking a little longer and maybe thinking a little harder about how much they want to invest. So are we likely to see further headwinds for Microsoft, even if Azure is the driver? I think we will, and the issue is it's easy to forget that only about, I think the last numbers I heard were 15 to 20% of companies have moved their workloads to the cloud. I shouldn't say of companies, of the potential workloads. And so there's still this huge potential upside to move to cloud computing from all the big platforms. And the other thing to bear in mind is we've had these incredibly strong growth rates for cloud computing across the board, AWS, obviously, Microsoft. And at some point, you can't last, right? It's the law of big numbers. You run into a certain point where it's very difficult. The thing is, even as things start to slow down a bit, a lot of companies started big initiatives during the pandemic that are cloud computing base.",https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hqIy-Q36neE,67,2022-10-26 18:38:06
4187," Very difficult. The thing is, even as things start to slow down a bit, a lot of companies started big initiatives during the pandemic that are cloud computing-based, and they are going to continue those. Like you said, as the commentary said, some of those projects are going to slow down a little bit. They're not quite as high priority, perhaps, as they were, but they're still going to do it, because it's still part of these companies really kind of trying to transform their businesses, and that's an essential part of survival, in the next decade. We're still waiting on numbers from meta. We've got to alphabet or Amazon, and Apple later on in the week. It's sort of interesting to see how the narrative around tech has changed, because for a while, it was about the social media companies, and yet when you think at where we are in the current court, it feels like we're going back to these established players, so if we can call that, it has come down to Apple, it comes down to Microsoft, and how are you looking at your portfolio of those tech names, and where are the safe bets? Yeah, no, I think we are falling back to the most trusted tech brands, and the big names are going to be the ones that are going to, I think, well, make it through this. The other thing is, again, these companies over the years have become increasingly diversified. Now, in the case of meta, I think it's a challenge, right? Obviously, very advertising focused, a very consumer-based advertising focus, so likely it's going to be tough. Apple, everybody loves to say, well, one of these days, something's going to catch up to Apple, but what Apple magically manages to do, every quarter, is somehow get different elements of the puzzle to add together. There have been rumblings that iPhone 14 sales, for example, have been lower than expected, so they've apparently cut the production, and so people say, oh, we'll see, iPhone's going to be down, but remember now, that iPhone is less than 50% of the revenue, they've built up this huge install base, they continue to sell services, right? Everything from Apple TV and all the other services they have, that's driving their growth. They're also doing more, obviously, with AirPods, and the watch, and other elements of their ecosystem, so they've managed to create this, I think, pretty diverse story, similar to Amazon, right? I mean, Amazon is very dichotomous. You've got AWS, which just cranks out revenue and cranks out dollars, and then you've got the online sales business, which realistically is probably going to take a hit, and it's going to be like any of the other retail environments. But the question is, is there enough on the AWS side to offset some of that? It's hard to tell for sure, but again, it's that story of diversification that these big tech companies have done over the years, and I think we're going to start to see the benefits of that, but clearly at more of a reduced kind of a normal rate, not the huge multiples that they've gotten. Yeah, a lot of investors are going to be parsing those numbers or breaking down those numbers closely. Bob, great to have you in studios, right? Thank you, Kiko, great to be here. Bobo Donald, Technologist Research, President and Chief Analyst. Well, macroheadwinds, no doubt taking a toll on corporate results. So we've been talking about an underwhelming numbers for big tech, pointing out some glaring weaknesses in the global economy. Major data points held above water for some time, but it's a slowdown we've been fearing so long, finally here. We've got an S for A and Julie Hyman. Julie, making an appearance on the internet. I'm going to shout out. Let's start with the earnings, because we just went through the big tech ones there, but there's another one that I know in as you've been watching, that's Texas Instruments. Yeah, that's right. And Texas Instruments is important because their chips go into everything from home appliances to missiles. So the scope of where their chips go is very significant here. And Texas Instruments basically saying that they are seeing softness, especially also going into the industrial segments. So that industrial segment that seemed to be immune to sort of a softness in the chips pace, a slowdown in chips pace, that is notable. Now, analysts have been talking about that we would see a slowdown in the chips pace, especially in the second half of the year. But again, that scope, you also have, of course, the Biden administration restrictions when it comes to chips and China, that's also weighing on here. But the bottom line from what I can glean from this is that, basically, this slowdown that we're seeing, it's not going to be a quick turnaround. Julie, your thoughts on that? Well, it's interesting what's going on with Texas Instruments. It seems like everything's slowed except autos, is what analysts were pointing out. That was actually a bright spot, because that's a spot where the automakers are sort of in an arms race, where that is concerned. So for me, the takeaway is that this is very lumpy. And this is something we were talking about in the last hour.",https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hqIy-Q36neE,68,2022-10-26 18:42:29
4188," where the automakers are sort of in an arms race where that is concerned. So for me, the takeaway is that this is very lumpy. And this is something we were talking about in the last hour. Not just within chips, but within everything, right? Because if you look at results from something like VISA, which was out with its numbers as well, from there, the indication seemed to be that consumer spending is still relatively strong on things like perhaps travel, right? So it's not that businesses and consumers are not spending. It's that spending is on different things. They're spending perhaps less, maybe overall. Certainly companies seem to be judging by the results from Microsoft, for example. But it's not sort of across the board, things falling off a clip. It's this sort of lumpy slowdown. But doesn't that go back to sort of like, how do we look at what the macro picture looks like, right? I mean, we've been talking so much about how there's this divergence between where consumer sentiment is versus where consumers are actually spending, and that it, yes, there are concerns about higher prices. And yet, when you look at sort of the broader labor market, things are still pretty tight. And this sort of seems to add to that idea of being a little noisy and trying not being able to have a very clear picture on where things are headed. Yeah, definitely. And if you also look at the home data, for example, I've been also watching that because as housing goes, so does the economy. This is another area where we are seeing September, new home sales were down in September. And you saw also in September the mortgage rates, those climbed up to by 100 basis points. That's huge amount in one month. So now it's just sitting just around 7%. You are going to see a slowdown in this. In the housing market, we are already seeing it. And keep in mind, the housing is a lagging indicator. So when we're talking about these different areas of the consumer, how the consumer feels, where it's spending its money, housing is a huge component of the economy. It encompasses so many jobs from construction to mortgage lending. And then it also encompasses the durable goods. So diswashers, everything that has to do with building a home and what you put inside the home. I think that there's different areas, as you mentioned, of the economy. It is a little bit lumpy. And it's just which areas do you want to focus on? And which are lagging, which are the ones that indicate? Well, in going back to what we've been learning from earnings, when Chipotle is kind of an interesting story, they raise prices a lot of companies have to offset the cost. They did beat expectations. And yet it does seem to suggest that there are trade-offs that are happening among consumers. Well, and they talked about the lower income consumers are not coming in as often. Transactions actually fell at Chipotle by a percent. They're going to fall by a higher percentage in the current quarter, according to the CFO Jack Carton, when we spoke earlier today. And so not only are you getting lumpiness among what consumers are spending on, there's a lot of differentiation amongst consumers. So whereas a higher income consumer might still go out and spend a house, even though a buy house, maybe they're spending less on that house. Likewise, you're going to have a big differentiation between higher and lower income consumers and what they're buying, where they're traveling, et cetera. Well, even that, even if the lower income customers aren't coming through the doors much, higher income, maybe spending more. Even for higher income, that is a trade down, right? Yeah, it could be. Definitely, if they're buying Chipotle and not capital grill, I don't know. I don't know where they live. I'm not sure. Right, exactly. But yes, there could be some decisions being made. And we know that inflation impacts the lower income consumer as well. So that is expected. These are, I mean, we've seen it with other, with even the dollar stores and the previous earnings, where they show where consumers are spending. And there may be not spending on the t-shirts. There's now spending on food, on the consumable products. Yeah, something we've heard from other retailers to groceries over other businesses. Good to have both of you on. Thanks. And that's Fraying Julie Heimann. Well, coming up, I, on the prize of Fed Hockishness is peaking. Does that mean the IPO market can get back to its feet?

4189,"... Well, balancing act Elon Musk's deal to buy Twitter slated to close this Friday. Bloomberg reporting that the Tesla CEO confirmed that in a video conference with bankers funding the deal, the timing they'll making some people nervous with less than two weeks to go until the midterms. There are growing concerns about social media companies and how well they're equipped to handle disinformation and content manipulation. Let's bring in Yahoo Finance, Alexis Keenan, who's following that story for us. And to number one, we're looking at this timing potentially a little clearer if it closes on Friday. How quickly, that's a big if, how quickly can Elon Musk move to change the platform as some have speculated he would? So I've heard some legal experts say, and whether they're the right ones or not, but they say it could happen immediately. Look, it's going to be a private company. He could turn this thing on a dime. So this makes it a very interesting and delicate time really for Elon Musk to be taking over this company because you do have midterm elections coming up November 8th. And these companies, social media companies, Twitter and the rest of the major US companies, they're all tasked with having a really robust content moderation policy around leading up to elections and after, certainly that's been an expectation ever since the report came out, the Congressional bipartisan report in 2016. So also though, Musk is working to sustain demand on the Tesla side. So he's got to balance this, but also he is having to keep that demand up with Tesla stock being down since the acquisition about 31%. And I'll tell you why in a second. But first let's hit the fact that neither Tesla nor Musk have responded to explain exactly what is going to happen with content moderation on Twitter once and if the deal really gets done here, that...",https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hqIy-Q36neE,70,2022-10-26 18:51:18
4190," Let's have responded to explain exactly what is going to happen with content moderation on Twitter, once and if the deal really gets done here, that deadline being Friday at 5 o'clock, though Twitter has for its part in August, reaffirmed its position, its policy is called the civic integrity policy. And what it does is it offers prompts to users that direct them to information that the company deems accurate and it also adds labels to content that it deems misleading. So that policy in effect, but maybe not so much after Friday. But also it's been raised by some of the legal experts I've been talking to concern about Musk straddling not just the work responsibility of SpaceX, Tesla, his other companies and then bringing Twitter in, but really trying to manage and be the arbiter of what lives and doesn't live on Twitter. When it comes to world leaders, we've seen in the past a lot of discord about labels that have been put on lawmakers content, both in the U.S. and abroad, that's still going on recently with lawmakers in Ukraine, in the Russia-Ukraine conflict. And so does Musk want to be in that position? That's a question that I hope he answers soon. It's going to be a difficult balancing act once he is faced with those decisions. You have to wonder what his feet is going to look like, too. I mean, you're talking about global leaders. He has sort of meddled in or weighing it, weighed in on what happens with Russia-Ukraine. He gave that interview with the Financial Times where he talks about what should be done with Taiwan. When you are leading that very platform where the discussion is happening, you know, sort of do the rules change. And the larger question everybody keeps asking is, what does it mean? Those people who were kicked off the platform like Donald Trump, are they going to instantly be reinstated? We don't know. But yes, it could end up being a problem that Elon Musk doesn't want to handle. And yes, could he push these responsibilities off to others who are running the company? Sure. But at the end of the day, the buck kind of does stop with Elon Musk so long as he is the sole owner of this company. We'll have to see how it plays out, but certainly he's going to have to continue to try to curry favor in China, in Germany, and other places where Tesla is operating and make sure that he's pleasing world leaders, people of power on the content moderation level. And we don't know for sure that he wants to be the CEO and he's going to be running. We do not know. All to be determined there. Alexis, thanks so much for that. Well, Intel's self-driving car unit, mobile I, priced its initial public offering at $21 a share, late Tuesday. That's above the $18 to $20 range. That values the company at roughly $17 billion, more than the $15 billion until paid for the company back in 2017. But a ways off from the $50 billion valuation it sought last year. Let's bring in Yahoo! Finance is Dan Halley who's been watching that for us and Dan, you know, there's a few questions that come with this. Number one, given where the IPO market has been, does the fact that Intel prices at a higher range suggest the appetite is back there again? Yeah, I think that's really the big question for this kind of listing, right? This is mobile I, just to give you some background. This was a company that was originally developing technology to be able to provide computer vision for self-driving cars. Obviously, it's gone. Heavy into self-driving, Intel picked it up some years ago at around the $15.3 billion market. Now, as you said, according to these reports, IPO is being priced at $17 billion. But that's below, again, as you pointed out, that's $50 billion that was originally being looked at. And this all has to do with just the IPO market kind of falling off after a big 2021 big 2020, big 2019, where we saw some of these mega companies, and hit the public markets. Now, we haven't seen very many that are doing a billion dollars more in their IPO or more in their IPO. We have mobile I hear barely touching a billion dollars. But I think it does point to some interest in this kind of company and the long-term growth perspective, for something like this, where there is still a lot of work to be done in self-driving cars in computer vision when it comes to vehicles. And so if mobile I go public and can get some clients under its belt, then I think that just means that the opportunity really is there.",https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hqIy-Q36neE,71,2022-10-26 18:55:23
4191," in computer vision when it comes to vehicles. And so if mobile I goes public and can get some clients under its belt, then I think that just means that the opportunity really is there for growth. Now, when we talk about self-driving cars, obviously, the discussion ends up pointing towards something like a Tesla, GM. What those companies are offering really are just drivers, system technologies. It's not really self-driving, no matter what they companies call it. It's just still drivers, system technology. So the self-driving will still take years to kind of shake out. So there are ample opportunities for companies like mobile I to kind of really fully establish themselves in the space and they become really the main client for some of these larger automaker brands and see where they can bring the technology going forward. Dan Halley is always seeing on top of the big tech stories for us today. Thanks so much for that. Well, coming up, Green Champions, California, leading the charge on clean tech and sustainable innovation. But the question is, are those investments being made in an equitable manner?

4192," you you... Welcome to Yahoo Finance Live I'm Sean the Svith alongside Dave Briggs. Let's get you up to speed. On the Saturday that we are seeing today has to do with the tech earnings that we got out after the bell yesterday. Take a look at the Dow, though, just barely in positive territory. You can see the tech side. We take a look at the NAS Agnazdeck composite off just around 1.8% NASDAQ 100 off over 2% today and that tech side also reflected in the S&P. You can see the S&P all about 7 tens of a percent on track to snap a three day win streak taking look at the bond market action very quickly years. We see a bit of a risk off sentiment in the market today. You can see yields pulling back just a bit off 9 beast points just above 4% now. Let's take a look at some of the biggest of climbers inside the tech sector. We have to look no further than Microsoft and and alphabet. You can see Google there off just around nearly 9% drop today trading just above 95 dollars a share pulling up Microsoft. That's off just around 7% this afternoon trading at 2.33 a share and just about an hour from now we're going to be getting results from meta taking look at how meta is trading this afternoon ahead of those results. That's off a 6% a lot of that has to do with the results that we got from Google yesterday the fact that we are seeing such a pullback in ad spending obviously huge concern here from meta ahead of those results. To you look at the sector action across the board they're selling obviously intensified in communication services and technology sectors both of those sectors off 2% and 3% respectively on the flip side energy holding on to gains this afternoon up just around 1% of the health care and material state. Google's worst day since March of 2020 we talk about that time period an awful lot these days. Shana thank you let's get you up to speed now on housing again seeing the impact of higher rates. Mortgage demand fell last week to nearly half of what it was a year ago and it was lowest level since 1997 that's according to the Mortgage Bankers Association. The driving force once again the 30 year fixed rate now increasing to speed. The number of the numbers on Thursday up from 694 we could go and now at their highest level since 2001. That was the time a guy named Harry Potter was debuting in theaters for context. Refies down 86% year over year. Well demand for adjustable rate and mortgages or arms as many call them continue to increase more than tripling from the market. The number of the numbers that are in the market is in the market. The number of the numbers that are in the market is increasing from earlier this year. Now over to a raise. We're going to get us up to speed on some moves in energy. Hi, Des. Hi, Dave. And we're watching today oil as it has been rallying WTI up more than 3% branches up more than 2%. A couple of reasons for this is light dip in the U.S. dollar and oil is invoiced in dollar. So that's why you're seeing this bump. Also the U.S. posted record high exports. That's why with WTI, we're going to be in a few more days to be able to see the market. So that's why we're looking at a rally here as well. Taking a look at natural gas prices. A little bit of a bump. But take a look at a one-month chart. Because you see the market. And we're going to see the market. And we're going to see the market. And we're going to see the market. And we're going to see the market. And we're going to see the",https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hqIy-Q36neE,73,2022-10-26 19:04:13
4193," why with WTI, you're looking at a rally here as well. Taking a look at natural gas prices, a little bit of a bump, but take a look at a one-month chart because you can see natural gas down 17% over the last month. In fact, I'm going to pull up a year-to-date chart so you can see the action here, this downward trend. We are expecting some warmer weather in the next couple of weeks. It's a part of the reason why you're seeing a little bit of this price movement. But also, in Europe, we're seeing a downward trend with natural gas prices there as well because of milder weather because their inventories are now, their storages are full and also because demand is down as well, guys. I don't know, thanks so much for that. Let's talk about the broader market action this afternoon. A lot of that has to do with the selling that we're seeing in tech. And really talk about the key underlying technical factors that we need to watch for the rest of this earnings season. For that, we want to bring in Katie Stockton, Fairlead Strategies, Founder Katie. It's great to see you. Let's first start off with Alphabet. Having the worst day that we have seen in quite some time, you can see right now trading just above $95 a share. I know you have a chart really looking at the technicals of this $95 a share. What do you think of Google at this price? Well, you know, when you see a gap down, it's obviously a step back on the chart. But it's surprisingly not doing too much damage to our indicators. The indicators are designed to reduce the noise and the indicators are actually treating this gap down as noise. You're not seeing any kind of breakdown with the gap just given the oversold bounce that preceded it. So I would say that it could be worse when we might take away. And now if we saw Google or Alphabet and Microsoft get back above, there's summer lows. That would be nice and incremental positive for them. Or viewing any kind of stabilization on the back of this as within the context of their long-term downtrend. So the bear market cycle still very much has a hold on most of the mega caps and of course major indices. Katie, you mentioned Microsoft. They're down more than 7% largely on the back of a bit of a miss on the Azure cloud growth. Let's zero in on your expectations there. Yeah, it's really the same chart to be honest in it. And it's maintained a fairly high positive correlation to Alphabet's chart. You'll notice there to a gap down but not a breakdown. There is some support risk at the recent low. That is still very much intact. There's also additional longer term support around to 15 for Microsoft based on if they're not she replacement level. It's not as if the client is making the bottom drop out for these names. It's really just sort of more of the same in terms of the downtrends that have been enforced here to date. And we suspect that they're actually going to recover here in the near term. And we say that more because the top down influences as opposed to something specific to those stock themselves. The positive seasonal influences are very prevalent at this time of year. We also have or came into the earnings season with this sort of deeply and widespread oversold condition. And that's why the vast majority of the reactions outside of Alphabet and Microsoft have been more positive than not. So that is something that could foster greater relief rally and give us at least better selling off. OK, we have Microsoft and Alphabet the two big reasons why we're seeing the SMP in the red today. We have the SMP off just around 8 tens of a percent on track to snap that three day winning streak. When you take a look at the current value of the SMP just above 3,800, where do you think we go from here? Looking right up into that down trending 50 day moving average and that was sort of a natural place for it to take cause that we wouldn't expect it to go up strongly every single day. It already lifted more than 10 and a half percent off of it three-cent low with this oversold balance. So we've been calling for a few days of consolidation as of yesterday. And that's based on short-term overbought conditions primarily in some counter-con signals on a very, very short-term basis. But we're looking for that consolidation before it's higher for us resistance that has been taxed of initially is around 3914. And beyond that, we're watching the down trending 200 day moving average, which we would not be surprised to see a test of before this relief rally fully fail. Okay, Katie, how about the current seeks to...",https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hqIy-Q36neE,74,2022-10-26 19:08:26
4194," that we're watching the down to the 200 day moving average, which we would not be surprised to see a test of before this relief rally fully failed. Okay, Katie, about the currency exchange, obviously the US dollar, the strength of it, the story for many, if not all, multinationals in Q3 without before a little bit of a pullback in recent days. What's your expectation? Very strong long-term up trend, of course, behind the dollar, and that up trend still does have the support of positive long-term momentum indicators just look at long-term moving averages. They're all pointing higher and mostly diverging still. And yet within that context, we had noticed a few weeks ago some signs about the exhaustion that we hadn't really seen since about April, looking at the dollar index. And the signs of exhaustion were based on the Denmark indicators. Those are designed to gauge what a trend seems to be firing out a little bit. And that's what seems to have happened here for the dollar. We're looking for more consolidation, more of the same that we've seen recently for the pullback and consolidation. So basically regulate the slope of that very steep up trend. Can you take a look at the price of crude today? Again, getting that bum like a nurse was just telling us about a lot of that has to do with the data that we've just gotten out. But taking a look at how crude has been trading. We have it up on your screen there. When you take a look at the right hand part of that chart, really, in the month of October, we have been pretty ranged by between this 85 and 95 bucks of barrel. What do you make of the prices that we're seeing today? Yeah, it's a little short term momentum shift. The upside we've seen already an oversold bounce that was partially retraced now coming out of that pullback. I do think that we'll see a relief rally unfold as well and food greater degree in crude oil prices, also natural gas prices. But there has been of course a long term loss of upside momentum that we've seen that with a downturn over the past several months. And that is certainly notable shift for crude oil. So we have to assume that this relief rally may meet resistance a bit lower of course than the earlier highs here. We're looking for resistance. We discovered somewhere in the 96 to $97 for barrel area. But those energy stocks really don't seem to be bothered whatsoever by the downturn that preceded this relief rally. They do not. All right, Fairlead Strategies, Katie Stockton, always a pleasure, always learning. Appreciate your time. Elon Musk making an appearance at Twitter headquarters. See, posted this video on Twitter moments ago. It comes just days before his $44 billion deal to acquire the social media platform is supposed to close. There is a court mandated deadline on Friday at 5 p.m. Eastern for Musk to take ownership. Bloomberg reporting Musk will speak to employees on Friday. And he's already tweaked his Twitter profile calling himself Chief Twitt, Shana, which is well, pretty appropriate. You can see shares up just over 1%. The question is, how do you address those employees? He is not a master communicator, though clearly one of the brilliant business innovators of our time. This is a tenuous time inside that building, at which they already know about the paperwork suggesting 75% of them will be out of the job. Yeah, you would have to guess that he won't exactly receive the warmest welcome from so many of Twitter employees. Taking a look at an email that was actually sent out by Twitter's chief marketing officer, who sent the employees there. She was saying that Elon is going to be in the San Francisco office this week walking the halls, trying to dive in and really realize the important work that you do. Feel free to say hi. She went on to say if you see him in the hall, I don't know if people are going to be too eager to see Musk in the office. I mean, there's so many questions that remain unanswered, especially when your job is potentially on the line. A lot of people are anxious, and I think people want to know exactly what the vision for Twitter is and remains to be seen. I guess how long we're going to have to wait to see what Elon Musk is going to actually do with them. And how he's going to make money, start by broadcasting that live on pay-per-view. I don't get you. We would all pay our five bucks to watch that address. All right, we're just getting started here on Yahoo Finance Live coming up.

4196," So what were the biggest headwinds for you? Well, we really did see some mixed signs across our business. We've had a very strong recovery in our North America to Hawaii markets, which is the biggest part of our revenue generation. Really, there's no question that's been back for several quarters. Holding things back a little bit is our two parts of our network. One is neighbor island, where demand is actually strong, but we've got a competitive situation with low fares in that part of the network that are suppressing financial returns. And then Japan, in the third quarter, wasn't fully recovered. It's going to take a little time to get back. The good news is that at the beginning of October, they have removed some of the pandemic travel restrictions in Japan. So the environment is really set up now to have a more robust recovery over the next couple of quarters. And Japan is the biggest source of international visitors to Hawaii. It's very important to the market and important to us. Peter, you touched on the competition there from a local competitor aggressive pricing. And you also talked about this on the earnings call last night. What are you doing then to compete because they are offering fares at very, very low prices? Well, we're matching the fares on many of our flights. So we've got pretty broad availability of those discounted fares. But on top of that, we offer a broader and deeper schedule. We really want to focus on delivering impeccable service to our guests. We've doubled our Hawaiian miles that we offer to our guests to reward our loyal passenger. So we're going to make sure that we give people reason to fly Hawaiian. Whatever the fair price environment is, we want to make sure that when people have a choice, they choose Hawaiian. As they have for 93 years traveling between the islands. So we're no stranger to competition. And we're just going to face it head on. Yeah, $39 fares. That's a burger and a beer in New York City these days. The deal with Amazon, how significant and investor story is that? And can you tell us more about the option to acquire up to 15% of your stock? We're really excited to be able to announce this agreement with Amazon. It's been in the works for a number of months. And it's great to be able to talk about it now. It really means a couple of things fundamentally for us going forward. One is that it's an avenue for growth in the years ahead. And so it really opens up a new channel for us to grow the business in a little bit of a different way. And it also helps us diversify our business. This business with Amazon won't be facing the same risks and challenges that we have in the passenger business. That doesn't mean it's risk-free, but it is a little bit of diversification, which is good when you're dealing with the ups and downs of an economic cycle. So we're contracted now to fly can air planes for on behalf of Amazon. We'll be flying between airports that are near their large distribution centers. Most of this will be on the US mainland. Some of it is likely to touch Hawaii over time. And there's an opportunity to grow beyond that. And it's up to us to perform and deliver impeccable service and to operate on time. So Amazon chooses to pick offs to do more of their flying going forward. And JPM, JP Morgan calling it a game changer here for your business. Peter, when you take a look at staffing, and I know we've talked with you about it in the past, the pilot shortages, what you're doing, what that currently looks like for your business. Have you seen any improvement? We've really seen some good traction being gained here in terms of being able to staff up. We've been hiring pilots and flight attendants and other employees throughout the year. In terms of pilots right now, we're able to recruit the pilots we need. And part of that is because we've got a lot of wide body aircraft. And wide body aircraft are at the end of the day, what pilots get paid the most to fly.",https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hqIy-Q36neE,77,2022-10-26 19:21:24
4197," Part of that is because we've got a lot of wide-body aircraft and wide-body aircraft are at the end of the day what pilots get paid the most to fly. So we've got a pretty compelling economic proposition. We've improved a lot in terms of being able to recruit mechanics and airport employees here in Hawaii. That's been a tight market, but we're moving along. And over the course of the whole year, we're up to close to 1,500 positions filled. And that's at a company where our total employment is about 7,200 right now. So a lot of activity from our recruiting department and they're doing a good job, but it is a dynamic market. You've got to make sure you've got a compelling proposition and that you've got a company that people want to work for. And that's something we're really focused on making sure that we're an employer that is a desired destination in a competitive market. Peter Ingraham, always great to have you. Thanks so much for coming on after earnings. We hope you join us again in next quarter Peter Ingraham CEO of Hawaiian Holdings. All right, coming up next, Chinese tech stocks are bouncing back today. We're going to discuss whether it's time to buy some of these names next. So Apple adding a new text to its App Store. Some sees another direct shot at Facebook parent meta. Tech reporter Dan Howley here with more on this story. Dan, what are we learning? I'm sorry. That's right. Apple is essentially forcing or enforcing its in-app payment rules on Facebook parent meta. In particular, this has to do with when people make purchases to boost some of their posts on the likes of Facebook or Instagram. Those were not being processed through Apple's App Store payment.",https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hqIy-Q36neE,78,2022-10-26 19:25:55
4198," make purchases to boost some of their posts on the likes of Facebook or Instagram. Those were not being processed through Apple's App Store payment system. And so Apple wasn't getting any revenue out of that. So now they're saying that, look, other companies do this like Twitter and TikTok. So now we're going to enforce this with Meta. Now this comes as the two companies spar, continue to spar rather over Apple's privacy changes that it made to iOS, which is really smacked Meta as far as ad revenue goes, as well as Snap, by the way. And also comes as Apple talks about how it's going to be increasing some ads across its own platforms. Now when Apple talks about its advertising business, it talks about how it protects user privacy, how it doesn't collect user data, how you only see it in particular places. And that's its way of contrasting itself against something like Meta or other social media companies that will display ads for you from places that you may have visited online or through third party apps. So really this is kind of a continuation of the budding of heads between the two companies. And I don't expect it to end anytime soon. It doesn't look like it's going very well on Meta's side of things. The privacy changes have really struck at them and they continue to try to work through the Metaverse transition. So it's really hurting them more than it's hurting Apple. But part of the philosophy behind their desire to be a Metaverse company and behind that push that's costing them $10 billion a year is to get away from relying on third party hardware partners like Apple. So this is kind of their way of ensuring that if the Metaverse is the future, they can call their own shots. They don't have to rely on Apple doing things like this. Didn't let's talk about another big story for Apple today. It's going to comply with the EU's ruling that all devices are going to use the USB-C ports. Talk to us just about how costly this could potentially be here for Apple. Yeah, this is almost something that a lot of people were expecting to happen. We already have USB-C on the Mac. We already have it on the iPad. So it almost felt like a foregone conclusion that we would see it on the iPhone as well as its AirPods. The cases for the AirPods are still lightning-enabled. But they do offer the Beats brand that uses USB-C. So it's not as if this is something that is completely alien to them or anything like that. I don't know how much it will end up costing them. I do think that it is just another hardship for consumers, though, because all of those lightning cables that they have, they'll become useless once they have their new iPhones. So it really does become this, you know, unending cycle of, there's another cable. Now I have a whole, you know, rats nest of them in my basement. What do I do with them? Right? Right of them. So I think that's really what this comes down to. It does make more sense, you know, USB is universal. You can use it to charge your computer and your phone. It's just a shame that it took Apple this long to get on the USB train. I know, I already have way too many Apple chargers at home. Right. Even yeah, exactly. It's turning into a bigger problem. Right? I didn't have any. Thanks so much. Let's take a look at the broader market here, because the SMP back in the red today's big tech sells off Microsoft and Google leading it to the downside following their disappointing earnings results. You see the S&B off just around a 7 tens of a percent. Nasdaq actually up nearly 2% this afternoon. Here to talk about that and some of the broader trends at play. We want to bring in Tom Liden, vetifies, Smyshe Chairman. He joins us for this week's ETF report sponsored by Invesco. QQQ. Tom, it's great to see you. The slide that we're seeing in tech, I know you recently just wrote about ETF fun flows when it comes to some of those tech specific funds. What do you make of today's news and what do you think that's going to mean for investor appetite there? So when you look at the big picture coming out of the financial crisis, it was all about fang stocks, Microsoft, those tech stocks that really drove the S&P to, it was really tough to beat. No active managers could really touch it. Now in the last couple of years, S&P has been challenged and we're seeing more of that with these mega cap stocks being challenged in the market. What that does mean to is it's better for some of these actively managed ETFs. For the first time in 20 years, we're seeing active managers actually outperform some of their...",https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hqIy-Q36neE,79,2022-10-26 19:30:04
4199," Two is it's better for some of these actively managed ETFs. For the first time in 20 years, we're seeing active managers actually outperform some of their indexed counterparts that they're benchmark against. So that's good for the ETF business because active management has really made it in there. Number one, number two, there are also great opportunities outside the mega cap area. Outside the S&P 500 small caps in the last three months are up, almost 8% compared to the S&P that's only up 3%. So diversifying away from these big companies is important. And also when you look at small caps, just because of this strong dollar, multinationals are affected overseas. We know that, but there's a home country bias with small caps where they can buy goods and services overseas and do most of their business in the US. And then finally, quick shout out to stocks overseas. I mean, listen, those markets are challenged and in many cases in emerging markets, you've got multi-generational buying opportunities where there are single digit P's there and although it doesn't feel good, the currencies is working against you. If you've got a long-term outlook like you guys do, who are a lot younger than me, you could buy some now and just forget about it for a couple years, but you're not going to see buying opportunities with these low PE ratios that you see now. Speaking of overseas challenges that could to some represent opportunities, she's third-term and China hammered Chinese big tech stocks, Chinese stocks represented here, is there opportunities there in the ETF space? Well, Peter Lynch said don't ever let a bear market opportunity go unused or something like that. I'm kind of paraphrasing that, but it not only from a technical standpoint, a governmental standpoint, all the saber-addling that's going on, and then the whole delisting thing that's happening, that's really key and important. But we have to know that timeline is not the next three months, it's actually the next two years. So we've got some time for that delisting thing and the accounting thing to be worked out. And also with that being said, you look at some of these companies like Baba, they're not going away. And they're going to continue with all the online buying that's happening and going to continue to grow the fact that most of the citizens in China don't have laptops, they don't have desktops, they do everything off of their phone and all their buying and purchasing happens there. Their companies that are set up there to take full advantage of that. And the valuations have come down tremendously where you could buy some of these ETFs like KWeb, which is online buying China, which has just been devastated, price-wise. But the crazy thing is, shareholders are staying tough, they're not selling. Actually, some are doubling down because they see this as a buying opportunity. Time, you mentioned the strong dollar. Obviously, a huge head when we've heard about it from a number of CEOs who have reported earnings over the last couple of weeks, we've seen the dollar index pull back just a bit today. But when you see the strength of the dollar here, what do you think that needs just from an investment standpoint? And then if you're looking to capitalize on this through ETFs, what should people be doing? Well, as Katie said in the last segment, it's tough to find a trend. When you fight a trend, you've got to have some pretty big guts. Right now, with all the uncertainty in the marketplace, people are going towards safe havens, the dollars are safe haven for sure. And if we continue to see rising rates, Fed's pretty clear about signaling, which is a good thing. They're telling what's going to happen. And since they were pretty clear about that in May, all of a sudden, there's been more confidence in the market. We see from the advisors that were surveying regularly when they were selling bonds have now actually come back into the bond market because there's more clarity along with these advanced yields. So that's really, really good. What we can't count on is stability overseas. And that's the scary thing. But while there is an instability, ETFs like UUP, which in the Avesco Long Dollar, there's an opportunity that if you want to hedge against continued problems overseas with foreign currencies and instability in governments, that may continue to do well. That applies, Tom. Liden, I was good to see you, sir. Thank you, senior studio.",https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hqIy-Q36neE,80,2022-10-26 19:34:22
4200," the end governments that may continue to do well. That applies Tom Liden. I was good to see you sir. Thank you. Good to see you, studio. All right, investors are loving Wingstop this afternoon. We will tell you why after the break. This time for triple play three stocks that we're watching in the final 30 minutes of trading Netflix, Boeing and Wingstop. My play today is Netflix. Pivotal research once the biggest bear on the street when it comes to Netflix. Now on board with the streaming giant double upgrade there on the stock to buy a from sell and lifting its price started to a street high of $3.75 a share. That means that they think the stock is going to rally at least another 20% here from current levels. Pivotal research is bullish for a number of reasons those do include the net new subscriber growth number that we just got last week. Competitors raising prices, that giving Netflix an advantage. And they also say that the company is positioned in a relative strength position here and they're going to submit a major slowdown in digital advertising, which we have heard now from so many companies that have reported over the last week or so. Jared, so when you take a look at this stock, it has really bounced back over the last three months year to date though. We're still clearly in the run. Yeah, and let's take a look at the Wi-Fi interactive. This is the last three months, which you were just referencing and you can see we got lift off. Didn't even get that a couple months ago when we had that nice big August rally. However, you take a look at what's happened over the last 10 years. You can see how the stock gave back four years worth of gains in a matter of weeks, if not months here. And this remains a broken stock, kind of a show me story, along with many others in the tech sector until proven otherwise. And now I want to turn to the Dow where I am taking a look at Boeing. That stock is off 8.9%. This is a 10 year view. Let me just give you a year to date while I give you some of the details from.",https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hqIy-Q36neE,81,2022-10-26 19:38:52
4201," want to turn to the Dow where I am taking a look at Boeing, that stock is off 8.9%. This is a 10 year view. Let me just give you a year to date while I give you some of the details from this morning's earnings announcement. Now, number one, it's having its worst day since May, off nearly 10% at the lows today. And that's after reporting a miss on profits and sales. This is not helped by a $2.8 billion worth of losses and defense. And that's due to cost overruns on military contracts, including the refueling of Air Force 1. So you got to think maybe they're not hedging their fuel costs the way they should or maybe it's just in the contracts. Nevertheless, you can see these losses really varying by business segment here. Also we got some selling underway during the session after they cut their 737 delivery goals. And they said it may drop the 737 max variance unless a critical certification deadline in the U.S. is extended. We've seen these problems day before for Boeing. They just kind of happen in clusters. And you can see on this chart on the Wi-Fi Interactive, this is a year-to-day chart, didn't take out the May, June, July lows right here. So we do have a successful retest of that bottom, but we are heading down in a big fashion. And it's kind of reminiscent of some of those big down days that we had back when they had those original problems with the 737 max day. Going through the report, there is something to like, of course, the commercial unit. Revenue is up 40 percent and they delivered 112 planes. That's up from 85s, they're making some progress there, but they did cite continued supply chain issues through next year, is their expectation so clearly not out of the woods yet. My play, A Trending Ticker, on Yahoo driven by my stomach is always wing stop reporting earnings. Sales jumped 18 percent from last year, including a 6.9 percent increase in same store sales. The company's margins help by a 42 percent drop in the cost of bone and chicken wings from a year prior. Digital sales, a huge number, accounting for 62 percent of their sales during the quarter. CEO Michael Skipworth saying we've opened 167 net new restaurants through the third quarter on track to have a record year for restaurant development. Shares jumping 16 percent on this news, still though, down 9 percent year to date. Jared, the big question is boneless wings or are they called spicy chicken nuggets? Oh, you know what? I got to have the wings. I got to have the wings. Boneless wings. You call them boneless wings. Boneless wings. I do too. I do too. I don't call them chicken nuggets. No, but there's a big argument there. I'm guessing our own Josh J for is going to be in my ear momentarily. Sorry, Jen, do you mean Kate? No, I wasn't going to jump in there. They're not wings to me unless they have the bones in it. Okay. I guess you're on the other side of this argument. It's interesting though, Dave, when you take a look at this chart here because over the past six months, they certainly have seen a massive rebound in their business. Past six months, it's up 60 percent. And really, when you take a look at the commentary from the CEO on the earnings call when you talk an analyst this morning, he was really saying he was very sure and very confident in the business here over the coming months. When you take a look at the challenging environment, what that could mean for a slowdown, obviously, means investors are pretty excited and we're seeing that reflected in the share price today with the stock popping up what 16 percent. All right, well, it has been a tough day for tech stocks. I'm in disappointing earnings. But coming up next, we'll speak with one tech CEO whose company shares are climbing higher. 17",https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hqIy-Q36neE,82,2022-10-26 19:43:17
4202," Bis kamu由aspersomen, dan四, dan dan dan dan dan Dan dan dan dan dan dan dan dan dan dan dan dan dan dan dan dan dan dan dan dan dan dan dan dan dan Record revenues propelling Juniper Networks to a Q3 earnings beat, provider of automation, AI and cloud delivered and software based technologies. Juniper Network's CEO, Rami Rahim, joining us now, Rami, good to see you, sir. What do we learn in the quarter? Well, it was a great quarter. We had record revenue for the quarter, record enterprise revenue. We had double digit growth rates in all of our strategic verticals, record software, record ARR. So, I'm delighted with the execution of the team. I think we've got some great technology out there and it's really working for us. Rami, we take a look over the next couple of quarters. Obviously, we're in an environment where some businesses are beginning to pull back on spending. Are you seeing that happen at all? And what are you seeing? Are you seeing any orders be canceled yet? You know, we're seeing some customers scrutinize their budgets a little bit more in the timing of their projects. But by and large, I'm delighted with the order momentum and demand dynamics that are existing in the market today. I think we have seen no cancellations, maybe a few push outs. I really do believe that we have a very large market opportunity and we have a very differentiated technology solution about AI-driven operations, AI-driven experience and the ability to grow share even in an environment where we might see some pull back in spending. But so far, we haven't really seen anything. Rami, much ado about the Azure Cloud numbers from yesterday. What are you seeing in the cloud space from your own numbers? So our cloud customers are very important to Juniper networks and our cloud business has been performing very well over the last few years. I honestly don't pay too much attention to the results of any given quarter because generally speaking, cloud providers' business is doing exceptionally well in the long term, they will have to continue to invest in their network infrastructure to keep pace with the insatiable demand from consumers and enterprises for cloud services. And we power many of the cloud networks that are out there, all of the hyperscalers, many of the tier two, tier three cloud providers as well with great technologies for automation, ASIC technologies that drive the passenger requirements for our customers. So I'm delighted with the performance that we're seeing in the cloud space. Speaking of performance, we have a three month chart up right now. But if you take a look at how the stock has fared your to date clearly outpacing so many of your rivals out there, what do you think Juniper has done to really better position yourself than some of the major competitors because you're all 15%",https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hqIy-Q36neE,83,2022-10-26 19:47:48
4203," He's saying so many of your rivals out there. What do you think? Juniper has done to really better position yourself than some of the major competitors, because you're all 15% but when you compare that to some of the massive losses that we're seeing within the tech sector, it looks pretty good. You know, the future of networking is around AI driven operations. And this is where we have performed exceptionally well. You know, we saw our enterprise business grow double digits both from orders and a revenue standpoint. And the magic, the secret sauce here is our AI capabilities that is crushing the costs of running networks for our customers as well as vastly improving the end user experience of using those networks to do practically anything today. That differentiation is working for us in the market today better than it has in the history of our company. The release sites, a worldwide shortage of semiconductors and other components. You also say we're experiencing ongoing supply chain challenges. Can you talk about those challenges and do you see them improving on the horizon? We grew revenue in Q3, 19% year over year, which means that roughly speaking, we shipped 19% more volume of products this quarter than we did a year ago. So clearly things are improving, but they remain challenging. And in fact, we're sitting on a record backlog for the company, which means that there are a lot of customers out there that are waiting for their products to be shipped. I do anticipate things to start to get better, not completely normal, but better next year. We're obviously working very closely with our strategic suppliers to understand what the dynamics are like. And we've invested in our supply chain to keep pace with or as close as possible with the demand from our customers. That's works for us in Q3. I expect it to continue to work for us through the rest of this year. And I think it should get better next year. I mean, you mentioned earlier that you haven't really seen a slowdown, at least when it comes to some of your customers out there in this weekening economy. But more specifically, what does it mean for your business, for your growth? Because here we are up against a strong dollar. Rates are rising. How are you adjusting? So we are in fact making sure that we're pivoting our investments to areas of the market that are going to be most resilient to any sort of economic downturn. Even if you don't necessarily see anything just now, we are, in fact, looking at investing in new areas in our go-to-market organization and our technologies, that could make us more resilient in the event of that downturn. So for example, public sector, college campuses, health care, our new areas where our technologies are really, really suited for, we just have to pivot our sales motion, our playbooks in that direction. And I think that sets us up for success even in the event of a downturn. Rami Rahima, CEO of Juniper Network. Thanks so much for joining us. All right, coming up next, President Biden cracking down on junk fees from banks and other businesses. We've got the details for you when we come back.

4204," music music music music President Biden cracking down on so-called junk fees. And that means everything from banks and other businesses, Yahoo! Finance is done for Sean Burger. Has it details on that for us? Hey, Jen. Hey, there, Sean. That's right. President Biden announcing this morning that he is indeed going to be cracking down on those so-called junk fees, effectively banning banks from issuing surprise overdraft and deposit fees on bounced checks. His new measure is being announced. Less than two weeks ahead of the midterm elections are aimed at lowering costs for Americans who are grappling with high inflation. Take a listen. Today's actions are going to save consumers more than $1 billion each year. And that's a lot of money back in people's pockets. As director Chopra shared this morning, that his team is even going further developing rules and guidance that would take credit card late fees and other banking fees that cost Americans $24 million a year. Take them on. And we're just getting started. There are tens of billions of dollars in other junk fees across the economy. And I have directed my administration to reduce or eliminate them. The Consumer Financial Protection Bureau issued new guidance on Wednesday, making it illegal for banks to charge overdraft fees. One at the time of purchase, the bank website or ATM balance showed the customer had enough money in their account. The agency says those fees likely violate the CFPB's X ban on unfair fees are unavoidable to consumers. Now, the president says he's just getting started by and also highlighted new rule requirements. The Department of Transportation is working on aimed at requiring airlines and online travel sites to disclose fees for picking a seat, checking a bag or any other extra add-on fees. Guys. Okay, Jim, want to ask you about the SEC also making some news today, passing a rule that would allow companies to claw back executive compensation? What can you tell us? Yeah, so the SEC just approving a rule this morning that would claw back executive compensation of companies that have to materially correct financial statements, basically putting these executives' bonuses in play. The SEC commissioners voted along party lines three, two with Democrats voting in favor of Republicans voting against. Now this is a financial crisis error rule that was left unfinished from that 2008 financial crisis that would require U.S. listed companies to put out a plan to recoup executive compensation if they have to correct those financial statements due to compliance failures. Now, when asked whether he thinks that this new rule could change how companies set executive compensation, SEC chairginslor said, quote, I don't share the view that companies could shift toward more salaries, but while it may change how they're doing it, it better aligns it with incentives that you don't get paid on errors, I think boards would rather have incentive pay based on balance.",https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hqIy-Q36neE,85,2022-10-26 19:56:11
4205," May change how they're doing it and better aligns it with incentives that you don't get paid on errors I think boards would rather have incentive pay based on valid financials and take away any possible incentives to have both deep financials. Dave, I have to argue with that logic. Jen Schomburger, thanks so much good stuff. Some breaking news now. Tesla reportedly under criminal investigation in the US over its self-driving claims. Reuters reported the Justice Department launched the probe last year and hasn't been disclosed until now. It comes after more than a dozen crashes involving the autopilot system which was activated during the accidents. Tesla shares edging higher on the day less than 1%. Coming up, we're counting down to the closing bill on Wall Street. Stay with us right here on Yahoo Finance Live. Just under a two minutes here until the closing bill, Jay Blacchare, it's a closer look at some of the selling and I guess some of the buying there's some green on that screen that we're seeing today. What's up, Jen? Yes, well, it's some mega caps that are really weighing on the results here and in the Dow. You can see that's positive or at least it was positive energy leading the way along with healthcare materials. But to the downside, XLC, that's communication services and tech. Those sets where the losses are concentrated and you can see that in alpha, that is down 9%. So it was Boeing, by the way, over in the Dow, but Microsoft also down 7% Amazon down 4. Guess what? We got meta after the bell. It's already down over 5% today. It's also in that communication sector that we were talking about. And here's the Dow.

The Dow closed on the day up just barely eaking out gains 3 points in the S&P up. 0.7% while the Nasdaq Jared talked about. Big names, Alphabet and Microsoft, dragging it down 2% on the day for a closer look at the broader markets. That's brilliant. Jake Jolly, BNY, Mel and Investment Management, Senior Investment Strategist, Keith Fitzgerald, Group Principal. Good to see you both. Keith will give you first crack what's your interpretation of the day? Well, interesting day, I think that investors are grasping at straws, i.e. the mobile eye debut, but at the same time, there's shellacking companies that in this game of things really don't deserve it. So to me it's interesting, we did a little bit of buying, I don't want to look at gift horse in the mouth. Jake, what do you think about today's moves? Keith, I think we're still up over the last couple of days and we're still positive for the month, but I think unfortunately the macro outlook has not materially changed. So we shouldn't be too surprised to see sort of the growth your tech side of the market come under pressure and remain under pressure so long as the interest rate outlook is still leading to the upside. Keith, we've had 24 hours now to let the earnings come in from both Alphabet and Microsoft. And let's start with Microsoft, is there opportunity there given the take down? Well, no question in my mind, you know, this is one of the strongest companies on the planet. It's one of the most widely held companies on the planet. It's up 1400% over the last 20 years. It's up hundreds of percent over the last five. Do you really want to get off a winning horse in the middle of the race? That's what investors need to think. And frankly, if a report like today where they had a double beat top and bottom line bothers them, they really out to rethink why they're investing in the first place. Jake, when you take a look at today's risk off sentiment as some piece still off nearly 20 percent since the start of the year. A lot of this has to do with fears here that we're going to slide into a recession. Where do you stand on that? And do you think the US can still avoid a recession? Well, we do think it is possible to be a void recession. We don't think that's the odds on that. We would give it about a 30 percent probability of avoiding getting some sort of a softish landing gear in the next six to 12 months. But the other side of that probability, 70 percent probability is that we do have a recession or environment. There are still a lot of indicators out there suggesting that there is more pain ahead in 2023. So for us, that means that this is a market that is starting to look much more favorable to bonds than equities. And within equities, we think it makes sense to be defensive and really favor those higher quality names within our equity allocation. Keith, can we avoid a recession? I think we've been in one for the past six months, frankly. I don't think the official statistics reflect that. The average American is hurting, the wallets are hurting, everything's getting pinched in the wrong direction. And I think the fed statistics don't just simply catch up. They're reflecting an economy that no longer exists. Jake, we're one week out now from the next fed decision. I sound like 75 basis one. I guess pretty much a sure thing. What are you expecting? And also, what do you expect then looking out into December? Yeah, 75. Go ahead, Jake. I'm sorry. Go ahead. Big 75 is pretty much in the bag for next week. Well, we're obviously going to be listening for is an indication of whether we're going to get a downshift in the rate of heights coming into December. Right now, looks like the market's kind of debating whether we're going to see it here 75 from December meeting. Now, keep in mind that we get two more inflation reports before the next fed meeting in December. So, we're on.",https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hqIy-Q36neE,87,2022-10-26 20:04:47
4207," debating whether we're going to see 50 or 75 from the summer meeting. Now keep in mind that we get two more inflation reports before the next bed meeting in December. So we're obviously going to have a lot more inflation data that's going to influence whether the Fed decides to step down in 50. We obviously saw the Bank of Canada deliver a surprise downshift today. I don't think that's really going to be influencing what the Fed does. But we got to see how these inflation reports come in before we really see how the Fed went to decide to take policy in the summer. Keith, you were chopping up the bit to get in on that. So what's ahead from the Fed? And do you think we'll see in these two months any sign of inflation cooling? You know, let's tackle the last one first. I don't think inflation is going to cool. Not at the retail level. We're certainly all going to get pinched. But when it comes to the Fed, I don't think the Fed understands the narrative. I think it's as wrong now about rates and labor as it has been about transitory from the very beginning. So I'm hoping they're going to pivot. I hope they're going to take a breath. But you know, 75%, 75 basis points is big in twice. So I don't think that's actually going to happen. Traders with real money have a very different viewpoint. So Keith, what is it going to take then in order to see inflation start to cool? That's the question I've been asking myself and anybody else who is going to listen. For a long time, I think we got to fix the supply chain. The Fed simply got to go along for the ride until the government stops spending money because you can't add fuel to the fire and expect different results. And that's what's been happening. Well, divided government will assure that they stop spending money. So Jake, what will help? Well, unfortunately, we need to see some softness in the labor market. But that is facing a very strong, average man. I disagree. Respectfully that we are inter-recessioned right now. I think when we look at the economy, we're still seeing a very robust, economically active economy. And that's the reason that wages are still growing in 6%. And that is a problem for a Fed that is trying to get inflation back down to 2%. They're going to have to keep, keep edit as Jake now has said. Keep typing the screws on this economy. And that's what makes the outlook so challenging in total. I'm very glad to get both of you to weigh in on this because we're taking a little survey over the next hour. You're going to pick a fang stock. We're going to take out Netflix. We're going to put Microsoft in. You're going to pick one stock next three to five years. Keith, you get one. What you got? It's got to be a fang. It's got to be a fang. Only we're taking Netflix out, put Microsoft in. Yeah, let's see. I'm going to use A for Apple. Believe it or not. It's not fang, fang, fang. But you know, I'm going to Apple. That's the one I want to own in five years. Barton. Jake, who you got? I want to buy all of them. But if you're going to force me to pick, I'll take Microsoft. Keith, when you take a look real quick outside of some of those techniques that we've already talked about, we're also using opportunity in the market. Tremendous opportunity, energy that battles a long way from over, both literally and figuratively speaking. Medicine is interesting. That's not going away anytime soon. Those are areas we're keen to look at. And finally, corporate security, literally digital security with the number of bad actors around the world today. That is a must have theme and about as must have as it gets. All right, Keith, this is your out. Jake, Jolly, thanks so much for joining us. All right, coming up, meta earnings coming out right now. We'll break down the numbers for you when we get back.",https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hqIy-Q36neE,88,2022-10-26 20:09:17
4208," to All right, some breaking earnings news. You can see Ford shares down 2% after hours. Earnings are in. Yahoo! Finance is pros, supermanian here with the numbers. What do we see in? Amen. Yeah, Ford shares a little weaker here after hours after the report. A revenue, big revenue beat here of 39.4 billion versus 36.9 billion estimated. And adjusted EPS at 30 cents by a penny off from what Wall Street was expecting at 31 cents. But also they're actually taking a 2.7 billion non-cash charge impairment from their Argo state, which tech crunch had just reported that they were dissolving Argo, the self-driving technology company, between itself and Volkswagen. And they're taking a charge, they're saying they're going to invest, they're going to take engineers and invest in their L2 and L3 autonomous technology that we'll hear more about that later. But another big news is they updated their fiscal year, adjusted EBIT to 11.5 billion per year. That range was 11.5 to 12.5, so they took the lower part of that range there. As you know, last month they warned about cost pressures and things like that, warning that a billion dollars would hit and higher cost would hit their bottom line. But we also saw sales here in Q3 up 16% bail, it's about 464,000 trucks. That's a 4% increase in truck sales and 33% increase in SUV sales. We'll dig through this report more to see what's going on with EV and the game plan and things like that. But right now Ford shares off about almost 30% in the after hours. All right, thanks, prize. We want to get to meta earnings there across in the wires right now. Dan Halley has that for us. Hey, Dan. That's right, Sean. We have a beat on revenue, but a miss on earnings per share. They came in at 27.7 billion on revenue expectations, where for 27.4 billion earnings per share of $1.64, expectations were for $1.89. But what we're real issue here is their Q4 guidance. It came in lighter than expected. Meta is saying between 30 billion and 332.5 billion. The street was expecting 32.2 billion. They also said that they're going to be pacing spending on reality lab investments in 2023. But that past 2023, excuse me, but in 2023, the spending will be significantly higher on that. And that's the operation that cost them $10 billion last year as they try to ramp up their metaverse capabilities and move into that kind of company. Reality lab operating losses for this quarter were at 33.67 billion. That's versus expectations of 3.09 billion. Now they did have a little bit lighter than that.",https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hqIy-Q36neE,89,2022-10-26 20:13:52
4209," the 3.67 billion, that's versus expectations of 3.09 billion. Now they did have a little bit lighter than expected monthly active users at 2.96 billion versus expectations of 2.97 billion. And we also saw Facebook Daily active users beat that came in at 1.98 billion versus 1.86 billion users. So really not a great look for Facebook here. Obviously, meta, we're looking at shares down more than 6%. And you can imagine what it will be like tomorrow as everyone else digest this news. Exactly. It was off just around 5.5%. Already today we're seeing a drop again, Dave, of just over 6% here after hours. Yeah, let's talk. So he down 62% for the year. There's not a whole lot more room to fall. One would think, Dan, would you characterize these as bad? But maybe not as bad as some expected. But they did beat on revenue, but they did miss on these earnings for share. I think it's, you know, it's the moving forward that people are more spooked by. And, you know, basically saying that they're going to be dumping even more money in next year for reality labs and then pacing this spending. They did say that it seems like they're going to be reducing some headcount. They said they're going to be shrinking some in teams while other teams will be doing it. Some in teams while other teams would remain flat. So they are going to be looking at trimming some expenses. Yeah. But, you know, I mean, this is a company that's been just smashed since really, you know, Apple came out with those privacy changes for iOS. And then since then the slow down the economy and the digital ad market really just kind of crushing them at the same time that they're spending all this money on the reality labs venture, which we don't even know if that's going to be a big deal in the future or not. You did in the headcount. Those couple of lines did stick out to me. Headcount ending. They see headcount ending 2023 next year about in line with what it currently was in the third quarter of 2022. Saying that they're making changes across the board to operate more efficiently. They're going to hold some team, the headcount and some teams flat while they also have plans to shrink some others. Dan took through some of the reality labs numbers there. I think that's a big reason. Why the sock is often after hours in addition to that light guidance that we're getting here from meta. Also just in terms of Facebook monthly active users, daily active users. I want to quickly point that out monthly active users. 2.96 billion that was a slight myth there, daily active users. A bit better, but we certainly are not seeing that growth like we used to. And we know meta has certainly tried to diversify its business from what we initially thought of when we thought of meta. We obviously had the huge focus on Facebook, but that is certainly the switch that we've seen and the way that the company has progressed. Wall Street has not been on board with. All right, well, we are going to take a quick break. And we'll make a back wall of more on meta.

4210,"<|th|><|translate|> Tonight to celebrate and into your wonderful life!.... Let's take a look at meta. You can see why I look at that the stock now off just over 9% the earnings miss also weak guidance here. We're on shares in after hours trading just above one a 17. Let's bring in Brentville. Jeffrey senior analyst here with more on this and Brent. I know you've only had a few minutes here to dig into these numbers, but what's your first take? Look across the board tech continues to miss and they're disappointing. I think what's most disappointing are the expenses. I think everyone wants Zuckerberg to hit the air breaks on expenditures. The fact that they're holding head count flat is good, but I think everyone is calling for more severe measures in terms of trimming head count and trimming the expenses to get a hold of what's happening in this macro storm. So I think as we've said across tech, there's nothing really different here. It's the same story. Microsoft miss, Google miss, Facebook miss, Texas instrument at miss, everyone's missing. The macro is taking a hold and what you need to do in those times is you can't control the top line, but you can control the bottom line. And I think a lot of tech including meta has done a terrible job of getting a hold of the expenditures. It's hard to shift quick, but I think everyone wanted to hear more severe measures on the expense cut and we didn't get that. And so perhaps we get more on the call. But until we get that, this is the same issue at Microsoft and at alphabet. And investors wanted a harder line in the sand on expenditures and we're not hearing that yet. I think we'll get that, but I think ultimately, it's going to have to get a lot worse before these companies actually get in front of it. And unfortunately right now, there's really no support for any tech names. As we've been saying, tactically, until we find the bottom and the fundamentals and we are not near the bottom of the fundamentals, as we've said, it's a dark winter coming. We think there's tactical pain ahead for tech. And I just, again, it's just another reason to steer clear of tech right now for a lot of investors until this clears out. And as you talk, we see that number continue to fall. Brent now 11 and a half percent down after hours. And Brad Gerstner, of course, brought up what you're discussing his company controls two million shares of Facebook wanting a head count reduction of 20%. Do you think would you like to hear that address? Do you expect to hear anything about that address in the call? Well, they had already addressed it. They said flat head count through 23. So we didn't get what Brad wants. It's clearly the right thing to do, right? There's an incredible amount of below it. And we are effectively going into a recession. We've been talking about this repeatedly that it is going to get harder as we go into 23. The fact that companies like Microsoft and Google are all seen.",https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hqIy-Q36neE,91,2022-10-26 20:22:21
4211," talking about this repeatedly that it is going to get harder as we go into 23. The fact that companies like Microsoft and Google are all seeing it, it's just an indication of what's to come. And it's going to get worse. And so holding flat, I think, is not good enough, and I think that's why you're seeing the reaction that they don't get it. They're not listening to what investors want. And investors already have enough, had so much pain that they don't want to stick around for this. So it's, again, we've seen the Clint sweep. There's nothing different here between Snap, Microsoft, Google and Meta. And again, you've seen it across semis, you've seen it across most of the rest of software. And if you haven't seen it in software, you're going to see it. They're only delaying the inevitable, in my opinion. So it's really difficult to find anything to get excited about other than valuation. But Facebook's been cheap for a long time. And it's still, it doesn't, these stocks are not finding bottoms until we find a fundamental bottom. And I think that's what's been really hard for investors. It's been hard for me to be honest as an analyst is like, what's baked in? And what's baked in is nothing until the fundamentals bottom. And we are still probably a quarter or two away from fundamentals bottoming. You're Brent, it's very different than this toll. And obviously that Mark Zuckerberg is striking in this earnings release. He was saying that while we do face some near-term challenges on revenue, the fundamentals are still there for a return to stronger revenue growth. It sounds like you strongly disagree with that sentiment. If there could be one thing that Meta needs to focus on, I know you were saying they need to pull back on spending. But the one thing that they can do in the short term to better position the company for maybe the second half of 2023. What can they be doing today? Look, I'm not disagreeing that there's going to be a recovery. But I think everyone, we've said this in tech. Tech is awful at getting in front of the puck. If you guys are hockey players, you know what I'm talking about. Like this is, they just don't understand how to skate and get in front of it. Everyone is late to this. No one is preppy. No one's knowing acting on offense into a macro storm. You don't like wait it out and then all of a sudden you get wet and you're like, I'm going to buy an umbrella. You buy an umbrella first. Right? So of course it's going to get better. But like if you listen to Jeffrey's economist, which Dave Zervelsen and Natan Markowski have been dead on, like things are going to get worse. And the overall macro continues to soften. So again, I don't think this hey, this hope of things getting better. It's not getting better. They missed earnings by 20 miles. So, you know, I understand what tech companies are trying to evangelize for their platforms. But let's just talk about the reality of the environment. When you have a absolute 100% clean sweep of downward pressure across all the top stories with exception of like, okay, let's say 98%. There's 2% that are doing okay still. Like, you got to get more defensive. And these companies aren't acting quick enough. Getting back to the hockey puck though, Brent, don't you think Mark Zuckerberg sees himself as Wayne Gretzky skating to where the puck is going in the metaverse. Although Gerstner wants 5 billion in cuts on spending there. Would dramatic metaverse spending cuts change it all your perception of a company that's trading it what 10 and a half times earnings? Well, there's no question he's skated, but he's like, he's like, seven ranks in front of the puck on the metaverse. Like, we're not ready for it. Okay, no, you know, but when you talk to young young young audience, they're like, I don't want to wear a headset for more than 10 minutes. They don't want to wear for two hours. Like, this is way out there, people. Like, there's way, it's way out. And I think ultimately this goes back to the micro, this, this, this go back to Microsoft. Microsoft is the same thing. You got to go back to the core. The core market that they're in is incredible with their user base globally. The billions of users and what they can do in the advertising market. Go back to the core. Stop spending on things that don't matter right now. You can come back to it, but you don't have to do it right now. And I think this is, you know, El Timner's you know, point and I deeply agree with this view.",https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hqIy-Q36neE,92,2022-10-26 20:26:30
4212," It don't matter right now. You can come back to it, but you don't have to do it right now. And I think this is, you know, El Timner's, you know, point and I deeply agree with this view. Go back to the core, huddle, stand underneath the bus stop while it's hailing out. And when the sun comes back out, you can go plant the metaverse flowers. You can go do all these other things, but don't do it right now when it's pouring rain. Brand, while we have you, I don't make up, look, I don't make up the rules. All I'm saying is this is what our clients are saying. And I agree and he is not following the advice. You know, yeah, and I do agree with a lot of what you're saying here, just in terms of being way too early. People simply aren't on board. They aren't buying these headsets. And we're certainly seeing that reflected in these numbers that we're getting today. Bro, while we do have you though, let's talk about Amazon. That's going to be the big focus after the bell. Tomorrow we have discussed Amazon with you at Great Length in the past. I know a lot of what analysts and what investors are going to be watching as any guidance here in the current holiday quarter. But what are you expecting to hear? Well, if it's any indication of what we've seen already this week, it's more than news. It's already to be so negative, but it's not good right now. And I think look, Amazon has the advantage of already have gone through part of the downturn, right? For the bulk of e-commerce, e-commerce saw it first, right? We're seeing software and these other categories see it later. So the good news is they've gone through part of this. Obviously, the consumer, I think, is going to continue to soften despite what these and other CEOs are saying. I think the consumer is going to continue to soften a little more. And so the e-commerce business is still a concern. I think in EWS, given the weakness at Azure, and the potential, not huge upside for Google Cloud, everyone is super fearful that they are the 800 pound gorilla in cloud at 60% market share of the big three. So if they show weakness in AWS, no one really cares about the e-commerce business. You've got to have the software business, which creates the bulk of the profits continue to do well. Now, they've been putting up 60% backlog growth the last three quarters. The growth isn't going to fall out of the sky. But ultimately, it only took one point of the Azure D cell for Wall Street to freak out and send Microsoft's doc down almost 8% today. So I think what the market's telling you is that any bad news is still not in these stocks. And so we like Amazon long term. I think it's an incredible franchise. I think they're absolutely dominating cloud computing. It's not easy. You cannot catch up to these guys. No one can catch them. They're gone. And so the good news is they're in an incredible position. The bad news is I think what we're seeing is any fundamental issue still investors are just ruthless and they're just selling these stocks down even more given given given this these negative data points. So I think the good news is by the time we get to the print tomorrow, you know, the stock obviously will have already been under tremendous pressure. And I'm assuming Metta is not going to help tech again tomorrow as well, given given what happened with Microsoft and Google last night in the soft tech today. Looks like the case. And finally, that gets us to our survey today. I think you just answered it though. We're getting one fang stock. We're taking Netflix out putting Microsoft in. You get three to five years you're playing one stock. Who is it? One thing for me, it's still Amazon. Okay, we've got we've got an Amazon. We've got an Apple. We've got a Microsoft. So no leader yet. Brent Thill, I was good to see you, sir. Thank you. Thank you. All right. I see how they're doing after hours dropping. Not terrible, but down 1.7, 1.8% at this hour on Q3 earnings. What lies down the road for Ford, David Kudla is the main state capital management founder, CEO and chief investment strategist and possibly remaining in our senior auto's reporter also with us to break down these earnings. It is nice to see you, sir. So what do you make, David, of these earnings? What do we learn that we didn't know from their pre-announcement? Probably the biggest news is Argo shutting down their joint venture with Volkswagen on their level 4 autonomous looking inward. Jim, probably was looking inward at level 2 and level 3 internal development.",https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hqIy-Q36neE,93,2022-10-26 20:30:51
4213," level for autonomous looking inward. Jim probably wants to look inward at level two and level three internal development for their autonomous efforts. That's probably the biggest news relative to the numbers though. Three billion more than estimates on revenue. Thirty cents per share versus twenty seven on estimates. Three cash on the books. This is a good earnings report except for the two point seven billion dollar charge are taking for divesture out of the Argo joint venture. Hey David, Prost here. So we saw that Ford reaffirmed their forward guidance, EBIT guidance for the lower range of the 11.5 billion EBIT there. So that's a good news. But compared to GM earnings yesterday, do you think that Ford is still sort of struggling with their kind of cost structure and how GM was able to sort of perform better here? Yeah, there's been some special factors with from quarter to quarter Ford had built 40,000 vehicles in the third quarter that didn't get shipped. General Motors had a similar problem in the second quarter vehicles that were built to weren't shipped. This chip shortage has just wreaked havoc with the auto makers and gone on for months and months and in other parts shortages. So the same problem that GM had the second quarter that actually increased vehicle deliveries of finished product in the third quarter Ford will get that the fourth quarter. So a special item there. But you know, this is also resulted in a lot of pen up demand even as the economy slows that will help even as the demand fluctuates, consumer demand fluctuates with higher interest rates, with the economy slowing, a lot of pen up demand for for burottos. And Ford shares now down 2% down 40% year to date and down 19% since that pre-announcement of that billion dollar charge and the 45,000 cars parked. How do you characterize their position in the EV field? Not against Tesla who sells 2 out of every 3 EVs, but against primarily GM. You know, I think that, you know, I've got to, I've got to saying, GM and Ford, the domestic auto makers are under loved and under owned. You know, they've, they traded at P.E. right now of 5 to 7. Tesla before the recent slide was trading at a P.E. near 100. And the reason for that is Tesla's seen as a technology company rather than a car company. And Ford are seen as, you know, as as car companies and car companies only even with all the technology development they're doing in the same areas as in many of the same areas as Tesla. I think that they're both poised well right now going forward. They have so many EV models coming out almost everything they make, the F-150 electric vehicle, the CAC, the Lucid electric vehicle coming out, the Hummer electric vehicle that is sold out through 2024. They've just got so many EV models that are coming. They've been managing that transition pretty well. And from a practical standpoint, you know, there's been questions about autonomous. Tesla's pushed autonomous very hard. And I think that GM and Ford are taking a more practical approach to it. And GM Farley showed that today with what with backing out of the level four development that had trouble attracting investors focusing inward on their level two and level three. Good stuff there. David Kudla, Mainstay Capital, Prosubramanian. Good to have you both. Thank you. All right. Coming up, we'll break down some of the stocks moving the most in after hours trading. Stay with us here on Yahoo Finance Live.",https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hqIy-Q36neE,94,2022-10-26 20:35:11
4214," This exercises is very important. Many employers across the country have started their open enrollment periods for 2023 health insurance plans, though the IRS has made some changes to health savings accounts and high deductible plans that could affect your choices. Your help navigate what's different this year is Yahoo Finance's Carrie Hennan. Carrie, nice to see you. What do we need to know? Hey, great to be here. Yeah, this is this is a really big time. It's really important to see what your employer is kind of teed up for you this year. But the one benefit that a lot of people overlook if your employer offers it is a health savings account, right? And so this is all about you have to have a high deductible plan, of course. And that means this year, the IRS has set the limits where you have to have a plan. That means what you pay out of pocket before your insurance kicks in, right? So what you're looking for this year is it has to be, they limited it to at least $1,000 for a family plan for your deductible and 1500 for individuals. So that they raised those limits. But here's the good news is you can put more into these plans because they're inflation adjusted. So this year, your contribution if you are an individual can be $3,850 or family plan and 7,750 and if you're 55 or older, throwing another $1,000. But Dave, what I love about these plans, at most people don't get, it's like a tax trifecta. You can you don't pay tax in the money going in. You don't pay taxes on the money as it grows because you invest this money. You don't take, you don't pay tax on it, federal taxes when you take it out. And if it's used for medical expenses at the IRS as approved, they have a whole list of these. And most states don't tax you either on capital gains or the amount you take out to state student in Jersey and California. But this is really one of the few investments that you can roll over year to year. And it's kind of disguises a health benefit. But I'm telling you, it's also a retirement benefit. You roll it over. You can take it with you when you retire or if you change jobs and retirees, the cool thing is,",https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hqIy-Q36neE,95,2022-10-26 20:39:43
4215," benefit, but I'm telling you it's also a retirement benefit. You roll it over, you can take it with you when you retire or if you change jobs. And for retirees, the cool thing is you can, there's no required minimum distribution like other plans. You can let it hang out there and keep growing and keep investing it. And so that when you do take it out, you can use it for those medical expenses in retirement, not covered by Medicare. And that's really, you know, that's a bananza for many people. Welcome news for people beaten down by inflation, Carrie. They're not for everyone. Who are these accounts not good for? Yeah, that's a good question. You know, I get real excited about them because I think it's a really terrific opportunity. But if you are somebody who has a lot of health expenses, if you have a chronic illness or if you expect a major kind of life event in the next year, maybe a pregnancy or something that may a surgery of some kind for the neck for 2023, you might not benefit as much because yeah, as I told you before, these are high deductible plans. So you have to pay a bit out of pocket before your insurance is going to kick in. So it might not be the best deal at least for 2023 if you have some of those upcoming things. Carrie Hannah, nice to see you. Great information for our audience. Appreciate that. All right, let's get a shot of see what's moving after hours. All right, Dave. We have a bunch of earnings. Once again, this afternoon, Meta Ford service now and aligned technologies. Let's kick it off with Meta. You can see the stock off nearly 12% here after hours of company reporting and earnings miss also softer revenue guidance. It's earnings revenue from its reality labs also missing expectations because people simply aren't buying headsets. We just heard that from analyst Brent Thil taking a look at the performance here over the last three months. You can see the stock off just around 18% over the past year off 58% here we are today right around 52 a week lows. Mark Zuckerberg also making some headlines about head count plans when it comes to Meta. He's saying that he sees the head count at the end of next year, the end of 2023 around the same level as what we just saw at the end of the third quarter of 2022. So certainly raining in any hiring plans that the company had had and you can see Meta off just around 12% after hours. Let's take a look at Ford here. It shares off just around 1.6% when you take a look at the quarter numbers. It wasn't that bad revenue beat at 39.4 billion but adjusted EPS coming in a bit light. Ford also saying that it recorded a $2.7 billion charge on its Argos stake over the last three months. You can see the stock actually barely in the green up just around 2% year to date. Totally different story. You can see shares off around 38%. Let's take a look at service now. That stock jumping after hours up nearly 12% EPS coming in better than expected at 196 this share adjusted revenue at 1.93 billion CEO Bill McDermott. He has been named to the chairman post. He's going to be succeeding founder Fred Lutty. He look at some of their guidance. So miss just by a bit. Fourth quarter and full year subscription revenue coming in just a bit light looks like the street though shrugging that off. You can see shares up just over 11.5%. And the line of technology. Rounding it out there shares a sinking 18%. This is the maker of invisaligned. He can look at some of these numbers earnings coming in a bit light 136. The S. Man was for 217. Remnew 890 million S. Man was for 973 million. A couple of things from the CEO in this earnings release. He talked about the weaker macro economic environment also weaker consumer confidence that having a direct impact on his business also Dave mentioning the strong dollar something that we've heard from a number of these CEOs that have reported over the last couple of weeks. Certainly have one of the stores the year. Thank you. All right. Apple Amazon. A.B. Inbeve all on tap tomorrow. My stock to watch driven by my stomach again. MCD McDonald's reporting Q3 earnings on Thursday. Expectations are for revenue of 5.7 billion earnings per share of 257. We're really watching for the impact of inflation of what Shana mentioned foreign exchange headwinds and any success about its limited time offering such as its collaboration with streetwear brand.

4216," Here today, if you hadn't heard, the Macribe is back on Monday on Halloween for what's being built as the legendary sandwiches, farewell tour. That's right. Goodbye, Macribe. Speaking of food, celebrated chef and restaurant tour Wolfgang Pock here in a talk inflation, restaurant worker wages, and really the state of the restaurant industry coming out of the pandemic. Don't go away. Food is getting more expensive and that means you'll probably pay more when you go out to eat the next time. The latest data showing that the cost of dining at a restaurant is up 8.5% from just a year ago. It is 15. A week later, it went up to $2,000. I mean, some of this thing has gotten out of control. And forget about if there's something to repair in the restaurant, just to get somebody out to come and fix your stove or your refrigerator, it costs a fortune. So everything has gotten up, but also salaries. You know, we are one industry. We employ more people than any other one except the government. You know, over 17 million people who are in the restaurant business. And now it's really a pie-as-market in a way. You know, the employee said, I want that much money. And I will work that many hours and that many days. So it has gotten more...",https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hqIy-Q36neE,97,2022-10-26 20:48:24
4217," A Pius market in a way, you know, the employee said, I want that much money and I will work that many hours and that many days so it has gotten more difficult for us but you know we have to navigate all these problems and go through them. I do want to circle back to the employment shortage but as for those 15% higher cost are you seeing a reduced appetite for paying that? Are you able to pass along those costs? You know it looks like the luxury segment is still there, you know people still have money to spend, maybe they go out one less maybe but not that much really. I know in Las Vegas we have restaurants in Las Vegas, it's booming, it's better than ever and I'm sure the hotel is the gaming is doing better than ever because we are, we get the customers if they lose enough money they have to eat and drink. So and I think here in New York, cut in New York is doing really well too especially for dinner. You know for lunch we have less people maybe because less people go to the office and so forth but then our people still go out and want to enjoy and you know have a nice time. How does remote work, I'm sorry, how does remote work impact your bottom line? Well I think the remote work at the beginning was really difficult because we did a lot of takeout but not that much really and to me it's a boring business really doing takeout because you put everything in boxes instead of on a nice plate. You don't get the reaction from the customers you know it's like performers like to perform on Broadway or singers in stadium whatever they get the energy from the customers and for me it's the same. So I really like to be there in the restaurant. Now for sure lunchtime because people don't work that much in the office has dropped so but we live our main business always has been dinner thank God. When you take it you mentioned the labor shortage they're affecting your business obviously severe amounts of a shortage and workers not only in your industry but really across the board. First is how has it affected your plans, your initial plans for expansion and really your ability to keep open the restaurants that you already have? You know it is really difficult but it's a worldwide phenomenon. You know if we have Spago in Put Up Es for example it's hard to find workers there I said well in that part of the world they must have enough people coming to work but no. It's as difficult in Put Up Es as it is in New York or in LA to recruit people and I think thank God we have a good name and we pay well so we still can get people but it has gotten more expensive. I know our sommelier for example in a restaurant used to make a $100,000 plus decommission and they came up to me and said somebody offered me a job for $130,000 can you match it? I said you know what I will match it because I like you and you are good to the customers but also for me to train somebody new would cost me more than $30,000. 130 grand I might be in the wrong business that is impressive. I'll put the little wine rack over here that can test you how much you know. I knew you were a genius. You might be better on the tequila friend. Either way I don't discriminate. I like that both. Indeed. We have some fun food trends to ask you about. You're huge on TikTok. Another thing that's huge on TikTok is food and recipes and cooking and the latest trend is butter boards. More than 300 million views do you know what these things on the screen are right here? Wolf have you tried a butter board? Do you like the trend of TikTok cooking in general? You know I love TikTok in a way because I think it gives you the news instantly. You see what's going on but it was interesting like for me I did a TikTok and I had won the cheese for example. I just cut a pumice in chunks, put olive oil and black pepper on top and I got like 6 million people who watched it and another thing I did like was the sillier thing is I had a big block of butter, a nice forget and I used the butter and the baguette and put salt on it and people say oh my god that's so delicious. I bought something like that. Maybe I shouldn't have steaks anymore. It can be very simple now. This isn't necessarily a TikTok trend but certainly a trend in the food industry. The rise of popularity of pumpkin spice. I don't know if you've ever tried it. Have you tried it? I'll spend what $500 million in total.",https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hqIy-Q36neE,98,2022-10-26 20:52:29
4218," food industry, the rise of popularity of pumpkin spice. I don't know if you've ever tried it. Have you tried it? People spend what? $500 million in total. It's spent on pumpkin spice flavored items in the US each year. What's your reaction? I think pumpkin spice in a way makes you feel good. You know, when you smell it, it reminds you of holidays. It reminds you of Thanksgiving or for me Christmas. I remember I was a kid at home. My mother used to pick cookies and all these spices. Really, I loved. We even put them in wine. You know, hot red wine with sugar and the pumpkin spice and it smells up the whole house and it's really delicious. So I can understand that everybody likes this warm feeling. Wolfgang, great to have you in studio. And I mean, you need very, very hungry. I'm counting down the minutes hours. Look still. I'm at cut over a bottle of red and a steak. OK, you know what? We just got some new steaks in. They are amazing. You know, so I'm really happy. You don't have to sell us. We're already there. OK, right. OK, thank you so much for joining us here in studio. Thank you. Come on, next Taylor Swift's midnight's album, just did something no other album has accomplished in five years. I'll tell you what it is next. Let's go. OK. Taylor Swift's new album Midnight is having a massive opening week. The new album has a huge impact on the music industry at large. Midnight's moving 1.2 million units in the US during its first three days of release. That's according to Lumany. That number should be even higher by the end of this week, historically speaking. This is the first album in five years to move more than a million units in its opening week. The last one also being from Taylor Swift with 2017's reputation. But besides just streaming, Taylor has really emphasized that she wants to sell physical copies, more traditional forms of media, vinyl, CDs. That's important because those traditional copies weigh more heavily when we talk about billboard charts. So it's a really important strategy for her.",https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hqIy-Q36neE,99,2022-10-26 20:56:59
4219," in all CDs. And that's because those traditional way more heavily when we strategy for her and the just keeps happening. So I Well, at least being a music over to movies. There's Yes, and I'm a Halloween to the nitty gritty of the nitty gritty of the horror because the post pandemic has really benefited from horror. I spoke with box office pro chief analyst Sean Robbins. He told me that the box office has been incredibly resilient. If you take a look at the top 13 horror films I had debuted since the pandemic movies like a quiet place to more recently smile they've really outperformed representing 10% of movie going attendance during opening the audience usually skews younger that's been a big factor. We saw younger audiences were the first to return to theaters for those movies specifically 53% of the audience has been under the age of 35 and these movies they're inexpensive to make their low risk. There's really a low threshold of success and that's why you know for film like smile that only costs 17 million to produce. It's a beer to 22 million. I think that this is a genre to keep her eye on and anytime of year these films seem to do well. It is. I'm not a fan. Nope. I don't go to horror movies. It's too much for me. I know you have a fear of stranger things so I don't expect you to. Exactly. I know. You're not. I think so much for the update on that. That does the first today on Yahoo Finance. I think so much for tuning in. We'll see you right back here again tomorrow..",https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hqIy-Q36neE,100,2022-10-26 21:47:29
