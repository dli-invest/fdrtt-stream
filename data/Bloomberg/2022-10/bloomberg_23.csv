17019," When I was 24 years old, I saw the UFC on a paper view on TV and I was so overwhelmed by the athleticism, the skill. And then at the end of the fight, the combatants hugged a shook hands and I just fell in love with it. The part of UFC's appeal is it doesn't look like a ballad athletic display of martial talent and mastery as much as it looks like a bar fight. We choose to do this because we love this sport but it is a business and if you do not treat it like a business, I guarantee you that the promoter is and you will be left broken, broken at the end of your career. Each of us have an individual story but as with anything you take enough of these individual stories and you see not only crossover but intersectionality. A group of former UFC fighters that are suing the UFC scored a key legal victory on Thursday when a federal judge said he would grant their lawsuit class action status. There have been fights in every major US sport about workers' power in the labor market. I don't think there's a guy in the sport from the guy who just got his first fight all the way up to the Conor McGregor's that is pleased with the way the UFC treats fighters. The way we've been strong armed, the way we've been coerced. Fights over unionization in some sports, fights over free agency in baseball and in boxing the Muhammad Ali Act which restricts the kinds of contract terms that can be imposed on boxers. The fighters who brought this lawsuit see it as the continuation of a tradition in sports of athletes fighting to have agency and power in the terms of their work and who they do it for. Mixed martial arts used to be pretty culturally and legally fringed in the United States. It was banned by most states. John McCain had famously called it human cock fighting. There are some rules in the UFC but to a large extent all sorts of body parts and tactics and attacks are on the table and people get seriously injured at times. My nose has been broken multiple times. I had my right back to oral torn off how to get that reattached. I've had my job broken to two places I've had my neck broken. I had my left ankle broken how to get that repaired. I've had a torn right labor in my shoulder. I broke my eyeball. I mean the bone that holds up my eyeball. I've had my left eye orbital fracture twice where my eye caved in. I was walling my own blood. I knew don't blow your nose or both eyes of the world. At the time that UFC was bought for just $2 million by the former boxing coach Dana White and a casino owner. He had been friends with Lorenzo Fertita and his brother Frank Fertita. UFC was struggling as were other mixed martial arts promoters. It was pretty much a fixer upper. The money that they spent to actually purchase it for $2 million was much less than the money they quickly had to sink into it in order to revitalize it. They've hold off a multi pronged strategy that was quite successful. First they did what White has referred to as running towards regulation. They found ways to make compromises with state regulators so that the sport would not be illegal. And at the same time, they also popularized it. They made gambles like paying the production costs themselves for the first season of a reality TV show the ultimate fighter on Spike TV. UFC.",https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dp8PhLsUcFE,5425,2022-10-22 00:00:24
17020," show the ultimate fighter on Spike TV. UFC under Dana White had a gift for weaving, compelling personal narratives and rivalry, people throwing shoes, a guy coming to the octagon with who let the dogs out playing while he was dragging another guy on a leash. My first contract with the UFC is kind of an interesting story, because here I am on this reality show, the ultimate fighter. And they started to realize how big of a stepping stone this was going to be for the UFC. Sat us all down individually, put a contract in front of us and said, Hey, we realized that this is going to be huge and we really want to have you all a part of the UFC family movie and forward. So we want to go ahead and get this out of the way just sign this simple contract and we'll be able to move forward is as one unit. But as I'm looking at this thick contract and wondering what I should do, Dana White looks at me and says, don't worry, this thing takes off. We'll take care of you. The fighters would say at the heart of UFC's power is the contracts that it signs with fighters. Before boxing had competition boxing used to be dominated by a few dominant promoters and the contracts were ported over from boxing. And the contracts are basically designed to control every aspect of a fighter's career. They're long term. They last multiple fights. Fighters under these contracts are bound to fight only for UFC for a period of time. And UFC can extend that time if a fighter declines a match or if a fighter gets injured. They control who the fighter fights. They control when the fighter fights. And then they have a number of different clauses that make it very difficult for a fighter to ever break free from UFC if that fighter ever did want to become a creation. Contracts are so one sided. There really is no negotiation room for any of the things, especially as you're coming up and as their stranglehold on the sport of MMA got so much stronger. Part of what's at the heart of this lawsuit is the ways that UFC successfully took other competitors off the board. The UFC had such a stranglehold on mixed martial arts and as they were buying up so much of the competition, shutting them all down, they really became the only option for anybody that wanted to do this professionally. If you follow Dana White's Twitter or watch him on YouTube, you could have seen Dana White calling himself the grim reaper and bragging about how he has defeated or derailed or acquired one after another company that tried to compete with the UFC. In 2011, UFC acquired strike force, which at the time was the most prominent rival still standing. It was a great buy this year for one more time. Scott Smith and come Lee. The CEO of strike force Scott Koker has said in the past that he saw himself like Luke Skywalker up against the death star trying to compete with UFC. Eventually when strike force was bought out by UFC, my only option was go to UFC because they had the rest of my contract. Now I'm under a contract where it's only an 18 month contract with six fights, but five years later, I'm still stuck in the contract.",https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dp8PhLsUcFE,5426,2022-10-22 00:04:48
17021," The month before UFC's parent company, Zufa, completed its acquisition of Strike Force, a UFC executive sent an email and the subject line of that email was, we own MMA. The UFC has admitted in documents that have now become public, that they've almost never lost a fighter that they wanted to keep. In internal UFC emails, we now know the company referred to what it was doing as choking off oxygen to the competition. The most important oxygen that UFC allegedly ran afoul of the law by cutting off to its competitors is the fighters themselves. And not only did they make it clear to us, they made it clear to the whole mixed martial arts world, there is no negotiating. These are very strict, never-ending contracts and that's the case for this day. The UFC just says, oh you want to fight for us, you sign here if you don't want to, we've got 20 other guys that'll take your spot. They have 70, 80, 90% of the top fighters under exclusive contract, meaning that those fighters are not available to any other MMA promoter. And fighters, even if they wiggled their way out of the very restrictive contract that UFC imposed on them, didn't have another professional mixed martial arts option because there weren't robust rivals to go sell their work to. On Tuesday afternoon, a class action lawsuit was filed in US District Court in San Jose against Zufa LLC with fighters, Kung Li, Nate Corey and John Fitch attached to the suit. Rampe Jackson came to me and says, hey, Kung, I know this lawyer, he will help get the fairness for the fighters in the marketplace. And I decided I wanted to step up for all the fighters that being affected. At the end of 2014, more than six years ago now, a group of now all former fighters filed anti-trust class action lawsuit against UFC. And in broad terms, the case is an antitrust case where we're claiming that the UFC is both a monopoly and a monopsony. Usually when we talk about monopoly, we're talking about the power that a company has when it becomes the only one selling something. Monopsony is about the power of being a monopoly purchaser of something, and particularly a monopoly purchaser of labor. A key argument in this lawsuit has been about as UFC succeeds and its revenue sores, how much should we expect that absent illegal conduct the fighters pay would soar as well. In UFC, year after year, the share of the company's revenue that goes to actually paying the workers doing the fighting has hovered around or below 20%. And what this analysis shows through complex statistical regression modeling is that if the UFC was competitive and did not allegedly violate the antitrust laws, it would pay its fighters 50% or more of the revenues is generated just like baseball, just like hockey, just like basketball, boxing. If instead of paying 20% of the revenues generated, it paid 50% or more of the revenues generated, the fighters would have made $1.6 billion more during the period that we measured 2010 to 2017. Sometimes when you write about allegations against companies and particularly about lawsuits against companies, those companies don't want to say a whole lot about them or are pretty dismissive of the significance of litigation against them. UFC in their comments to me has been pretty feisty.",https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dp8PhLsUcFE,5427,2022-10-22 00:09:03
17022," or are pretty dismissive of the significance of litigation against them. UFC in their comments to me has been pretty feisty about this, saying that they see this lawsuit actually as a threat to the ability of businesses to take risks and succeed, and that they don't want to roll over, that they want to fight it and they want to defeat it. The fighters I talk to describe having side jobs, being reliant on UFC in part because after taxes and expenses, they weren't making enough money to feel financially secure. The overview of my career from a financial perspective is, you know, something I've had, a challenge in admitting, I can tell you now that I lived in my mom's attached to a rock the entire time I was fighting ahead. The second job is about turning a bartender, a third job as a personal trainer, just to make ends meet. Nate Quarry told me that over his time in UFC, he fought fights while he was tens of thousands of dollars in debt coming into the fight. It gets so disheartening because I've seen fights that are called the fight of the year. This is just that this brutal war and they battled for four and a half rounds until one guy's body just gave up and then you find out, oh, that guy made $60,000 for that fight. In one of the hearings in this lawsuit, UFC's attorney argued that if the fighters were really the product, if all that UFC were selling were the fighters, then the fighters wouldn't need UFC at all. That a fighter is not themselves the UFC product anymore than an Apple engineer who makes a cool iPhone is the product that Apple is selling. We the fighters make this whole thing happen and it's been driven by Chuck LaDelle. It's been driven by Reyna Coutures, been driven by Conor McGregor, it's been driven by Brock Lesnar, it's been driven by all the greats that have walked before us and that walk this path right now. We are the product. If the fighters are not the product, then go ahead and release us from our contracts. You'll do fine without us. Clearly. It's the identity and rank and popularity of those fighters that attract the eyeballs and make the sport what it is and if you can lock all those up and keep them from other promotions, you can dominate the sport, which is what they've admitted they've done. William Isaacson, a lawyer for UFC, said in a statement that UFC has spent many years building a world-class organization enhancing the brand of our athletes and championing the sport of MMA. UFC pays its fighters more than any other MMA promoter with average fighter compensation rising by over 600% since 2005. Our efforts have raised the global popularity of the sport and the overall revenue potential of all MMA organizations and athletes. In December of 2020, the judge announced a crucial step in this lawsuit, which is that he is going to certify it as a class action. Class certification makes this lawsuit a much more significant threat to UFC and the judge made clear long before saying how he planned to rule that he expected whatever he did to be appealed into federal appeals court and on from there to the US Supreme Court. So we are likely in for many more months and years of wrangling over this. Kyle Pingsbury said that he doesn't think any settlement would be acceptable unless it includes a change to the restrictive contracts that UFC uses to keep fighters bound to the UFC. My son is about to turn six years old and it started when he was in the womb. We're in this thing to the end to change the sport forever. We want the same freedoms that are offered in any other major sport and we're every other major sport has gone through what we're going through right now.

17023," People tell fighters, you know, just shut up. Look at how lucky you are. Well, no, actually we're fighting for what we believe in. We're going to continue being fighters, and that's how we are made. We're going to continue being fighters, and that's how we are made. We're going to continue being fighters, and that's how we are made. Every nation that's a coastal state has some region of the sea floor that falls within their territorial waters, and many countries including the US, the area that's underwater exceeds the area that's above water. So huge amounts of nations, areas and regions are just really unexplored, uncharacterized. We don't really know what's there. We know less about our sea bed than we do about the surface of the moon or Mars. Only 20% of it has been mapped. A map of the sea floor could lead to all kinds of discoveries, like numerous species, and rare earth minerals like cobalt that we need for electric cars and mobile phones. The value of all the gold deposits are loan on the sea floor is estimated to be around $150 trillion. A map could also help us when tragedy strikes. Malaysia Airlines Flight 370 disappeared from radar screens. The mapping of the ocean floor has been carried out. The problem is that the southern Indian Ocean is just so incredibly huge. To me, a map is a fundamental piece of understanding of who we are, where we are, where things are. Once you understand something, you start to value it more. When you start to value something, that's when you start to really think about making it healthy and preserving it and keeping it going. A map is the first step. It's the basic understanding that you need to figure out where you are. Oceans. They cover over 70% of the planet, but most of what lies underneath is a mystery. The sea floor is a really fascinating landscape. We don't have a lot of data to describe the shape of it in detail. But in places where we do, there are spectacular features. There's meandering channels with all kinds of interesting topography. There are canyons, there are sea mounts, mid ocean ridges, all kinds of things that we see on land that are just basically hidden from us by the water. As it stands, this is what a map of the sea bed looks like. All that black? Those are the parts we haven't mapped yet. At present, most people think that the sea floor is actually mapped because you'll see a world ocean map and you can see some shape of the sea floor. But most of that is based on prediction. Roughly 80% of what you see for the world ocean floor is modeled based on measurements of the sea surface height and a computation based on gravity. In 2017, the Nippon Foundation and the General Bathometric Chart of the Oceans, or Jebco, launched Sea Bed 2030. It's a collaborative project to collect and collate data ocean wide and create a complete map of the sea floor by the end of the decade. To do this would take one ship around 350 years at a cost of up to $3 billion. That's why data is harvested by all kinds of vessels from fishing boats to fish.",https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dp8PhLsUcFE,5429,2022-10-22 00:17:54
17024," To do this would take one ship around 350 years at a cost of up to $3 billion. That's why data is harvested by all kinds of vessels from fishing boats to freighters. Because there is so little data, it's important that vessels that are capable and willing to acquire data when they're just moving around the ocean do so. So we have a lot of data that's collected during transit. There's a lot of academic requirements to make data publicly available. There's industry data that's starting to become more and more available. There's government data. So there's a lot of different ways that this data is coming in and it's a really messy and challenging puzzle to put together. But what's exciting is that it's a puzzle to put together. Since SEBA 2030 launched, the area map has risen to 20 percent and all the information collected is freely available. The more data we have collectively and other people can access, the faster the discoveries are made, which really pushes forward our understanding at a faster rate than if you held onto that data and it was only you with that data. Things like machine learning and artificial intelligence are also going to kick in in the next decade. Because with all this data, they'll be able to make connections that are a lot faster than perhaps we would have been able to, which then again feeds our human understanding and also gives us new ideas, new ways of thinking, of exploration. Until the early 20th century, mapping technology was simple. Usually a weight attached to a long rope known as a led line. After the Titanic sank in 1912, explorers proposed using sound waves to find its hull in the North Atlantic. This led to Sona, the most common technique used for mapping today. Operated by the Schmidt Ocean Institute, the Falcourt is an 82 meter long research vessel, equipped with two multi-beam Sona systems that have helped Deborah Smith and a team of other marine technicians to map over a million square kilometers of the sea floor. You know, you go from somebody with a rope with some knots to Sona or acoustic, that is, I call it, math magic. But it is incredibly advanced mathematical technology to be able to measure the distance and time of travel of sound on a moving ship. Multi-beam mapping works by using Sonares. So Sonares is taking sound and the measurement of time. So you have a multi-beam Sona, and it sends out a ping of sound. That sound travels through the water column, hits the sea floor, and comes back to the ship, and we measure that time, and we're able to calculate the distance. Each individual ping of sound has many, many beams. So it looks like a giant fan across the sea floor, and that fan is moving along the sea floor. So you have many tiny little beams going across, and they're traveling along a track. You can look at that data and look at both the peaks and the valleys and the highs and the lows and sort of create a three-dimensional image of the sea floor. The accuracy of multi-beam Sonares really depends on the water depth that you're in. Think of it like a flashlight beam, and if you're holding a flashlight and you're shining it on the floor, the closer you get to the floor with your flashlight, the smaller that beam is. If you have 400 of these beams all across, so think of 400 people holding a flashlight. The closer they hold that flashlight to the sea floor, the smaller your beam is, which also means the smaller that you can find information or data about. So it really depends on the depth of the sea floor in order to see how much you can define an object. This variation in depth means that mapping resolution will range from 100 by 100 meters in shallow waters to 800 by 800 meters in the deepest parts of the ocean, which go down as far as 11,000 meters. Remotely operated vehicles or ROVs can then be sent down to investigate sea bed features up close. We've just crossed the 1000 metre mark. It's 4.6 degrees C, and now we're going to drive the ROV down at a high rate towards the sea floor. On a recent mapping expedition, scientists on the Falcore discovered a 500 meter tall coral structure in Australia's Great Barrier Reef. The first to be discovered in a...",https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dp8PhLsUcFE,5430,2022-10-22 00:22:15
17025," On a recent mapping expedition, scientists on the Falcourt discovered a 500 meter tall coral structure in Australia's Great Barrier Reef, the first to be discovered in over 120 years. A place that is incredibly popular, well-visited, well-traveled, you know, we're still finding new things. You don't know until you map it. And so until you get that sort of high-resolution picture, you don't know the sand waves or the old river beds that used to be there, or the waterfalls off the side of a volcano that used to be above the surface and now is below the surface. It's a little bit of everything. Think of let's say Hawaii or someplace where you see a volcano above the water, picture that below the water. I'm really kind of obsessed with the whole concept of stale here. Although we can create 3D models and, you know, kind of come up with these visualizations, it's not the same as that feeling of looking out over this big landscape. But, I mean, I think we'll get there soon with VR and other kinds of technology, but it's really spectacular to think about, especially with the familiarity that some of us have with these features, like what it looks like. We look out at the ocean and it just looks flat, maybe with little bumps. We really don't think about all of this that's underneath, and it's really an amazing landscape that's just hidden from us. With more than 90% of the ocean deeper than 200 meters, fleets of autonomous vehicles could make the data gathering process faster, cheaper, and safer. And new discoveries might help with exploration of all kinds. I think the ocean can actually provide us with huge incidences, we go out into space as well, and look for life and other kinds of life forms. I also think in this next few years, we will have a different kind of access to the ocean because of virtual reality and augmented reality. And so that will allow us to sit in our living rooms and really experience what's underwater in a different way and see this different alien planet. You You Since the dawn of man, meat has been on the menu. And even with growing trends of vegetarian diets and plant-based substitutes, around 89% of the world population consider themselves omnivores. We have come a long way from our hunter and gatherer roads. We have managed to establish a whole industry designed to feed almost 7.7 billion people. We have maximized production and we managed to reduce hunger over the past couple of decades. And although we've become exceedingly efficient at putting meat on the table, raising livestock animals by the billions comes with its own set of consequences. If animal agriculture continues to expand the way it has, there is a race that we won't be able to stop climate change. But with rapid advances in technology, we might soon see a food industry that leaves all those problems behind. I'm going to fight to be one of the world's",https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dp8PhLsUcFE,5431,2022-10-22 00:26:27
17026," I'm about to be one of the world's first commercial customers for lab-grown meat, cultured meat. It's a bit just as the company and I'm very, very excited. Here is the chicken. It's pretty crispy outside. It's really good. I mean, look, it's really tasty. Here at 1880 in Singapore, cultured chicken is being served under a regulatory approval granted by the Singaporean government. It's the very first time a cultured meat product, meat made from animal cells grown in a lab, has been approved for commercial sale. Eat just the company behind these chicken nugget-style dishes is based out of San Francisco and got their start in 2011 developing plant-based egg substitutes, like mung bean scrambled eggs and mayonnaise. But it wasn't until 2017 that they announced they were shifting focus to a cultured meat product. In order to feed the world that we live in, a lot of animal protein, we need to take a third today and it'll be more tomorrow of our world and make it dedicated to feeding chickens and cows. We go to areas that are filled with biodiversity rainforests, taking a bulldozer to them and planting soymne corn to feed the chickens that we climate change is accelerated to the end of the day. We use these as accelerated by the kind of animal production that we engage in. When we bring animals in tiny little spaces, it accelerates the probability that more zoonotic diseases are going to impact our families. And from a morality perspective, why do we need to cause any harm to any other living thing? To have dinner that tastes good, it does not have to be that way. And those things underlie the force of this idea. The total alternatives that have made it to the market thus far have been plant-based. Immutation beef and pork made from ingredients like pea protein and coconut oil by companies like Beyond Meat and Impossible Foods. That's a very different proposition from cultured meat, which is made from actual animal cells. I'm a huge fan of any company of any person trying to make a product that's improving the food system, including all the plant-based proteins. Maybe in some future menu you'll have this kind of cultivated chicken and you'll also have a plant-based version. That's fine. But I guess you have to ask yourself in our lifetime, is that diner likely to also remove the conventional option on the menu too? We do think we need a more permanent solution. We do think we need if you will in-game to this problem. And we just think this is more likely to be the path to achieve that. So animal cell technology has been around for several decades for applications such as development of vaccines and other biotherapeutics. The first known prototype of cultured meat was done by Mark Post earlier in 2011. And essentially it was developing beef baddie. It was a very expensive prototype. If I'm not mistaken above 250,000 euros at the time to produce just one beef baddie. It was more of a group of concepts to really demonstrate that this technology is possible and that it can be done. The weight that we grow and produce culture chicken is essentially a weak isolate chicken cells from the chickens without having to kill them. So from a small biopsy for instance, we mercy cells in a liquid broth that contains the nutrients that the cells need to survive and be healthy and to grow. We really need these cells to multiply, to reach the numbers that are sufficient to make a meat product. We're looking into the cells that are really important for meat. So we think about muscle cells, fat cells, by the isolation we are able to form those muscle tissues in culture. The culture happens inside of a fermentation tank, what we call the bioreactor, which is essentially providing the same conditions as the animal body. We're going to warm temperatures, some sort of mechanical stimulation so that the cells that are exposed to very similar conditions that they have inside of the animal. After the cells proliferate and reach a certain density, the final step is essentially to separate those cells.",https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dp8PhLsUcFE,5432,2022-10-22 00:30:56
17027," that they had inside of the animal. After the cells proliferate and reach a certain density, the final step is essentially to separate those cells from the liquid broth that they are in. We just make sure that the product meets our quality and safety standards, and then those cells are ready for consumption. Milk, cheese, yogurt. A lot of those derive from fermentations. The only difference is that they are starting from a different cell type. In this case, we're just using the animal cells as the initial and beginning of the product. Beatjust has developed chicken nuggets so far with far more textured chicken breast plan for the future. But another cell-based meat startup, Memphis Meats, has already started working on culturing other animal cells as well. We've done beef, we've done duck, we've done chicken, and these are things that are favorites in various parts of the world. For instance, people in America love beef and chicken. People in China love duck. So we wanted to show that we at Memphis Meats can produce meats that we as a global population love to eat. There's a lot of similarity in how we grow the meats from various animals or fish. But they're also different because of nutrients they need and how they actually come together to form the final product they meet. And I think it's very similar to how we also grow various animals. There's similarities in the feed that we gave cows and pigs and chickens. But there's also differences how we cultivate and it's very similar for us as well. So we've been working with the FDA and the USDA for the last three years and really developing the guidelines on how this food should be regulated when we come to the market. As soon as we get regulatory approval in the United States, people will be able to go to the supermarket and buy it and enjoy it. They'll be able to go to a restaurant near them and order meat directly from animal cells. But it's not just getting the meat right. Once approved, the gates open to a very high potential demand and scaling becomes the next big hurdle. Before we can only make chicken for myself, my friends, my girlfriend, my family, my colleagues, now we actually have the ability to make chicken for millions of people. So that allows us to invest into allowing the economies to scale to drop the price. The second is we need to reduce the cost of the nutrients that these cells are consuming. So they think chicken feed raises or drops a price of chicken. The nutrients we feed ourselves does the same things. We need to drive that down. The cell density is another technical element. We need to continue to increase that and hammering on those things. So of course, the next five, 10, 15 years, we'll put us in a place where we're significantly below the cost of this animal protein. And that will be one of the main inflection points that will lead to a new way of eating meat. So here's a close up of a half-eaten crispy chicken bite. You know what? What I'm really thinking is, just I'm eating chicken. I like chicken. You know, the normal chickens eat. I don't know where they came from. And so I don't know why I should be very stressed where this came from either. The meat market is worth more than $1 trillion annually and there are over 60 startups in the cultured meat field. Cultured meat has attracted several prominent investors, including Sarah DeBrin, Richard Branson, and Bill Gates. What is also interesting is that even meat giants, such as Cargill and Tyson, have invested in space, it's this destructive potential of the market, as well as the promise to greatly reduce the climate impact of meat production that has attracted investors. It remains to be seen who will get regulatory approval in which countries and whether consumers will like lab-grown meat enough to make the switch. And while there's no evidence that lab-grown meat is any less healthy than traditional meat, there's an ongoing debate over how healthy eating meat is in general. But if these products are a success, they could be the beginning of a more humane, less destructive meat industry. The food and ag industry is the most innovative industry in the world. It's always figured out how to feed a growing population. And we've never failed doing so. And it's been very clear to us that we are part of that, and we're going to figure out how to feed the next 3 billion people joining us. And I just see an evolution. We can do...",https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dp8PhLsUcFE,5433,2022-10-22 00:35:23
17028," failed doing so. And it's been very clear to us that we are part of that and we're going to figure out how to feed the next three billion people joining us. And I just see an evolution. We can do this a bit differently. We can do this in a way that is consistent with the kind of people that we want to be, the kind of planet that we all want to live in. We can build a food system that reflects really the best characteristics of who we are. And that makes me really helpful. In possible foods might be the world's most ambitious company. Just listen to founder and CEO Pat Brown. People wonder how big the plant-based meat industry is going to be. It will be the meat industry in 20 years. We're going to look back and basically say, wow, remember back in the day when we used to his animals to make meat. Yes, impossible stated goal really is to replace the use of animals as a food production technology globally by 2035. That would mean supplanting a $1.2 trillion industry not to mention a source of sustenance as old as time. To be fair, the company has got a lot of people talking about its products. So there's this thing called the Impossible Burger. What's called artificial meat? The realest, the realest, the realest burger in the world. Not bad. But before impossible foods can take over the world, it's going to have to overcome strong competitors, penetrate tough new markets and generally transform its product from a conversation piece into a ubiquitous staple food. With the coronavirus turning the world of food upside down, this could be the moment when impossible foods was founded in 2011 when Pat Brown, a longtime vegan, was nearing the end of an accomplished career in biochemistry. I've been astounding just my whole life and just came to this realization that by far the most important scientific question in the world is what makes meat delicious? Pat Brown, someone call a zealot for his mission. He really doesn't hold back when it comes to talking about wanting to completely replace animal agriculture. Producing meat from animals is the most destructive technology on earth and if we're going to avert catastrophic climate change, we have to find a better way to produce meat. You've probably heard about the dangers of cow flatulence. Their digestive systems produce large quantities of the powerful greenhouse gas methane. In fact, it's estimated that livestock farming is responsible for nearly 15% of all greenhouse gas emissions. Impossible claims it takes 89% less GHGs, 87% less water, and 96% less land to produce its burger. The key of course would be to get people to actually eat the thing, which is where the company's secret ingredient comes in. Him, a genetically engineered substance with a bloody ion rich taste like red meat. So, him is a very controversial part of the Impossible Burger. It's also what makes the Impossible Burger what it is. There are a lot of consumer groups and anti-GMO groups that oppose the Impossible Burger because of the him. The studies on its safety are pretty short term, but the FDA has approved it.",https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dp8PhLsUcFE,5434,2022-10-22 00:39:37
17029," Bo groups that oppose the Impossible Burger because of the heave. The studies on its safety are pretty short-term, but the FDA has approved it and the company says it's completely safe. And there isn't any evidence that it isn't. Critics have also challenged the company's claim to health advantages over traditional meat, pointing out that while the Impossible Burger has less fat, sodium, and calories than its beefy cousin, it's also more highly processed. But let's be real, we're talking about minicking hamburgers here, not kale salads. These burgers are definitely better for the environment, so that's a plus, but they are not necessarily better for your health. After years in the lab, Patton's colleagues were confident they had a product even Ron Sponson could love. And the Impossible Burger made its debut in 2016. Their burger began its life in the public when it was sold at David Chang's Bama Fuku. And they went from sort of higher-end, fine dining restaurants into higher-end burger restaurants, like Bare Burger and Mommy Burger. And then suddenly they started popping up everywhere. It tastes like a burger. It tastes like meat. This is all made from plants. All made from plants. This tastes like meat. Doesn't it just look like real meat? So meat-like. They always say it's what they say. Like a burger. It tastes like yuckers. The foam is the world's relics. No, it doesn't taste like a burger. Opinions differed on the Impossible Burger's relative meatiness, but the debate itself was fantastic free advertising, helping to propel Impossible into major chains like white castle, and then in the summer of 2019, into more than 7,000 Burger Kings across the US. To date, the company has raised over a billion dollars and a funding round in March valued the company at around 4 billion. But fake meat is a happening space these days and impossible faces some daunting competition. So I'm now for the stock of the hour, and that is Beyond Meat Shares of the faux meat or plant-based protein company are soaring today. Beyond Meat is also making a very meaty burger from plants. They're very non-GMO. They stress that all the time to differentiate themselves from Impossible. It'll be much easier to genetically modify plant material to make it take on the texture and appearance in a Roma of animal protein. Right. But we won't do that. Beyond Meat had one of the biggest IPOs of the year in 2019. So Impossible, which is still privately held, has some catching up to do. But you won't hear Pat Brown knocking his biggest competitor. I wish them nothing but success. They have the same mission we have. The only rival we care about is the incumbent animal-based industry. Rivals or not, Impossible and Beyond certainly agree on one thing. The true prize isn't the American market. It's China. 27% of the world's meat is consumed in China compared to just 9% in the US. The Chinese population eats a ton of meat. They are a huge market. China is a really interesting case because they have long had vegetarian cuisine as part of their culinary culture. And whether they are looking for meat replacements is still an open question. What we found in our reporting is that some consumers are excited about them. It's just we don't know if it's going to be enough. To improve its prospects, Impossible is developing a plant-based replacement for pork. Globally pork is the most widely consumed meat. It's almost 40% of all the meat consumed globally. Number one in Europe, number one in China. So if we're going to achieve our mission, pork is right up there. No word yet on when Impossible Pork will be available. This morning, growing concerns about the nation's food supply. From butchers to national supermarkets, supplies now limited and prices rising. The impact of the coronavirus on the price and availability of meat has given a boost to companies like Impossible Foods. Over the four weeks ending April 19, sales of plant-based meat in China.",https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dp8PhLsUcFE,5435,2022-10-22 00:43:51
17030," and availability of meat has given a boost to companies like Impossible Foods. Over the four weeks ending April 19, sales of plant-based meat increased. But Impossible has acknowledged some negative effects from the pandemic as well. This being a product that has primarily been served in restaurants, they took a pretty big hit with all the food service shutdowns, although the company doesn't want to say how much of a hit. They have however announced some new retail rollouts. Recently they announced that they're going to be rolling out with crogrer supermarkets and that's big, that's great for them. The question of whether this is like a long-term sea change for these companies. I don't know, just up to ANC. It's safe to say Impossible stands a slim chance of achieving its goal of replacing the entire meat industry. But it's early days for the science of plant-based meat and it's not impossible that these products could one day contribute to a greener, more humane future. In the meantime, as the technology improves, we get to look forward to many more years of this. This is meat. No, this isn't possible. Yeah, that's what I thought. This is the meat burger. I like it better. It's not even close to a veggie burger or a tofu burger or anything. Wow, that's very, very much. What are, is a strategically important point on the map of Pakistan. It sits very close to Iran, actually, on the very southern coast. It's about a 10-hour drive west of Karachi, but it's only about an hour drive to Iran. The area is extremely poor. It's very arid. It doesn't have enough water. Electricity has been very spotty. One of the most surprising things about visiting Guadar is the high degree of security that is absolutely everywhere. There are armed guards that are required to escort foreign visitors everywhere you go because it is contested region because there have been militant attacks in the past. Despite all this, Guadar is a key part of the China-Pakistan economic corridor, also known as CPEC. The Crown Jewel of President Xi Jinping's Belt and Road Initiative. We will leave no stone unturned in ensuring that CPEC and all the projects under its umbrella are materialised in time and in full. So far, just one-third of all CPEC projects have been completed. In Guadar, none of them have been, and the promised improvements for local people like job creation and better infrastructure have not materialised. So, what has China got to gain from developing this seemingly obscure city on the Pakistani coast? We have seen this movie before. An outside power comes into Pakistan. It spends heavily on big infrastructure projects. China is not the first to do it. Right after Pakistan became independent in the late 1940s, early 50s, the US was sending advisors into Pakistan to help plant economy. The US was doing infrastructure projects there too. Those early projects helped the US gain Pakistan as an ally against the Soviet Union during the Cold War. The US has provided about $80 billion in aid to Pakistan since its independence, but overall the result is disappointing. One of the recent attempts was in the late 2000s as part of the US effort to combat terrorism.",https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dp8PhLsUcFE,5436,2022-10-22 00:48:08
17031," its independence, but overall the result is disappointing. One of the recent attempts was in the late 2000s as part of the US effort to combat terrorism in Afghanistan. The number one item on that aid package was to build these high visibility infrastructure projects. So there are literally projects that the United States tried to do or Pakistan proposed to the United States in the 2000s during that period that have become Belt and Road projects. China is stepping into a gap which has been left by retreating ambition from the US. The Belt and Road Initiative is China's President Xi Jinping's signature foreign policy initiative. In 2013 it comprises an overland belt stretching through China Central Asia into Europe and a maritime road stretching around Southeast Asia through the India Ocean and up past East Africa. So a benign way of characterising China's Belt and Road Initiative would be infrastructure for influence. So when Xi Jinping announced the Belt and Road Initiative, shortly afterwards China designated Pakistan as its showcase flagship project. So the China Pakistan Economic Quarter was going to be the biggest and most important showcase for the success of the Belt and Road. Pakistan is in great need of infrastructure development. They wanted to create a railway, highway, roads, all kinds of economic development that is intended to help Pakistan and it's meant to provide jobs, 2.3 million jobs for Pakistanis. It's meant to provide a 2.5% boost to GDP growth. And China would gain economically as well. XiPek was intended to reduce oil and gas routes from the Middle East by thousands of miles, a way to cut overland into western China instead of going around Southeast Asia by ship. Projects in Pakistan also provide Chinese state owned companies with an additional market. Chinese workers are brought to Pakistan to build infrastructure and then take wages home. XiPek is also strategically significant for China and Pakistan. China wants to strengthen this relationship to counter their shared rival India. XiPek is both an instrument of Chinese power as well as a test of Chinese power. If it succeeds, China will be demonstrating that it's able to do what great powers have not been able to do in Pakistan, including the United States. Which is why Guadal is so important. It's in Pakistan's Balochistan province, an area with serious electricity and water shortages. Balochistan province is actually populated by people who are of Baloch origin. There are different ethnicity. They speak a different language from the majority in power in Islamabad. And they feel as the poorest province in Pakistan, they have not sufficiently benefited from some of the economic achievements that the rest of Pakistan has had. That area is quite contested by the Balochistan Liberation Army. The people who feel that even Pakistani people have encroached into their territory. So quite a number of people are still staging attacks and they attacked the biggest international hotel in Guadar, shot up the lobby and killed I think five people. This unsettled city is where the China-Pakistan economic corridor is supposed to lead to. Authorities plan to develop Guadar into an international port city. Guadar port has an interesting history and an interesting location too. It's located in Balochistan. It's about 120 kilometers from Iran. Pakistan purchased this territory from Oman, I think, in the 1950s. So for a long time, Pakistan has had on its agenda trying to develop this area. Since the 70s, it's wanted to build a port in Guadar, actually approached the United States in the 19th.",https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dp8PhLsUcFE,5437,2022-10-22 00:52:33
17032," He has had on its agenda trying to develop this area. Since the 70s, it's wanted to build a port in Guadar, actually approached the United States in the 1970s and tried to convince the Nixon administration to pay for a port, even offered naval access if the United States was willing to pay for that. The US rejected Pakistan's offer, concerned that the port would not be commercially viable and would cause geopolitical tension. But in the early 2000s, a Chinese company was awarded the contract to build the port and they completed Phase I of Construction in 2006. The port was then managed by a Singaporean government entity. In 2013, a Chinese port operator took over from the Singaporeans. In 2015, China announced that it will expand the port as part of the CPEC initiative, but five years later, little has happened. When you look out at the port, you can see it has only three births and all of them were empty. And the only ship that was in the port at the time was a Pakistan naval frigate. And so it indicated to me that the port is not particularly operational for commercial purposes and a number of analysts have talked about the strategic importance in a military sense if eventually China were able to use the port of Guadar as a military base. No one would be surprised if China did use it in that way. I don't think in the short term, like it is set up in Djibouti, where it has a permanent base. I think it's more likely to use it as almost a sort of forward-based resupply option. Something it can use when it wants to. Other projects like building Pakistan's largest airport in Guadar and two special economic zones have been delayed. A 19-kilometer highway linking the port with the Maccran Coastal Highway in Balochistan is under construction too. Most of the people who live there and work there already are fishermen. They rely on access to the sea. The way that the highway expressed highway from the port was originally proposed would have cut off their sea access. And so that was a real point of contention with the community. There have been some proposals to allow them at underpass. It's still a little bit unclear how that is finally going to be resolved. Even if those projects are eventually built, there are serious questions about who will work there. There is a problem with manpower, of course, in Guadar. It's a very small city. And so one proposal has been well, we'll just ship Chinese workers in from China and build lots of fancy housing for them. The first Chinese-built community in Pakistan, a 500 million dollar development, spanning over 10 million square feet, with over 60 percent open spaces. That kind of proposal is what makes a lot of the Pakistani local people quite upset. A Guadal-based journalist expressed concerns to Bloomberg over projects like this. The journalists spoke anonymously for fear of persecution from the Pakistan government. These projects are creating jobs, but they're not really creating jobs for the local people of Guadar. They're not against economic prosperity, but they're against the development that leads them behind. Pakistan doesn't have the money to build these projects. It's gone to the IMF for its 13th bailout since the 1980s. By engaging in CPEC projects, the government of Pakistan has incurred more debts from China. Not only posing challenges for Pakistan, but possibly the international community if Pakistan eventually defaults on its debts. But CPEC is still set to go on. Even if most current projects haven't been completed, the two countries have recently signed new projects worth $11 billion. Pakistan's Prime Minister said the country's economic future is linked with China. It's hard to imagine how the China-Pakistan economic corridor is going to be the game changer that the Pakistan government would like it to be. We're not seeing the economic growth or benefit from the projects that were set out. We're supposed to see it by now. We're not seeing the job creation. Project delays, accumulating debts, commercial viability. These problems of CPEC are also typical of Belt and Road projects around the world. For China though, it's never the...",https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dp8PhLsUcFE,5438,2022-10-22 00:56:51
17033," Emulating debts commercial viability. These problems of CPEC are also typical of Belt and Road projects around the world. For China though, it's never the narrow accounting perspective that matters. It's the bigger strategic benefits. As China's dollars continue to flow, as China's concrete continues to pour, China's influence continues to increase. There was some degree of runaway expectations. I think there was also some degree that they were an extremely forthcoming with the state of the game. The cyberpunk 2077 story is very much kind of a story of everything that can and will go rock in game development. What is this bug? Jack is AI flipped out. It wasn't there before. Where's my gun? Keep her steady. I can't shoot. The release of Cyberpunk 2077 in December of 2020 will go down as one of the most disastrous game launches in history. And it instantly rewrote the narrative of its celebrated developer, CD Projekt Red. Larger studios with bigger budgets weren't able to create the same quality of open-world game. The inside story of the making of Cyberpunk depicts a process marred by unchecked ambition, unrealistic timelines, and a focus on marketing at the expense of development. When CD Projekt Stock was at its high, it was the largest stock in the Polish stock market. Cyberpunk was supposed to be the biggest game of 2020. This was a game that was starring Keanu Reeves. This is a game that was from the makers of The Witcher 3. This was supposed to be the big temple release of last year. And for it to become such a disaster for so many people, I think, will have pretty far-reaching consequences. CD Projekt's origins are somewhat unique in the game's industry. In the West and Japan, the late 80s and 90s were dominated by games through the home console market. And characters like Mario and Sonic the Hedgehog were becoming household names. The same was not true in a post-Soviet and economically depressed Poland. Most games were done on PCs, and most games were copied and sold in small markets around the country. You could go to the market down the street in Warsaw and buy in cell CDs. And these two guys, Marchiniewinsky and Michal Kaczynski, decided they were going to start selling CDs, and they wound up striking a deal with the people who made a game called Baldur's Gate, which was kind of like the seminal role-playing game in the late 90s. It was never a business, it was kind of lifestyle. So we're actually pretty bad with counting money. You can kind of think of it almost like Nike, you know, where Phil Knight was selling shoes out of the trunk of his car. You know, you can kind of think about it the same way. It was, you know, just selling physical goods and then evolving that into a much broader enterprise. CD Projekt, named for selling CDs, would move on from just reselling games to localizing Western and Japanese made games into the Polish language. But it wasn't until 2002 that the company would make its own game, The Witcher. The Witcher is a huge, huge series, huge fantasy series in Poland. And so it was a pretty big deal that these guys got the right-",https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dp8PhLsUcFE,5439,2022-10-22 01:01:18
17034," The Witcher is a huge, huge series, huge fantasy series in Poland, and so it was a pretty big deal that these guys got the race to make the video games. The Witcher book series is a source of national pride in Poland, and as CD Projekt released The Witcher 2, the video game series would become an important economic symbol for Poland as well. The CD Projekt Red had become this behemoth of an institution in Poland, and they were really big in the Polish technology scene because they were getting more worldwide attention than most Polish companies do, and I'm making a lot of money, and in 2011 when Barack Obama came to visit Poland, the Prime Minister actually gave him a copy of The Witcher 2. I confess I'm not very good at video games, but I've been told that it is a great example of Poland's place in the new global economy. But it would be the launch of The Witcher 3 in 2015 that would elevate CD Projekt Red from representing the best of Poland to representing the best of the game's industry. I mean really the thing people look for first and foremost I think is that the game is just good, and Witcher 3 was just a phenomenal game. There's a level of just storytelling, an emphasis on making every side quest count. On top of the atmosphere, the dialogue, the character interactions, the different way stories can end, they nail that. Other open world games felt empty and enforced, and the developers of them gave excuses as to why there couldn't be more rich story or interactions, and The Witcher 3 blew them out of the water. CD Projekt Red was beloved. They were seen as a studio that was willing to make what the player wanted, and to truly put in the love and effort required to make a high quality game that really connects with the people playing with it. The Witcher 3 would go into an over 250 game of the year award, but along with being a critical success for CD Projekt it was also a financial success. Estimates put the sales of Witcher 3 at around 28 million copies in 2019. A huge step up, considering by 2014 the Witcher and the Witcher 2 had only combined to sell 8 million copies, and with two large expansions for the Witcher 3, CD Projekt also helped separate themselves from other AAA publishers at the time. And the game award goes, oh man, I have to pay a micro transaction to unlock. That's so stupid that this has to hold on. I got this guys, here we go. Other games, and the most notorious, you know, one to do this with EA's Star Wars Battle Front 2, they got really aggressive on micro transactions in a game that already cost at least $60, you could have paid more if you bought the premium editions, but not only was it that they were being very aggressive and trying to get you to spend money, but you could actually get items that helped you win. Well, gamers kind of draw the line in the sand there, and they don't like them. CD Projekt had done this phenomenal job of marketing themselves as a gamer-friendly company. We've said this a million times, and I'll say it again, we're gamers first of all, and we all like to be treated fairly. So it only makes sense that as developers, we apply the same principle to everything we do here at CD Projekt Red. So giving everyone a bunch of free DLC was an absolutely no-brainer. They said, we're not going to sell you DLC that's like horse armor packs and other nonsense. We're going to just give you a free stuff, and then we're going to sell big expansions as part of the Witcher 3. And not only were they really good, they were offered at a fair price. And this is a company that was seen as just like a company that really cared about quality and cared about its customers, and would not do anything to kind of screw fans over the way that fans see that EA and Activision and all the other big publishers do. With a critically and financially successful game, as well as the goodwill from the gaming audience, all the focus would shift to CD Projekt's next release, Cyberpunk.",https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dp8PhLsUcFE,5440,2022-10-22 01:05:29
17035," with a critically and financially successful game, as well as the goodwill from the gaming audience, all the focus would shift to CD projects next release, Cyberpunk 2077. It's actually funny, they first announced it through like a press release. CD Predicc red though wouldn't put out another trailer for Cyberpunk until 2018 at the E3 trade show. The game play about to see is from a work in progress version of the game. Everything you see is potentially subject to change. It all looked incredibly impressive. They had enough action, enough narrative beats with just the right amount of tension. They touted how each of these NPCs, their thousands of them, each one with their own daily routines and everything. So yeah, so people were certainly blown away by the demo of 23 awards and just people left the theater just in awe. What they didn't know of course is that the demo was completely fake. Fake demos are common at E3. They just put together builds of games to show off what they tend to be like rather than the actual state of the game. What was unique about this demo was that it was impressively long. It kind of plays into this idea that CD projects is very much a market and driven company and so demos were really really important to them. So it was really important that they make this demo blow people away, which it did, but that might have come to the cause of some time they could have been spending on the game. A year later, at E3 2019, fans would get another big surprise. Whoa! No way! Oh what?! Please welcome the other people. The fear of being there, of walking the streets of the future is really going to be breath taking. You're a breath baby! The Cyberpunk trailers showed gorgeous cities, beautiful lighting, really cutting edge technology when it comes to the rendering of the game itself. People were very excited to be immersed in this gorgeous Cyberpunk world. We saw over 8 million pre-orders, which is a ridiculously large amount for any title to sell, let alone pre-sell.",https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dp8PhLsUcFE,5441,2022-10-22 01:09:45
17036," World. They saw over 8 million pre-orders, which is a ridiculously large amount for any title to sell, let alone pre-sell. And you saw the Stock Cry start to go up and up and up and up into the right, you know, pretty much in a straight line. If you just look at like the Polish Stock Market, like the Wig Index, when CD Projekt Stock was at its high, it was the largest stock in the index. And that was around the time that they announced that the game would be coming in April of 2020. Behind the Seaheens, people were pretty shocked that they were saying April. I don't think a single person who worked on that game actually thought they had a chance of coming out in April of 2020. So in April of 2019, I published an article for Kotaku about the making of a game called Anthem, which was a game from Byware that was disastrous in many ways and the article kind of ran through why that was. And afterwards, they started hearing from other developers who had stories to share that they said sounded a whole lot like Anthem. The deadline is unrealistic, the direction keeps changing, things are floundering, we're going through a lot of problems. This sounds exactly like what you wrote about Anthem. Around that same time, perhaps coincidentally, I heard from VCEO of CD Projekt Red who wanted to reach out to me specifically to talk about Crunch. CD Projekt Red had a reputation for Crunch, especially during the development of Witcher 3. Their management wanted them to have a reputation for treating workers well and not forcing them to go through Crunch. So Marchiniewinsky, who's a co-founder and co-CEO of CD Projekt Red, came to me and said, Hey, I want to make a vow right now that we're not going to force anybody to Crunch, that people will not have to work mandatory over time on this project. Over the course of reporting, Bloomberg has conducted interviews with more than 20 current and former CD Projekt staff, most of whom requested anonymity so as not to risk their careers. CD Projekt declined a comment on the process or provide interviews with the story. The company would end up delaying the game three different times, first pushing from an April 2020 release to September, then November, and once again to December 2020. In order to meet the deadline, the studio would scale down the size of Cyberpunk's main city, as well as canceling some features. And while those measures helped, developers still said they were under significant crunch, including one former audio programmer who claimed to work up to 13 hours a day, five days a week, and stating he had seen friends who had lost their families over this. This was not a big secret in the office that the game was not going to be ready. But watch, a similar sort of thing happened with Witcher 3, and a similar sort of thing happens with a lot of games, where they don't seem ready until suddenly everything just clicks. Some of the best games ever made, like we're created through this process. I don't know that it's the most efficient or the wisest way to make video games, but it's what a lot of people do. I think that management there has genuinely tried to change it or at least said they wanted to change it, but it has proven very difficult to change that when you make games in this one in a specific way. Game studios, some of them see crunch as part of their core culture, that all of their games that they've made under crunch have been successful, so it must be a core element to the magic recipe for creating good games. And that's really not the case. We've run studies and seen that at eight weeks of working 60 hours plus, the output of a professional is the same as if they were working 40 hours a week. So chronic overwork degrades how effective someone is to the point where then it becomes negative and overworking them is just getting new less and less productivity. And so these guys, the people at CD Projekt, having made the Witcher 3, we're kind of riding on that high, you could call it arrogance or confidence or whenever you want to call it, of having made the Witcher 3. And I think that like having a certain level confidence can certainly be a good thing, but in this case it could also be dangerous because it kind of blinded them to the reality, which was that this game wasn't going to call us.",https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dp8PhLsUcFE,5442,2022-10-22 01:14:15
17037," music So many pictures entertainment is reeling from what may be the biggest and most devastating computer hacking in Hollywood's history. Hackers attacked in waves, first crippling Sony's internal systems, then leaking five Sony movies online. Today the US government pointed the finger of blame directly at North Korea for the devastating cyber attack against Sony pictures. Sony pulling the plug on the interview, saying it will not show the controversial comedy about an assassination attempt on North Korea's leader. The Sony pictures hacking was taken very seriously because it was an attack on the free world. What we have been building in terms of our civilization and our freedom and our ability to exchange information freely have been disrupted by a country that we knew very little about. North Korea has reportedly made attempts to steal COVID-19 vaccine technology by hacking pharmaceutical giant Pfizer. The Justice Department has charged three North Korean hackers over a wide ranging scheme that included the attempt theft of billions of dollars for multiple companies. Despite so many attacks blamed on North Korea, there was not much known about the people behind the hacking attacks and my aim was to reveal who these people are and what they are like, what their operations are like and on what their dreams and fears were. My name is Sam Kim. I'm a reporter for Blue Mug News and I wrote a story for Business Week about North Korean hackers. My story is about people who are sent from North Korea to countries like China to hack for the regime, spy on enemies and make money. North Korea's cyber abilities began about in the 1970s with a lot of students going to countries like Russia, China and even East Germany to learn coding. It was aimed at improving the productivity of factories at home. But in some time in the 1980s and 1990s, the current leader Kim Jong-un thought that it would be a good idea to develop a team, an army of people who could hack for North Korea's military. So they began this team of hackers who would spy for the North Korean military. Kim Jong-un takes the hacking ability more seriously than his father. He also enjoys a bit of tech sadness as well. He's often shown traveling on his airplane where on the desk there's a Mac computer. He understands the importance of computers. He understands the importance of employing technology to improve productivity of his economy. North Korea is an isolated country with its economy pretty much dilapidated nowadays. It's been under increasing pressure and sanctions from the US and the international community basically.

17038," Basically, it does not have the resources and money to build a kind of conventional weapons that other countries are able to build. So what happens is, North Korea concentrates its resources on building nuclear arms and missiles, which exports, called, basically, a symmetric weapons. It's the kind of weapons that gives North Korea an instant edge. Think of cyber-hacking abilities in that context. It doesn't cost them much money, but if you have the right people, and if you have the right training, you are able to cultivate an army of people who are able to penetrate into the computer. It's a symmetric weapon that is not a threat to computer systems of other countries. And that's what North Korea is after. But if you consider the fact that there are only about 1,000 IP addresses in North Korea available, and many of them are basically loaned from Chinese communications companies, you can kind of tell why North Korea is willing to send its hackers abroad rather than operate from within. What's the matter with operating from within? Well, first of all, it would mean that a lot of information would have to be coming in from the outside world, which could risk exposing the government and the people to whatever truth there might be about them. So they're sending their trained hackers to China and other countries where access to information is better. But at the same time, because these are allies, and also because they have their diplomats stationed in countries like these like China, they're able to regulate and control these hackers better. So formally, North Korea denies engaging in hacking and describes accusations to that affect as enemy propaganda. It took me at least half a year to track down these people. It felt like a wild goose chase in the beginning, because a lot of the people like these are protected by the government in South Korea. But at the end, I was able to find a person who had pretty extensive ties to the North Korean defective community here. And then I was also able to gain access to the people who had actually done programming hacking from North Korea before coming to South Korea. And Jung is one of them. Jung actually is not a real name. I knew before meeting Jung that he was in his late 30s. But when I actually met him, he looked at least a decade older. He wouldn't open up. I mean, it took me, I think, at least an hour to make sure that he would trust me enough that he would share with me his life story. When he was first sent to China, he was a student studying computer science at a university near the border with North Korea. And he came back and realized that there was a lot more to do in China because he had more access to information. And he asked that he'd be sent back to China. And there was also recruitment going on for people who would actually do coding officially, but really hacking from North Korea. So he applied and he got the job. Once he got to the border, he crossed by foot and from there, he took a bus. And then when he arrived at the station that he would spend years in later, he learned that the three story building in the heart of a city was actually provided for free actually by a Chinese man who had business ties in North Korea. There were actually two other people that I had met. They all said that they go to this freelance website for programmers and clients from around the world would come and give them orders, give them jobs to do. Some of the jobs given to Jung were cracking open, commercially successful anti-virus.",https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dp8PhLsUcFE,5444,2022-10-22 01:22:49
17039," Jobs to do. Some of the jobs given to Jung were cracking open, commercially successful anti-virus programs. And once he was able to open that up, he replicated that program into another product, which his client would repackage as a whole different product, to be sold to other people. He also created what we now call bots. There are very popular online games, including lineage. He would create a bot that would just roam around without any supervision from the user and basically trade items without the users on that game. He would grow that bot on lineage and sell it for almost $100. Another defector said the money from clients was wired primarily via PayPal, to accounts controlled by minors because they were the only ones with access to legitimate bank accounts. Jung had to make at least $100,000 a year and he doesn't get to keep most of it. Actually, most of the money goes to the minors to the North Korean regime. But if you don't meet the court, and the minors will make sure that they'll put enough pressure on you. And if that happens repeatedly, you will face the growing odds of being sent back home. Among the three people that I spoke to, there's a common thing that they all tell me, which is that on every Saturday, they have to do this propaganda session, which is basically about gathering all the hackers together into a room and they have to recite whatever message, whatever lines come from Pyongyang, about the Kim family, about socialism. If you're especially someone who with a free set of mind, that's stressful. One person actually was really stressed out what he heard about North Korea, once he was in China during the propaganda assistance, he just couldn't take it. Jung was a senior member of the unit that he belonged to and he was good at Chinese as well. Whenever a senior North Korean official came from North Korea to check on the hacking units in China, Jung would accompany that official. He doesn't provide me details, but he calls it unsavory incident that happened between him and an official that he was traveling with. And that altercation prompted him to defect, but there was no one that he could turn to after defecting. He would, in disguise, roam around China. He called me that he actually enjoyed it. He actually enjoyed the freedom of not being known to anybody, just roaming around a country that was huge. How did he make the money that he needed to carry on? He did the same thing he did at the North Korean unit. He would take orders, he would reverse engineer software to make money, but at one point he said he was just sick and tired of it all of a sudden. He just wanted to find a place where he could just settle down and he contacted South Korean authorities. Now, he lives in Korea. He met a woman here. Last time I checked the head of a baby, he worked for a software company, ironically, an antivirus company. What keeps coming up in my head, even long after I spoke to these people, is there was one common thing about them, which was the sense of disillusionment. One day had access to outside information, one day were able to freely roam in the Internet.",https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dp8PhLsUcFE,5445,2022-10-22 01:27:13
17040," The solution went. One day had access to outside information. One day, we were able to freely roam in the internet. There was a spark. And one day realized that there's a discrepancy between what they think is really happening and what North Korea is telling them every Saturday morning. That's when the spark gets bigger. The little fire is what eventually drives them to decide to leave, even if it takes a huge risk on their lives. The spark is what they think is really happening. The spark is what they think is really happening. The spark is what they think is really happening. The spark is what they think is really happening. Step into the shopping center of the future. Since they started popping up in the 1950s, malls have been the quintessential American shopping experience. Muscling temples dedicated to the wonders and excesses of retail, food service, and entertainment, the rise of the mall coincided with the growth of the suburbs. The heyday of the malls really is the 1970s, sometimes referred to as the malling of America. They really thrived at providing some sort of public gathering space, some sort of social life in addition to actually giving people places to shop. Over the past few decades before then, lots of developers were building malls and it kind of coincided with the growth of highways. So as more people started traveling and interstate started being built, developers really wanted to put something to attract people to stop. Take a look at an average American mall today, however, and you'll see a very different picture. Closed stores and empty hallways became the norm in many malls even before COVID-19 delivered them another set of problems in 2020. So what happened? This is the story of the rise and fall of American malls. When malls work best, they survived and thrived thanks to their anchor stores. Those are the stores that are on the edges of the malls and that are outward facing to the parking lot. So if you're a shopper, you're going to walk through one of these big, usually a department store. Silesher centsent Of their sales segment with a trending",https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dp8PhLsUcFE,5446,2022-10-22 01:31:38
17041," are outward facing to the parking lot. So if you're a shopper, you're gonna walk through one of these big, usually a department store. So if you're thinking about macy's or sears or JC Penny, those are called the Inker stores. So once shoppers are done shopping there, maybe they wander to the middle part of the mall, shopping at the other apparel shops or even going to buy some food, but you really had to have a reason for people to shop in the first place. Because anchors bring in all those people, they tend to pay very little rent. Around 80% of income from mall owners come from the inline stores inside the mall. Over the past few decades, malls have been facing challenges from all sides. The first being, there's just too many of them. As early as in the 90s, the malls were beginning to compete with each other. We have a lot more retail square footage per capita than Canada. We have only seven times more retail square footage per capita than Europe. After the 2008 financial crisis, lowered retail spending across the board, malls and especially their department stores also had to contend with a new challenge that was growing fast. Mall started to suffer in the early 2000s with the rise of online shopping. Suddenly, they didn't have that captive audience who had to go to the mall to buy something. You didn't have to get up, get in your car, drive all the way to the mall and then see a bunch of other people. You can just do it from the comfort of your own. Department stores overall have become less relevant over the years. Many have fallen totally off and that's Sears, JCPenney. Several bankruptcies in this space have really hurt the industry. But as department stores go, so does the mall often times. So if department stores start closing locations, that means they're usually leaving malls. This is the Green Briar Mall in Southwest Atlanta, Georgia. It's in many ways emblematic of the problems facing malls today. It's been there since 1965. So for more than half of a century, it's been serving this area of Atlanta that's predominantly black and also as middle-class neighborhood. It started with anchor stores that were department stores. So you had JCPenney and then Riches, which was later bought by Macy's. So you had these two national chains. It had the first Chick-fil-A in a mall, like that type of format. So when you think about the history of malls, like Green Briar had like the perfect template, but now Macy's will be exiting the mall, meaning that the mall will be left without an anchor, which is vital to attracting other shoppers to come into the stores. Green Briar then because it's kind of an example or a test for all these other middle-ing malls across America, about what do you do when these large department stores as a business decision on their end are trying to just stay in the high-quality malls? How does a middle-ing mall survive? What's their next strategy? For more information or at Bob R같's website or at McDonalds, visit K or other. UK Greenbrier is a textbook example of how closely the deterioration of the middle class in the US is tied to the health of its malls. The median income for the surrounding area has reduced by $6,905 over the past 15 years to a total of $20,756 per year and yet residents and store owners hope that Greenbrier mall will see better days. malls are made up of the people and communities that help fuel them. Greenbrier is still a place that people go to and cherish even if on paper it doesn't have-",https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dp8PhLsUcFE,5447,2022-10-22 01:36:02
17042," see better days. Mauls are made up of the people and communities that help fuel them. Greenbrier is still a place that people go to and cherish, even if on paper it doesn't have the elements that make it a thriving mall. A lot of the existing constituents and residents there feel in many respects that they worked hard their whole lives to be able to experience the American dream. The single family suburb and house in a leafy yard near a big mall that had a great Macy's. They're very reluctant to see that taken away from them. Now that Macy's is gone, Greenbrier may try to take inspiration from what many Mauls were doing in the years following the financial crisis, focusing not on shopping but experiences. That was a trend we were seeing, you know, in 2016 up into the pandemic pretty much. And by experiences I mean everything as dramatic as a water park or hosting like concerts to have people want to come other than just to buy stuff. Having Instagramable moments, making sure your store is pretty that people want to take a photo and post it on Instagram or Twitter. Historically the mall has always been a place for teenagers. You like to hang out, see your friends and also kind of be seen at the mall and that hasn't completely changed like before the pandemic about 95% of Gen Z's. So today's teenagers had gone to a mall in a three month period. So teenagers are still going to the mall and they've always been key to having thriving malls because they're coming into their spending power. And once you went over teens hopefully you're really winning over a loyal customer for life. But thanks to lockdowns across the country most Mauls at one point or another were shuttered in 2020. That means no one using the multi-billion dollar American Dream Mauls indoor ski slope. No one going to the King of Prussia malls indoor skydiving attraction. Basically the pandemic gave Mauls what they didn't need another problem. What would your net income or net operating income have been in 2022 without COVID and what is it now in a post COVID world. So our views is roughly 10% hit to net income over that period. That's Vince Taboni from the analytics from Green Street Advisors which rates American Mauls from A to D just like a report card. And if Mauls did have a report card they wouldn't exactly make honor roll. During the US out of the thousand Mauls in the country there are roughly 250 Mauls we grade A minus or better. The B and C quality Mauls which is the vast majority of the Mauls by count we think are on a negative trajectory and it's going to depend on a lot of the local dynamics ownership decisions around how much money to invest in the property. We'll determine whether this mall can survive as retail or so you know rapidly melting ice cube. While there have been a few bankruptcies among real estate investment trusts that own mostly B to D malls in the past few years A malls really are doing just fine. Some of the most productive shopping centers in the country are super high-end so I'm talking about bowel harbor shops down in Miami, Florida. There's Americana man has it in Long Island's Gold Coast, the Grove in Los Angeles. These are places that have all high-end stores and have done quite well. A lot of that has to do with efficiency of their properties so their sales per square foot are really high but also they've invested a lot in their actual mall because it has to look beautiful it has to have all the services that that a wealthy shopper expects. So what will the future hold for less sought-after malls that can't revive their golden years? For many of these malls it will mean closure and then hopefully conversion. If they can't get a new use to come in it's expensive but you can just demolish it and there are still quite a lot of sites just sitting.",https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dp8PhLsUcFE,5448,2022-10-22 01:40:12
17043," It can't get a new use to come in. It's expensive, but you can just demolish it. And there are still quite a lot of sites just sitting waiting. Amazon has been picking up more and more of those building their big fulfillment centers. Also, a lot of communities see this as an opportunity in order to redevelop, re-enhabit this dead mall to help that community meet the challenges it was never originally designed for. The number one reuse of an existing mall is as workspace. It's actually pretty easy to just throw some carpeting down, cut a few more windows, and turn it into office space. Sort of number two reuse of malls is either in medical, health care, or education. Lots of great examples of community colleges all the way down to elementary schools. Moving into malls. Then the third strategy that I wish happened more is actually just demolishing the mall and re-grain it. Either reconstructing the wetlands that used to be there, and that frankly, we never should have built on in the first place, or providing community parks and gardens. While most analysts say post-pandemic retail shopping could breathe some life back into the American mall, many are not long for this world. Depending on where you live, it might be time to make one last visit, grab some food, do some shopping, and say farewell. When former President Donald Trump announced plans to scale back two national monuments in Utah, there was outcry from a lot of people. One company, in particular. Patagonia really is a resistance brand. They embraced the liberal resistance against President Donald Trump and really put themselves at the forefront of that movement. In 2017, it sued the Trump administration for sort of slashing the size of these two national monuments in Utah that were kind of mechas for climbers. It said at the time joining the legal fracas was both extraordinary and obvious. The company's General Counsel said it took exactly one email to the board to decide to actually do that. I sent the case is still out. Well, I think the only thing this administration understands is lawsuits. We're losing this planet. And we have an evil government. And I'm not going to stand back and just let evil win. This year it got even more active, it changed its mission statement to quote, Patagonia isn't business to save our home planet. Manufactured these little tags on some of it.",https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dp8PhLsUcFE,5449,2022-10-22 01:44:36
17044," It changed its mission statement to quote, Patagonia is in business to save our home planet. And then it manufactured these little tags on some of its clothes that if you flip them up, it says, boat the assholes out, very implicit, running up to the election. And it launched a digital tool to help people find the polling place. And on that digital platform, it says, boat the climate deniers out of office. Again and again, on the loop. This isn't the first time that taking a stand has paid off for Patagonia. The business which is now worth over a billion dollars was built on it. I couldn't care less about making more money, but by doing the right thing, it always ends up making more money. So is this all a strategy, a sort of premeditated strategy? Who knows? I mean, Sean Arts has been very vocal from the start and makes no bones about. He calls himself a dirt bad climber and an accidental entrepreneur. So I don't think he's fudging this, but what's important is that it's sort of a textbook marriage of philanthropy and profit. If you want to understand the entrepreneur's study that juvenile delinquent, because they're saying, this sucks. And I'm going to do it my own way. Of course, like every other teenage kid, I had no idea what I wanted to do with my life. When I was 16 years old, I took off and drove across the country, went into the Wind River Range and discovered mountains. Patagonia was born out of Rockclimate Abonchino Arts first business, Schuwenart Equipment, which made in soul climbing supplies. Abonchino Art was a blacksmith in the 50s and he started selling climbing gear out of the back of his car. That was less harmful to rock faces. This is sort of the origin story of the company. It's called itself the activist company, a activist company. Six months out of the year, Ivanshin Art is a blacksmith. He makes mountain climbing gear. The other half of the year he climbs. In 1968, Ivanshin Art and four friends, including Dag Tomkins, the late founders of the North Face brand, embarked on the ultimate road trip from California where they were based to Patagonia in Argentina. The mountain was in a good mood, dazzling sun, calm air all day. If this weather holds, they could be on the summit within days. This trip became a documentary about these friends who were hippies in the 70s climbing in Yosemite where the sport became a lifestyle and how these friends became pioneer of the outdoor industry. Schuwenart moved from selling petons to polyester and in the 70s Patagonia was born. In 1973, Schuwenart and his wife Melinda opened the very first Patagonia store in Ventura, California, where the company's headquarters remained today. Melinda Schuwenart was the driving force behind many of the employee benefits, like on-site childcare, that helped the company achieve an impressive 4% employee turnover rate. The retail and consumer product sector average is more than triple that at 13%. I do think that Patagonia was a leader, one of the first corporations, to take into account the human capital and make sure that their staff, all their employees were cared for in many ways, not just wages, but also they just cared about their people and knew that that's a good business model.",https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dp8PhLsUcFE,5450,2022-10-22 01:48:50
17045," Therefore, in many ways, not just wages, but also they just cared about their people and knew that that's a good business model. Patagonia began donating 10% of its profits to grassroots organizations in 1985. This later became the 1% of sales that Schu and Ad labels and Earth tax. I don't think it's for land free. It's rent for us living on this planet. While Patagonia was creating the blueprint of how to be a socially conscious brand, it was also turning a profit. It even made ink magazines list of the fastest growing privately held companies. So every time the company makes a decision to do something socially environmentally active, it is met with success. And that isn't lost on Schoenart or any of the other leaders of the company. The more money Patagonia made, the more it gave away under its philanthropic programme. Between 1989 and 1991, the payroll grew by 40%. But trouble was on the horizon. I think for 1991, we are looking at a recession. The question is how deep that recession is going to be and how long will be in it? Sales fell flat and the bank called in the companies revolving loans. A company that prided itself on taking care of its own laid off 120 people, roughly 20% of its workforce. That was when we decided that we were going to start doing things differently. And we're going to start running the company as if it's going to be here 100 years ago. With a renewed sense of purpose, Patagonia was ready for what it called business unusual. It started with the costly move to recycle an organic materials before launching a clothing repair service to discourage fast fashion. And Patagonia's influence was growing. What was intended as Schoenart's philosophical handbook for employees became an international blueprint for sustainable business printed in term languages. What's interesting to me is that all this, I hate the term on brand, but it's very on brand. It really works for the kind of companies created. It works for the kind of employees he's been able to recruit and retain. It all is very seamless in terms of the identity of him and the company and what it means in the marketplace. So over time, the company's mission and its marketing have become the same thing. The inflection point came in 2011, actually Black Friday. Patagonia took out a huge ad in the New York Times that said don't buy this jacket. And it sort of got into the nitty gritty on, you know, the carbon footprint and the water footprint that goes into, you know, a piece of a peril like a parka. And at the time Schoenart said the best jacket for our planet is one that already exists. So the company at that time said it needed to address the issue of consumerism, which coming from a for profit business hits pretty hypocritical. As the company encouraged its customers to buy less, its annual sales increased by almost 40%. The stance on this is hypocritical is loud and constant talking about consumerism in a critical light while very much being a part of it. Fast fashion is top on the list of environmental destruction and not just destroying the environment but impacting human health. They are in the fashion industry, they're clothing retailer and to come head to head with that is courageous. You're not only just trying to create a product that'll last but you're also educating an entire generation of people to understand that whole ideology that you don't need to change out our outfits. In 2014, Rose Macaria was appointed as CEO. During the next six years, she grew Patagonia into a billion dollar company while also scaling up its environmental goals and bringing a more political voice to its activism. Ivana had this model where he was basically saying you can have a great business, you can make quality product, but you can also do the right thing by the environment, by your employees, by your community.",https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dp8PhLsUcFE,5451,2022-10-22 01:53:15
17046," Great business, you can make quality product, but you can also do the right thing by the environment, by your employees, by your community. And that to me was like the most holistic vision of business that I'd ever seen. So right now Patagonia has a team of about 20 people, solely focused on activism and grants. And this all comes at a time in the past decade when consumers are paying much more attention to the social footprint of companies and where they buy their goods. So what's happened is all this is good business for Patagonia in the past 10 years, revenue and profit at the company of roughly quadruple. It's private, but estimates are it does about a billion dollars in annual sales, which is sizable. And that's part of the reason why it's been such a for to a disciple as it's ramped up its activism and become more vocal on these things. It's resonated with the market. As the company branched out into other areas, including a venture capital fund for environmental causes and sustainable food, revenue reached a new peak of over one billion dollars in 2017. But this was still small change compared to fast fashion heavyweights like Nike, who made $37 billion that same year. Patagonia's conscience hasn't always been reflected in its customer base either. Personalized vests have become the go-to corporate uniform. And the expensive price tag has helped the brand and the nickname Patagonia. It's expensive stuff, it's expensive apparel. And that is part of their calculus in terms of the activism, you know, a lot of the more sustainable parts of this pie chain art. There's a premium for organic cotton or sustainable down. The Patagotchi label is a symptom of that. So Patagonia products are very popular, of course, with people who are active in the outdoors, but also with people who are not as active. For instance, you know, people in finance where the Patagonia vests go to the office. And that's because of the image that the brand projects. And so they have to leave with the fact, although they, you know, preach for the environment and want to stand for good, their victims of their own success. Patagonia set sales records in the first three years of the Trump administration. Now, in 2020, things have changed. Is COVID-19 brought the business world to a halt? And the American people voted in a new administration. Patagonia appointed Brian Gellert as CEO. As far as if CEO transition goes, this one's happening quite strangely. There's no real budget for next year yet because of everything that's going on and all the uncertainty around that. Patagonia's new focus is going to be on forging a relationship with the Biden administration. It should be a more close relationship, but Gellert still has his guard up. During the Obama administration, they didn't always agree and he expects the same with Biden in the White House. They plan to bring litigation wherever needed against any government needed about the issues that they care about and that's climate change in the environment.",https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dp8PhLsUcFE,5452,2022-10-22 01:57:37
17047," MUSIC Okay, so you built this, so this is all. This is new since the pandemic. We assume Googlers would want more indoor outdoor options. I mean, it's so exciting. It's such a fun... It is. It is, but I would say the thing we're really excited about are these new buildings because we're building sustainability and everything we do. So really forward-looking. More? More? Good? Yes. Okay. Visit professor's library and here we are.",https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dp8PhLsUcFE,5453,2022-10-22 02:02:26
17048," Good? Okay. From one of the newest workspaces at the Googleplex in Mountain View, California, this is Bloomberg Studio 1.0 with Alphabet CFO, Ruth Porat. We're not far from her childhood home. Her father was a physicist at Stanford, her mother, a psychologist. After graduating from Stanford herself and then earning a couple more advanced degrees, Porat landed her first job on Wall Street in 1987, where she would spend almost three decades until Google's co-founders lured her to Silicon Valley. It's wonderful to be here with you. It's great to have you here at the Googleplex. Thank you for having us. So we are at Google headquarters in Mountain View and at this very same time you are making massive investments in New York office real estate. You're expanding headcount in Atlanta and Chicago and Washington, D.C. What's the strategy behind all of this? Well at the core we believe in hybrid work. So we do want to bring people back on campuses, but not full time. We're thinking it'd probably be a three to work week, but we think coming together is just such a core part of innovation, serendipity, culture, every element of it. And we're growing at a really rapid clip. So we are excited to be expanding our real estate footprint. And then we also wanted to make sure that we're meeting people where they want to be. And so enlarging the number of sites that we have available for people in particular sites where you have great diverse populations. Sundar just told me that Googlers will have this option of working in hybrid mode forever, literally forever. Obviously, you're embracing this massive cultural shift. But what are the risks? What are you worried about? So the positive we've seen is there's a productivity uplift we believe in giving people the opportunity to be at home some of the time, not do the commute, be able to deal with everything else in their life, and coming into the office. So the risk is, I think about my career and so much of the benefit in my career was the informal coaching, being pot-pron into meetings, all of the touch points that you have. And so I think that one of the most important things for all of us as leaders is we need to evolve the way we lead. We need to make sure that we're thinking about this hybrid work life and why that's the way to be the best magnet for talent and make sure that we're continuing to reinforce all of those great practices while opening up new great practices. Speaking of your career, before you were CFO of alphabet, you were CFOs, Morgan Stanley, and you started your career on Wall Street in 1987. Talk to us about the journey of going from big banks to big tech. Why did you make that leap? And what impact did you want to have? Well, I love doing it Morgan Stanley, and I became CFO the day James Gorman became CEO yes, needed to join him in that journey, and that was January 2010. And we were still recovering coming out of the financial crisis. There were still some pretty rocky days and a lot of decisions that needed to be made. And then I got to a point where I felt like we were in a great spot at Morgan Stanley, and obviously it's continued to do really well. And I just wanted that next chapter. On my view, in my career, I've always been focused on continually learning and I feel like when you hit a plateau the right questions, what's my highest and best use? And it's been an extraordinary time. You also survived Wall Street in the 80s and 90s, which is notorious Boys Club. And Silicon Valley has sort of come to be known as a Boys Club of its own. How would you compare those two cultures? Well, when I was starting my career many decades ago, it was tough and much worse than it is now, and it evolved. No question about it. Not where it needs to be, but certainly evolved and I saw it through my career. I would say the biggest difference out here is the level of impatience. And I love it. It's the view is if you can do some of the extraordinary breakthroughs that we have out here, if you can do natural language translation, everything we do with AI, with VR, with self-driving cars, why can't you fix this now? And that level of impatience I think is fantastic. The legend has it that when you got to Google, you were going to reign in the spending.",https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dp8PhLsUcFE,5454,2022-10-22 02:06:18
17049," Fantastic. Legend has it that when you got to Google you were going to rain in the spending, tighten up on the moon shots. Your nickname I believe was Ruth Vader. Was that a tough job to take on? So I think the narrative was written before I got here. And what I find most interesting about that is I firmly believe the single most important thing in the capital allocation is investing for long term growth. I think if you don't you are sowing the seeds of your long term decline. And I learned that really early on in my career. Now if you're investing in an industry like this and trying to do truly transformative things by definition, everything can't succeed. And so by definition you should have the metrics and data and milestones to assess is it working or is it not? Because if everything's working or if you think everything's working, I would say one of two things are wrong. Either you're not reaching high enough or you're not being honest enough with yourself about the pace of breakthrough, whether you're going to get there. So to me, a really natural part, you know, kind of a sister organization to investing for long term growth is actually thinking about how are you doing with the risk that you're taking stack rack them and figure out what's at the bottom so you can redeploy those resources to the top. They go together actually and so I find the narrative. It's a false choice to think that it's either about growth or it's about pruning stack ranking. They go together and you have to think of them as actually empowering one another. You advised the Treasury Department during the great recession. What lessons did you take away from that? What struck me is a lot of the lessons from the financial crisis are relevant and good times and bad times. So the most important is it's easier to prevent than to fix. And so you know, there was that was really clear during the financial crisis. The financial crisis was about liquidity and it dried up quickly and it would have been really easy six to 12 months prior to build in durable liquidity. You couldn't do it in the moment. And so this notion about really building a solid foundation on which you operate. You need to do that ahead of time. It needs to be all of the work we do on trust and safety and content moderation security. That is the foundation on which you can build everything else. The hangpaws at one point said to me you have to have the will and the means and too often by the time you have the will you no longer have the means his comment was be decisive act early even in the absence of information. I think that's true in this whole notion of investing for long term growth because if you're not actually assessing progress along the way and you just assume you know what we can keep investing in everything. At some point down the road you'll say I wish I made those tough calls to double down on the things that really mattered what times are we now what's your read on the economy today especially with rising inflation. Well I think back to March of 2020 and where we were and I think of all of the intervention and steps that have been taken since then and you've certainly seen the recovery coming out the back and and it's been really gratifying from those those painful days to see the breakthroughs that we've had not just on the medical front but we've also seen the improvement across businesses. I think one of the biggest concerns in particular is you're seeing us go through a digital transformation and the acceleration of it is ensuring that everyone has the skills the digital training and skills to thrive in this new economy. Google now reaches more than half the people on the planet. Why shouldn't we view Google as a monopoly? We often say that people come to Google not because they have to but because they want to. It's really opening the world for so many people so that's the intent.",https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dp8PhLsUcFE,5455,2022-10-22 02:10:41
17050," Hope you enjoyed this video! I want to talk a little bit about regulation. You were drawn to M&A in your early days at Morgan Stanley. Microsoft is making some big acquisitions, deals that some think Google maybe would have wanted to win in a former life. Is antitrust scrutiny constraining any of your business plans and your ability to compete? So the main thing that we've done throughout our life of Google is really invest in innovation as organic growth and we're continuing to do that at a really rapid clip. We have then layered onto it, tuck in acquisitions and larger acquisitions and we're continuing to be active. We're more in the smaller ones and add-ons to be fair, but we think there's a lot of opportunity still ahead of us. And so we're continuing to invest in partnerships in some acquisitions and do you think that there's still upside in a lot of different areas? So would you say this regulatory scrutiny isn't slowing you down? It's really important for those of us in certain leadership positions to be very focused on constructively engaging and working with regulators on what are the issues, what is that they're trying to solve and how can we constructively engage with them. At the same time our engineers should focus on innovation and continuing to kind of up the bar on everything we're doing, address what is most helpful for our users. Google is facing more serious legal threats at this time in the United States than the other big tech companies. How are those conversations with regulators going? Are they frustrating at this point? Well, there's certain elements that are frustrating because I listen to the outline of some of the proposed legislation and I think it's inconsistent with some of the priorities for public policy. So as an example, there are a lot of focus on what is called self-preferencing. Are you putting too many of your own products together? But during the pandemic one in three small businesses said they would have failed without digital skills. Why? Because what they were able to do is connect with their users in different ways. So if you go search for a small business you can then go to a map and you can get directed to the small business. That's a good thing. We have 6,000 small businesses who wrote in and said, you know what, we need these digital tools and skills. Same with a number of things on racial equity. Real surge in searches about where can I, where's a black owned business near me and the ability to direct people through search and maps. So I think that what's really important and that's why I said it's about constructive engagement, let's make sure we understand what they're trying to solve and work with them on what is it that we're trying to address through products so that the products are helpful in the ways that they want. Facebook has taken a serious reputational hit. Has that had ripple effects or created collateral damage for Google? Well, I think that whenever there's a backdrop that's challenging, it has ripple effects. But what we're really underscoring is all of the steps and investments that we are making to really protect the ecosystem the way we are commitment to our users. So we know how sacrosanct that trust is and it's all about privacy and what are the steps that we're taking to make privacy protected.",https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dp8PhLsUcFE,5456,2022-10-22 02:15:00
17051," into our users. So we know how sacrosanct that trust is and it's all about privacy and what are the steps that we're taking to make privacy protected for our users. What is it that we're looking at to protect content and content moderations? Google now reaches more than half the people on the planet. Why shouldn't we view Google as a monopoly? So you know, I go back to the earliest days when Google, I first learned about Google back in 1998 and in those earliest days when I heard about this like eighth search engine, the question is why do you actually need it? And back at Morgan Stanley, it's working with our research analyst Mary Meekers, she actually had her team put up white pages all around the conference room and was doing this comparison. Well provided the most responsive results most rapidly and all of a sudden you could see, well, when did this Google thing actually maybe we do need something new and that's been the ethos at Google since inception is just continued to innovate to make this eight never better experience for users and so if we can if we can deliver on that which is what drives people here, it's really opening the world for so many people. So that's the intent. Facebook and Twitter are exploring digital currency. What is your thought on the crypto market and is there a play for Google? So we look at it. There's nothing to comment on now. I think we're much more interested in blockchain and the underlying technology and the implications for the business and also for the way we can support our cloud customers. So certainly a lot of effort there. There's considerable chatter in the crypto universe that Web 3 and the blockchain could circumvent the power of Facebook and Google and more. What do you think about the next frontier of the internet? At this point I think there are a lot of different things ahead of us that are actually studyingly exciting that enable us to actually continue to address different needs and requirements. Like I look at for example in something like health where I think blockchain will be very valuable when you think about health and health records. There are also a whole host of other areas where the data analytics that we provide are absolutely critical. Should we make excuses to our employers? Should we tell our like if I have to head to a parent teacher conference or take a kid to the doctor, do I tell my boss that I don't know? You don't tell your boss, you've got to get over the guild. You survived breast cancer twice. What was your biggest fear at that time and how did you overcome it? Well the biggest fear was I wouldn't make it and I remember when someone had some interview while I was going through chemo said where do you want to be in five years and I froze because it was I'm.",https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dp8PhLsUcFE,5457,2022-10-22 02:19:23
17052," Going through chemo said, where do you want to be in five years? And I froze because it was, I want to be alive. And I learned a couple of really important things. One, given breakthroughs in medical technology, I learned to love the word manageable. These, this journey does become manageable, not for all cancers, but for many more cancers. And that gave me a lot of confidence talking with other survivors about it and it gives me an edge of all, get the best care. And just plow through it. I was just very grateful. I'm grateful for all of the investments people have made over the years, but for anybody out there. And I think everybody sadly will be touched by cancer either themselves or someone they know and love. Many of these cancers are manageable and just go at it with gusto. So that's what I did. You're a mom of three sons. And I find that especially remarkable because I also have three sons. How have you managed that over the course of this incredible career? How do you find that right mix of focus and free time to spend time with your family and doing the things that you love? So my kids, my kids give me energy. They're remarkable. And I think one of the important things for me is this notion that you do have to have a mix. It's not about trying to find balance, the physics of which is really challenging. I think when people try for balance, they always feel they're failing on something because something's out of whack. So this metaphor that life is like a kaleidoscope. And you need to have different shaped pieces of glass and different color. And sometimes one is larger than the other. And what's beautiful about life is when it's constantly moving around. And so to me that metaphor has actually been sort of an anchoring principle. The other is you have to put the kids first. So like they know that I'm there, when they need always. And I think that just making sure that you're setting the boundaries the way you need to, I would say it's much easier today than when I was growing up in banking. We had a cubicle. There was a computer room. You were anchored to the computer room. One of the many beautiful things about going through this evolution in work is understanding that hybrid works. So how do we get rid of mom guilt? Especially in this new work world. I want to shake my mom guilt. How do I do that? OK, so even when you feel it, just say, you know what, it's an investment in my career because I can stay in this longer and be operating at a higher level if I'm really getting the stimulus from all parts of my life. So you've got to drop the mom guilt. And when on the other side, mom guilt with kids, I think they get it. I think they understand what we're doing. And they'll never forget during the financial crisis at one point I was working on AIG. We went around the clock. I came home to shower that one like right as we were landing AIG. And my three kids had each written me a yellow sticky note with a message on it. And one of them was based, you know, the essence of which was, I get why you're doing this. And they saw it as the right thing for the country. I don't need to over dramatize what it was, but that's what it felt like at the time. And that level of pride, I still have those three stickies right by my bedside because I get it. I get the mom guilt. I wish there were certain elements I could have done differently. But I also see the relationship we have and they understand what it means to actually be engaged in society and doing something you care about. No mom guilt. No mom guilt. Thank you. It's not allowed. Should we make excuses to our employers? Should we tell them like, if I have to head to a parent teacher conference or take a kid to the doctor, do I tell my boss that I'm going to be? You don't tell your boss. You don't tell your boss. Guys don't tell their boss. So what do we say? I don't think you say anything. I actually made this point at an event at Morgan Stanley. I'm like, do not tell your boss. You've got to get over the guilt. The only way to move on from it is realize, I'm a professional. I do things when I can. And it makes sense. And I get it all done. I just do it on my own timeline. And I actually had a woman who emailed to me afterwards and said, I know you said I'm not supposed to tell my boss. So I won't. But I can't not tell somebody. So I'm going to email you. And I'm like, OK, that's step one. I've got five step journey. I do not.",https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dp8PhLsUcFE,5458,2022-10-22 02:23:43
17053," I'm supposed to tell my boss, so I won't, but I can't not tell somebody, so I'm going to email you. And I'm like, okay, that's step one of five step journey. Do not tell your boss. Tell your boss, you know what? I need to do certain things for myself, and I'm getting, I feel guilty doing it, but I get everything done. There's no question you are so beyond having to check in with people. Well, thank you. So, do not. We're in the middle of this so-called great resignation, and people are reflecting and changing and making big decisions. What's your advice to people in this big evolution, you know, huge choices ahead? Well, I think you framed it really well. I don't think it's the great resignation. I think it's the great reshuffle, and people are reflecting on what do they want, and how do they want to work, and how do they want to live their lives. So, I think for all of us thinking about what does that mean for our institutions, it is about evolving the way we work, the way we interact, the expectations that we have, to say, but I grew up in a cubicle on the 26th floor of a skyrise, doesn't work anymore. And so, what should we do as leaders? And I think that this generation, appropriately, and it's very exciting, expects more from all of us, and so it's not just in how we work, but it is in what we do. And I think all elements of what's the mission, are you delivering on the mission, is really important. Okay, so if you rapid fire questions, someone you'd love to have dinner with? Well, I'd love to say my parents, because they passed away in over a years ago. Favorite family ritual? We do this crazy thing that we've done for years, which is everybody gets to pick where we travel. We come up with the five different locations, and then we all vote, and then we get the grid, and that's where we go. What's your favorite getaway? Probably, I would say maybe Iceland was the vast. That's an amazing one. New York or California? Ooh, it's so unfair. Well, sitting here outdoors right now, and knowing I can do that for the rest of the years for you nice, but the energy from New York, so I'm not going to, it's like, I don't pick amongst children. So, in closing, Google is a massive company, multiple divisions, many bets. Where are you spending most of your time now? I'm spending most of my time on your very important question about capital allocation, because if it really goes to this core point, you've got to invest for long term growth, making sure that you're investing with the right intensity. I often say, I don't want to get to the two-yard line, but not score. So you need to make sure you're investing with the right intensity to support long term growth. That's the most important area where I would say I spend the bulk of my time, and then, of course, you have to prioritize in order to recycle to support those efforts. What kind of discussions are you having with Larry and Sergey now about this next phase of Google? So when they made the announcement about the role of change, they were very serious about moving to this board role, and they've been their amazing board members. Sundar, of course, relies on them for council wherever, whenever, but most of the interaction is really around what are we doing at the board level. And you have your freedom to allocate capital as you like. I work closely with Sundar and Phillip and Thomas. Yes, we work as a great team. So what's the vision for Google then, 10 years from now? It's fascinating to... I think I had the same reaction you did when I heard Sundar say search is the biggest moonshot, and I think that continuing to find ways to be helpful to users, to solve what they need where so many people are coming online, and it is video going to be the way they understand it's going to be about search is going to be a different type of experience, so much of it's going to be about voice, first, and language translation. So it's going to continue to evolve. And what about for you personally? Where will you... It's been so amazing to hear about your journey, and I'm just curious about your personal growth. What you feel you've accomplished in the last, since you've been here, and what you hope to accomplish. I find that the opportunity to try new things and to invest in new things, and as we think about, well what does that mean for each one of our areas? I think that intellectual curiosity keeps...",https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dp8PhLsUcFE,5459,2022-10-22 02:28:01
17054," I knew things and to invest in new things and as we think about, well what does that mean for each one of our areas? There's, I think that intellectual curiosity keeps you young and I think that continuing to learn is like your brain is like silly putty getting pulled in a lot of directions. So to me it's continuous learning. Ruth Porat, thank you so much for joining us. It's been wonderful to be here. Thank you, great to have you on campus. Come back anytime. All right, anytime. Thank you so much for doing this. Well thanks for doing it. Of course. So sorry I'm late and I'm coming late. Not at all. It gave us more chance to tweak the lights for the 50,000th time. So you're doing well? Yes. How often are you coming into the office these days? About two to three days a week. How about you? I guess you come in. Yeah, I'm in every day now. So no more kids on the set. I have to ask, is your son still mining Ethereum? He and I literally were talking about it last night. He's like, Dad, you are the one who made me give up on it. I'm like, no, no, I didn't. But yeah, the thing that's good about this is I think it excites a whole new generation about technology, which is good. I really appreciate taking the time. Well, thank you for doing it. And thank you for coming down to do it. I'm ready to go and you guys are. From Google headquarters in Mountain View, California, this is Bloomberg Studio 1.0 with Alphabet CEO Sundar Pachai. Ford and raised in India. Pachai had almost no access to a computer until college. But just years later, found himself rising through the ranks of the world's largest search engine. In 2015, it was Pachai that Google co-founders Larry Page and Sergey Brin chose to run Google and later Alphabet. Now valued at more than $2 trillion. It's one of the most powerful companies on the planet. Sundar, it's great to be with you today. Thanks for doing this. Great to be here in person. Google just hit a $2 trillion market cap. Alphabet, I should say. Where is the next trillion dollars going to come from? You know, I've always felt your market cap valuation is an effect of the value you provide. And I feel fortunate. Our mission is timeless. There is more need to organize information than ever before. I still feel searches are biggest moonshot as a company. You know, people will want radically more conversational experiences. They will want what we call multimodal experiences. They may speak to search. They may look at something and ask what the information is. Being able to adapt to all that and evolve search will continue to be the biggest opportunity. We are so excited about the YouTube cloud or hardware products, Google Play. So we're building a diverse set of businesses.",https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dp8PhLsUcFE,5460,2022-10-22 02:32:25
17055," Regulation is important in areas like AI regulation will be important. And so I think, you know, those who will be part of the answers as well. The Facebook follow out that Instagram can be toxic to teens, for example, has this raised more or new concerns for you about the impact of technology, tech addiction, algorithms, YouTube even on our children and their development and their mental health. I mean, you're a parent and you also have a lot of power over how this plays out. You know, I mean, like you, you know, bringing kids up in this modern digital world is something, I think all parents are anxious about rightfully so. I think, you know, it's part of why a few years ago when in YouTube, you know, we were exposed to a set of concerns. You know, we invested, it became our number one priority to work harder. The reason YouTube invested so much in developing YouTube kids as a safe destination for young children, so on. The technology is going to play a big role in helping give children the next wave of opportunity as well. So the answer is to develop it responsibly. We have changed our balance in these areas and saying, we think about content responsibility first and then the pace of development or new features in areas like YouTube. And so that's how we approach it for a while. Facebook and Microsoft are all in on the metaverse. What do you think about the metaverse? What's Google's metaverse strategy? It's always been obvious to me that computing over time will adapt to people and people adapting to computers. You know, you won't always interact with computing in a black rectangle in front of you. So just like you speak to people, you see and interact. Computers will become more immersive. They'll be there when you need it to be. So, it's always been excited about the future of immersive computing and being computing AR. And we are in that count as the metaverse. Is that what that is? You know, metaverse is, I think it means different things to different people. The way I think about it is evolving computing in an immersive way with augmented reality. As part of that, there'll be many experiences, some of which will be immersive interactive virtual worlds, which is the metaverse concept. But I think this doesn't belong to any company. This is the evolution of internet and the web, the internet, all of it will continue to evolve. Google was famous for its campuses where you could go and never leave. You had everything you ever wanted. Now, you've said they can be flexible. They can work from home. They can work at the office. They can be hybrid. They can work remotely permanently, perhaps. Are you committed to really letting them do this forever? And if so, how does that change the future of work and society? Look, we've really embraced the fact that the future is going to be flexible. At Google, we've always tried to give agency to our employees. But we do realize the importance of bringing people together, the creativity community and collaboration that comes with it. So the balance we are striking is this notion of three two. But we're giving the strength of our companies. We have more locations than most of the companies. So we're giving people a choice to move anywhere in the world. Four weeks they can work from anywhere. We're going to accommodate 20% of our workforce to be remote over time. So we're going to embrace that flexibility. Forever. Forever. Yeah. And we're committed to it. Through it all, it forces us to design better products. And since people use Google Workspace to run their companies, I think gives us a chance to innovate and bring all that out. I think there is so much value in giving people more flexibility between their personal and professional lives. And I think it will lead to people being happier. And I think companies can be successful in that model. And so we are trying to get the best of both worlds, but embrace the flexibility and see where we go. How confident are you that when you look back, you'll be able to say Google did enough to help save the world. We are putting so much energy and resource into it.",https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dp8PhLsUcFE,5461,2022-10-22 02:39:00
17056," Here we go. you grew up in India, you lived through droughts, water was scarce. How has that experienced shaped your feelings about the urgency of stopping climate change? I grew up in Chennai, India, and a big part of my childhood was a really pretty severe water scarcity. We would get water trucked in for the streets and stand in lines and carry a few buckets of water at home. There was no running water for many years. But fast forward a few years ago, Chennai had one in a hundred-year flood, which was a very extreme event. Kind of drove home. That combined with a few years ago, waking up to the orange skies here in the Bay Area, seeing the look of concern on my children's faces and having to explain it, you know, all kind of drove home in a deeply personal way for me. So I think it's the most defining issue we all face and, you know, definitely something very motivated on working towards. I remember waking up to those orange skies too and having to have that same conversation with my kids. Do you think the commitments at COP26 went far enough? You know, encouraged by many things, you know, we have to tip our hat to the people who are working super hard. The issues and the trade-offs are genuinely difficult. You know, you have to keep the economies growing, you know, it really matters. And but at the same time, it's a pretty severe urgent issue. So I'm encouraged by the progress. I think it builds on the Paris Agreement. So I can see the forward progress. There is the deep anxiety that it all may not be enough. But, you know, we have to be optimistic and keep pushing. Google has set some aggressive targets to run entirely on clean energy to be the first tech giant to do so 24 hours a day. How confident are you that when you look back on this time, let's say a decade from now, you'll be able to say Google did enough to help save the world? We are putting so much energy and resources into it. It's always been kind of a founding value for us. We've been carbon neutral since 2007. We've been matching our energy consumption with renewable energy over the past few years. So this, you know, we are now pushing it's a moonshot to be 24, 7 carbon free. That means every search you do, every email you send that we can do it carbon free. We were at 61% in 2019. The number is now 67%. We have set our goals to be 100% by 2030. And to do it globally, that means we have to solve new things which we haven't done before. Wind and solar alone won't be enough. We just started geothermal and Nevada. We will be investing in newer technologies, including carbon capture. It's a...",https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dp8PhLsUcFE,5462,2022-10-22 02:43:20
17057," for. Wind and solar alone won't be enough. We just started geothermal and Nevada. We will be investing in newer technologies including carbon capture, etc. over time. So that's what excites me. We are a technology company at heart. So part of there are many answers to this problem. Some of it is that we are going to have to innovate our way out of it. And you know, we want to push as hard as possible in doing that. Our Bloomberg New Economy Forum is happening this year in Singapore and the Asia Pacific region is one of the fastest growing internet economies on the planet. Where do you see the most room, the most opportunity for Google to grow there? You know, it's such a fitting time frame. You know, I'm glad you're focused on the region. It's the most vibrant region we see. It's our 20th year since we opened our office in Tokyo. It was the first office outside the Bay Area. You have two and a half billion people on the internet. There are many areas in which they are leapfrogging trends which are here and embracing the future. Digital payments is a great example. So many of our products originated from APAC, Google Maps, Google Pay. A lot of our journey to bring computing to more people is playing out in Asia as well. I am excited about also the work we are doing through cloud because the companies that are rapidly transforming themselves digitally. So a chance to provide that is something very exciting for us. So super dynamic region. I feel like we are learning as Google being in the region. And so I think it'll transform the first 10 years I would have said we took products here and brought it to APAC over the past few years. We're beginning to build things there. And some of our future global products will be APAC first and rest of the world later. You can't talk about APAC without talking about China. And you're facing stiff competition from Chinese tech giants there and beyond. What should US policymakers know about competing with China? There's a lot of conversations about US and China, the competition is fierce. Many of the cadet areas like AI and quantum computing where we are investing a lot. Chinese companies are neck to neck. What I think about, you know, was encouraged by the news coming out of Glasgow about the US-China agreement on climate. To me, while we talk about all the areas where we are competing, some of the biggest areas which are common challenges for all of humanity. The pandemic was one. AI and AI safety over time will be a shared one. Obviously sustainability is another area like that. So I think these are all areas in which the countries can come together. And so I think that's a way by which we think about as, you know, when we compete on the internet and there may be different versions of how the internet plays out. So I see opportunities both sides. What are the chances that Google search will ever come back to China? Or that Google Cloud would ever come to China? Today we don't provide most of our signed-in services in China. I don't see that changing. But you know, there are ways, as I said, in areas like AI or sustainability. I think there'll be opportunities for us to work together. Through Cloud, we will support multinational companies which have presents everywhere. And so maybe there are opportunities to work that way as well. AI is advancing at an astonishing rate. And it is hard to understand sometimes what this really means. In concrete terms, how will our lives look different? Let's say 10 years from now as a result of AI. You know, done correctly, you know, in many ways it's going to be helpful to you. You'll take it for granted. The same way today, for example, in India, over one third of the queries on many phones come through voice. That is something people take for granted. You can do it. So over time you'll expect to speak and be able to understand any language in the world. And you know, those are all ways it's going to make it better. You may go to a doctor's office and go through a scan. And the system may be prioritizing for the radiologist so that they don't miss some important things, maybe giving them a second opinion. You know, so these are all ways in which it will seamlessly start playing a role. And I think we'll you know, we'll see that if it's a problem.",https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dp8PhLsUcFE,5463,2022-10-22 02:47:33
17058," They don't miss some important things, maybe giving them a second opinion. So these are all ways in which it will seamlessly start playing a role and I think we'll see that if it's a fact. You mentioned if done correctly and there are concerns, there are fears that AI will replicate the worst of society even under Google's own roof from your own researchers. What scares you most about AI? What keeps you up at night? It's the most profound thing we are working on as humanity and anytime you're developing technology there is a dual site to it. I think the journey of humanity is harnessing the benefits while minimizing the downsides. The good thing with AI is it's both going to take time. I think I've seen more focus on the downsides early on than most of the technology we've developed. So in some ways I'm encouraged by how much concern there is and you're right even within Google, people think about it deeply, we publish a lot of research. I think it's more important that there are outside academic institution, governments, nonprofits looking at this issue as well. So I think it'll be an issue which will have a lot of attention which gives me a lot of comfort as well. You said you'd pick up some new hobbies in the pandemic. How did you start? Cooking pizza, just learning cook which I was never good at. A little bit better. It's warm. You have presided over Google's full-missive social movements that reverberated in and outside the company. What have you learned as CEO since the walkout? For me, it was a moment. I think it changed the company for the better. We've always been committed. It gave us an insight on what more we could do. We undertook deep commitments. And the biggest overall diversity and inclusion, I think. If you're committed and you actually put in the effort behind it, you can make a difference. Now we have stated clear goals. We are on track to meet those goals. But it forced us to think about new answers. So for example, tech companies used to talk about the pipeline problem. But we are now going to places where the talent is. We are working much harder. So going to Atlanta, going to DC, going to Chicago, going to New York. That's improving our diversity and representation at all levels. The war for talent is even more competitive now in this new world. What are you offering? Elon Musk has said, big tech is a place where talent goes to die. How do you respond to that? Okay. I look at the fact that we are looking to hire 30,000 people next year. I look at the impact we have on many people.",https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dp8PhLsUcFE,5464,2022-10-22 02:52:05
17059," on to that. Okay. I look at the fact that, you know, we are looking to hire 30,000 people next year. I look at the impact we have on many people coming and working in the latest cutting edge things. And many people come in, people leave Google. We are proud of people who have left Google that are, I think there are over 2,000 companies that have been started by whom we call as supers. I'm equally proud of that, right? I think we are one part of a big, big system. And, you know, I think I think I'm proud of the role we play in bringing in people and the impact they have over time and outside world. All right. That's most of the heavy stuff out of the way. We're going to do some rapid fire just to get to know you a little bit better. You said you'd pick up some new hobbies in the pandemic. What did you start? You know, pizza, cooking pizza, just learning to cook, which I was never good at. I've gotten a little bit better. Cricket or soccer slash football? Wow. Stuff. Both. Please don't make a quiz. Okay. Squid game or Ted Lasso? I watched both. The Ted Lasso is much more calm. And so I'd rather take Ted Lasso over-scoot games any day. I know you're a voracious reader. So what's the last good book that you read? You know, I've been on a podcast binge. So a lot more podcasts than books nowadays. Okay. Favorite videos you watch on YouTube with your kids? A lot of music videos, music videos. This whole notion where creators are watching other things and commenting on it. It's a trend which my kids are really into. And I've kind of gotten used to it now. So, you know, watching other games. It's a fact. It's a phenomenon. Screen time policy that's worked for you as a parent. And what's not worked? You know, I've kind of given agency to my kids. The only thing I tell them is that I can look at their digital well-being once in a while with them. And so. How do you do that? I asked them to show it to me and they show it on their phones. So, you know, so that's pretty much the only thing. So beyond that, you know, it's agency and, and, you know, talking to them about it and making sure we are spending time doing other things. And making sure they develop good habits, basically. Metaverse or real world? Done correctly. You know, you shouldn't feel and feel the need to make a choice. You know, you always want to be present in the real world. And when you feel the need to do something, you want to do that. But, you know, I do think presence and the realness of the real world will end up mapping for humans for a long time. Do you own any crypto? I wish I did. I've dabbled in it, but, you know, in and out. In and out. Okay. Larry and Sergey, I'm not going to make you choose. How many times a week do you talk to them? You know, I talk to them regularly. You know, it kind of ebbs and flows. You know, and so there are times we get excited about something and we spend a lot of time talking it through, but it depends on, you know, what would I need? A piece of advice you wish you had in your 20s and a piece of advice you wish you had in your 40s. 20s would be, you know, being patient. You know, I think when you're young, you're very impatient, which is a great thing. But sometimes you do amazing things by slowing down and being really focused and doing it over a period of time. And so I would advise the young, you know, the younger version of me to be more patient. Maybe at 40, I would say, you know, when I look at climate, you know, I want all of us to be impatient. So, you know, I feel like when there's an urgency towards something, I think the world needs to be impatient. So that's the advice I would give to a older version of me. How much do you personally wrestle with the decisions that you have to make? And how much longer do you see yourself being the CEO of alphabet, not just alphabet, but also Google? Yeah. On the first one, there are moments we all have to make tough decisions and, you know, in some decisions way on me. And, but I, it's a privilege to do it. I have very good people helping me think things through. So I think the combination makes it all, you know, fine. On the second thing, I am, look at it, I'm so energized by the things we need to do. You know, I didn't have much access to computing growing up. It changed my life a lot. It's the one.",https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dp8PhLsUcFE,5465,2022-10-22 02:56:21

17061," Music Music Music Music Music Music Music Music Jeff Bezos shocked the world when he stepped down a CEO of Amazon. Less shocking was his choice for successor. Annie Jassy was not only one of his longest tenured lieutenants but the architect of Amazon's multi-billion-dollar cloud business, Amazon Web Services, a moonshot that helped transform Amazon into not just e-commerce but enterprise juggernaut. Jassy then needed to find his own successor, tapping a former colleague who helped grow AWS in its earliest days but had since left to run Seattle software giant Tableau. His job to continue the reinvention of AWS and in turn Amazon. Joining me on this edition of Bloomberg Studio 1.0, new AWS CEO Adam Salipski. Music He worked for AWS for 11 years and then went on to become CEO of Tableau Software in 2016. Then you get a call from Amazon to come back and run AWS as CEO. Tell me about that call. Well, I was having a one-on-one at my prior company and my Apple news alerts went off like everybody else did and it's at Jeff Bezos. He's taking on a new role and Andy Jassy is taking on the CEO role of Amazon. And of course Andy and I worked shoulder to shoulder about 20 feet apart for 11 years. Of course I reached out and congratulated him and we started talking and the conversation turned to some of the possibilities. And next thing I know a little while later here I am back at Amazon absolutely delighted and honored to be the CEO of AWS and helping to shepherd this amazing business for our customers. In that process did you talk to Jeff as well? Yeah, I had some communication but it was you know principally with Andy who of course was you know knew the AWS business best and of course it's taking on the CEO role. But yeah, there was you know contact as you might expect with a small handful of other people. So what did Andy tell you he wanted in the next chapter for AWS? Andy reminded me not that I needed reminding but that it has really still day one for AWS and for our customers. It is still so early in this business and we shouldn't think that just because the business has grown rapidly or just because we're currently the leader in the in the cloud that it's anything close to mature. And so he really reminded me that we have to stay hungry innovate as quickly as we ever have done in the past. You're about half a year into the job. What changed while you were gone that surprised you? Well I think that so many more customers have really adopted the cloud and really decided that they're going all in. So I mean it was a pretty decent sized business when I left but it's really grown and the customer base is really expanded. And so now we have very deep relationships at the CEO level, the CIO level across it.",https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dp8PhLsUcFE,5467,2022-10-22 03:04:50
17062," really grown and the customer base is really expanded and so now we have very deep relationships at the CEO level, the CIO level across every country, every industry, every use case and we're regularly interacting with the most senior people at our client organizations. So you were working at real networks in the early 2000s and I understand you were offered a job at AWS without even really knowing what it was. I guess AWS was in stealth mode. Well it was very secret. So it was it was it was hard that you know the company didn't want to talk too much about it but of course you know we had to talk a certain amount about it. So the call I got went something like we have this initiative to turn the guts of Amazon inside out and expose it to other people and it sounded intriguing although I confess I didn't fully understand what that was all about. So I came in and started talking to Andy and a few of the other senior leaders and eventually to Jeff and I would have to say that even by the time I took the job I thought I mostly understand what they're talking about and it sounds like a good idea and I'm in but I also was like well you know we'll just have to see how it goes and you know Amazon's a big big place and so I think we got a lot of a lot of intent to succeed here and that's the thing that impressed me was Amazon really had the desire and the intent and the belief that this could be a really good business. AWS comes out of stealth mode and is the first to market with a cloud infrastructure service in 2006. How important was that first start and do you think AWS still has an advantage today because of that? I think the the time to market advantage that we had which was probably honestly five to seven years had start before other companies really started to take this seriously was in a norm frankly it was just one of the biggest things that happened to us in the early years because at the beginning a lot of people didn't get it I would get asked a lot in 2006 so what does this have to do with selling books? And I mean I had a slide with kind of a pile of books on it and a question mark next to it and the answer was it has nothing to do with selling books but the technology which enables us to sell books being global being at a massive scale being secure being low cost being highly perform it all that technology has everything to do with offering these types of services externally. Now AWS isn't a scrappy startup anymore and you do have big rivals even though AWS is still the leader Microsoft and Google are big rivals. How do you make sure that being big doesn't slow you down? It's a great question big we are currently the leader and I mean depending on which you know third party you you you you look at we're probably a little bit more than twice as big as as number two and it's really important to continue to act as if you know we're insurgents and to be insurgents and not to start to act like incumbents and I like to talk about actually managing the business we want our senior leaders to be managing product and managing customers and I think as you get bigger and you put more and more layers into your company it's all too frequent that you start managing math you start managing ratios and percentages and growth and I think it's it's a real disease if you if you stray away from really focusing in a deep way on the product you're building and in a deep way on what your customers are telling you and so we try and organize both with our org structure as well as just with with our culture and what we choose to focus on and really making sure that everybody is thinking about one or both of those two things product and customers and if you keep even the most senior leaders engaged at that level then all of a sudden you you maintain the urgency and you keep acting like an insurgent we got to feel that urgency every day so keep acting like an insurgent that's the motto absolutely and structure yourself and build a culture that allows you to it's one thing to say it but it's easy to say it but it's much harder to put in place enabling mechanisms that enable you to do so and we focus a lot of effort on those mechanisms now do you think the cloud keeps getting bigger and that AWS and Microsoft and Google just get bigger pieces of an ever expanding pie or at some point doesn't become a zero some game and that fight for market share becomes more brutal and more bloody well I mean this is a very large market segment if you look at global IT spend it's it's in the trillion",https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dp8PhLsUcFE,5468,2022-10-22 03:09:14
17063," that fight for market share becomes more brutal and more bloody. Well, this is a very large market segment. If you look at global IT spend, it's in the trillions of dollars. I've seen estimates like $3 trillion. It doesn't really matter how many trillions it is. It's very, very large. And we've always believed that this was too good a market segment opportunity for the really to only be one winner. And sure enough, you've seen robust competition emerge and we all compete vigorously. But it is the segment is just growing so rapidly that I think, really for us, we believe that the winning business strategy for a long time to come and I would maintain forever is to focus not on the competitors, but to focus maniacally on customers and wake up every day understanding exactly what it is that they need us to build next and then work backwards from there, back internally to how can we build those things. And if we do the best job at building the most quickly, the things that are most important for our customers, then I'm really not worried about what the competitors will do. You worked 10 feet away from Andy Jassy in the early days. Tell us something about the Amazon CEO that no one knows, but you. You're going to get me in trouble, aren't you? Yeah. Yeah. You worked 10 feet away from Andy Jassy in the early days. Tell us something about the Amazon CEO that no one knows but you. You're going to get me in trouble aren't you? We has, you know, I grew up in Seattle and Andy coming from New York has this fascination I don't understand with New York sports teams so I've had to endure that for a lot of years. New Yorkers, yeah. So what are you going to do? Although he's, you know, he's I think come to adopt some of the Seattle teams, particularly the new hockey team, the Kraken here. As he should. As he should exactly. So how do you expect Andy will be different from Jeff or how has Andy already been different from Jeff? Well, I think, you know, we're all different as leaders. I think it's all important that we it's important that we all bring our own stamp to it and operate within ourselves. I don't think I would be a very good Andy. I don't want to presume but I would assume that Andy wouldn't be a great Jeff because you know, Jeff's Jeff, Andy's Andy and I'm me. So I think that Andy was certainly bringing a great depth of experience from AWS which is, you know, one important part of the business and we'll having operated that business for so long and I expect that'll also give him an opportunity although he was involved in other parts of Amazon certainly for a number of years. We'll be able to bring a fresh perspective to the whole company just as I hope.",https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dp8PhLsUcFE,5469,2022-10-22 03:13:36
17064," Cheerio, though, he was involved in other parts of Amazon certainly for a number of years, will be able to bring a fresh perspective to the whole company just as I hope to bring to AWS. And I think that fresh perspective is often helpful, I think, just the mere act of change is useful for the business, for customers, for employees, and just to shake things up a little bit. So I think just a fresh perspective. How will you be different from Andy? Well, I think that the world around us is changing so much that we're going to have to be different. It doesn't matter what we did yesterday, and right after I joined we actually added two new leadership principles, which is very exciting. One's around striving to be Earth's best employer, and the second around focusing on the fact that success and scale bring broad responsibility. And those are things about which I personally am very passionate, and so I really personally look forward to digging in and helping the company to figure out what are those things that we have to figure out, where can we innovate to be Earth's best employer, and then also to figure out externally, what can we do to really be great citizens of our local communities, to be great citizens of our national communities, and to be great citizens of the global community. And I care a lot about those things, as a lot of other people do here, but I plan to put a good amount of energy and time and focus and hopefully help Amazon innovate in all of those areas. How closely do you work with Andy Day-to-Day? Does he regularly weigh in on AWS decisions or not? Well, he's got a pretty broad scope of things to worry about now, so he's got a pretty intense day job, I believe. So he's really focused across the company as you would expect him to be. But that being said, obviously, AWS remains an important part of Amazon, and so we touch base regularly, be it in person or via email, just on the most important things going on in the business. Does Jeff ever weigh in on AWS decisions? Yes, I mean, really from the beginning, Jeff was involved at the very, very beginning at some of the most fundamental decisions. How do you price EC2? What do you name S3? What does the detail page look like? Obviously, over time, the business grew. Jeff was always available when we needed him, and I certainly anticipate that'll be the same going forward. So is he still available now? What do you understand that Jeff's priorities are? Sure. Well, let Jeff speak to his own priorities, but certainly, Jeff has been available when, for example, we've been doing our annual planning cycle as many companies have. It's been great to have Jeff weigh in on really where we're heading for the next year and beyond, and to just make sure it's easy to get focused on the details of the business, and it's great to have multiple people who can help you pick your eyes up a little bit. Now, you joined AWS in the middle of a pandemic. You came back to AWS in the middle of a pandemic. That's hopefully moving into the rear view mirror. Moderna is one of AWS's biggest customers. If it weren't for the cloud, if it weren't for AWS, would we have had a vaccine as quickly as we did? I've got to tell you, I'm Ios, but it's been an absolute privilege for us to work with Moderna because what they're doing, obviously, is literally life-saving, and they've been so innovative and so creative. So, Moderna took a drug development process to get to a vaccine candidate. That process would typically have taken them 20 months. And doing that on AWS in conjunction with all the innovation on their side, reduced that 20 months to 42 days. 42 days to get the vaccine candidate, the mRNA vaccine candidate for COVID-19. And that was really running multiple parts of Moderna on AWS. So if you look at the drug design part, they had their drug design studio running on AWS, all the way to manufacturing with the new digitized manufacturing that they call their digital manufacturing platform. So it's really end to end and the ability to use massive amounts of resources and to pick the exact type of service and capability for each part of the job and to really bring the full set of resources to bear. In addition to not having to focus on the IT and the infrastructure and the technology, and rather letting Moderna focus on the all important.",https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dp8PhLsUcFE,5470,2022-10-22 03:17:55
17065," bring the full set of resources to bear. In addition to not having to focus on the IT and the infrastructure and the technology, and rather letting Moderna focus on the all-important job of drug discovery. So working in partnership, it was just magnificent to see what they accomplished. Since you joined AWS, a number of longtime AWS leaders have moved on. To Microsoft, to Stripe, to Tableau, does that concern you? Well, actually, retention has been very good. If you mentioned the senior leaders, if you look at the VP Plus ranks, the VP and above ranks at Amazon, the average tenure is over a decade, over 10 years. So that's actually very, very strong retention. So of course, you're always going to have some level of people coming and people going, and at the end of the day, that's actually healthy for the business. You want new perspectives to come in. Of course, in the right proportion. Amazon has opened an investigation after 550 employees supported a petition, claiming a culture of discrimination, harassment, bullying, and bias. What's the status of this? Well, we are incredibly focused, and I personally believe it's incredibly important to really have a very diverse, inclusive, and equitable environment. And we're going to make sure that whatever it takes, that we've got that. So we believe that we're really doing a lot of things to deliver on that. And we've got a lot of innovative efforts around bringing in a diverse workforce, which we have to have both because we're going to serve our customers best, they're diverse. We have to match that diversity. And also, I just believe it's our responsibility, and it's the right thing to do. Any time there is any possibility that things are not, something is not on the way we wanted to. We're going to investigate it thoroughly. That's what we're doing in this case, and we'll make sure that we're operating in a way that's consistent with our values, and that's always the only goal. If you could rewind to the early 2000s, the earliest days of AWS, is there anything you would have done differently to build an inclusive culture, to start with a more inclusive culture, to make sure that it didn't become a boys club? Well, I don't think that's what we have. I think that we do have a really fun, exciting, innovation-led and inclusive culture. And that being said, these are hard problems. I think we've done a lot, but we are nowhere close to where we need to be. We're going to be restless and dissatisfied with our progress on DE and I, just as we are with every other part of our business. Mark Zuckerberg is making a big bet on the metaverse. How big do you think it's going to be? Such an interesting sense. The metaverse is real.",https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dp8PhLsUcFE,5471,2022-10-22 03:22:28
17066," AWS has the biggest trove of sensitive corporate data in the world. I'm curious how you think about the balance between data and privacy and freedom and civil liberties in the modern era. I mean, there are governments. There are nation states around the world that want that information, hackers and criminals want that information. Well, we are very clear to start with that. Our first job is security. We often say security is job zero. It was on the first page of our operating plan pretty much every year, every year that I can remember. But what about when governments request that information? So, subpoena that information? Sure. Well, we are very clear that our customers' data is their data. So the data belongs to our customers. So not everybody operates that way. We are not going to look at customers' data. We are not going to compete against our customers using their data. Their data is their data. And furthermore, we have all sorts of architectural best practices that our customers should be and are using for any sensitive data. And so a lot of that really relies around encryption. And so we build a lot of different encryption capabilities. So that any sensitive data, which could leak for any reason, be it to a government, be it to a hacker, be it to anyone else, any form of security breach, that it's encrypted and useless to anybody else. Given the broad array of encryption solutions that we provide, it's actually very doable and powerful for our customers to safeguard their data that way. Mark Zuckerberg is making a big bet on the metaverse. Is AWS going to have a role in the metaverse? I think AWS already has a big role in the metaverse. So I think the cloud enables the metaverse. So if you think about all of the compute capacity, all of the storage, all of the machine learning, which is required to create, compelling and delightful end user experiences in the metaverse, a lot of that is already today running on AWS. So if you take Epic Games, for example, so Epic Runs Fortnite, you know, massive popular game, 350 million users worldwide and Epic Runs, almost everything on AWS from the backend, servers to the analytics and everything in between. So I think that's a great example of the metaverse at work and all that's happening today on AWS. And we anticipate that's only going to grow really rapidly in the future. How big do you think it's going to be? Such an interesting sentence, the metaverse is real and yet it's virtual at the same time. I think that if we continue to do what we've always done, which is to provide a technology platform that allows organizations to transform, then these gaming and entertainment and social media and other companies will be able to do what they do best, which is to focus on innovating on behalf of their end users. And I think that the metaverse in many other areas will be rich with invention. So this next conversation will happen in the spheres, in the metaverse. That's where we'll next meet. That can be on me, on me, on me, on the metaverse. All right, see you there. Now, I know that climate change, you know, and stopping climate change and your data center footprint is a big passion of yours. How fast will Amazon's data centers get to carbon neutral? Amazon is already the largest purchaser of renewable energy in the world. And we intend to be 100% renewable energy by the year 2025. We originally said 2030. We actually accelerated that by five years to 2025. That's part of our broad or climate pledge that Amazon created, and to which we've now gotten 200 other organizations to sign on to. And the climate pledge is to be a net zero carbon by 2040, 10 years ahead of the Paris Accord target. So we know how to do some of that. Other part are going to require invention, but we really look forward to it. And I think it's one of the most important things we can do for our generation. Amazon counts some of the biggest oil and gas producers as its customers. Isn't that a contradiction? Should you be kicking them off your platforms?

17067," for our generation. Amazon counts some of the biggest oil and gas producers as its customers. Isn't that a contradiction? Should you be kicking them off your platforms? Those customers are trying to get to sustainable business models which rely on new energy sources. And so many of those customers are figuring out how do they get to wind, how do they get to solar, how do they get into batteries, all new business models relying on renewable energy. And I think rather than abandoning them and having them maybe dig in more on fossil fuels, if we can enable them to move faster, to be more innovative, and to be more agile in figuring out new business models, new technical solutions, experimenting, failing fast, and moving on to the next next idea, then the whole world will get to the renewable energy solutions that we need. At this year's re-invent conference, it'll be the first time that Andy Chassie is not giving the keynote. You will be, give us a preview. What can we expect to hear? We're going to have a lot of really exciting announcements. So I think across our service portfolio, you'll see that. We have a lot of exciting partner announcements. The partner ecosystem still remains to this day so important to what AWS is doing and we have some great announcements lined up for that. And then I think people are going to want to see that we're making it easier and easier for them to consume the cloud and to work with AWS. And so we're going to continue to, in addition to building more powerful basic capabilities, we're going to continue to make it easier and easier in a variety of ways to interact with AWS.

17068," Those to become a one-click journey to the center of the zeitgeist, pop culture, and kid culture. Amplifying some of the brightest and sometimes darkest traits in all of us. While YouTube has elevated a generation of creators and educated and entertained generations of viewers, it's fought misinformation, terrorism, racism, and violence many clicks along the way. Currently, YouTube's biggest battles are focused on eliminating COVID and vaccine misinformation and keeping the platform safe for kids and teens. On this edition of Bloomberg Studio 1.0, we rewind to talk about where YouTube has been and fast forward to where it's going next, with one of the longest tenured employees and women at Google, the CEO of YouTube, Susan Wajitski. It's been five years since we last talked on camera and we have a new president. We are weathering a pandemic. The most watched video on YouTube is... Baby Shark? Baby Shark. So, a lot's changed since 2016. How do you feel about YouTube 2021 versus 2016? I feel good about it. It's definitely been a while and technology things moved so quickly, so a lot of things have changed since 2016. And overall, I've been really pleased that we've continued to grow and grow our ecosystem of creators. We've invested a lot in responsibility and that's been a really big focus for us. With weather through a pandemic and a lot of hard challenges, but overall, I'm feeling really good. You've been at Google for 20 plus years going all the way back to Larry and Sergey. In the garage, you've been the CEO of YouTube for seven plus years. How has your job changed in that time? Since I joined being the CEO of YouTube, I would say one of the biggest things that has changed, certainly, has just been maybe the recognition of the importance of digital video. So, when I first joined, actually a lot of people would say, oh, like, why did you join? I was running ads beforehand and that's been the main way Google generates revenue. And so a lot of people said, like, why did you leave that and go to YouTube? But I always believed in digital video and I believe that now we see that the world also believes we've seen a lot of adoption of digital video and the benefits that that can have. You've championed this diversification strategy at YouTube since you started. What's working and what's not working? Well, our main way of generating revenue is from advertising. But we also have really grown our subscription revenue and that has been really, really important from many different reasons. So that has enabled our users to have an experience where they can have music, YouTube music, and premium. We just announced the 50 million subscribers that we were really excited about. But we also see other ways that our creators generate revenue. So our creators, for example, generate revenue with channel subscription. They may sell merchandise. We also have things like digital goods, so like super chat, super thanks. And so we've basically diversified the number of ways that our ecosystem is generating revenue. The original tagline for YouTube was broadcast yourself and that concept has exploded. You have ordinary people in the spotlight. When they grow up, they want to be an influencer. They want to be a YouTube star or a YouTube creator. What do you see as the future of the creator economy? I see a lot of possibility with the creator economy and because I see that many people have a lot of interest and they have a lot to offer. And beforehand, they went up and able to have shared that with the world. And so there are so many people depending upon what their talent or their interest is, whether it's a sport or cooking or gaming or hairstyles that people have come out and really been able to share that and create a lot of jobs. So we actually see, like our, we actually saw a 35% increase in the number of creators that are generating six-figure income out of YouTube. And in the last year. And so that's just an example of like how the creator economy is continuing to grow. And for years, YouTube was the only company that actually paid creators. But now a lot of companies are paying creators. OK.",https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dp8PhLsUcFE,5474,2022-10-22 03:35:24
17069," example of like how the creator economy is continuing to grow. Well, and for years, YouTube was the only company that actually paid creators, but now a lot of companies are paying creators. You know, Facebook and Instagram, snap, TikTok. How do you see that competition playing out? Who wins? Well, it is a competitive landscape. And in general, I mean, competition's good. It makes everyone work harder and that's good. I mean, we look at creators and we say, they're going to come to us. If we do the best job and creators come to us looking basically for fame and fortune, like, how can I, I have a skill or I have a talent, something I want to share with the world like, and YouTube can help that be known, can help them provide that fame, but also we can generate revenue for them. And so as long as we're doing a good job of that, creators are going to come to us. If we start to fail, then they're going to leave us and they're going to go to another platform. And so we just need to work really hard to make sure that we deliver that for our creators. A year ago during the Black Lives Matter protest, YouTube made big commitments to Black creators in particular. What's been the progress there? And how do you see YouTube, the potential for YouTube to be used as a tool for social justice? Well, so we've made an announcement that we were going to do a $100 million Black Voices Fund. And so we're continuing to develop content there. But one of the other thing, and I think there'll be a, there's been a lot of great content that's come out and we'll certainly see more. But you know, because YouTube doesn't have any gatekeepers, like you can just post and become a creator, you know, we've, we have seen a lot of people of different backgrounds and underrepresented backgrounds become creators and have audiences. We never really measured it beforehand because we didn't have a way. And so one of the things that we've done is we've enabled creators to now tell us what backgrounds they affiliate with. So we can have a better understanding of how they're doing on our platform. Let's talk about YouTube shorts. It seems to be a top priority. Yeah, we all know that TikTok is on the rise. How important are YouTube shorts to the platform to the company? So YouTube shorts, it's very important. We see that creators and users want to watch all types of content, long form, short form. It turns out that the first video that was actually ever uploaded to YouTube, me at the zoo was an 18 second video. So it was a short form video. And what we have lots of short form is and we've had it way before TikTok did. But what we have really been leaning into more is just enabling those to be found. And then a lot of the creation tools. And so bringing a lot more mobile creation is really important for us going forward. Did you notice that viewing time was being lost to TikTok? Did you see that trend? And do you see TikTok as a sort of existential threat? I mean, we definitely see many competitors in this space. What we're just focused on are our own metrics. Like do we see our users engaging? Where's our opportunity? We're always looking around and seeing what our competitors are doing. And if they're doing something that we think would be good for our users and our creators, we're also going to look at how we can improve our own economy, create our economy and what's good for our users. I think a lot of people, you know, we talk about vaccine hesitancy and they blame social media. They say YouTube's not doing enough. One of the big things for us is to continue to work with public health experts to get their messages across.",https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dp8PhLsUcFE,5475,2022-10-22 03:39:45
17070," Music Today's your big day. Are you excited? Mama is tired. This is Peter Plarr. You have to feed your creativity. So this tree house, you guys ready for the movie? See what we can do. At this point, YouTube has become a hub for discovery, for information, for, you know, it satisfies our curiosities, right? That comes with a lot of inspiration, but also with misinformation. When it comes to vaccines, vaccine hesitancy, videos that cause a public health risk, where do you want to see YouTube do better? We've taken responsibility very seriously. It's been one of my top priorities. So first of all, we want to make sure that if there's information that violates our policies, we came up with 10 different policies around COVID. Then if that's a violation of policies, then that's something that will remove. We removed over a million videos associated with COVID. But we also want to make sure that we're raising up information that we think would be, that come from trusted and authoritative sources. And we've really been able to do that. I think a lot of people, you know, we talk about vaccine hesitancy and they blame social media. They say YouTube's not doing enough, you know, how do you respond to that? Yeah, I mean, I think, first of all, we're always learning. I just, just to be fair, like we're always thinking about how can we do better? We're looking at the feedback and working with public health experts across the board. And, you know, I think one of the big things for us is to continue to work with public health experts to understand, you know, what are the ways that we can partner with them to get their messages across. And I really believe that that is something that's really changed is the, is the evolution of bringing creators, musicians, experts talking about public health. We never would have seen that before in the pandemic. How much do you internalize the criticism of YouTube's content? Do you take it personally? And how does that influence the decisions that you make as CEO? I want to be doing the right thing. And I care about that. I care about the legacy that we leave. I care about the world that we leave to our children. I care about how media is consumed by the next generation and by everyone today. And so, I really have put a lot of time and effort to make sure that we are acting responsibly. And there's always a balance between the free speech and the, right, but being responsible and taking down content that we think could lead to some kind of real-world harm. And so, I mean, sure, I think whenever you're in a position like that, there's going to be a lot of criticism. But our goal is just to continue to talk to experts and evolve. And how do you make decisions in those tough moments where it's a tough call? Like, how much of it is making a decision or leading by consensus and how much does it come down to you? The goal is that when we have tough decisions, they're not, we're not, they are the only ones that are in the world. They are like improvising in some way. Like, we've made a concrete set of decisions beforehand and then we're looking and saying, is this something that meets our standards? Is it a violation or not a violation? And if it seems like there's some set of issues with the content that we have on the platform, we're going to go back to experts and then reevaluate. Should we be making changes to our policies? YouTube helped keep a generation of children connected, educated, and entertained, distracted through the pandemic. What have you learned from that experience and what do you see as the potential future of YouTube as a tool for learning, as a tool in schools? When I meet people and they find out I'm the CEO of YouTube, almost always, they tell me about something they learned on YouTube or someone that they're something their family member learn. So I see that as being a very significant part of YouTube. And during the pandemic, we certainly saw that a lot more education went online.",https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dp8PhLsUcFE,5476,2022-10-22 03:43:55
17071," when they're something their family member learn. So I see that as being a very significant part of YouTube. And during the pandemic, we certainly saw that a lot more education went online. And we had all the homeschooling. We had people who had to also just learn a lot of skills that they hadn't learned beforehand. But probably the biggest thing that we also learned was just and that I really saw was a need for us to continue to work with educational institutions. And the need for us to be able to integrate with some of the learning tools that the kids are all using because they are using YouTube. And there's a lot more that we can do to really help educators have you to be a key part of the curriculum. My kids are on YouTube a lot and sometimes more than I want them to be. And sometimes it's super productive. And they're learning something cool. And sometimes it's not productive at all. How are you innovating to make the time that kids spend on YouTube more valuable? And of course, safe. It's very important to me as a parent to make sure that we're giving parents options about how what they want their kids to see. And that's one of the reasons that pretty much as soon as I got to YouTube, we started working on YouTube kids, which is a separate app, which is important for kids in terms of how we can control the quality. And we can give parents a lot more control about what kind of content is appropriate for them and their family. And there are many other things. Like we actually just came out with a supervised experience for tweens because tweens was one of the age groups that was actually hardest. They usually don't want to be on the kids app. But they're not 13 to be on the main app. And so the supervised experience is something that we recently came out with. The Wall Street Journal has been doing some in-depth reporting on Facebook. The report is that Facebook knew that Instagram was toxic for teen girls and didn't do anything about it. Does YouTube look at the impact it has on teen users? The influence it might have on someone's body image or self-esteem? First of all, I think it's a very important topic. And we do have a panel of experts that we work with to be able to help us understand what are the different ways that our product could be used or how do we face some of these challenging issues to make sure that we're getting the best advice. And we certainly do see for a lot of really tough issues that YouTube can be a really valuable resource. So body positivity, mental health, we see a lot of creators actually talk about mental health. And that for a lot of kids, it's really, like, destigmatizes and enables people to talk about what's happening and what's going on with them. The potential long-term impacts of YouTube on teens and on children, whether it is toxic or whether it's addictive, is that something that you wonder about? Is that something that you struggle with not just as a CEO, but as a mom? We certainly want to make sure that we are doing what we can to be responsible with kids and in every way possible. And that's one of the reasons that we actually have worked hard to give parents as many options as possible for them to decide what is important for them and their family, whether that's, like, limiting screen time, like, limiting what is the content they actually have access to. I mean, even letting parents just say, these are, like, the 10 videos. My kid can only see these 10 videos. And so that is really important for us to give the tools back to parents for them to decide what is best for them and their family. Are you concerned about looming regulation? There may be regulation that is well-intended, but actually then has a really negative impact.",https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dp8PhLsUcFE,5477,2022-10-22 03:48:23
17072,"we I would like to begin by addressing the heinous attack. I'm the United States Capitol. Like all Americans, I am outraged by the violence, lawlessness, and mayhem. How much did President Trump test YouTube? And how much did it test you as a leader? Election integrity is something that we see incredibly, it's incredibly important, and we've leaned into, in every way we possibly can. We treat all public figures and all public leaders the same as we treat any individual. And so, meaning that everybody is held to the same standards. And so we definitely held President Trump as we would hold all other presidents and all other elected officials to the same standards that we hold our creators and anyone else on YouTube. But was that difficult for you as the CEO of the company? I mean, that's kind of, that's like a big responsibility. I mean, yeah, it is difficult, but it is very important. And we also are global. So we're dealing with leaders from all over the world. And there were a number of leaders that, and there continue to be a number of leaders that post or that there's content that may be a violation of our policies. But we do hold a consistent standard across everything that we do. YouTube was the last platform to ban Trump. And you have said, his channel will be reinstated when an elevated risk of violence has subsided. How and when specifically will you make that decision? Well, we'll make that decision based on a number of different factors, whether that is like events in the news, signals we're seeing from the government. And we'll certainly continue to evaluate that based on a large number of signals that we see. And will he ultimately be reinstated? I mean, we've stated that we will reinstate him when we believe that there is no risk to public safety or there are no public danger. Google just removed a voting app for Russian opposition leader, Alexi Navalny. The Russian government seems to be stepping up requests to take down content. You've talked in the past about your family history, your grandparents living behind the iron curtain being concerned about censorship back then. And Russia is a huge YouTube audience. How concerned are you about Russian government overreach? One of the things that is important to us at YouTube is the fact that we do enable so many voices and that we do enable people to express themselves and really celebrate the freedom of speech. And we certainly, that's a core value of ours. And but when we work with governments there are many things that we have to take in consideration. Like whether it's like local laws or what's happening on the ground. And so there's always gonna be multiple considerations that we're gonna have to take into consideration. Navalny said that YouTube deleted a video, one of his videos. Was that at the request of the Russian government? We certainly get requests from governments. And we look and consider what's, you know, why are we getting the request? What's actually happening on the ground? And based on a whole bunch of different factors we make a decision. So we don't always, those are not always requests that make sense for us to honor but uncertain cases, we will honor them in that country. The five administration seems to be targeting big tech. We've seen Mark Zuckerberg, we've seen Jack Dorsey now testify before Congresswoman.",https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dp8PhLsUcFE,5478,2022-10-22 03:52:32
17073," honor them in that country. The five administration seems to be targeting big tech. We've seen Mark Zuckerberg. We've seen Jack Dorsey now testify before Congress multiple times. And I've heard it said that YouTube is getting a pass. Do you think you should be up there testifying? Well, I think we do get a lot of scrutiny. I feel like there's a lot of scrutiny. And because YouTube is part of Google, Sundar has testified a number of different times and answered many different questions on YouTube. So I do believe there's a certain amount of scrutiny. And if I were ever asked to testify, I certainly would go and testify as well. You're one of the most senior women at Google. If not the most senior woman at Google, Google has faced a lot of scrutiny for how it treats women in recent years. How much progress do you think Google has made in hiring and promoting women across the company? And how much progress do you think still needs to be made? I see a really big effort across technology as a whole to be able to be more inclusive. And I think that is really positive. I've been a big supporter of it since the very beginning. And I mean, I think at Google, there are many efforts. And there's a lot of work that has been done. And I'm sure there's a lot more for us to continue to do. And if you just look at the stats, you can see they're not enough women. We need more women in technology. And I think we have made a lot of progress, but it's still hard. It's harder to be a woman in technology. It's harder to be a minority of any kind. And so I think there's still a lot of work for us to do. When we last spoke five years ago, I asked you about being a mom. You have five kids. And you said something that really stuck with me. You said being a mom makes me a better leader. I prioritize better. I see something growing fast. And I run towards that. If something's growing closely, I'm like, I don't have time for that. How has that management strategy played out for you? I think it's played out really well. Thank you, Sven. I mean, prioritization is everything when you look at it because we have a lot of opportunity. There's a lot of moving pieces, very dynamic environment. So if you can prioritize and say, these are the most important things to do, then you're going to get there faster. Larian Sargay have no left. How long do you plan to keep running YouTube? How long do you plan to stay at Google? As long as I have a mission that I believe in and that things that I'm excited about getting done. So I have a lot of ways that I see that YouTube can continue to grow. I have a lot of products and ideas and things that aren't yet released and things that aren't yet doing. And I'm excited about getting those done. So I think if there comes a time where I no longer have a list of projects or I feel like, I don't have that much more to add, then it'll probably be time to do something else. Would you throw your hat into the ring to be Alphabet's next CEO or if the board asked you, would you step up and do that? Well, I think Sundar's doing a great job. Very, very, please. I think he's doing, I mean, it's a very challenging job. There's a lot of different constituents and a lot of product, a lot of different issues. And I mean, I'll just say I'll always do whatever would be wherever I could be most helpful to the company. Do you still talk much to Larian Sargay? I do still see them socially though, not workwise. Do you ever talk about work? I mean, it's not necessarily casually, but our business is very complex right now. And there's a lot of things that are happening. And so it's hard for, I mean, people may have different opinions, but to really engage it's a long conversation. What do you want your legacy to be? I am proud of the way that we've been able to enable people to have a channel, to have an audience. Like I just met with a number of three creators. And like YouTube really was able to let them shine and create audiences into business and employ people that otherwise never would have happened. And so that's certainly one continuing to grow that. I'd say a second, it's been really important to me to see a lot more women in technology that has been just a personal goal of mine is to be a role model and try to support women. And I feel very fortunate to be have gotten to where I have. And I know it was due to like many different factors. And I want to support.",https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dp8PhLsUcFE,5479,2022-10-22 03:56:56

And I want to support the next generation of women and make see technology as like an open place where anyone can come and be successful.

Crypto like I think that that I think was more Last year I think it's kind of a wave that passed. No, I don't think so, but I think it's like Anytime that Frankly, it's when a lot of other people get into crypto right other audiences too It's when it's in the news a lot and when does that happen a lot of times when the prices are going up She was a federal prosecutor going after gangs and the mob before being handed for next assignment Taking down Bitcoin Katie Han soon realized this new technology was much more than a tool used by criminals She dove deep and became a crypto convert swapping her prosecutor hat for a board seat at Coinbase became the first female general partner adventure firm and recent Horowitz Han now a prolific crypto investor recently launched her own fun with one and a half billion dollars to deploy It's the largest fund ever raised by a single investor Joining me on this edition of Bloomberg Studio 1.0 CEO and founder of Han Ventures Katie Han Katie, it's so great to have you great to be back here in the studio with you Emily I want to start with a vibe check Okay What state of the crypto cycle are we in right now? It was hot. Yep, and then it got pretty cold Well, look Emily zooming back because I've been in crypto for a decade if you can believe it We've seen crypto be really hot and then all of a sudden not And so we've seen this before however I think one of the things that's a little bit different now is with each new crypto cycle more and more people come into it And so it's more and more pronounced each cycle and I I would push back on it's not I think it depends on what area of the ecosystem you're looking at We think developers think crypto and web3 is still really hot. I am seeing a lot less of those We're all gonna make it Hashtags. I'm seeing a lot less of them too. Although I am spending less time on Twitter. So maybe that's why as well But with each cycle there are There are new acronyms What hasn't happened is a crypto winter in the midst of kind of really serious global macro conditions So we have inflation kind of at record highs for our generation in our lifetime And then we have also a war that's broken out in the Ukraine and we have a number of other factors going on here So that's very different. There was some serious carnage out there. Yeah, socius Luna three hours. What's been your takeaways for more? I don't want to sit here and tell you that algorithmic stablecoins are bad because I actually think they're really interesting However, I think what happened is you had In this case you mentioned Luna and Tara, you know, that was an algorithmic stablecoin That was getting pretty widespread adoption Um relative to what the tech could do. I didn't realize you spent your teenage years living in Egypt and learning Arabic. Yeah, tell me about your upbringing. I was always Uprooted um my dad worked for a large company and we were always moving just when I would get comfortable in one space And I think actually that's pretty important if you fast-forward and look at my career I'm comfortable being in uncomfortable situations, you know, I was didn't know Uh, a lot about venture when I got into it initially I didn't know a lot about crypto when I got into it initially and I was okay asking questions I was okay not knowing the local acronyms or the nomenclature of a particular field and I'm you know I'm taken right back to my teenage years in Cairo moving from Houston, Texas one day To downtown Maddie in Cairo the next day you studied law. I did you clerked for Supreme Court Justice Anthony Kennedy That's right you became a federal prosecutor you were taking on prison gangs Yep, and the mafia. Mm-hmm. That must have taken a really thick skin. I was doing it at each 25 Um, and now I",https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dp8PhLsUcFE,5481,2022-10-22 04:05:37
17076," Taking on prison gangs and the mafia, that must have taken a really thick skin. I was doing it at age 25. And now if I kind of take a step back and you know, I think that happens at different points in your career. Like, whoa, if I would have analyzed that a little more at the time, and I'm kind of in some ways glad I didn't, I just dove right in, because I felt it fascinating. There was a human aspect to it, and people's stories, and I felt like those stories mattered. So I was drawn to criminal law and became a federal prosecutor, and I did cases involving violent crime, but then really mistrying cases, being back in the courtroom, being before the grand jury. Like, the prosecutor, you would see on TV going to try those murder cases. Doing those two hour closing arguments. That's right. And so moved out here to California. I died at the largest prison gang in the world at the time. Outlaw motorcycle gangs hostage taking bank robberies, armed bank robberies. There was really not a kind of criminal case by that point in my career. I hadn't done it. It was right around that time, 2012. One of my bosses came in and said, let's have that same energy that you brought to those gang cases, to those murder cases, and let's go ahead and have you investigate this new criminal technology that we really need to look into and possibly shut this down. So you created the first cryptocurrency task force. How would you describe it? Fortunately, several of us in the government realized at the time it's not possible, also not desirable, because Bitcoin is not an entity. It's not a person. It's a protocol. And it would be like saying, let's go shut down cash. Let's go shut down the internet. It's not possible. Probably wouldn't be a good idea either. I was using crypto and technologies like the Bitcoin blockchain, because that's all it existed then. This is 2012, 2013, to actually uncover criminal activity. So I didn't think that that technology was bad. Frankly, it was a tool that helped me uncover the various activity. And by the way, it was a step level function improvement better than compliance by banks. I'll just go ahead and say it. That's a little bit controversial, but I had spent a decade subpoenaing large financial institutions, and five times out of 10 didn't get back what I needed. One case I worked on and people always say, oh, you shut down the Silk Road. What actually happened? I was looking into something completely not having to do with anything at all of the Silk Road and came across some what looked to be some kind of odd activity. And it turns out that a couple of federal agents on the Silk Road Task Force out of Washington, DC were cropped. And that is the case that I ended up in dining and I ended up prosecuting those agents and they both went to prison. So that's the aspect of what the Silk Road case that I worked on. I would never, never have been able to uncover that criminal activity by those agents because they were federal agents, they knew how to cover their tracks. Had they not used Bitcoin blockchain. Right? So that technology right there, if they had just used wires or cash or bank wires, we would never have uncovered that. Just how hard is it to launch a crypto fund in front of scratch? Japan's critical role in the global economy is changing as the world recalibrates. Often decades of stagnation, Japan's leaders are forging a more innovative and sustainable path forward to revitalize the nation. Corporate giants, policymakers and pioneers tell us how they're doing just that. Every week on Japan ahead, right here on Bloomberg Television. So what's the best investment advice you've ever been given by anybody? The compound interest, the compounding of returns is an incredible miracle of business, finance and human existence. Everything you learn is additive every day and if you keep added and don't quit, it's an incredible miracle and it's not just interest.

In your observation of investors, what do you think is the biggest mistake that average investors make? Selling it the wrong time. And they sell when the prices go down? Yes, or yes. Not keeping, but people have conviction or if they invest for the right reasons, just keep at it. So you became kind of a crypto convert after this. You joined the board of Coinbase. That's right. Very early on. How did you and Coinbase and Brian Armstrong come together? I hosted an event here in San Francisco at the Federal Reserve Bank and believe it was there that it wasn't just Brian, it was a lot of what I'll call legitimate actors and crypto who wanted to usher in this new wave, this new ecosystem. And then we brought together the heads of all kinds of agencies, really in an effort to kind of talk about building bridges. You know, the government and the crypto industry were never going to see eye to eye on a lot of things, but we did think there were some commonalities. Coinbase is a company that has suffered. They've been losing share. The valuation of the public markets has plummeted. Why do you think that is and how do you think it can be fixed? Yeah, well, I think again a few things it's tied to. One, a large aspect of Coinbase's business now, of course, is trading revenue. And that's down when prices are down. And you know, the company's been very transparent about that long before going public. I mean, also if you look at its S1, it specifically identifies that. And just how volatile crypto cycles are. So I think that's part of it. It's judged by public markets as a technology stock or as a financial services company. By the way, I think it's both. I think it's not just a financial services company. I think it's so much more. I think it's really a portal to this whole new ecosystem. You were also on the board of OpenC until recently there's an insider trading situation or accusation going on there. Coinbase has also had employees accused of insider trading. How much is this happening within crypto companies and within the industry and how big a problem is? Yeah, I think crypto is under the microscope. So where you have a case, two cases, three cases in crypto ecosystem, which now is a trillion dollar industry. I think multi billion approaching trillion dollar industry, you're always going to be able to find examples like that. So I don't want to make too much out of a handful of cases. That said, the company, Coinbase, OpenC, take these things incredibly seriously. Along with your position at Coinbase, you became a partner at one of the most storied venture capital for insular convales. That is Andrews and Horowitz. What was your experience at A16Z? There I met Chris Dixon and I met Ben Horowitz and I met Mark Andreessen and I had worked with them for just about a year, maybe a little bit over when they asked me to come and co-run their crypto funds at AndreessenHorowitz. Again, I jumped at that chance and I think really that speaks to the fact that as I said before, things are a hell yes or there are no and it was a hell yes for me. So Andreessen Horowitz is the kind of place where if you make a partner you don't leave. How did Mark and Ben respond when you said, yeah, I want to leave to start a crypto fund of my own. As you might know Emily, they're an anchor. They're an anchor check into my fund and I'm very grateful for that. Mark and Chris and folks like them are also personal LPs. So I felt very supported when I shared that decision and I will say that it was not running away from AndreessenHorowitz. It was running to another opportunity and you know crypto is not what do they say it's not a spectator sport or it's like you're in it. It's very young. It's 24 seven. It's global and it's hustle and at this and that's a trade off. It's a life trade off and at this point in my career and in my life, if I was going to continue to make that trade off, I just wanted to do it and do it in a way that was really true to me. So you struck out on your own, yes, to launch on ventures, what gave you the courage to do that? What was the spark that lit the fire? Yeah, that got you to say, I need to do this and do this now. Sure. What I set out to do was to continue to invest in this ecosystem that I think is so broad that decision was very purposeful and the timing was very purposeful. We have an early stage fund that does seed stage series a even series B and then we have what we call an acceleration fund which is.",https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dp8PhLsUcFE,5483,2022-10-22 04:14:20
17078," Very purposeful and the timing was very purposeful. We have an early stage fund that does seed stage, series A, even series B, and then we have what we call an acceleration fund, which is not a growth fund. It's a crypto growth fund, and I think those are different things. But it's later stage. It might be crypto-publics, certain kinds of public tokens were set up to hold tokens and participate in the token ecosystem, or later stage companies. I mean, there are now several crypto, many crypto unicorns. Space has become really competitive. Even though you say, you know, crypto's had its ups and downs, the thing is, a lot of people in some of those last cycles have seen the kind of venture style returns that can be had in crypto. And so you've had a lot of new funds enter the space. And that's driven up competition. So what differentiates on ventures then? From all of these other crypto funds, or even the more traditional venture capitalists, like entries in Horowitz or Sequoia, they also have crypto funds now. Well, I think a lot of traditional venture capital funds now have crypto funds. It used to just be like a regulatory designation. It was like, are you an RIA, which is registered investment advisor? I would say for crypto founders today, it's not enough to just be an RIA, right? They, frankly, I don't even know if a lot of them care. That's a regulatory designation. What crypto founders today want to know is, do you live in Brith crypto? Do you inhale the discourse? Are you part of the community? Do you participate in governance? Are you going to be staking these kind of crypto verbs out there? And if you're not really in this space full time, I think it's very hard to run a successful crypto fund. We don't have a hedge fund component. So we're not sitting here buying and trading and selling. That's a hedge fund structure. And there are crypto hedge funds. We're not one. We're making seven to 10 year best. Just how hard is it to launch a crypto fund from scratch? You know, it's hard, but it's not impossible. We don't have a crystal ball. I don't know. I can't predict cycles. But I knew that we were in a cycle where you saw so much further an excitement around the space. And I already talked about what makes this different. But I think one thing also is we are a nimble strike force. We don't fish in the same pond. We have the crypto natives. We have a fish and execution. We have operators, seasoned operators, who really know how to stick the landing. And I think that's reflected on our culture. I would say the only thing that's changed in our strategy as a result of the market correction is really more of a focus on early stage. But we still have our late stage fund. And when we see valuations, which I think will still see correct, spoiler, I think we'll continue to see some corrections. And so we might deploy our later stage fund a little bit more slowly. It might not be on an even 50-50 cadence. And that's OK. Long-term, our strategy hasn't changed. Long-term, we're committed to this space. How much do you think valuations are going to correct? It's just I can't give you a one-size-fits-all answer because crypto is not a monolith. You have some crypto companies that really follow more of an enterprise-sass business model. You have others that are layer one protocols. You have still others that are consumer-facing applications. And I think one of the things we're seeing right now is the infrastructure layer. And that's where we're spending a lot of our time, by the way. And we think more and more use cases will come about when the infrastructure layers in place. So my own view is we are not rushing to deploy. We're certainly not getting caught up. We're going to get VC FOMO and have you not deploy that. You know, look, I think it's very easy to get into that mindset. It's because it's a competitive sport. It's a competitive space. And I think I'd be lying if I said that that doesn't influence anyone. I try to, what I do, and I think I do differently, is I try to take stock of that. Oh, that's the FOMO mentality kicking in. That's bad. Again, you don't want to over-correct, though. What we look for is we look for amazing founders. It doesn't matter if I think valuations will correct. If there are amazing founders, there's a huge tam. We also look for what's your regulatory plan. If you're launching a token, what's your plan to comply with the law? What's your plan for security, by the way? We've seen a lot of hacks in the space. We want to really dive in there and make sure that the founders have been thoughtful about, especially if they're cost-dating customer funds, keeping those funds secure. If it's a cross-chain bridge, what are the exploits? Have you changed your strategy at all, given the downturn? Have you backed out of any deals? We've decided not to do certain deals. Because the conditions have changed, don't you raise the fund? We have decided not to do certain deals. We've never backed out of any deals.",https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dp8PhLsUcFE,5484,2022-10-22 04:18:44
17079," Have you backed out of any deals or decided not to do certain deals? Because the conditions have changed, don't you raise the phone? We have decided not to do certain deals. We've never backed out of a deal. We have decided not to do a few deals because we think that pricing was ahead of progress candidly. And we might have been wrong about that, Emily. We might have been wrong about that. But I think if we were wrong not to do a couple of deals, better that we might have been right. Because if we were wrong about that, I think we can find a way to still invest in those projects later. Well, one thing I'm hearing is that a lot of dry powder has just stepped up. Because all these funds raised a lot of money raised. What was the biggest fund ever for a single person, not just a woman? Anyone? Are you confident you're going to have a place to put all that money? I am, but if I don't have a place to put it, I'm not just going to go willing, nearly deploy it. One of the things that we told our LPs even during that period when we raised our fund, which was when crypto was undeniably still on a bull run, we said that we are going to be pretty steadfast sticking to a tier deployment cycle. And I think one thing that's changed is that might have lengthened. It certainly hasn't shortened. But we will, again, we feel very good that we have the capital to back great teams when we see them. So you think we're going to fall behind the United States? I think we already are falling behind. Fall behind. No one covers the world like Bloomberg. Some people has emerged at a wedding party alongside别. What about NFTs? And if you two are concerned about the declining demand? We are going to increasingly live in a digital world. And I happen to think that if you live in a digital world, you're going to want to own digital goods in that world. You're not just going to be satisfied to rent them, which is what we do now. We buy our content from walled gardens without digital scarcity, which is what NFTs unlock. You don't really own anything. You're subject to the whims of a platform. And I think NFTs and digitally scarce goods fundamentally change that. I think you'll see NFTs back again. But we are spending a lot of time in the infrastructure layer. Like I tell you, zero knowledge, technology, scalability. We think of that as like the plumbing. If you think of the fiber-hubbic cables. Remember, you couldn't have had YouTube and Netflix with dial-up. You couldn't have streamed content. The same is true of crypto use cases. We think that there will be a lot of new use cases unlocked when the infrastructure is there, when it's more efficient, when it's more user-friendly. And so we're spending a lot of our time there. President Biden issues this crypto executive order. There are a number of ports that are coming due. What do you want to see from the administration when it comes to regulation? Are you optimistic that we will get there? Yeah. We were so delighted to see that executive order. It's not something you should normally be delighted about. So why we were is because it was to us a real recognition that this is a US government saying this field isn't going anywhere. This field is growing. It's growing so much that we are going to direct every single agency in the federal government to come up with a plan here. I think we take a step forward, but then you see we're a big government. We're a big system. We have states. We have local entities. We are ви. What is that?",https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dp8PhLsUcFE,5485,2022-10-22 04:23:20
17080," You know, we're a big government, we're a big system, we have states, we have local entities, so we take a step forward with the EO, and then we take some steps back sometimes too, and I think what I see as crypto founders are confused by that. They're starting to think, well, I could go to this jurisdiction where there's a single regulator, and you don't have 50 states with different rules. It's the US government that needs to start taking stock of the fact that right now, Emily in China, there's a quarter of a billion ECNY wallets, a quarter of a billion. We're still talking about whether there should be a government central bank digital currency. We're still studying that. So you think we're going to fall behind the United States? I think we already are falling behind. Fall behind China. And we're falling behind. What are the dangers of falling behind China and the rest of the world? This is years ahead, so I don't want people to take a headline and say, oh, I think the US dollar will be no longer the global currency, reserve global currency. I'm not saying that now, but fast forward decades. And if you no longer need to use the dollar because you have an alternative, I think that's a real problem. What would we use instead? Well, I think that there are going to be stable coins out there that people who have access to a smartphone will use. There is a demand for it. We see 285% year of your growth with stable coins. So people are clearly liking the idea of this. Now, again, there have been some spectacular failures, too, but not all stable coins are created the same. But I think the important thing is that we really do need to not just quash innovation. What do you think of how Gary Gensler, the chair of the SEC, and how he's approaching it? One of the things that I hear from founders is that they're very confused because they get told, come in, register. Just come in and talk to us. But you have the one company who's done the ultimate act of going in and registering. And based, filed an S1. And still, there's a lot of saber rattling still going on, I think. And again, I don't want to single out the SEC. And I don't want to suggest that anything they're doing is bad. I do think, though, that right now there's a lot of confusion. And one of the pieces of confusion stems from the fact that it started with the ICO Lenia back in 2016, 2017, I can't even remember which year now, where the SEC was very loud about securities. A lot of them were securities, but the space has changed. And so to still view it through the ICO lens when so much has happened over the last five years in the space, I think is a mistake. What do you have to say to the skeptics out there who just don't believe in the future of Web 3? And don't see where this is going. I would say don't judge the current state of innovation by the end state of innovation. I hear from a lot of these skeptics. And by the way, I'm friends with a lot of these skeptics, too. I don't only want to live in a crypto bubble. They want to see the use cases, especially if they're not technical. Well, when am I going to use it? What will I use it for? And I think one of the things that's not appreciated is how quickly the infrastructure here is catching up. And once you have really scalable blockchains that can handle a lot of throughput and are very efficient, I think that unlocks a whole lot of use cases. People are spending more time on screens. That curve is up and to the right. Whether we like it or not, that is the future. I mean, those who have kids know that kids spend more time online. They want digital things, too. And I think to dismiss it, it is a bit generational. I do find not always, but it is a bit generational. If you talk to kids about being able to have money online, they instantly get that concept. They're comfortable not having to hold something in their hand to think it has value. Take us to the end state. Do Google and Amazon and Facebook and Apple still exist? I believe they will still exist. I mean, it depends what you talk about when you talk about the end state. I mean, I think that, you know, I think for decades, those companies will still be around. But the important thing is I think this new ecosystem is going to represent a challenge to them. I think that those entities, decentralized forces are coming and will cut into those entities, profits and revenues. So we have a little rapid fire section.

17082," I don't do that. I'm not doing my job. At six foot four inches and more than 300 pounds, Dominic and Sue has done his job in the NFL for 12 years now. Sometimes, maybe too well. You got, you know, frozen feet and didn't realize you were stepping on my cap. You also stopped doing my teammates at one point. He's been, you know, in my time one of the most dominant three techniques in the game. And I understand not everybody's gonna like me and that's okay, but I guarantee the people that don't like me, don't know who I am and haven't even taken the time to get to know me. After spending a few days with the Dominic in here in the rainy city of Portland, I've gotten an insight into a soft spoken native portlandian, family man restaurant tour and real estate investor who's endeavoring to have more impact with his businesses than he's had against quarterbacks in the NFL. It's a simple concept of like, I don't want to be at the top of the pyramid or be amongst the 1% and be there by myself. I want to bring other people with me that are like-minded and you want to work with them and when you have the opportunity to help other people at the same time it's a smart business decision. Why not create both. Say hello. It's really fast. The rock boat and the rock boat. The kinks is more observer. You've been in analyzes. 40 dives in. And this car is full throughout all right into it right away. For someone who is so single-minded on the field seeing Sioux in his native habitat, it's a bit startling and not just because he's a dad. From his home office bouncing from zooms to calls to texts, he's methodically creating an empire. It includes investments in tech companies like Quip and Ember and hospitality investments, including restaurants in Portland and beyond. But the primary focus for Sioux has been real estate. Over the past decade, much of his investments have been focused on multifamily and commercial projects. So tell me your business philosophy like in a nutshell. Like how do you distill it down? Just understanding that investing and social impact can go without question-hand at hand. And I think you can impact other people's lives and do good. But at the same time, make smart business decisions where as I've always seen it as a true give and take relationship versus just someone always taking. And I think that's where that capitalistic mindset, that majority of America lives in. It's a short trip from where we're sitting to see where Sioux came from. His home in the offseason is here in the Irvington District of Portland. And his house is only a few streets away from where he grew up. This hoop's been here for ages. Oh my gosh. And the family that own this house, their son actually played the NBA. There used to be at the far end, we called our little where we'd have a main death contest. What was Portland like when you were growing up, me now it's seen as this like boom town, right? But was it like that 20 years ago? No. Portland was very, very small. Everybody knew everybody pretty much. Growing up in Portland, Sioux is surrounded by sports. Nike's headquarters was just 20 minutes away. And he still works out there when he's home. His older sister in Goomsu also became an elite athlete. She'd end up going to the 2004 Olympics as a soccer player, playing for their father's home country of Kimmeroo. Oftentimes in a family, especially when you have multiple superstars, it's clear that like this family's in the business of growing superstar athlete. My parents could care less about. They wanted us to be in athletics and have that fulfillment of being in sports. But hands down education was a number one. And my sister's super smart. She got a degree in kinesiology and biological sciences. Su's parents divorced when he was two but stayed close. His mom was an elementary school teacher and his dad owned an HVAC company. As a young kid, I enjoyed going to work with him. I got to spend a lot of time with my dad on job sites. And it's really what got me into the business as I got a little bit older towards middle school.

We bought the building lived on one side and rented the other side and that's where we really started to learn about real estate or how I started to learn about real estate From those early days, Sue's fascination with an ambition in real estate only grew Especially as a pro football career gave him the means to I bigger and bigger projects He's been buying and building property in his hometown of Portland as well as across the United States Including luxury residential office and hospitality space and affordable housing All with the mission to help build generational wealth through real estate And real estate is one of the most tried and true places to store and grow wealth Buying and owning property commercial or residential when done right can be a source of income as well as a crew value over time That's if you choose projects wisely and have patience over the past few years The pandemic both increased demand and lowered the supply of housing leading to skyrocketing values At the same time Low interest rates made acquiring the capital needed to purchase properties even easier More recently though Rising mortgage rates and new supply have begun to change that picture and rents have been increasing at historic levels owning real estate has the additional benefit of influencing Maybe even transforming the neighborhood and the community around you that's an idea passed down to Sue from his father He assembled a handful of different lots and projects and this is one of them That has been I won't say a unicorn, but it's been very very profitable If you look at the building you have the exterior so we gutted everything inside and kept the exterior facade and then built on top of that It was originally a chop shop when we first took over People at night when I was growing up in the 90s and early 2000s would not walk up and down these streets by any means You see it's live you got great restaurants up and down coffee shops further down You got everybody probably knows assault and straw they're right up the street There's no way they would be here back in the 90s. So my dad had a great vision and in focus for seeing where the city was moving Out of these investing in real estate properties in order to renovate them isn't that remarkable at its face What separates Sue is his fluency and the details of the business He'd learn that on the job of his dad as well as in the classroom Imagine simply climbing a cable into space The concept is known as the space elevator Not only could it significantly change how we leave planet earth But it could also completely transform humanity's relationship with space And there are scientists who think we could have already built it We have the material we have the technology we have the lasers we have the climbers we have all of it If a private entity wants to build it or a government like a building It'll change society we have no clue how Colonizing in the space how really spreading out of space really change our society over the next 50 to 200 years It'll be completely different You Watch Bloomberg surveillance early edition for the news you need when you need it I'm not really can't lie in New York and any Edwards in London Australia's central bank raises interest rates twice as much as four cars Then surveillance for in-depth analysis outside Tom Kean and Lisa Brownbottes I'm Jonathan Ferro the NBA front and center.

17084," technology with Emily Chan. Weekdays at 5 p.m. in New York and 2 p.m. in San Francisco. Why do the biggest names in business choose Bloomberg? I have to be great questions. It's great question. Great question. And pest question I get all night. Bloomberg Top Experts. Great questions. Disruptive defensive player in college football. The most dominant player that I've seen this season. He was a heavily recruited athlete. He opted for the University of Nebraska, which has not only a great football team, but a highly regarded construction engineering program. I knew leaving high school, I wanted to get an engineering degree because my ultimate goal is to come back here to Portland and build another division to my dad's company. Granted, that didn't necessarily happen because other things transpired. But like going broke. Yeah, like going pro, yeah. I think I get it from both my parents, but primarily my dad who's always been somewhat calculated and focused on what we want to accomplish in building and connecting with the right people and then also just learning from others. Lincoln, Nebraska may not be the first place you'd think to meet some of the world's most influential business people. The Portland Metro area alone has more people living in it than the entire state of Nebraska. But his play on the field allowed him to meet and maintain relationships with future mentors in his business career, including the Oracle of Omaha himself Warren Buffett. I loved the Wall Street Journal story last year. They called you a secret finance nerd. Let's talk a little bit about that because... Yeah, you're not something. Ever since then, we've been close friends, confident, and really a true mentor, being able to bounce a bunch of different ideas off, and then also understand how he envisions the world, although he's not fully into real estate, and he's changed a little bit because he now has a brick-try halfway home, you know what not. That long-term vision and that being able to buy and hold is one of the greatest things that I learned from him. Sue also met with one of the most interesting people who has split time between the locker room and the boardroom, Joe Moglia. Moglia's career began in the coaching world, but he would rise through the ranks to lead TD Ameritrade as CEO from 2001 to 2008, and Chairman from 2008 to 2020, navigating the company through the global financial crisis and its aftermath, as well as its eventual combination with Schwab. He was around my entire senior year, and one pay, I just asked him, like, you always leave every Friday before our games and come back Saturdays ready to go. Like, where do you go? And it's always like a black car going out. It's like, I go to New York, it'll take care of business with TD Ameritrade. I'm the chairman there, and then I come back and obviously have my role here with you guys. And I was like, well, that's pretty interesting. Like, I'd love to learn more. And so he said, well, make sure you follow it with me after the season. All right, so I asked him this exact same question. Check out what Joe had to say. So, our first step, our first step is going to be, I want you to come down to my office. The season was over, and I want to see the budget that you would put together. So he comes down, it's about a month later. And I got to tell you, I was impressed. He comes into my office with a suit on, tie on, he looked great. And we sat down, he showed me his budget. The budget was about $60,000. Now, now we've talked about that a little bit. Two or three months, he was going to get a pretty significant contract. And he was going to make a shitload of money. And $60,000 budget with regards to all the different things that people is going to be interacting with, it's probably not going to quite work out. Yeah, that's exactly right. He's like, man, you're going to be spending anywhere from $20,000, $30,000 a month. And I was like, there's no way I'm in college right now. My rent's like $1,500. Yeah, I didn't imagine ever getting there. Alone the whole I'm there, sorry. There was, of course, one other pivotal person he'd meet and cultivate a relationship with during his college days. His future wife, Kacya. I have only been a champion. It is beautiful. Lady of my life. We met all the way back in 2009. I was a women's basketball player and he was a football player. And the best way that I like to explain it is he ran after me a lot. And would always try to kind of say he's going to break my ankles or what are we going to play one-on-one?

And so after some time I finally gave him a little, a little chance and I got to know him and truly he became my best friend. The two have had a whirlwind past few years. They moved in together in 2018, were engaged in 2019 and had their then traditional Zoom wedding back in 2020. In February of 2021, Endomacan would win his first Super Bowl with a Tampa Bay Vuckeneers and just a few months later, the two would welcome their twin sons, Kari and Kingston. When the two aren't changing diapers or doing the latest TikTok trend, they're business partners working together out of the same home office for much of the off season. We really both listen to each other's calls. We kind of have what's going on in the mornings after workouts and when the boys are during breakfast will be like, what's your plan for today? How many calls do you have? When are your calls? Are the ones that I can listen in on or the ones that he's like, you know, I want to be a part of that. I want to participate or just listen in. The two also work together on the Sue Family Foundation, the charitable arm of Sue's business ventures that focuses on empowering people with resources for long term success. One issue they're working to address is financial literacy. Right now, there is no financial literacy requirement at all at any level and to me, that's mind blowing. It finances are in our life from the minute we are born to the minute we are no longer here. And so to not have a requirement of how things run, how to properly use your finances is to me quite insane. And while many athletes get back to their community, the Sue's extend that notion to all of their business enterprises as well. Looking not only at how they can impact the bottom line, but impact their communities and one of those spaces has been restaurants. Access the financial world on demand.

What is Sue's restaurant investments is here in downtown Portland. A fast casual restaurant called Bayes Fry Chicken. He started with a previously successful Portland-based restaurant tour named Mike-A-Camden. To understand it, I ordered a chicken sandwich for myself for journalism. Tell me about where we are. We are in downtown Portland. This building was built in 1882, so that's an old building. You don't get much older than that in Portland. We got the fry chicken sandwich, we got the chicken strips. It's easy, it's approachable, it's super great quality. When we opened this up, we went straight to organic on all the chicken, which was awesome. It was very, very juicy, so be careful. But good food and a good location aren't guarantees of success in the restaurant world. Restaurants are tricky businesses for athletes, seemingly easy to understand, but complex to conceive, operate and market.

17086," world. Restaurants are tricky businesses for athletes, seemingly easy to understand, but complex to conceive, operate, and market. Actually, they're hard businesses for anyone, even food pros. While Micah himself has had successful ventures with restaurants like Fox or Ramen, Little Big Burger, and Blue Star doughnuts. In 2016, he had just shut down a previous attempt at a fried chicken restaurant. Restaurants are high risk. What's appealing to you about being in this particular restaurant business? It's one. This is a foodie town. I got amazing chefs, people that enjoy quality, high quality food and kind of giving back to my community is something that was missing. And then also you come out and see there are a pandemic. A lot of people are supporting people in their levers. The last few years have been far from the solid days for the restaurant industry. The pandemic altered dining, living, and working habits and everything from lockdowns to labor shortages have plagued the food business. Bays opened this location only a few months before the global pandemic shut down much of the country. And George Floyd's murder led to a reckoning around racial inequality. As protests and counter protest swept the country, Portland became a focal point. Images of property destruction by protesters who themselves were often the victims of violent attacks by extreme right wing groups, as well as Portland police, ricocheted across social media, giving rise to a flood of disinformation by opponents of police reform. It was ground zero right out our front door is ground zero for the night we protested the land on for three or four months. Thankfully enough this community knew this this location was owned by Sue and then we didn't get stuff thrown through our windows, you know, stuff like that. But the attention that was brought to Portland via those protests, it hit its cause, it hit its nerve and it started the conversation that is still going on today. Portland has in recent years been an almost cartoonish example of a liberal stronghold. And while coffee shops and breweries are a thing here, the real Portland is a complicated place in a state of near existential crisis facing issues around affordability, the unhoused and crime. People of color in Portland have been historically disenfranchised, especially when it comes to one of Sue's biggest businesses, real estate and development. Like in many cities across the US nearly a century ago, redlining practices allowed white neighborhoods easier access to capital and excluded black and immigrant communities, including Su's home in the Northeast of Portland, where Irvington was, quote, still desirable, just a few blocks north, Alberta was considered, quote, hazardous. And while redlining was made illegal in the 60s, its effects are still being felt. Investment in areas like Alberta, where Sue and his father bought a property, have helped revitalize neighborhoods. But it's also led to gentrification driving out home prices and pushing people of color out. Through his development company HMS, Sue is hoping to change the traditional narrative. We are down on Alberta, further down from what we're up before, but this is 30th where we are creating Alberta Alley, which is going to be a nice collection of BIPOC type of restaurants. Beyond creating a space for black, indigenous and people of color owners of restaurants, Sue has also brought in more black investors, including another profile player with Portland Roots named Bretton Scarlett. We went to take a look, but as you might expect, we had to go inside. Let's go inside. And get out of this Portland rain. Right now, Alberta Alley is still very much a work in progress. But the intention is to create a space for multiple restaurants and eateries in a communal, well-alley type experience. Currently, they're working to bring a Latino-owned expansion of puppies, chulos, and another base-fried chicken location to the space. You guys are native sons, you know, sort of putting a different mark on this city. Tell me about, you know, your process of being an owner and not just a, like, participant, not just a customer to some extent. Yeah. Portland's an interesting place and has a long history of racism, of marginalizing certain groups. Like the house that I grew up in on the deed, it says that a black person can own that house.",https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dp8PhLsUcFE,5492,2022-10-22 04:53:30
17087," of racism, of marginalizing certain groups. Like the house that I grew up in, on the deed it says that a black person couldn't own that house, right? But my dad purchased that house back in the 90s. Right now you think about purchasing commercial properties like this, right? Under black ownership, and then also the cycle of having tenants here and being intentional about having tenants here that are represented that may have historically not been able to have an opportunity to be represented. When I grew up here, it was predominantly a black neighborhood and a lot of different people. Just kind of starting out their businesses here that really in the bipop space. And so a lot of justification moved those things out and brought up new developments and not really looking for a way to bring those people back in. And so this is an interesting way to fold them back into having that opportunity of kind of getting kicked out. And now not coming back and hopefully being successful and finding ways to help them be successful. We have a very altruistic view when it comes to our real estate endeavors and have multi-family units and be able to create them and mix used developments. I think one of the most things I'm going to be proud of as we're getting this journey and started is our allied approach to attainable living initiative, where we really want to have the ability to afford a attainable living for everybody and we're starting here in Portland. There's never been a greater need for housing and yet it's almost impossible to get housing done and developed. Sue's partner at HMS is Joel Anderson, a third-generation contractor and developer-based in Portland. And while the two have developed a portfolio of everything from high-rise residential to industrial, one of the common threads is their vision of the social impact real estate can have. Both Sue and I have been very fortunate and worked very hard. Some lucky bounces that they went our way and there's a whole bunch of people that we interact with in our communities that just didn't have those same opportunities and have never had access to invest in commercial real estate. While real estate investments have been a great place to store wealth, the recent housing market has left many unable to participate, especially when it comes to BIPOC communities. And I think one of the ways that we can do that with all cap as we call it is giving them the opportunity to not only pay rent and understand those other pieces and keep it afloat, but also give them the opportunity to be a part of it. And one thing you know about people when they have ownership into a building, they take care of it that much more better. All of these people are really important. Affordable housing, which about half of Americans say their community lacks, is a hot button issue long-fraid with racism. Some say they oppose it over perceived increases in crime, erosion in the tax base, and increased traffic. Sue and Joel believe they can ultimately flip the script by better knitting residents into the community economically by affording everyone a stake. Nalturistic capital, alt cap, it's very intention is to bring people in that have been excluded. If we take an accredited investor, somebody and say, OK, you're going to invest $100,000 in this project. They'll, yes. But you're only going to get credit for 95% of that. And $5,000 or 5% of your investment is going to go to a nonprofit. Alt cap community reinvestment fund. And we say to them, now, OK, you can participate from $500 to $5,000. And for every dollar you invest, we will match you through the Alt cap reinvestment fund dollar for dollar. And so if you have somebody who invests $500, they now have $1,000 investment into this project. They've effectively doubled their return. It may seem complicated, but Joel and Sue believe that programs like Alt cap can give people who've long been excluded from real estate and attainable investment option. While some investors might pocket giving up some of their economics, proponents of this shared ownership believe it's long overdue. If we can get real estate transactions to include everybody, you're talking about $1 trillion industry that has the ability to engage everybody in a micro fashion earned at a disproportionate rate, you can transition the wealth of our country in short order. Of course, undoing centuries of economic disparity and systemic financial bias, that's a long game. For Sue, it's his life's work, and he'll be able to devote even more time to it once he leaves the game.",https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dp8PhLsUcFE,5493,2022-10-22 04:57:53
17088," disparity in systemic financial bias, that's a long game. For Sue, it's his life's work, and he'll be able to devote even more time to it once he leaves the game of football. How do you think about the idea of transition, especially given everything that you've already done in business? Yeah, the transition to a difficult one for me. I look at it consistent and have over the last couple of years from a standpoint, especially since the boys came into my life. If I want to spend as much time with him and not miss out on things. How do you balance the economics versus the emotions? I mean, this is a deep analysis. This is one of the most important decisions you'll ever make. Yeah, I think the analysis is very straightforward. It comes down to numbers in a lot of ways, but then also, just do I believe I have more to offer without question. Do I aspire to be in the hall of fame? No question. Do I want to do that at the cost of not spending time with my kids, not being around my family? Timing is always going to be key to that. We've got a good process with me and the wife. I lean on her a lot, and I think she has a good tail tail to give me some different things to think about. And she always says it's ultimately your decision, but I truthfully know it's both our decisions. When the price of anything goes up, the consequences reach far beyond what you'd expect. But perhaps most of all, when it comes to food. In 2010, surging food prices helped spark the Arab Spring. Lives were lost, regimes fell, and the consequences are still with us. Once again, food prices are rising and fast. Energy costs, broken supply chains, and surging demand were just some of the factors that have driven food prices to their first record high since the Arab Spring. And that's all before a war between two of the world's biggest food producers. Ukraine is called the bread basket of Europe, and taken with Russia the two account for about a quarter of global wheat trade. They produce more than half of the world's sunflower seeds in oil, nearly 20% of the barley. Now throwing rising energy prices and processing, transporting, even refrigerating food gets more expensive. Plus, fertilizer production is extremely energy intensive. Less fertilizer means lower crop yield, and prices rise even more. The pandemic revealed how complicated and fragile global trade systems are. Global agriculture, perhaps even more so. Unlike metals, for example, food goes bad. And crops take months to grow and are vulnerable to unpredictabilities like the weather. Rising food prices will be felt everywhere, but the poorest countries in the world will be hit the hardest. And as all these factors compound, the real fear is that record high will lead to record high, and ultimately to a global food crisis with vast consequences. We make it very transparent to the shopper before they accept an order. What the order is going to look like, how much we're going to pay them, and how much the consumer is paying them. And so they can decide whether they take an order or whether they refuse it. And that's the kind of flexibility that our shoppers really value and the kind of transparency that they want. Are you seeing a labor shortage right now? And what are you doing to combat that? It's different in different places. Or demographic of shoppers is completely different from food delivery and our right sharing, where 70% women and half of them are moms. And that's because a lot of the job at Instacart is very different and just being in a car with strangers. It's about like going to the store, doing a good job of customer service of really picking the right products for the consumer. And we are seeing that being very appealing to women. It seems like everything is going green these days. But there's one mode of transportation that seems to be clinging to the traditional fuel loving ladies. And while commercial aviation has made strides through smarter design and cleaner engines, many of those gains have been nullified by more air traffic. The challenge is enormous. This is a large industry. It will take decades to convert. The good news is that we will have a solution as early as three years out that people can.",https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dp8PhLsUcFE,5494,2022-10-22 05:02:10
17089," In the charging industry, it will take decades to convert. The good news is that we will have a solution as early as three years out that people can get into and start moving zero emission. And it turns out that the solution could be all around us. Hygge Gen is the most abundant element in the universe. And so if you had to use something, it would be great. The only product of the chemical reaction between Hygge and Oxygen is water. We looked at the fundamentals of what it would require to take an aircraft, up in the air of significant size over significant distance, commercially relevant. You get to hydrogen fuel cell being the best approach from the cost of fuel, efficiency of utilization of the fuel, and the mitigation of the climate effects. Serial clean tech entrepreneur Val Miftikoff started zero-Avia following his previous success in the EV charging industry. So the beauty about hydrogen in general is that the energy density of hydrogen as fuel is actually three times better than jet fuel. So you can see any size of aircraft going for any distance that jet fuel aircraft can go over time. It will just take significant amount of time to get the industry over, but this technology can scale to all sizes of aircraft that we use in commercial service. Zero-Avia uses a hydrogen fuel cell to produce electricity to turn a propeller. Unlike a traditional engine which uses combustion to create energy, a fuel cell generates electricity through electrochemical reaction. In this case, hydrogen and oxygen are combined to generate electricity, heat, and water. Zero-Avia has flown a six-seater aircraft on a hydrogen fuel cell, a world first. Now they're aiming bigger at 20 seats. That's technically commercial. One side of the aircraft, the left side, we replace the engine with our power plants. We still got the normal engine on the right side. And part of this is, you know, innovation. You want to ramp up a East profile in meaningful steps. So anything happens. We have the second engine. But even in the first flight test campaign, what we're planning to do is to demonstrate operation of the aircraft, pure-learn zero-emission power on the left side engine. Once we take off, we're able to switch over to completely zero-emission power. Hydrogen is used throughout all sections of the flight. That maximizes the efficiency of the entire operation. That reduces the weight, provides for best sort of mission capabilities, payload, and range. Building power plants and fuel cells is one thing. Creating a whole new infrastructure for supplying hydrogen is something entirely different. In automotive, the big part of the reason why hydrogen did not take off is because the fueling infrastructure needs to be so distributed. Let's say, the United States, you have 100,000 fueling stations. Compare that with aviation, where 95% or more traffic in the United States is concentrated in the United States. It's concentrated in 100 locations. That's a three-order magnitude difference, which makes build-out of the infrastructure much simpler. It's much larger, much more concentrated stations, but there's much fewer in quantity. Calling it simpler might be underselling the challenge of distributing hydrogen, which unlike other fuels that can be easily transported in liquid form, is usually found instead in a gaseous state. How do you get the hydrogen from point eight to point B? We don't have pipelines for moving hydrogen around. We don't have all the specialized trucks to move them around. So we got thinking we need a solution that can be a low-capital expenditure solution. And that's the genesis of the company. Jump-all Clark is the co-founder and chief innovation officer of Universal Hydrogen, a startup that is designed modular,",https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dp8PhLsUcFE,5495,2022-10-22 05:06:29
17090," That's the genesis of the company. Jumphal Clark is the co-founder and chief innovation officer of Universal Hydrogen, a startup that is designed a modular tank system for the domestic turboprop market. Like Zura Avia, it allows for retro-fitting planes already in use. Each module has two capsules and so what we do is load it into the aircraft as if it was cargo, strap it down, connect it to the aircraft, close the loading door, and that would be it. When you get to your destination, you'd basically unload it, put it back in a truck, send it back to the production site to get refilled. We needed to basically come up with something that could both fit in containers and also fit in the aircraft, not require increases in the maximum takeoff to the aircraft. This compromise is one of the biggest hurdles that may prevent widespread adoption of hydrogen. Obviously you're going to have to take out some seats because the energy density of hydrogen is less than jet fuel and you can store it in the wings practically, so you're going to have to take away some space and a few of that. In the ultra-fine margins of aviation, removing 10 to 20% of your seats is a tough ask, but that hasn't deterred start-ups like ZeroAvia or Universal Hydrogen. The maintenance costs of a fuel cell motor system goes down and it goes down significantly because motors and fuel cells have much fewer moving parts than a gas turbine engine. The wear and tear is much lower and therefore the time between overhaul is longer. When you put all that together, our numbers indicate that the chasm, cost per available seat mile, actually goes down slightly or is at the worst equivalent to what you have now. What you will have is a smaller cabin, a smaller number of seats. However, the cost for each of those seats to operate it is the same or better with the hydrogen. Back in 1997, I was interested in the following question, which is there are a bunch of the dinosaurs called Saurapod dinosaurs, which had really long skinny necks, so Apatosaurus is an example. That was a really long skinny tail. So I made a computer model that showed that in fact the tail of these Saurapod dinosaurs could actually act like a whip, a bullfip. Now the way a bullfip makes that cracking noise is because the tip of the whip actually goes about twice the speed of sound. And that crack is a sonic boom. I think the way they got a date was to impress the females by making loud booms. The way they got a new one is the way they got a new one. The way they got a new one is the way they got a new one. The way they got a new one is the way they got a new one. Everything you need to get set for the start of U.S. trading, Bloomberg, the open with Jonathan Terrell, is preparing you as only Bloomberg can weekdays on Bloomberg.

17091," Like ZeroAvia, Universal Hydrogen is also working on engines. Successfully testing their two megawatt ironbird that will allow them to retrofit planes carrying up to 55 passengers. ZeroAvia is aiming for their first commercial hydrogen electric flight between London and Rotterdam with their 19-seater by around 2024. But much like the range anxiety that has plagued some battery-powered electric vehicles on land, hydrogen fuel cells are also fairly limited. At this point, they still don't have the capacity to power a common 100-pastor jet. Beyond fuel cells, however, there is another hope for our lightest most abundant element. Burning. The first Ureca moment I suppose is when we saw steam and exhaust because we were thinking to ourselves, huh? They're burning something here and they're producing absolutely no CO2. An expert in gas turbine combustion, Professor Bobby Satie leads research at Kranfield University in the UK. Built on a former RAF base, the college runs multiple aeronautical programs. But what Bobby is focused on is burning hydrogen as cleanly as possible. So what we're trying to demonstrate in this rig is how we can conceive some hydrogen combustion technologies that can be integrated in the next generation aircraft engines, which will deliver not only low zero CO2 emissions, but also ultra-lone ox emissions. Knox or nitrogen oxides are a significant source of air pollution globally. They're the dirty particulates that cause smog in cities, usually spat out by diesel cars, scooters, and buses. Hydrogen is characterized by much wider flammability limits, which means we can go to much leaner combustion and as a result we can burn at much lower flame temperatures and that's better for reducing nox emissions. Going leaner means burning fuel with an excess of air in the engine. Using something like gasoline, lean burn emits far fewer hydrocarbons. Doing it with hydrogen also delivers cleaner emissions. While Knox is a pollutant, hydrogen combustion produces up to 90% less nitrogen oxide than caracene. So while burning hydrogen isn't technically as clean as using it inside a fuel cell, it's still a huge improvement over jet fuel. Unfortunately like any radically new idea, there are other potential byproducts of the process that aren't fully yet understood. Knox is clearly one of the main emissions we need to consider, but the aviation community is also asking themselves and the community in general what about all the water vapour emissions. And some studies have shown, albeit they still a large degree of uncertainty about it, that controls and serious clouds that may be induced from controls could contribute to global warming about four times a month than CO2 does. We know that if we are going to be burning hydrogen, we are going to produce much larger amount of water vapour emissions. And if we are going to be producing a much larger amount of water vapour emissions, then the propensity for contrainformation is also going to increase. In spite of all these challenges, hydrogen is being taken seriously by the broader industry. Companies like Universal Hydrogen and ZeroAvia are gaining the attention of investors looking for viable and eventually profitable solutions. Industry giant Airbus wants to introduce a hydrogen powered passenger aircraft by 2035. Recently announcing plans to retrofit a gas gasoline superjumbo with a hydrogen burning engine. The modified aircraft will add a fifth engine, adapted for hydrogen, and will be mounted on the rear fuselage. The A380 is the largest passenger aircraft in existence, so it offers plenty of room to store the 400 kilograms of hydrogen. The company's designs for a blended wing concept to store extra hydrogen also offer a glimpse of our flying future. Apart from the complex engineering challenges faced by airplane manufacturers, there are also difficulties in production of hydrogen itself. Nowadays, most of the hydrogen used in fuel is derived by splitting it off from molecules of natural gas, but that requires a good deal of energy and also produces carbon dioxide.",https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dp8PhLsUcFE,5497,2022-10-22 05:15:07
17092," used in fuel is derived by splitting it off from molecules of natural gas. But that requires a good deal of energy and also produces carbon dioxide. To make green hydrogen, the electricity used to run the electrolyzer must come from a renewable resource, which is currently a lot more expensive. As with any new technology, however, initial costs are daunting, but time may be the best remedy here. If you look at economics of hydrogen fuel production, for example, versus fossil fuels, for instance, the cost of hydrogen is all based on capital expense and very little operating expense. It's sort of similar to solar power, right? You put solar panels out there and they produce power for 20, 25 years. The operating expense is relative below. What that means is that as scale grows, as we've seen with the solar panels, the cost of outputs drops dramatically. So the first phase is not about the most efficient aircraft. It's not about the aircraft that will deliver the lowest NOx emissions. It's about demonstrating that we can carry hydrogen safely on boat. We can burn it safely on boat and it can be used to fly passenger aircraft. The key thing is that we don't try to put everything in the first generation or we'll just going to delay the entry into service, so to try and keep it as simple as possible. If there are some questions on the margin, they're all in the sort of business model and market adoption realm. It is very hard to create a technological argument or impossible to create a technological argument that says, well, it's not going to work, right? It is going to work. Big expensive cities have a lot going for them. But if you live in one, you've probably noticed that these big expensive cities keep getting more, well, expensive. You could always move away. You might have just started working remotely, so there's really nothing keeping you there. But then again, moving is a hassle. Well, what if someone paid you 10 grand to do it? What if they threw in free office space, a bicycle, or a gym membership? Programs and cities and states around the US are doing exactly that, and they're getting a lot of interest. We've had over 50,000 applications. About 90,000 applications. We've had over 1800 applicants from all over North America. So are these nascent programs actually beneficial to their communities and the workers joining them? Or are they little more than flashy advertising campaigns for places looking for an injection of fresh talent? You'll get insight into limitless possibilities, knowledge, and inspiration to feed your ambition. So before you invent pioneer, disrupt. Before you change the world, Bloomberg. Have you ever been cruising on a highway and wondered where the heck are all those trucks going? There's a behind-the-scenes world of logistics that makes virtually everything in our modern lives possible. Not only do we take it for granted, we're completely oblivious to its environmental cost. But thanks to a handful of companies, there's a hidden revolution happening that, as it turns out, is perfectly suited to delivering a cleaner future. For years, online, order and rapid home delivery have been booming. And thanks to the pandemic, this trend has a full...",https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dp8PhLsUcFE,5498,2022-10-22 05:19:23
17093," For years, online ordrain and rapid home delivery have been booming. And thanks to the pandemic, this trend has evolved into a way of life. But what actually happens when I click that tempting button to buy, let's say, an old school, real hardcovered book. For mighty Amazon, which tends to capture the lion's share of all book sales, they're crocked along with other books to one of several Amazon inbound fulfillment centers. Now the book is an Amazon's massive fulfillment network, copies then journey along the so-called middle mile, and can be redistributed to any of the hundreds of smaller warehouses or nodes closer to customers in major population centers. The last step is the so-called last mile, how it gets to a buyer's home. The book might be sent to an Amazon delivery station, then put in the back of a Mercedes Sprinter van and dropped off by Amazon itself at the customers front door. This system, while it's a marvel of modern-day logistics, still relies mostly on traditional combustion engine vehicles for middle and last mile delivery. As demand for rushed delivery rises, so does the number of gas guzzling trucks hustling between warehouses. Environmental, it's one of the biggest issues there is, and the quicker that the globe can sort of decarbonize transportation, the better it's going to be. So if you look at total greenhouse gas emissions in the U.S., about 28% of that is transportation. And of that chunk of the 28% about a quarter of it come from mean even heavy-duty trucks, so middle mile and sort of long haul trucking. If you really want to move the needle on carbon emissions, this is a really good place to look. So how do we solve this growing emissions problem and still satisfy our addiction to the same big delivery? Or solution? We actually started this because we were fleet operators ourselves. We had a fleet of medium-duty vehicles, and we saw how challenging it was becoming to operate diesel vehicles. The technology exists to convert last mile fleets from diesel to electric batteries, and the prices of those batteries have fallen dramatically in the last 10 years, and any routes that are around 200 miles or less are really ready to make that transition. So X-Ls is trying to perfect the frame of the car, they call it the chassis. So this is everything is sort of underpinning the car, the electric motors, the battery pack, all the battery software and cooling and technology and kind of the brains of the car, if you will. And then the business model is basically to sell that and let the end consumer dictate what goes on top. Our platform we call the X platform, UPS is using an X platform with a parcel delivery van body on top of it. Lumis, who operates an armored car fleet, uses the same exact X platform, but with an armored body on top of it. X-Ls is currently making their modular battery packs here in Los Angeles, and the packs can be customized for specific applications. But while one big problem, vehicle cost, is improving as battery prices continue to fall, there's still another major hurdle at the other end. The best way to describe the current state of charging infrastructure in the U.S. is anemic. These companies don't want to build chargers unless they're electric vehicles, people don't want to buy electric vehicles unless there's chargers. That's a big problem for the personal EV space, where range anxiety is often cited as roadblock to mass adoption. But when it comes to delivery, there's a much simpler solution. When you think about last mile vehicles, they're not operating in different bases of operation. They actually return to the same depot every single night where they do their charging. Exos actually has a division helping fleets install that charging infrastructure. These fleets will actually bring their vehicles back to the yard, they charge them overnight, and then by the time morning rolls around for their next shift, those vehicles.",https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dp8PhLsUcFE,5499,2022-10-22 05:23:46
17094," These fleets will actually bring their vehicles back to the yard. They charge them overnight, and then by the time morning rolls around for their next shift, those vehicles are fully charged, ready to go with the infrastructure that's on site. With pilot programs up and running with delivery giants, UPS, FedEx and Amazon, Exos is quickly becoming a major contender in the electrification game. But there's another enormous part of this puzzle, which may end up eliminating more than just gasoline. So I'm got them, Narang. I'm the co-founder and CEO of Gatik. At Gatik, we do autonomous vehicles for the middle mile segment of the supply chain. Again, middle mile is one step back from last mile, trucking the goes from one factory or warehouse to another. The middle mile is evolving at a rapid pace, and with the pandemic, the middle mile segment of the supply chain was put into high gear. The prominence and the significance of the middle mile is only going to grow in the coming years. So Gatik is a really interesting company. What they're doing is trying to both make middle mile delivery autonomous and electric, so they're trying to move the ball in two ways here. And what's really interesting with them is they focus specifically on certain sector of users, namely large companies that have very fixed routes. Just as the predictable routes of shipping and delivery make electrification easier, they make autonomy a lot easier too. If your trucks are going the same way every single time, like Gatik's, that's a much easier puzzle for an AI to navigate. So what they do, they find the route they need to run, and they agonize over it for four to six weeks, just mapping it inside and out, figuring out where all the trouble spots might be, and coding their vehicles to deal with it. And often they're not taking the most direct route, they're taking the safest route, they're taking the route that's most predictable in terms of traffic. There's a common understanding in the industry that unprotected left turns and doing multiple lane changes are some of the most trickiest problems in the AV space. With middle mile, frankly, you can avoid all of that. You can take three right turns to make a left turn. You know, a bag of potatoes won't care. Gatik's ultimate goal is to provide a cheaper, cleaner alternative to the middle mile of today by saving money on gas and maintenance, by electric motors, and saving money on, well, drivers by going autonomous. They've already sold some major players on their vision and scoring Walmart as a customer, oh it's well for the future. Startups like Gatik and Exos are betting that the delivery industry is ready for a full-on high-tech refit. In a sector where only about 1% of vehicles have been electrified, that's a lot of potential for change. You know, the usual suspects are where you're going to see adoption come first. You know, the larger, more stable companies. So Walmart, Amazon, UPS, FedEx, et cetera. I think you'll see them experimenting with it more and the more routes that they can get it to make sense on, the faster adoption's going to be. And as the technology matures and batteries continue to get cheaper, there's another huge category of vehicles that's ripe for this kind of upgrade. So the Biden administration has been super aggressive about a pledge to electrify the entire federal vehicle fleet, which is just under 700,000 vehicles. The interesting is the federal fleet is both really old and really inefficient. The average age of these cars and trucks is about 14 years, and the average cost is about $1 a mile when you add up fuel and maintenance and depreciation, which are the three big ones. It's a good place to look if you're looking to get carbon out of the transportation system. While the most exciting and flashy developments in the world of electric vehicles are usually around personal EVs, the more impactful transition is happening behind the scenes. So the next time you order something online, and it effortlessly appears in your doorstep, your package might have made at least some of its hidden journey without consuming an ounce of gasoline.",https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dp8PhLsUcFE,5500,2022-10-22 05:28:02

Part of what I love about business is you get to build things from nothing. I don't have any invested. All this is all money in. This is me just building. It's pretty much full service shadow banking with nobody in charge. What are the moon shots at Amazon that are capturing most of your time and attention? We have a unique way that we go get big new investments. I'm not sure it's right or wrong. It just happens to be our way. We ask ourselves when we're considering something for questions. If it's successful, can it be big and move the needle in Amazon? Is it being well served today? Do we have a differentiated approach? Do we have confidence there? If not, can we acquire quickly? If we like the answer to those questions, we'll go pursue it with a single threaded team. It isn't distracted by the rest of the business. When it comes to the stock, it has fallen significantly. Do you think investors are missing something or has tech just been overvalued? I have never tried to predict what stocks might do. In any time, I've tried to a little bit. I've been wrong. I do really believe that in the short term, the stock market tends to be a voting machine and the long term it tends to be a weighing machine. We have a concept we talk about a lot of Amazon inputs and outputs. In the ultimate output for a company, a share price. In other big outputs, a free cash flow or profit or revenue, you can't really manage the outputs. You have to manage at the input level. That's where we spend all our time. If you do the right things for the business long term, things tend to work out. I think we've had very good returns for investors. I expect that to be true again. Japan's critical role in the global economy is changing as the world recalibrates. After decades of stagnation, Japan's leaders are forging a more innovative and sustainable path forward to revitalize the nation. Corporate giants, policymakers and pioneers tell us how they're doing just that. Every week on Japan ahead, right here on Bloomberg Television. Thank you for having me. What drives you? What drives me? I love the idea of a simple and inclusive world. A world where people see themselves reflected. I was supposed to be invisible by your accounts. I was supposed to not be where I am. I was supposed to have disappeared a long time ago. Every time in my life was about visibility. Yes, I will be this person who's not supposed to be here. I will fight through the hard times. Yes, I won't give up. Even though I was sort of the token black editor in the industry in the 90s, I knew even then that I needed to break people up with me. I needed to bring other people up.",https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dp8PhLsUcFE,5501,2022-10-22 05:32:26
17096," Editor in the industry in the 90s, I knew even then that I needed to bring people up with me. I needed to bring other people up with me. And so that's really been a part of, you know, maybe it's maybe it was growing up in a family of six, I don't know. When you run a team, how do you instill that work ethic, that kind of answering emails at all time? Yeah, I mean, you know, I think you say an example, you know, if you're an editor who leaves and has lunches and it's never in the office, you know, you don't really sort of instill faith. My team know that, you know, we're on a mission, we have to reflect the world we live in, we have to, you know, reflect the, you know, the beauty of multiculturalism, we have to reflect, you know, the beauty in diversity and inclusivity. So everybody takes it really seriously and we really have intense conversations about the zeitgeist and the world. And so, you know, I'm very lucky to have a team who are as passionate and, you know, I could call my team, you know, I could call somebody at six a more, they can call me at six a.m. and I'll pick up and they'll pick up. So, you know, we have something very special that we've built over the past sort of five years. But there were difficult moments, right? I think the first time one of your first issues, you thought that you could have been fired for it. Oh, just that, right? I mean, I lived in America, I lived in America for a bit and I was working for W Magazine and there was talk of Brexit and of course Americans were like your country's really, you know, xenophobic. So, you know, I came back and I thought, you know, I'm going to be welcome with open arms and they're going to love me and oh my god, literally back to them by fire. But I remember thinking, you know, I wanted to create a magazine where every woman could see themselves, you know, where every woman regardless of the backgrounds, regardless of their age could just literally see themselves. And at the time, now it looks like it's the norm when you look at other magazines. But in 2017, that was, that was a radical idea. But I also remember thinking, you know, with my background, you know, I've lost so much and gained so much that I thought if I knew, if I'm fired, I'd rather be fired for what I believed in. I'd rather be fired for creating a magazine that reflected the world as it was than try to sort of create a second-rate version of someone's vision. And that continues. I mean, there's this idea of always pushing forward. Right? What's the end? How do you measure success? How do I measure success? I'm definitely not, not financial. I mean, I think it's more about, for me, when I'm really exhausted, when I'm really tired, when I'm really questioning if I can go on, you know, I walk on the street and I see a little girl, a little black girl who's seen the magazine. And it's the norm for them all, a curvy woman on a traitor palace who's like, thank you for, you know, seeing me, you know, that makes it worth it. That for me is success. And anybody who knows or has known me for a while will witness that that for me is success. You know, my jaw is done when that happens. Do you think people come up to you? They do, but it's always in a positive way. It's always thank you for seeing us, you know. But I can relate, because, like I said to you know, by all accounts, I was meant to be invisible, you know. So for me, shining in light on people and making them seen, it's natural for me. They say that the fashion industry is changing. You're changing it. Are others around you changing it? I mean, now, you know, you look at other magazines and seeing real women in there, it's no longer a radical act. Seem, you know, people of color, women of color on covers is no longer a radical act. So it's being normal, you know, it's been normalized. And for me, I'm quite happy when I see that. You know, when you put Dame Judy Dengsh on the cover, and she's 85 years old, and the world just laughed it. Nobody questioned her, you know, should she be on the cover or you put, you know, a girl with a hijab on the cover, and it's not a problem. That for me shows that, you know, we're advancing, we're progressing. So, you know, progress for me is very important. Which is important. And so how do you take care of your team? How do you build a team around you? I mean, somebody said to me once, when you build a team, make sure...",https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dp8PhLsUcFE,5502,2022-10-22 05:36:44
17097," How do you build a team around you? Somebody said to me once, when you build a team, make sure you employ people you like. People, when you see them working towards your office, you're just so excited to see. That was it. Being good at your job and sort of a connection and being excited to see team members because you only have good as your team. No man is an island. I don't create the magazine on my own. And so it's great to have a team who you respect and who's views you respect. How do you think you're seen by your team? Do you have to be fearful? Do you have to be authoritarian? I'm a worker. I work very hard. But I think I'm pretty open. You can have conversations with me. Ultimately, the final decision rests with me. But I do listen. I like conversation. I like interaction. I hope they think I'm a good boss. That's really all you can hope for. They work on a very good magazine. They can get other jobs anywhere. The fact that they have made me think that they must be happy. How do you see the publishing world changing? People buy less magazines. You've been doing pretty well in terms of selling more. But in five years, how does it look? Five years ago, let's go back to ID when I was 18. I inherited a magazine, which will come out. It was all about club kids. You had to be out there. The only way you could see street fashion was through ID. In 2017, I inherited a magazine. But now I oversee a brand. The magazine is sort of the highest, the best paper, the best photographers, the best cultural messages. But at the moment, when you manage a brand, it's not just about that. It's about digital. It's about video. It's about audio. It's about events. So for somebody who's so forward looking, it's so great for me. And people always ask, oh, it's a magazine instead. When we launch a cover, Instagram is our cover, essentially. So we find a way of sort of making it work hand in hand. And it's so great for me. I think, had I just been doing the magazine? I probably would have been bored. So magazines aren't dead? Are they going to go down? No, I mean, yeah. But they're going to work in hand with digital platforms. But also, I'll tell you something. New readers of folk, young readers, don't necessarily come to us through the new stands. They come through the digital platforms or audio, videos we put out. So yes, and I was to increase tenfold. So yeah. Well, do you think that will change the kind of readership that you will court, the either age of your readers, but also where they come from? Yes, I mean, at the moment, you know, I think the readership is getting younger because of, you know, the whole digital landscape. And I hope that as we move forward, it kind of, yeah, we have new readers. And we also keep our loyal readers, you know. Do you think there's ever a time where actually we won't have print magazines anymore? No, I think print will always exist, sort of at long-side digital, but it'll probably be something more precious, sort of better paper, something more collectible that you want to keep in your house, almost like artwork. So no, I don't think print is going to die. So you were copied. But more quality. But more quality. But more quality. You know, almost like a book. A table book. I love that. Right, no, you need to. I think it's crucially important. And I think we've moved from this attitude, from its indulgence, a waste of time, almost an illness that needs a cure. For something as universally important to human life as sleep, mysteries surrounding its necessity and utility have only just been recently uncovered. Some of our biggest discoveries were in the 1970s or 1980s. And so it makes that a really exciting field, because it seems as though we're uncovering new insights each and every day. Some scientists are going further to find out how sleep and what happens there can be.",https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dp8PhLsUcFE,5503,2022-10-22 05:41:07
17098," because it seems as though we're uncovering new insights each and every day. can be harnessed to further expand our understanding. spit back a lot of facts. how and why to use that information and that's what you bring figures out while you're sleeping. no one covers the world like Bloomberg. the pressure cooker just got far too hot in banning them for the government to handle. you foresee two-thirds of the crypto hedge funds will disappear. are we close? the European Union will support and defend Ukraine's derrige world integrity. with unmatched reach and resources from more than 120 countries. the moment news breaks 24 hours a day. Bloomberg you are global business authority. this is Bloomberg Daybreak with Lake. and Bloomberg. you're recently on take talk. yes. is that fun? that's so much fun. I literally have to be held back. I'm so curious. I mean I like all the digital platforms. I really like to keep my finger on the pulse. I'm not one of the people that leaves work and shuts themselves in. I really want to be out there seeing the world as today. it's in all its beauty. I'm very curious. I have a very curious mind. I'm glad. I'm glad. it keeps everything moving and exciting. is that for Gen Z is that a commercial purpose to get closer to that? No, it's just out of curiosity. I've always been like that. I've always wanted to know what's next. I didn't want to be the one that's just being told, oh, you're 50 or whatever. I pay attention to everything. but the world is such a beautiful place for me. and it goes back to my childhood again. will be your biggest challenge to grow the brand in the next five years. I think we still keep it relevant. We have such great digital traffic. Almost almost six million every month to British vote. But I'm really excited about overseeing the European votes as well. Spain, Italy, Germany and France, and mentoring a whole new generation of editors. When there was this whole agonization, the whole world thought there was a global view that was going to dominate. But it's very much about local conversations as well as global conversations. I learn from these content leads. I hope that they also learn. The local, global conversation I'm very excited about moving into the future. Do you think it changes if we're in a recessionary environment? You have such a glamorous lifestyle. What you sell is so glamorous. Is it impacted by the cost of living or inflation? Or what we can live through? I remember a few years ago I put Taylor Swift on the cover. And the by-line was by better, by less. And it was a radical concept at the time. But now we all talk about sustainability. We know we can't keep shopping every day. We know we have to buy things that last. Things that help the planet. Things that we can pass on to sort of our other generations. That conversation and the fashion industry is having right now that I find so exciting. And it's going to be sort of, you know, people are going to have less money. So they have to buy things that last. And I'm really excited. And these are real changes. It's not just real changes. Real changes. It's not just conversation. It's actually happening. Do you think fashion brands always need to have a political point?",https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dp8PhLsUcFE,5504,2022-10-22 05:45:27
17099," And I'm really excited. And these are real changes. It's not just real changes. Real changes, it's not just conversation. It's actually happening. Do you think fashion brands always need to have a political point of view when they're great injustices? I think fashion brands can do more. I feel that having a black model in your show or having a feed on your Instagram post, it's not enough. We need diverse voices behind the scenes. I always say that I talk to all the CEOs. I know we need to employ more people from diverse backgrounds because that's the only way you can even reach out to more people. A variety of voices is always better than just one. And I always also say, let's not just have interns, let's have people on all different levels. And that's what I keep talking to people about. Do they listen? Some listen, but I think since George Floyd was murdered more and more companies sort of made pledges to people of color and it's a slow process. Some have taken it seriously and some are still working their way through it. But we have to keep on. The problem is that you can make a pledge and then follow through. Right? You have to really focus and keep asking that question for people to follow through. And do you feel like you're a guardian of that, of making sure that when you get promised something, they'll do it. And you'll hold them into account. Yes, if they promise something that I asked for, then I will literally wear you down. I'll literally chase you until you keep your promise. That's just who I am. We actually have one of the diverse cabinets here in the UK with Liz Truss. Is that important to you? It is so important as somebody who came from another country and was sort of welcomed by the UK. It's very important to have a diverse cabinet. That's how change happens. Going back to what we discussed before. That's how you understand people who are on the periphery or who've been avid. It's so important to have a diverse cabinet. But this you think in terms of policies and what they can bring to the table or just also seeing on how the TV a diverse cabinet can have an effect on policy. I hope they can have an effect on the parties themselves, as well as policy. For me, it's about policy that makes people's lives better. I know you're also very close to Ghana still. I mean, there's a pretty scandalous anti-LGBT bill getting through. I mean, it's so funny. I was invited back to Ghana a few years ago by the president. It was the year of the return. And I remember the last time we were in Ghana, we were fleeing. And I really supported the changes. I love the changes that we're going through. But yes, they do have an LGBT problem. Some friends and I signed a whole. I don't know if you saw it. Yeah. And we're doing what we can to change things on the ground. I think you can't also sit in the West and tell a country what to do. So it's about sort of forming alliances on the ground and seeing what is needed and how we can help. Whether than standing on our soap boxes, going, do this, do that, do this. So that's through what grounds, I mean, ground work, trying to change from with it or how? Yes, from with it. Trying to change from within, you know, talking to heads of LGBTQ, LGBTQ members and asking them what they need and what we can do to help. Rather than, you know, I'll say, do this. This is how you do it because we don't live there. You have a memoir out. Yeah. Why put it down on paper? You know something about when you turn 50. You know something about when it's your fifth year at Vogue. You know, I got married this year. I'm normally not someone who looks back all the time, but it felt like the right time for me to do that. And also, you know, I just felt that a lot of young people so see people like you and I and they think, you know, we just got here.",https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dp8PhLsUcFE,5505,2022-10-22 05:49:42
17100," At the right time, for me to do that and also, I just felt that a lot of young people see people like you and I and they think, we just got here and we were always here and for me it was really important to share the story of a journey about successors and failures. That's the reason why I got here. I just wanted to share that story with young people. That's what people who feel like they're on the outskirts of the outside of the industry. Do you feel like an outsider? I always feel like an outsider. As I said before, I grew up African in an African household in England, different languages, different foods and I'll go to school and I'll be in England. I've always been about duality. I've always seen myself as an outsider, also an insider and even when I took a job at British folk, I was the black gay working class outsider but I've been in the industry since I was 18. I was in essence an insider. That's really some of the duality that plays out in my life. Who do you think made you the person you are today? I know you left home twice, right Ganna, but also you had to leave your home. Yes. The puzzle made me who I am is really my mother. I mean, I loved my mother. She taught me about beauty. She taught me about clothes, about fascism. She also taught me that beauty came in all forms. Women were beautiful, no matter what shape they were, no matter what colour, what religion. That really stayed with me. I guess my creativity comes from her. Of course, I also had a military father, so the idea of precision and organisation and thinking ahead also comes from her. How did your father, I know you had a difficult relation with your father, how did your father shape the person you are today? It's a funny question, because I never thought I was like my father growing up. I was very shy, very sensitive, a little spacey. I prefer the company of women, to men, my dad was sort of authoritarian, disciplinarian. You had to be home at a certain time. He grew up as an Iron Fist, and I thought, I'm never going to be like him. He kicked me out of the house when I was 18. But I found out that over the years when it comes to work and discipline and sort of organisation that is him to a team. I'm the world of politics to the world of business. Balance of power with David Weston, views and analysis inside, from and about politics power players. Weekdays, this is Bloomberg. It's a really a reminder, isn't it, just how sensitive the markets are to any commentary about trade. We did see some pressure on the U.N. We did see some pressure on the future. That is now being reversed. Markets are preparing to close, but the day is not over yet. Talked it is now up about 45% of all the volatility you write down. You need the power of the Bloomberg terminal to get you market moving data before anyone else. There's numbers much higher than expected. Upgraded today to overweight. You need top analysts to bring you exclusive global insight into cross-asset markets. This is a really big focus. Bloomberg markets the close weekdays on Bloomberg.",https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dp8PhLsUcFE,5506,2022-10-22 05:54:06
17101," So at some point you lose your eyesight. What was that like? Yeah. Basically I have very high myopia. So I've never had great eyesight and I went through a series of retinal detachment for to be exact. And with each detachment I'll have to end up looking down in a contraption for about three weeks. And in the dark room, it was very harrowing. It was very harrowing time in my life. But I always say you don't have to have vision to have vision. So in those dark rooms my imagination was even bigger. I dream bigger. And I came out to sort of the last surgery and the cover I did was for W Magazine with Rihanna as the queen, with a golden eye. And I look back at the other eye. Oh my God, there are their eyes. Subliminally. So yes, it was very challenging. And even to this day, I go for checkups to make sure my eyes are okay. And they're great right now. And once the more I look after myself, the better. The better. Yeah. It's amazing. You power through adversity. Do you ever think actually this is too much? Have you ever thought this is too much? I mean, there have been times when I felt this is too much, but it's not in my vocabulary to start. It's not in my DNA to start. You know, I am my mother's son, my father's son, you know, the edge to move forward is always there. And that's why, you know, when I was young, I would always get up and work. I had a responsibility touch when I still got on a plane to go shoot the Hollywood book full, yeah. But now I'm learning to say no. Now I'm learning I can't do that job. I can't fly. No, it takes time, but it comes with age. It takes courage to say no, right? Definitely. So when you look at all your covers and there's so many beautiful ones, is there one that's that's special to you? Well, I say to someone, they're like my children. You always have a favorite child. But I'm especially proud of the covers we did in lockdown, you know. When the world had essentially shut down, you know, the teams were sort of scattered all around London. And I had to go back to the days of I did when, you know, you had to really create, use your imagination. And we had a series of four covers, Judy Dench. When they said, you know, anybody over 60, she stayed at home, they sent her workers cover, a cover of landscapes just so people could take a breather. And the activists cover when George Floyd was murdered. And I really think we create covers that, you know, in years time, people can look back and see what the time that period was like for me, an artist always has to reflect the times to paraphrase Nina Simone. And that's really important for me. I mean, there was a bit of controversy with Linda Vanjolista. Yes. Yes, I mean, you know, there was a, there was a complaint that, oh, you know, she should, she should have looked a certain way, you know. And for me, I've known Linda in the 90s. I've known this incredible icon who really defined what a model should be. And I also saw my friend go through really dark days, you know, due to the complications for surgery, literally disappear from the world, really not the Linda the world knew. So when we were doing this cover, it was the collaboration. She wanted to be that Linda that everybody knew. She wanted to feel good about herself again. And I wasn't going to deny her that act. And also, you know, whatever I would like to say, whatever a woman wants to do with her body, it's up to her. So, you know, I'm very proud of Linda and I'm very proud of that cover. And I mean, sometimes you're almost like an activist. Is that how you, you're like a fashion activist or a political fashion?

17102," What would have happened to my family? So even when we ended up in a room, two rooms in a voxel, six of them, we were so happy to be there, penniless, but so happy to be there. So, you know, every day, I just, you know, I'm an optimist and I know it's not the most fashionable thing, but that's why I'm sitting here with you today. Bye. Edward, thank you so much for your time today. Thank you. So is there more pressure when you're trying to win a basketball championship than when you're trying to please investors? Where's the greater pressure? Oh, I think it's definitely trying to win a championship. It's hard because a lot of, like, when you invest and you know this, when you're investing, you can control a lot more things. When, you know, in a basketball court, you can't control whether somebody's going to make a shot, you've got to get lucky. And what's the greater pleasure making five times your money on a Distress Dead investment or winning the NBA championship? They're both fabulous. I wish I could do one each year. That would be great. But I think there's a great feeling in being right on an investment that you've done a tremendous amount of work. And you've made money for your clients, which I think is great. I think winning a championship is, it's a very surreal feeling because there's a whole city or state that is actually behind you. We had 70,000 people at the finals. And we had them all outside. It's 17,000 in stands. And then literally, like, 60,000 people outside. And when we won, like, just the joy that you had brought to the city was phenomenal. Should be more emotional than you were bring for all the success that need to happen to beenergized maybe because of your We will never break Build on a foundation Strong enough to stay We will never break Have a wide array of things And the mountains shake All of who will remain We will never No, now we will never No Thank you Andy so much for coming down It's really wonderful to have you here in person It's my pleasure to be here thanks for having me I just found out we actually lived in the same dorm in college Just a few years apart So it's been almost a year since you took over From Jeff as CEO of Amazon It's been a year of first, the first stock split since the dot com boom The first vote to unionize an Amazon warehouse Your first Bloomberg technology conference Thank you I want to start with a quick report card In February 2021, Jeff Bezos shocked the world by announcing plans to step down as Amazon CEO A few months later, he passed the reins to Andy Jassy His longtime top lieutenant The architect of one of the company's biggest profit engines, Amazon Web Services Bezos has stayed on as executive chair Leaving Jassy to navigate a critical inflection point in Amazon's history How does the company manage market turmoil, rising inflation and regulatory scrutiny And a push by some warehouse workers to unionize All while keeping customers coming back Joining me on this edition of Bloomberg Studio 1.0 Amazon's second CEO, Andy Jassy He joined us from our flagship Bloomberg technology summit in San Francisco I'd like you to grade your view of Amazon's perfume",https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dp8PhLsUcFE,5508,2022-10-22 06:02:53
17103," Yes, from our flagship Bloomberg Technology Summit in San Francisco. I'd like you to grade your view of Amazon's performance. And we've got time later to really dig in. But quickly, how would you grade Amazon's performance over the last year with customers? Well, I think we've, you know, I'm not sure I'm the right person to grade myself during the year or not, but I'll give you my take. You know, I think with respect to customers, I think we've done a lot of good, you know, and I think if you look at during the pandemic, which really has extended till the early part of this year, you know, so much as the PPE and food and essential items and people equipping their home offices were bought from Amazon and, you know, to scale the way we needed to remember. In 2020, we grew 39% year over year on a $245 billion revenue run rate. I mean, it's, it's unprecedented. It's never happened before, but it was really hard to do that. And we had to take the really big footprint of the film and center footprint. We built the first 25 years of Amazon and doubled it in 24 months. We built out that transportation network in just a couple of years. You know, we nearly doubled the size of our workforce during that time. And I think you saw it in other businesses. AWS is a really big part of helping companies and governments have business continuity during the pandemic and so many companies and organizations in the last year made the strategic decision that they were going to stop running their own infrastructure technology and disproportionately chose AWS to help them move to the cloud. And we spent a lot of time helping them make that transformation. So what about investors? I mean, the stock is down significantly from a peak last year. Obviously, there's broader market turmoil. Yeah, I think, you know, for investors financially, I'd say it's mixed. You know, I think we have some businesses that are growing really strongly. If you look at AWS, you know, in 2021, grew 37% year-over-year. It's not a $74 billion revenue run rate business. It's pretty unusual growth. And we grew 58% year-over-year in our advertising business. You know, what's the $32 billion revenue run rate business? So some businesses are growing really strongly. And, you know, we've continued to grow in our retail business despite pretty crazy comparable during 2020. But I think the real challenge for us there is on the cost side. And there have been several things that have happened, some of which are more controllable than others. You know, I think the part that's less controllable is really around inflation. And I think we thought that inflation would start to attenuate in 2022. And with the war in Ukraine, it just went the other way and has significantly accelerated. And so the cost of trucking and line haul and ocean and air and fuel has just substantially gone up. And I think that will attenuate at some point. No one knows how long that will take. I think the more controllable areas for us are really around fulfillment center capacity and productivity. It was taking about 24 months to build new fulfillment centers during the pandemic. And so we had to make decisions, you know, in mid-2020 and early 2021 on how much demand we were going to plant for it. And so, you know, we end up with more capacity than we need right now. And there's a number of things that we're working on. We've stopped building on properties where we don't need it yet. And we've let a number of leases lapse and not a small number, you know, of both those things. We've had a lot of occasions in our history where we've worked on productivity and made improvements. And we have a lot of clearly defined issues. And I'm confident we're going to get back to the right level of profitability. You are going to sub-lease 30 million square feet of space. Is there a mistake in the execution there because of the overbuilding? Again, because you have to make these decisions two years in advance. And again, if you put yourself back in 2020 where we were growing 39 percent year over year on a $245 billion revenue run rate, it's very hard to know what's the right amount to build. And you have to make a decision. And we made the decision to err on the side of our consumers and sellers. Now, how would you grade Amazon's performance with employees, your colleagues? There has been some high profile. Yeah, I think that when I started in this gig, we had just created a new leadership principle to strive to be Earth's best employer. And I think we're, you know, we spent a lot of time trying to think through what that really means. It's broad. And I think we've made a fair bit of progress, but it's still early, in my opinion. But I still think there are many areas that we can keep improving. And I think, you know, I think.",https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dp8PhLsUcFE,5509,2022-10-22 06:07:09
17104," I think we've made a fair bit of progress, but it's still early, in my opinion. But I still think there are many areas that we can keep improving. And I think the first one I'd mention is safety. I think that in our fulfillment centers, that is the top priority. And when you get into the details and numbers and outside of all the spin of it all, we're about average there, but we're not trying to be average. We want to be the best in the industry and the best in the world at it. And that's a high priority and an area that I'm passionate about and the team is passionate about. And I think we have a lot of work we can do to make our employees everyday lives easier. We've identified kind of a top 100 list of areas that we can be better at, that we're just metronomically stepping through. And so we've made a lot of progress, but we've a lot of work to you still. Elon Musk just came out saying he has a super bad feeling about the economy, Tesla laying off 10% of his staff. Jamie Dimon says he's preparing for an economic hurricane. The World Bank just slashed its forecast for global growth. How do you feel about the economic climate? Well, I wasn't planning on giving any guidance to the camera. Please. But super bad or super super bad? I think. I think. I think there's some things that are related to Amazon that are useful to remember. I think the first piece is, remember that 85% of the worldwide retail market segment share is offline. And if you believe that that equation is going to flip at some point, which we do, I think it will flip over a long period of time. If you look at different downturns, should we have one at some point? And we've been through a few, obviously, in the 25 years that I've been at Amazon, customers changed their habits. And so I also think those two reasons, those two factors give me some optimism that even if we have a downturn, that we have the potential to still grow up, we have a roadmap that's probably three to five years long. And we're going to continue to invent. We're going to continue to be insurgent. And we have a lot of work to do to get to where we think we ultimately can get for customers. Now, when it comes to the stock, as I mentioned, it has fallen significantly. Do you think investors are missing something or has tech just been overvalued? And this also, of course, matters to employees who are significantly paid in stock? Well, you know, I look, I haven't been at Amazon for 25 years. I arrived at the company three weeks before we went public. I have never tried to predict what the stock's going to do. In any time, I've tried to a little bit. I've been wrong. So, you know, I think it's a pretty hard to predict what's going to be in any short period of time. I do really believe that Benjamin Graham Maxson, that in the short term, the stock market tends to be a voting machine. And the long term, it tends to be a waiting machine. And I think if you, you know, we've been through a lot of points in 25 years at Amazon, where the macro factors are off and stocks are down. Our stock is down. But you can't really control that. We have a concept we talk about a lot of Amazon inputs and outputs. You know, in the ultimate output for a company, a share price. You know, and then other big outputs are free cash flow, or profit, or revenue. You can't really manage the outputs. You have to manage at the input level. And that's where we spend all our time. And so, if you do the right things for the business long term, things tend to work out. I think we've had very good returns for investors. And I expect that to be true again.

Alpha Beth Sundart Pichai, Microsoft Sacha Nadella, IBM's Irvin Krishna, Micron Technologies Sanjay Mayhotra, and that's just the start. Add in the chief executives of Adobe, Deloitte, Gap, VMware, and that doesn't count Indians running companies all over the world. Why have so many Indians risen to the top? For no coasts of points to India's incredibly competitive education system, if you can survive the pressure it takes to get into one of the Indian institutes of technology, it gives you confidence to handle American universities and later the business world. Meanwhile, the belief in India's ability to produce so many tech wizards is reinforced every year. Let's make up about three force of the immigrants receiving coveted H1B visas for the US, and it's a safe bet that some of them will eventually find their way to the C-suite. What are the moon shots at Amazon that are capturing most of your time and attention? What is going to define the next era of Amazon? I mean, is it Astro, the home row butter? Is it something else? Well, we have a unique way that we look at big new investments. I'm not sure it's right or wrong, it just happens to be our way. We ask ourselves when we're considering something for questions. We ask, if it's successful, can it be big and move the needle in Amazon? Is it being well served today? Do we have a differentiated approach? Do we have confidence there, and if not, can we acquire quickly? If we like the answer to those questions, we'll go pursue it with a single threaded team that isn't distracted by the rest of the business. Sometimes that leads to innovation investments that seem pretty obvious. When I got to that company, it was a book's only retailer, and then we expanded to music and video electronics and toys. It seems obvious to people. Other times that process does not lead to investments that seem obvious to people. AWS was something that people externally and internally thought was a little bit nutty at the time, but just imagine what Amazon would be today without AWS. I think that you see the same thing here. There are so many significant investments we're making that I'm excited about. I'm going to have to constrain myself to a few. I'm really excited about what we're doing in the prime video space. I think we're clearly on the right track there and building a significant business. That's interesting because Netflix also just announced some layoffs. First subscriber loss in a decade, Disney cutting back on costs. Do you see Amazon's strategy as fundamentally different from Netflix and Disney? How? We're very bullish on it. Remember, all the models are a little bit different, but for prime video, we have 200 million plus prime subscribers who get that entertainment for free by being part of prime. We have a little bit different pricing model than some of the others, but I'm incredibly encouraged by what we have coming. If you look, we launched this show. Each or earlier in the year was a huge hit. We have a new Maisel season. We just launched a new boy season, which is our biggest fan. Are you a May boys fan? I am a big boy. It's Amazon Vot. It's very good. Of course, we have one of the rings coming up in September and Thursday and in a football. I'm very bullish about it. We also, we're excited about what we've done with MGM. I think some of the assets there will go very well with the rest of what we're doing entertainment-wise. So if you look at Warner Brothers Discovery and Paramount and Stars and Global, they're building really significant subscription businesses. So I'm very bullish about that business. I'm optimistic that we have a chance to build a significant grocery business, which is early stages for us. I am excited about Kuiper, which is our low-earth orbit satellite that we're building. You've got to remember there are 300 to 400 million people in the world who have limited to no internet connectivity. I mean, just think about how different the world is when you don't have that type of connectivity. So I think that's a really significant opportunity that has some AWS characteristics to it. I continue to be very optimistic about Alexa building the world's best personal assistant. We have a 200 million.",https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dp8PhLsUcFE,5511,2022-10-22 06:15:55
17106," characteristics to it. I continue to be very optimistic about Alexa, you know, building the world's best personal assistant. We have, you know, 200 million end points already that are using Alexa. We're clearly on to something there. And then you know, our autonomous driving, ride hailing service and zoos that we're building, you know, here in the Bay area. I just think with the way auto consumption is evolving, I think that also is a chance to be really significant business. Now, I don't know if, I don't know if all of them are going to be successful. But if any one of them becomes the fourth pillar for us on top of marketplace and prime and AWS, we're completely different company, just like we were when AWS became successful. So I think they're very worthwhile investments and bets and I'm optimistic about. We didn't mention Astro, obviously, though, powered by Alexa. Yeah. But I mean, our home robot's going to be doing where I don't yet. Where is it? It is. It's not really widely available for sale. What's the status? Oh, I hope you get another one. Okay. Thank you. Everyone's very curious about Jeff's role these days. What kind of executive chair he really is? He said when he left that he'd focus his attention and energies on initiatives that he really cares about as at Amazon. But from the outside, it looks like he's really focusing on philanthropy. He's focusing on space. What kind of an executive chairmen is he? Well, he, you know, Jeff is always going to be involved and he has, you know, I feel very lucky to have been in Amazon for 25 years. I feel very lucky to have worked directly for Jeff for 20 of them. And we have a really close relationship and have for a long time. And I think we share a lot of the same values about customers and how important is to optimize for customers and how high standards they need to be, you know, given how easy it is for people to switch and the importance of invention and speed. And so, you know, I just feel very lucky to have had the chance to work so closely with him. So, is your relationship, I mean, he was your only boss for 25 years, right? Is your relationship fundamentally different than it was when you were the head of your... Yeah, of course. Every single job you have, the relationships different. You know, remember, the first couple years I worked for Jeff, I worked as what we call this shadow then, which is really like a teeth of staff. And that was different than when I was starting AWS, which was different from when we got AWS going. And it was, you know, a business that was starting to do well. And it's different when I'm in the CEO role. But, you know, the constant has always been that we have a great relationship and we collaborate really well. Amazon is poised to become the biggest private sector employer in the world. Second, only right now Walmart is in that spot. But Amazon will probably soon surpass it. First vote to unionize at an Amazon warehouse. I know you've been spending a lot of time at warehouses. When you look at someone like Chris Mals, who I think some people look at as this modern day hero who got fired, pulled off this union vote, what's your message to someone like him, your message to the folks who think maybe we should join a union? Well, I know I think that the first thing to be clear about is that employees get to make that choice, whether they want to have a union or not. They always have had that choice and it continues to be their choice. And, you know, we happen to think they're better off without a union for a number of reasons, including the fact that, you know, it's much harder when you have a union to have a direct relationship with your manager and to get things done quickly. So, if you see something on the line that you think could be better for your team or you or your customers, you can't just go to your manager and say, let's change this. You know, there's a whole process in bureaucracy that you have to go through to be able to do that. You know, and we get, you know, when there's a union, we're going to get the feedback filtered by what the union decides is worth bringing up and we'd much rather hear from every employee whatever is on their mind. And so, you know, I think if you want to continue to have the structure that we've had for all this time, you have to have really competitive benefits. And then I think if you look at Amazon's, they're very unusual in this space. We championed the $15 minimum wage several years ago. The starting salary is now over $18 an hour, which, you know, is more than double the federal minimum wage. You get full health insurance and 401K and 20 weeks, up to 20 weeks of parental leave. And if you want to get a college education, you haven't had one. We have a career choice program that lets our fulfillment center associate.",https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dp8PhLsUcFE,5512,2022-10-22 06:20:16
17107," 1K and up to 20 weeks of parental leave. And if you want to get a college education, you haven't had one. We have a career choice program that lets our fulfillment center associate be able to do so. That is a very unusual and compelling set of benefits. And those were all accomplished without a union. So I think that we realize that we have to continue to work on the relationship with our employees. And we need to continue to provide the right benefits. And we need to continue to work on safety. And that's our intention. You made a huge mark on Amazon with AWS, obviously. What is the mark that you want to make still? A lot's happening on Wall Street. We need to catch up. We've got the information and insights. From businesses most influential and instrumental. It's knocking it out the bull path. It's a challenging dynamic. This is a level of uncertainty that we haven't had to deal with. Bloomberg Wall Street week, live Friday with replays all weekend on Bloomberg Television and Radio. The FTC has revamped its antitrust inquiry into Amazon. And by some accounts is accelerating it. Are you preparing for an antitrust lawsuit from the FTC? If you are a large company that's growing to a significant extent, like we have, you have to be prepared to be scrutinized. And we have known this for some time, many years. And we have tried to run the company with that in mind. And knowing that if somebody looked, that we would stand up to that scrutiny. I think that's what we've tried to do in running the business. We can't control whether organizations spring different suits against us. But I think if you look at our business, if you actually look at the fact, if you take out of the equation that there may not be the most objective leadership when it comes to Amazon in that organization, if you look at the facts in our retail business, we're about 1% of the worldwide retail market segment share. And remember, 85% of it is still offline. And if you look in our AWS business, we, depending on you measure it, 95% of the worldwide global IT spend is on premises. And then we have a cloud business, and then we have a portion of that. We were leading market segment share in the cloud part of this. But we operate, who we compete with, AWS is really on premises IT in addition to the cloud. So these are relatively small percentages of the entire pie. And you can kind of step through all the businesses. And I think simply because you've been successful in a few different businesses, doesn't somehow mean that you have a natural market power. It just means you've been successful in a couple of different customer experiences. But we still have a relatively small amount of market segment share in those areas. What about the SEC, you're being sued by them over third party data and how you've used it? Do you think in the past Amazon main mistakes with letting employees internally see how those third party sellers were doing? Well, we have pretty good control. I mean, we of course disagree with the premise of that. But I would say that we have very good controls with respect to the data that the different employees that they're able to see. And by the way, I think that we can be better for sellers. I think that...",https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dp8PhLsUcFE,5513,2022-10-22 06:24:28
17108," data that different employees sets are able to see. And by the way, I think that we can be better for sellers. You know, I think that we can have better tools from the get started. We can have better tools from the manage what they're doing across their different Amazon units. I think we can communicate better. There's a whole bunch of things we can do better. And we agonize over every single email or communication we get from sellers. And we do very regularly robust surveying and a lot more sellers are happy with Amazon than unhappy with Amazon. And I think if you look at what they're able to do as a business by virtue of selling on Amazon versus not, it completely changes what's possible. Sellers don't really long for e-commerce software. That exists in lots of places. And it's not very expensive. What they love about selling on Amazon is that they get access to our hundreds and millions of customers. And that completely changes what their prospects can be in terms of the businesses they're building. So we have a lot of work to do there. Like we do in a lot of other places. But I think we have a very strong partnership with sellers. What's the view of the supply chain right now and how much pain there is going to continue to be and for how long? Well, you know, I think that there's a lot of challenges in the supply chain still. I mean, it's gotten better than it was. But there are all sorts of challenges. You know, non-parasable goods, electronics, chips, there's still a really significant issue for all sorts of businesses. We have worked really hard to open a lot more points of presence and ports and increase our capacity and getting products in. But I think it's going to be something that companies battle with for some time. You made a huge mark on Amazon with AWS, obviously. What is the mark that you want to make still on Amazon? I mean, in this new role, what's going to define the anti-Jacy era? Well, I don't really think of it that way, Emily. I mean, I don't think it's really about an anti-Jacy era or any one person. And by the way, AWS was not about any one person. If you spend a time on AWS, that is an unbelievable team, not just an incredible leadership team, which it is, but just top to bottom, the number of inventors and people care about customers and operate something where it has to work almost like a doubt on it. It's always teams. And so I look at every single one of our businesses and take our retail business or our consumer business, which is the oldest for our business is 85% of it still lives offline. I think we have a lot of upside and a lot of growth. And I think as much invention as we've seen the last 25 years, the time I've been there, I think it's going to look small compared to the next 25 years. There is a lot for us to invent on behalf of customers. And so I'm excited to be part of the team that makes that happen. We are continuing to increase the amount that we give back to the communities in which we have big presence. And that really matters to me. I think we have a responsibility to do that. So it's a long journey that we're working on. But I'm excited to be part of it and I hope to talk for a long time. Well, thank you for joining us and telling us about the way the journey is going so far. Thank you very much. And I appreciate it. Thank you. Thank you. Thank you.

But there's an incoming revolution on the high seas that isn't quite as sexy but could be significantly more impactful. Container shipping is the key component of global trade. About 80% and 90% of all the world's goods are transported at some point. But there's a significant unseen cost to the modern era of global commerce. About 3% of all the world's CO2 emissions come from shipping. 3% may not sound like a lot, but that's roughly comparable to the entire CO2 output of Germany. Since reducing trade isn't a likely option, what about a technological improvement to help reduce the emissions from these well stock maritime behemoths? Before the COVID pandemic upended the way the world does business, logistics was one of those industries that might have been taken for granted. That's not the case anymore.

When I think about the conversations I have with Frank, the shortest part is actually about the analysis and the facts. It's more the debate about, okay, on that basis, what are the options? What can we do? My role is essentially saying in three sentences, what is working well in this company, where do we have challenges, and what should we do going forward? Deutsche Post DHL Group consists of five divisions. Express Germany's Post and Parcel Service, Global Forwarding and Freight, Supply Chain, and E-commerce Solutions. Each of these segments has seen revenue growth in the last four years, while the surge of E-commerce volume during the pandemic has had a direct impact on the trajectory. Have you seen E-commerce as a very structural and fundamental growth rival for us as a company? What we now saw under the pandemic was a structural acceleration. It took us forward to a point in terms of e-compensation, which we probably would have reached on the normal circumstances in three years' time. So it was a big step forward. DP DHL was well prepared to take this step. The company's strategic plan recognized E-commerce as a growing trend in the logistics landscape, but no one could have forecast the speed and breadth of the transformation. We are now seeing that also under the pandemic, but not only domestic e-commerce has taken a faster growth trajectories and anticipated, but also cross-border e-commerce. And we see that very clearly in our express network, but also in our e-commerce solutions division. What are the other big structural shifts that you see on the horizon? Is it e-commerce B2B? Is it increased trade as globalisation restructures? What are the shifts that you're seeing? The board B2B e-commerce is still at a very early stage, so we believe that there will be a huge growth opportunity there. And we also see that when we are talking to our customers now, I guess everybody has been now realised that being dependent on just one supplier in one province in one country is probably not a good idea. So they want to build more resilience into the supply chain. I think our international footprint, our global strengths, is really something we can leverage for the benefit of our customers. Another factor in the company's favour is its balance sheet. Since Melanie Christ became CFO, Cashflow has improved significantly. One of my priorities over the last years has been to really focus the whole organisation on better cash generation. It's not just a finance job, making sure that ultimately revenue converts into EBIT and into cash and bank account is the responsibility of the whole organisation. She says, we can't be successful as a company. If we are not collecting the cash for our services, we have provided. She has not missed one single opportunity to talk about that. I think it's a very comfortable situation, particularly in the current environment, to have a strong balance sheet. I think that is a respect. I'm very conservative and I'd rather have a bit more on the balance sheet and a bit more buffer. Spell out for us what the priorities are, the longer-term priorities, in terms of putting some of that cash to use for you. The first priority here is organic growth. We clearly indicated also this our CAPEX budget, 12 billion for the next three years, that we will keep investing into organic growth. We are very focused on our regular dividend payment. And then, if there is something left, which is fortunate.",https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dp8PhLsUcFE,5516,2022-10-22 06:37:31
17111," We will keep investing into organic growth. We are very focused on our regular dividend payment. And then, if there is something left, which is fortunately the case at the moment, we will think about inorganic opportunities, and we will also think about other means to allow our shareholders to participate. That is why we are currently running a 2 billion euro share-by-back program. Inorganic opportunities include M&A, like the recent purchase of beverage shipper, Hila Brand. But deploying cash is always subject to careful consideration. Does Melanie ever turn around and say, no, when you're pushing through or pushing for a particular package of spending? Yes, she does that quite often, because she has... She is a person and that's great if you have a CEO who is risk-a-perous, because you need somebody. You know, the business is always too optimistic. Melanie might be something too pessimistic, but that's a very healthy discussion. And if we then jointly come to the same conclusion after a debate, then we are probably in the right spot. How often do you find yourself saying no to divisional heads? So when I was promoted into the CFO position, my team gave me a stamp with rejected. It sits on my desk. I think the fact that people know it sits there already has instilled quite a lot of discipline in the organization. So I think when I get a proposal, it has already gone through a number of iterations and is normally of such a high quality that I don't need the rejected stamp too often. For the time being, Christ should be able to keep that stamp in a drawer. CEO Frank Appell has expressed a commitment to service quality and confidence that customers will accept higher prices that come with it. If you are too expensive, you will be out of business. But if you don't provide the right quality, you will be out of business as well. So we want to be, we will never be the cheapest in town. That's not doable. We are the premium provider. That's our strategy. Of course, it's also more challenging for us when our customers are under pressure. At the same time, I think, over all the last two years have shown that a reliable high quality supply chain comes at a certain price tag. I definitely see that inflation as having a huge impact on the logistics industry. And there's been substantial price increases in the last few years. I do not see that changing. There's a lot of innovation happening. And I don't see the inflation necessarily going away. It might level out a bit, but it's not going to go away. The logistics companies may have pricing power with customers, but their stock prices haven't been so robust. I think the issue there is the increase in interest rates has made everyone rethink and be concerned about the level of inventory that is out in the system, if you will, and with the level of disruption. I think what's happened more in the last that makes pre-mance is the more of a view that we're actually heading into. Certainly, any coming slowdown may be a recession. With more than half its revenue coming from Europe, investors may see DPDHL as more exposed to recession risks than its global peers. The company insists it can meet its revenue targets in the event of a downturn. It's counting on diversification as a cushion. I'm not so pessimistic that there is really a deep recession at our doorstep. But even then, our portfolio is very much balanced. We are everywhere in the world. The world will not go entirely in recession. I doubt that. Would it be a stretch to suggest that DPDHL is, to some extent, recession proof? I wouldn't go as far as to say recession proof, but I think we are very well positioned to deal with all different types of recession scenarios due to the breadth of the portfolio. The balance of the portfolio really gives us a lot of resilience against any type of headwind. Coming up, look at DPDHL's investments in action.

As the chief financial officer of one of the world's largest logistics companies, Melanie Christ has made her mark in global business. That's not what she originally attended to do. I really wanted to go into research. I wanted to become a physicist and that was where my passion was. But then during my studies, some friends of mine started doing this strange thing. They went into management consulting. I didn't even know how to spell it and I had no idea what it was about. But what they told me was quite interesting. And so I ended up doing an internship as a consulting firm. And I learned more in the two months there than I had in the last two years in my physics job at university. That is how I ended up in consulting. She started her career with three years at McKinsey, then spent four years in private equity with Apex partners in London before joining Deutsche Post DHL Group in 2004. I was brought into the company to do international M&A project. That was at the time around 20 years ago when we were really building the company in the current shape, acquiring lots of logistics companies around the world. The M&A part was the first thing. And I then wandered into a more mainstream finance field here in the group becoming the CFO of our DHL express division. So from then on it was more leading towards the CFO role eventually. Melanie Christ now heads the finance team with around 11,000 employees. Success in this role is as much an art as a science. If you do the greatest piece of analysis and you see it all and you know it all, but you can't convey that message and you can't convince the rest of the organization that we should move into a certain direction, it's useless. DP DHL is sending a consistent message with its investments. The company spent 123 million euros to upgrade its logistic centre at the Cologne-Born Airport, designing it around key strategic goals. What I love about this building is it actually shows the big mega trends which formed our strategy 2025, which was inaugurated in 2019 when this building opened. So globalisation connecting the world. Ecommerce, we have a lot of sortation facilities here for smaller e-commerce shipments. Sustainability, it's a very sustainable building, there's solar panels on the roof and everything, and digitalisation. And well, you can obviously see that it is quite automated. How did the team pitch this investment to you initially? And how hard was it as a sell for them? How quickly did you turn around say yes, this is worth 123 million euros? Of course, you always have to make sure that you have the right capacity for the growth in the network. And at that time, they came and said, hey, we will really see a strong growth in e-commerce volumes on top of the regular B2B growth. We need more sorting capacity, we need this building. And of course, there are always debates, does it really have to cost 123 million euros and so on? But fortunately, they convinced us, because then with COVID and the volume search, we urgently needed the capacity. At the same time as COVID accelerated demand for logistic services, disruptions in the labour supply hurt productivity. Advances and technology like this digital sauter have helped offset some pressures, but automation also raises questions. Does this tell us that this is the business grows? This is going to become a more automated business, but there's going to be less need for labour for workers. Well, you still see people here and were saying,",https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dp8PhLsUcFE,5518,2022-10-22 06:46:08
17113," So this is the business grows. This is going to become a more automated business. But there's going to be less need for labour, for workers. Well, you still see people here and I think what you can nicely witness here is the combination of technology which supports people. So for example, when you look at the customs area, it used to be a very manual and sometimes confusing process. Now the people are supported in picking the right shipments for customs inspections by light and they are automatically sorted in this sort of to go to customs inspections. So it is also helping the people with the jobs they're doing every day. We are over set in 2019-20. You know, we might get one-third less jobs in the current setup until 2030, if we digitalise the organisation. But we are very sure that our company will be at least 50, maybe 100% bigger and we will have more jobs to offer. At the beginning of a couple of years ago when we started that journey, people said, oh, you know, I might lose my job. I haven't heard that in the last two years as a question in any tone-hold. This airport hub also showcases DP DHL's Aviation Fleet which both small than 320 dedicated cargo aircraft. The biggest chunk of our aircraft, but we also have short and medium and long term leases and this grows in our business. We anticipate that the people keep going. You've talked about investing, of course, in sustainable fuel. Yes. When does that come online? How significant is it? The critics might say that's just window dressing around a part of the business that is of course very carbon intensive. At least a lot of emissions. Yeah, so you absolutely write the problem with our beautiful aircraft is CO2 emissions. And when you look at our overall CO2 emissions, two-thirds are from aviation. It is about flying these birds with more sustain with fuel and we said that we are really willing to spend billions on it. We now really hope that we will see the uptick in supply over the next years. Spending billions isn't vague hyperbole. The company has pledged to put 7 billion euros towards sustainable technologies and fuels by 2030 with a goal of climate neutral logistics by 2050. Sustainability makes good business sense anyway, especially if you are in a business that is energy or fuel hungry as a compliance element that not just operators in the logistics sector need to consider but also their customers. So being transparent becomes part of the service about their impact on the globe. We had a lengthy discussion, should we make a financial commitment how much we want to invest for the next decade in our sustainability? We had a long debate, is it right to say we want to invest 7 billion to 2030? There were pros and cons. But that was a very intense discussion melody in I-hat where we finally came to the conclusion that this is a right number. This is a right approach. We are a true approach, we are convinced our colleague and that's the reason why we are where we are, where we are seen as somebody who really commit. They are not that many companies who have quantified their future investment. Still ahead, how one of the business world's most influential women is working to strengthen gender equality within her company.

And while men still outnumber women as finance heads of large companies, there are signs that the balance is shifting. The number of female CFOs across major US companies has risen to an all-time high according to a study by Chris Colder Associates. And executive search firm Cohen Partners reports that 36% of new CFOs hired by notable companies in the first half of 2022 were women. I asked Melanie Christ if she's encountered obstacles as a woman rising through the executive ranks. I have to say I have not made many negative experiences. Maybe I was also a little bit in the even thought thinking about these challenges so much. So I mean when I studied physics there weren't many women so I was somehow always used to it. And it can also be an advantage when you're kind of like the only girl in the room. I mean the boss at the end remembers your name and not the 19 guys who all kind of like were ducks, suits and white shirts and look alike. I never experienced it as an external stress factor. I have to say for me personally it was more balancing my own expectations around kind of like getting family and the job combined. But that was probably more of a pressure I put on myself thinking that I had to be perfect in every dimension and not something where the pressure was put on me from my male colleagues. So how do you take that experience and put it to play in terms of how you advance the role of women in this organization? I think the great thing is that now across the board in finance but also in the group overall we have role models which show young female talent that everything is possible. In finance we have a share of women in management of 32%. So we are ahead of the group. We want to get to 35% by 2025. I think we are now at a position where if we have a vacancy I want to have at least one woman on the short list because we have enough female talent. So every short list should contain a woman and then the best person in the race should win. CEO Frank Appell says Christ sets an example for the entire organization and he believes her success may influence the entire industry. She has proven that she is an outstanding CEO. She is definitely a role model in many dimensions that you know what I like about there. She is still you know a very warm and nice person and that makes such a big difference. So you can get to that level without compromising on how nice you are as a person. I think she is a great role model and I hope that this has...",https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dp8PhLsUcFE,5520,2022-10-22 06:54:44
17115," This decarbonisation measure, I get so much in terms of return out of it, but that's a fascinating opportunity where we can make a huge difference for finance and for the group overall. As you look to the future, Melanie, what do you think is going to be the skill sets, the knowledge bases, they're going to be essential to the success of future CFOs? Yes, probably the two most essential new skills will be to get even better at lifelong learning, because we will have to learn so much new stuff every year. Be it in the digitalisation area, be it on sustainability, so this ability also has a 50-year plus-old person to keep learning and keep the curiosity. I think that is going to be super essential, and the second element will be being a great team player. The world is complex, you can't know it all, so you really have to work even more strongly with your team. What advice would you give to someone who's just recently been appointed CFO? That's a great question. I think I would probably simply say, be curious and ask as many questions as you can, try to learn as much as possible, not only in the finance area, but get close to the business, try to really understand the business, because only when you are close to the business, and you understand the fundamental profit drivers, will you be a really great CFO? I'm Tom McKenzie. This is Bloomberg. I'm going to name a couple of your babies. I don't know if I'm asking you to choose amongst your children, but some of the most recognizable buildings by you, of course, the Millennium Bridge, London City Hall, the Reichstag, and the Great Court British Museum. What was your favourite project to do? The Reichstag does stand out, because, first of all, it's an energy manifesto. So it transformed something that was dependent on fossil fuels, it uses all the technology to produce something which is essentially carbon neutral, and there's a public building, that's the statement. It's a symbol of a city, it's a symbol of a nation, it incorporates works of art, it's recycling an existing building, which, as I mentioned earlier, is the ultimate in sustainability, if you can... If you can get a new life to a building, it also creates public space at the roof level. It's the most visited parliament in the world, so it puts... The public above the politicians who are answerable to them, and that, of course, was made possible by the politicians. So it's a demonstration of democracy in action. While Teslas and the like make for good headlines, the reality is that even if every car on the roads today won electric, it wouldn't be enough to curb global emissions to avoid catastrophic climate change. Greenhouse gas emissions from transportation account for about 29% of total US greenhouse gas emissions. So what about the other 71%? Buildings across America burn fossil fuels to operate. What we want to do is make that all-electric. Instead of burning oil and gas to give us the energy and electricity we need, we want to do 100% clean energy, all-electric. We want to turn buildings into Teslas. Just like a Tesla or an electric vehicle is all-electric with no fossil fuels, we want to do that with our buildings. And if we can do it in one building, we can do it in all buildings. And if we do it in all buildings, we'll reduce 30% of US greenhouse gas emissions. You will put a woman on Mars. You will bring forth global cooling. You will be the first Chief Crypto Officer. Because when you subscribe to Bloomberg, you won't just get news.

17116," Inspiration to feed your ambition. So before you invent pioneer, disrupt, before you change the world, Bloomberg. I think that it's hard to put your head around any narrative. Like just be honest, we've had sort of a shift in, are we in some sort of circulation fears, moment, people were talking about that all day yesterday. Call it the Rescue Week with a president trying to rescue buyers at the gas pump. Earnings trying to rescue troubled markets and a British government just plain needing a rescue period. This is Bloomberg Wall Street Week. I'm David Weston. This week, Special Contributor Larry Summers on having to make hard choices to get inflation down. If your deficit projection starts to get out of control and your real interest rates start to rise, you can get into a kind of do-lute. And Deborah Lair of the Pulsen Institute on whether President Xi's ideology can get China's economy growing again. Xi's facing a lot of headwinds when it comes to the economy. It was a tough time on global Wall Street, but nowhere was it tougher than at number 10 Downing Street, where Liz Trust is on her way to becoming the shortest serving Prime Minister in British history. Forced to resign after concluding she just couldn't get done what she'd set out to do. I cannot deliver the mandate on which I was elected by the Conservative Party. I have therefore spoken to his majesty the King to notify him that I am resigning as leader of the Conservative Party. It wasn't easy for President Biden either as he continued to fight high gas prices for which he largely blamed the oil companies and counted with yet another release from the strategic patrol. The Department of Energy released another 15 million barrels on the strategic patrol and reserve extending our previously announced release through the month of December. The markets spent the week looking for some form of rescue from earnings and they did get a bit of it from companies like Netflix with Reed Hastings giving thanks. Well thank God we're done with shrinking quarters. That's a big feeling of we're back to the positivity. But Tesla didn't help much by disappointing on sales though Elon Musk predicted it would make it up in the fourth quarter. As our factors ran really important to a recovering Q4 so it's really talking off on the wide it looks like we'll have an end of the year. And although Goldman Sachs earnings were a pleasant surprise chief DJ officer David Solomon said they have a fair amount of work to do. Importantly talent is moving around tremendously at Goldman Sachs to align behind David Solomon's new new vision. What is this? The remix. I like that. Oh boy. And at the end of what was a wild week the markets did find similarly finally with the S&P 500 up 4.74% for the week while the NASDAQ was up 5.22%. And it was all pretty much driven by anticipation of where the Fed is heading as the yield in the 10 year climb for much of the week. But after peaking over 4.33% mid-day on Friday it fell to 4.2% to end the week. While the two year well the two year fell 13 basis points on Friday alone after speculation grew that the Central Bank might just slow its rate hikes after November. To take us through the week in the markets we welcome now Yuri and Timmer. He is director of Global macro for Fidelity Management and Sinaldecy. CIO for the Franklin Templeton Fixed Income Group. Welcome both of you back to Wall Street Week. Good to have you here. Sinalde let me start with you because so much of this week I think was driven off of fixed income, particularly those treasury rates. So what did we see this week and why were there so many apparently violent moves up and down? So you know David I think that we are going to continue just it was a crazy week but it has been several crazy weeks. I think until the market gets a sense of where the Fed is going to go and stop we're going to keep getting these wild bouts of volatility we've been expecting it for a while. In a sense you know there was not that much of news in the Fed saying that they're close to being done well of course they are. We already know that we're going to get up to five maybe five four.",https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dp8PhLsUcFE,5522,2022-10-22 07:05:25
17117," You know, there was not that much of news in the Fed saying that they're close to being done. Well, of course they are. We already know that we're going to get up to five, maybe five point two five, maybe a bit more, but quite early in the New Year, it's pretty clear that they will be getting close to an end. We get a 75, maybe we get another 50, after which do we get another 50 and another 25? I think the more interesting thing is what happens after that? Once the market feels that they know that the Fed is not going to pivot on a dime, I think we might get to a point where we stop seeing these wild back and forth, because these are truly massive moves in the Treasury market. And I would just note that every single data point is going to carry with it this level of gravity in terms of the moves that we see until we get to the stage that the market buys what the Fed is selling. And that is they're going to raise and then they're going to keep it high for a while. And you're in where are we headed? Where is the Fed headed? Because I look at Bloomberg right now, the Fed futures rate looks like it's about 5.05. At one point this week was up close to 5.2 in terms of a terminal rate. So when you look at the SOFR curve, it peaks at around 5% and you look at the implied terminal rate, it's around the same. The markets have been in a relentless mode of price discovery this year, and the glass has been half empty for the last nine months, where every time we think maybe the markets are bottoming and the Fed's going to be close to being done, that moving target starts to move again in the wrong direction. But I do think we're getting to a more glass half full mode, and I think that's what the stock market is starting to signal here that at this point the expectations for the Fed are so bad, meaning they're going to go so far, that the possibility of a surprise may start to go more in our favor. So maybe the Fed doesn't have to go all the way to 5. Maybe only needs to go to 4.5. Financial conditions have tightened significantly, so maybe the Fed is closer to being done than we think. But as Sanal mentioned, that's only half the equation, even if we know with clarity, where the Fed's going to go and when, whether it's 4.5 or 5 or 5.5, we don't know what the path will look like after that in terms of reverting back to a neutral policy. And we don't even really know what neutral is. Is it 3% is it 3.5? But I think the Fed is pretty committed to getting inflation back towards its target of let's say 2, 2.5%. And we're a long ways from that. And so I think the risk is not so much that the Fed overshoots or undershoots in the near term, but that it's going to take longer to get back to a neutral policy after it gets to that terminal point. So you're, you know, we were talking about this earlier today. And I, when I listen to what you're saying, I can't help but feel that for most in the market, there is this desperate desire to believe that we have the Fed that we've had for the last 17 years. And we can't because the environment is so different than it has been. Well, maybe not last 17 because the last year, year and a half has certainly been this new new world we're living in. But don't you think that a part of the volatility is markets which have become used to dramatic V-shaped recoveries and asset prices. So you miss the trade. So people keep jumping in suddenly realize it's not going to happen yet. Come out. And so you see these bouts of extreme volatility, largely because the market's been trained to expect that the Fed is going to step in when it gets too shaky. Yeah, now I agree. And you know, since the financial crisis, the Fed has been able to, not so much put the inflation mandate on the back burner because I don't think it ever is, but it was able to spend most of its time dealing with the full employment.",https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dp8PhLsUcFE,5523,2022-10-22 07:09:42
17118," the inflation mandate on the back burner, because I don't think it ever is, but it was able to spend most of its time dealing with the full employment mandate. And then when financial conditions were tightening, they could exercise the Fed put, as we call it, of course, and ease conditions and get the economy going. And inflation was never a clear and present danger. And of course, now it is. And ironically, now the Fed is in the position where it needs to not only maybe tolerate a higher unemployment rate, but even have that at its goal in order to compensate for the overstimulation that clearly was happening a year or two ago in the economy with that combination of fiscal and monetary policy. So that Fed put is either gone or out the money, and that does create a different response function in the markets. And so, and again, to the point I made earlier, knowing with clarity, which we don't know anyway, where the Fed's gonna go, and whether it's going to overshoot because it waited too long to start tightening policy in the first place. So now, instead of doing too little too late, it's doing perhaps too much too late, but even then we don't know how quickly the Fed will be able to go to a neutral policy. And I do think that that factors into valuation, because as you know, short rates, the Fed's terminal rate, real rates are important drivers, not only, of course, of the bond market, but of equity valuations as well, perv the discounted cash flow, and calculating that present value of future cash flows does depend on where rates go, and how far they go up, and how quickly they go back down, it's gonna be an important factor. So now, let me jump in here with a question to you. Is the Fed put ever truly gone? Because we thought maybe a BOE put was gone over the UK, but when the things got really rocking in the Guilt Market, it had to come back in. What about what happened in the UK? What does it tell us potentially here as well about the fragilio markets, and maybe the need for a centrum bank to step back in to give support? So, you know, I think that the UK, I'm not going to say the UK, historically, we always use that phrase, right, Canary and a coal mine. However, I think in this particular case, the UK, what happened there is emblematic of what can go wrong. The immediate cause, certainly, was the mini budget, which was quite disastrous, the combination of spending and tax cuts clearly was, it was the wrong time for a budget like that. But we tend to forget, it was 17 years again in the making, we've had a very extended period of extremely loose monetary policy, and that forced the UK, where you have a higher proportion of defined benefit pension plans, the UK is in a different position. Let's put it that way, which is not to say that the US and other countries should not look at the UK and worry about the unknowns. We don't know where markets will break, and the reality is we are in a position where there is some possibility that something breaks. Will the Fed put, has it gone away? I think the Fed might be left in this completely internally in coherent position that the Bank of England is in where simultaneously buying guilt but will continue to raise rates. You're in a very tight list. In a sense. Sorry, go ahead. Yeah, and exactly, the Fed put, maybe gone for the stock market, but I think it will be coming back for the bond market. And, you know, actions have consequences, right? And policy actions have consequences. And we only have to look to the Bank of Japan to see an example where they have, you know, the Bank of Japan owns half of the JGB market and has completely tamed the bond market. You know, the annualized volatility of long JGB is three. In the US, the long treasuries have an annualized volume about, I think, 12 or 13. And so if you're going to make fiscal decisions that have wide ranging impact, you know, and you're a central bank that has really dominated, you know, the bond market as, of course, the Fed has, as the Bank of England has, as the Bank of Japan has, you know, you can't really leave that market. So I think that...",https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dp8PhLsUcFE,5524,2022-10-22 07:14:06

You haven't found anybody. The compound interest, the compounding of returns is an incredible miracle of business, finance and human existence. Everything you learn is additive every day and if you keep added and don't quit, it's an incredible miracle. And it's not just interest. It was always said about compound interest returns, compound business returns, compound human returns. They're all very additive because you learn every day and if you keep at it, it's very, very helpful. In your observation of investors, what do you think is the biggest mistake that average investors make? Selling at the wrong time. And they sell when the prices go down? Yes. Or, yes. Not keeping. People have conviction or if they invest for the right reasons, just keep at it. PSO now is your online home for weekly Boston Symphony Orchestra and Boston Pops performances.

17120," He just cut federal taxes and didn't cut federal spending. I don't know whether he does or doesn't, but that's not his program. His program is in fact to cut taxes significantly, 10 percent a year over the next three years each year, but also to restrain the growth in federal spending. That of course is Lewis Rokheiser talking with a pre-chairman, Alan Greenspan, on Wall Street Week back on October 24, 1980. Back when Alan was simply part of Townsend Greenspan and company, it was just before Governor Reagan was elected president, and the concern back then was about tax cuts without spending cuts, something that frankly we're still talking about today. The top movie back then was Goldie Hahn's private Benjamin and Woman in Love. You remember it by Barbara Streisand, top of the billboard, Hot 100, chart for the week. Still with us, Arsenal, Desai of Franklin Templeton and your intimate of Fidelity management. So, you're going to start with you. What's an investor to do in this environment where we do have inflation that seems to be broad, maybe entrenched, we have a Fed that's on the move, what does an investor do? What's overpriced? What's underpriced? Well, you know, the good news is in a period where there isn't very much of it, is that both the 40 and the 60 side of the 60-40 paradigm, I think are now, you know, really attractively valued. I mean, you can get a 10-year yield at a 10-year note at 4.2, a two-year note at 4.5. You can buy the S&P 500 at around 15, 16 times forward earnings. Now, that PE is only as good as the forward earnings, so we will find out whether the earnings hold so far they have. So valuations have had a tremendous reset from the overvaluation days, you know, following the COVID lockdown, when the Fed basically repressed interest rates down to much lower levels than they really deserve to be. And that raised, you know, asset price inflation in the stock market, because again, interest rates are an important factor in valuation. And so it's been a very painful nine months during which neither the 40 nor the 60 has worked. That's a very unusual environment to be in. And I think, you know, the good news is that if the Fed does overshoot, I think the 40 will really present a lot of value at 4% plus yields, and maybe the 40 will start becoming negatively correlated again to the 60. And if our recession is averted, then the 60, I think, will do well because earnings then will likely hold up. And valuations are now much more reasonable. So for me, the glass half full view here is that at least one of those two engines is going to start working. I can't tell you which one it is, unfortunately, but I do think it's not going to be any longer this monolithic market where basically nothing works. So now when will the bond market be the engine that starts working? Are bonds getting cheap enough now that it's time to go back in? They're beginning to look interesting. Let's put it this way. If I look at investment-grade bonds, I look at short paper. You know, we just discussed, her interest discussed that we were talking about 4.4, 4.5. I think we're getting to interesting levels. We're seeing something, finally, that we haven't seen for, again, close to 17 years, fixed income, delivering income. What a concept. I think income becomes more and more important as we look forward. I do think that 10-year yields are likely to still go up. But having said that, it does start becoming attractive. So over the coming weeks and months, I think the first step would be areas like investment grade because you're getting paid healthily to hold good credit. And our baseline is not to have a steep recession. We'll have a recession, but I think we might be able to avoid a steep one, which means that fundamentals can still look good. And furthermore, if I look in areas like high yield and emerging markets, we are now getting paid between 18-10% in these areas, which means that finally, liquid fixed income starts becoming a very decent alternative to alternatives, which up till now have really been the only area in the last multiple years that could deliver those style of return.

17121," two alternatives which up till now have really been the only area in the last multiple years that could deliver those style of return. So I actually, I'm also glass-hopped bullet at this point for the first time in quite a while. Yuri, and just coming back to you and just kind of cash flow away of looking at stock valuations, as I understand it, in fact you've taught me. In fact the Fed has been buying bonds, but they've also been buying tips. Is that skewing that as a measurement? It's interesting you mentioned that because I'm trying to, I'm trying to figure that out actually in my latest research, because the Fed owns 33% of the Bloomberg tips index. So that may not be all of all tips. So the overall number will be less than that. And so it makes you wonder whether there's any price signal left. But when I compare for instance the tips break even to the inflation swap market, which is a direct swap, I don't really see a tremendous amount of price distortion from the Fed owning so many tips. And of course the Fed owns a bunch of nominals as well. So maybe one cancels out the other. So I think the jury is still out, but clearly the tips market is saying a different message than the headline inflation numbers are because the tips break even are around two and a half across the curve. And that's totally different from an 8% CPI. It's a great discussion. I really owe it to both of you. Thank you so much. That's Senegal de Saia, Franklin Templeton.

China's closely watched party congress wraps this weekend and investors will be awaiting the likely release of GDP and activity data that were delayed during the meetings. When the reports finally land, Bloomberg economics expects them to show an anemic third quarter recovery. Elsewhere the Bank of Japan will likely stand pat on its ultra low interest rate and asset purchases, despite a plunge in the yen that's driving up import costs. And in Australia, the central bank's preferred measure of core inflation is likely to hit a 31 year high. It is a big week for European earnings. It's an even bigger week for European bank earnings.

But the big one really comes on Thursday with the numbers that we're going to get from Credit Suisse out of Zurich. But the numbers are not going to be the focus. The focus will be the upgraded strategic plan. The management is also expected to announce on Thursday in Zurich. In Frankfurt that day, we have the ECB on deck as well. We are expecting the ECB to hike by circa 75 basis points. We're also potentially expecting the ECB to deliver some changes to other policies, including the cheap loans it offers to banks in the form of teletros. We could see some shifts there as well. Friday, we get the industrials. We get Airbus and we get Volkswagen. More than 160 members in the S&P 500 are scheduled to report earnings next week. That includes big tech companies Apple, Microsoft, Alphabet, Meta and Amazon. There will also be earnings from UPS, Chipotle, General Motors, Kraft Hines and McDonald's. Economic data include the US government's first estimate of third quarter GDP. Crost domestic product did contract in both the first and second quarters of the year, but is projected by economists to have reversed that trend, rising by more than 2%. The week rounds out with Friday's release of the personal consumption expenditures data, which the Fed uses for its inflation target. That data expected to show a continued re-exceleration in consumer prices. David. Thanks to Julius Sally, Guy Johnson and Romaine Bostic. Coming up, what ails the Chinese economy?

17123," 10 years of remarkable growth. That's what President Xi Jinping of China focused on in his speech to the party Congress last Saturday. He brought about a historical rise in China's economic strength in the past decade. China's GDP has grown from the 55 trillion to 114 trillion and come to account for 18.5% of the world economy. Not a bad track record during Xi's time in office, but if President Xi had been willing to go back to before he was president, the story is even more dramatic. As Deng Xiaoping initiated the Open Door Policy in 1978, China's economy has gone from under $150 billion to nearly $18 trillion last year. Now that growth is slowing down, with possible repercussions for the rest of the world, according to the head of the WTO. If China's economy continues to slow, the way we are seeing that will have a big impact on what happens to the world economy. And US officials like Deputy Treasury Secretary Wally Adiemo say that the Open Door isn't as open as it used to be. In addition to having resilient supply chains, we want to make sure that American companies are competing on a level playing field with companies in China and around the world. And that's why we've taken actions like restraining the ability to ship some key components. But Bridgewater's Ray Dalio, who's been back and forth to China over the last 30 years, insists that despite all the problems, he wouldn't bet against Beijing over the long term. I think the longer term picture in China is still bright. Because I know the people, and I know the culture, and I think it's good, but they have major issues now. And when it comes to China, the person we turn to here at Wall Street Week is Debra Lair. She is the CEO of Edelman Global Advisory and Executive Director of the Paulson Institute. Debra, welcome back. Good to have you. We are all focused on President Xi and what's going on over in Beijing this week. Give us your sense about what we're learning. It strikes me that one of the biggest challenges he has is the economy and growing the economy. And yet I'm not sure we're hearing much about his economic policy. I hear a lot about politics, a lot about security. That's right. Xi Jinping gave his all-important work report at the beginning of the plenum. And it gave of a few previews of how he's going to start to look at the economy. One of the things that he's emphasizing is common prosperity, his slogan about how he brings greater equality. One of the things that he's looking at is also how the party can continue to play an important role in the economy. And also he did give reassurance to foreign companies that they will continue to push for market opening in key areas. So will we get a sense from the personnel that surround him of where it might be headed? Because as I understand it, eventually we will see him come out from behind the curtain. We assume every day assumes that he will get his third term. But there's going to be a critical question of who is with him as he comes out. Absolutely. The important thing, and we're all watching for this weekend, when the new party lineup is going to be announced, there's a lot of rumors starting to fly around, although not as many as there usually are. But it's a big guessing game because that will give us really our first clue into what the third term is going to look like. And I think there are three important things to watch. One is going to be what happens to Lika Chang, the current premier. Does he continue to stay on the standing committee? He's turned out of staying on as the premier, but could they make him the number two in head of the National People's Congress? Two, who will be in the lineup to then take the premier position? And the two leading candidates appear to be Wang Yang, who's viewed as being more open on the economic issues, and Wang Huniang, who really is an idiotia log. And the third to watch is what happens to Liol-Ha, who's currently the vice premier, who's in charge of the economy and finance. Does he stay? He has good relations with many foreign firms, or who really comes in to take his portfolio. Debra, one of the things that we watch.",https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dp8PhLsUcFE,5529,2022-10-22 07:35:41
17124," A, he has good relations with many foreign firms, or who really comes in to take his portfolio. David, one of the things that we watch in the West, and we may be right or wrong in watching it, is the extent of which the markets in some way play a substantial role in economic policy over there, it strikes me that it's possible to interpret President Xi thus far as moving somewhat away from the markets. A lot of what he emphasis right now is ideology. I think it's what he came out of, more than perhaps we've seen in the past. Absolutely, we're seeing much more emphasis on ideology under Xi Jinping. And if we look back under Jiang Zemin, Jiang Zemin was saying the party is big enough to include business. She takes it in a different way. He says the party is all encompassing, and it should be forced into business. And so ideology is playing a much bigger role. And so we need to keep an eye on how Xi's favorite slogan, common prosperity, is going to be implemented. China, surprisingly, is actually much more unequal than the United States. And one of the things that he's trying to do through this common prosperity, slogan is say there should be a cap on executive salaries. We should be looking at big companies, particularly the private sector, giving back to the community. And how that's going to be implemented at the same time when he's trying to grow the economy, when he's trying to encourage entrepreneurship and create jobs, is going to be a very tough thing for him to balance. Well, I was going to ask exactly about that, Debu, because through history, a lot of people have said we should have more equality, less inequality, whether it's income or wealth. But a lot of attempts to get that done actually do get in the way of growth overall. Absolutely. I mean, in China, and we've talked about this before, the overwhelming majority of Chinese companies are small and medium-sized enterprises. It's up into the 90s. They are responsible for about 60 percent of China's growth and about 60 percent of job creation. And so if you can't create the right atmosphere for them to grow, you're going to have a significant impact on China's ability. And right now, she's facing a lot of headwinds when it comes to the economy. He's got issues still to deal with with real estate market. It's one of the only places that Chinese people can invest. And obviously, housing prices are going down at the moment. The world is facing a global recession, and she is still very dependent on exports to grow the economy. He needs to find a way to unlock consumer spending. And that's very hard to do when you don't have confidence in the path of the economy. And particularly when you don't have the kind of social safety nets in place, particularly around health, that make people feel comfortable enough and have confidence to spend their money. If you put it a longer course of Chinese history because you've been really very active in China for a good, long time now, are we seeing something of a turn back toward Mao in a way from a Deng Xiaoping? Well, certainly we're seeing a difference in the way that she is governing the economy. The Chinese Communist Party has about 93 million members. And to put that in context, that's 10 million more people than the whole population of Germany. And he used this as the way to govern the economy. And so therefore, the party is involved in every aspect. As we look at this new leadership coming in, watching the ideology versus the technocrats is going to be really important and give us a sense of what the government appointees, which will take place next March, will look like and how they're going to approach the economy. Is there going to be this emphasis on a more socialist economy? Or are they going to be more emphasis in what they call the socialist market economy? The fact that they didn't put out the GDP numbers this week on time, I think, is very disconcerting for the world's second largest economy to place politics over just the standard transparency of publication of data is not an encouraging sign. Deborah, looking into your crystal ball there, what do you think this might mean for U.S.-China relations? It strikes me at least that going back five or ten years, a lot of it was about economics. It was about trade, things like that. Increasingly from Beijing, but also from Washington, when they talk about one another, it's about geopolitics. It's about Taiwan. And thehui's movement left a back a different undermining, system dies left now dus hue skh the",https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dp8PhLsUcFE,5530,2022-10-22 07:40:08
17125," of it was about economics. It was about trade, things like that, increasingly from Beijing, but also from Washington, when they talk about one another, it's about geopolitics. It's about Taiwan. It's about Russia. It's about security in the Asia area. Well, national security definitely dominates the headlines, and there are some very serious issues that we're dealing with. I was just in the UK and they were telling me Taiwan didn't even use to really be on their agenda, and now they're spending about 75 percent at their time. These are the China experts focused on this. So those are absolutely definite, important issues to watch, but I think the real story here is going to be what happens with the economic and trade relationship. Traditionally, it's been the foundation of the relationship and it's created the people-to-people ties and built some levels of trust. Without these exchanges, with Western companies reconsidering both because of the politics, but also because of the state of the Chinese economy and the complications that have come with dealing with COVID-0, they're reconsidering their strategies. And not having that level of trust, I think really is going to have an impact and ensure that there are going to continue to be fraught relations between the United States and China. Do you have Deborah Hoap's, if not expectations, that after we're through the party Congress and maybe actually after they meet in the spring and confirm that he's president of the country, that that will free President Xi up to reach out to the United States or will it embolden him to become even more assertive? Well, I think once we know what the lineup looks like, I think it's going to be easier to answer that question. I think whatever happens on the political front, Xi Jinping needs to find a way to grow his economy because his power both internally and internationally stems from their economic might. China right now is the largest trading partner to 70 percent of the world. The U.S. used to have that role 20 years ago. And in order to maintain that, he has to show that he can grow the economy and he can't grow the economy through ideology. He has to grow it through basic economics. Okay, Deborah, it's always such a pleasure to have you here. You are really are our China expert. That's Deborah Lair and she's CEO of Edelman Global Advisory. Thank you for having me. Coming up, we'll wrap up the week with our special contributor Larry Summers of Harvard. This is Wall Street Week on Bloomberg. Imagine simply climbing a cable into space. The concept is known as the space elevator. Not only could it significantly change how we leave planet Earth, but it could also completely transform humanity's relationship with space. And they're a scientist who think we could have already built it. We have the material, we have the technology, we have the lasers, we have the climbers, we have all of it. If a private entity wants to build it or a government, they can build it. It'll change society. We have no clue how colonizing in the space, how really spreading in the space really changed our society over the next 50 to 200 years. It'll be completely different.",https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dp8PhLsUcFE,5531,2022-10-22 07:44:24
17126," This is Wall Street Week. I'm David Weston. We welcome once again our very special contributor in Wall Street Week. He is Professor Larry Summers, of course former Treasury Secretary. So thank you so much for being with us Larry once again. Much of the week was consumed with the drama over the United Kingdom, which is good and serious business for people who are living in Great Britain. But what lessons might it have for the rest of us? Look at one level Britain is unique. They went through Brexit. They've had some unique political challenges that have taken place within their Tory party. We've rarely seen the kind of extreme incompetence that was represented by the original trust proposals. But I think there are two lessons that policymakers around the world need to heed. The first is that things can change extraordinarily fast if you lose credibility. Just as it takes a long time to grow a forest, but you can burn it down very quickly. Something similar is true with respect to credibility and confidence. And I think at a time of rising government debts and rising interest rates, that's a lesson to be careful that policymakers in many different countries need to take account of. I would say the second, more specific, lesson just goes to the potential instability in government debt markets. And that's got both a macroeconomic aspect that if your deficit projection starts to get out of control and your real interest rates start to rise rapidly, you can get into a kind of doom loop. And it also has to do with liquidity in the markets. And the possibility that you'll get a situation where they'll be selling, but there won't be buying, which will be get a kind of liquidation cycle. And I think given the magnitude of the increases and interest rates that you're seeing in other parts of the world, that's something that policymakers are going to have to be very careful of. I thought Secretary Yellen was right to warn about issues around illiquidity in the U.S. Treasury markets. I think we're going to need to be watching our own fiscal projections in the United States very carefully, because I think they're going to look different with current market interest rates. If you factor in the recession, it's likely to come. That's going to have some significant effects. If you factor in all the different steps that are being taken, whether it's the student loan debt relief or the emergency funding that's going to take place because of the hurricane in Florida, or the increases in national security expenditures that I think are almost inevitable. Given what's happening in other parts of the world, I suspect that the fiscal issue is going to need sooner or later to be back on the table in the United States. So I think that we can be amused, those of us who don't live there, by some of the things that are happening in Britain. But if we think of it as an experience that's entirely outside of any kinds of concerns that other countries could have, that would be a real mistake. Well, and Larry, as you say, we have to perhaps pay much more attention to the fiscal side, be a bit more responsible. That's at the same time that many people, and you included, are warning that we may hopefully head into our session here. In the past several years, it's thought that if there's a session, we can just write some fiscal checks for it. If we don't have that...",https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dp8PhLsUcFE,5532,2022-10-22 07:48:43
17127," Many people, and you included our warning that we may well be heading to a recession here. In the past several years, it's thought that if there's a recession, we can just write some fiscal checks for it. If we don't have that ability, that way it turns out Liz trust did not have over in the United Kingdom. What does that mean about our ability to pull out of it? What is the prospect that when we've had so many years of feasts, we may be handed for some famine on higher interest rates, lower growth, and lower productivity increase? Look, David, there's always a tendency at the beginning of the pandemic, or in the early stages of very problematic periods, to assume that everything is going to be resolved much more quickly than actually proves to be the case. Think about COVID. I was early on your program and was very worried about COVID. But I certainly didn't envision that it would be something that would still be on people's minds going into the winter of 2023. And I think it's a mistake to think that all of our economic challenges are going to be met quickly, particularly if we heed what I think would be the dangerous advice that are coming from the erstwhile members of Team Transitory that the Fed can back off already and not carry through on the increases that the market is now expecting. I think for that to happen would be to almost guarantee a protracted period of stagflation. As we had both, we lacked both price stability and confidence. I think we need to remember that, apart from anything we do with discretionary policy, we have a whole set of natural stabilizers that kick in in our economy. As the economy goes down, tax collections go down, as unemployment crosses certain thresholds, there are increases in unemployment insurance payments. But unfortunately, I think we fired the fiscal cannon so strongly that there's going to be limited room for discretionary fiscal policy if we have another recession. Finally, Larry, one of the other events of the week was the release for the release from the Strategic Petroleum Reserve by President Biden, who swears this is not a political issue. But could you give us the economic potential effects of those sorts of releases? David, I think the initials pro release was a powerful thing that over the last months has done a lot to contain oil prices. And I think the Biden administration was exactly right to do it strongly, do it for a long time, do it in coordination with others. I think it's much less clear how much scope there is for that policy to work further going forward. In part, that's because of the many of the constraints are on the refining side. In part, that's because it's a little bit like QE for the Fed. Whatever you put out there, you're going to have to get back in at some point. And that's going to have the opposite impact on oil prices. So I think you've got to be careful about that instrument from here. And I think that we've all got to be very apprehensive about the degree of confrontation that now exists between the United States and what might be called the Russia and Saudi axis. This is going to be a very complex time. And I hope that we get through it while avoiding oil price spikes. My guess is that that's going to happen. But I think that's a major downside wild card from here, both with respect to inflation and with respect to recession. OK, Larry.

17128," side wild card from here, both with respect to inflation and with respect to recession. OK Larry, thank you so much once again for joining us on Wall Street Week. That's Larry Summers of Harvard. Coming up, what's up and down with Great Britain? Bloomberg Stephanie Flanders gives us one more thought on a wild and wacky week for the British government and the economy. That's next on Wall Street Week on Bloomberg. Why do the biggest names in business choose Bloomberg? Great question. Great question. Best question I get all night. Top experts, great questions. We're going to be back. Finally one more thought and this week it comes from Bloomberg Senior Executive Interfer Economics and Government and it's about her native land. Here is Stephanie Flanders. I think Liz Truss started off with the right idea which is the UK has been held back by a slow growth since the global financial crisis. Actually in the two decades before 2008 we'd averaged around two and a half percent growth which was higher than many of our trading partners. We sort of caught up a bit with Germany. We caught up a bit with the US during that period. Since then growth has been less than half that and certainly much slower than other countries. It did make sense to focus on growth and it made sense to also to be spending some money in her initial mini budget on supporting households through a massive energy squeeze as we approach the winter. I think the problem for financial markets is that the government showed no willingness to engage with the difficult trade-offs that all governments are facing in this environment where they want to stimulate growth. They want to help households face rising energy bills but they don't want to make it harder for the central bank to bring down inflation and they don't want to be building up a lot of debt just at a time when we know the cost of money, the cost of borrowing all around the world is going up. So it was not what she did but the way she did it and the kind of gay abandon with which the government was proposing tax cuts that were not funded by any form of spending constraint and not targeted to the people who in this particular environment needed help the most. I think what we also saw in the UK, there had been this nervousness in financial markets that maybe dates back to the Brexit referendum that some of the constraints, the institutional constraints on policymakers in the UK that had prevented silly politicians from doing silly things that those have been worn away in the years in the tumult since Brexit. I think what happened when you saw the new Chancellor installed, the 7th since 2016, you saw potentially those institutions...",https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dp8PhLsUcFE,5534,2022-10-22 07:57:20
17129," Since 2016, you saw potentially those institutional constraints come back, but the Treasury, the Bank of England, is still in charge. That's the message to markets, even if politicians are still messing around at the edges. There's a lot of Shaddon Freude, potentially, and certainly there, but for the grace of God, go eye, central bankers and Treasury officials around the world, they are looking at the UK and wondering what's happened to this previously great nation, but they should also be looking at potential pitfalls that they too will face as we go into this environment in which interest rates are going to be higher. The cost of government borrowing is going to be higher, and potentially strains are going to be put on financial markets. We saw a particular investment strategy, the liability-driven investments in the UK, which are particular to the UK, mess up the pension market, and force the Bank of England to intervene, but we know we saw similar fragility in the US Treasury market back in March of 2020, and there may be other things out there that we should be nervous about, as we see this very significant shift to a higher interest rate environment. That does it for this episode of Wall Street Week. David Weston, this is Bloomberg, see you next week. Every Friday with 30 minutes dedicated to fixed income, I'm Jonathan Farrow, this is Bloomberg Railroad. We make it very transparent to the shopper before they accept an order. What the order is going to look like, how much we're going to pay them, and how much the consumer is paying them, and so they can decide whether they take an order or whether they refuse it. And that's the kind of flexibility that our shoppers really value, and the kind of transparency that they want. Are you seeing a labour shortage right now? And what are you doing to combat that? It's different in different places, or demographic of shoppers, these completely different from food delivery and our right sharing, where 70% women and half of them are moms. And that's because a lot of the job at Instacart is very different than just being in a car with strangers. It's about like going to the store, doing a good job of customer service, of really picking the right products for the consumer, and we are seeing that being very appealing to women. Welcome to the world of decentralized finance, Bloomberg's covering all things crypto, the people, the transactions, and the technology. Bloomberg crypto Tuesdays. Hello and welcome to Emma Barnett Neats. And this week I'm meeting the space expert and physicist Professor Brian Cox. And I'm really looking forward to asking him about how he gets his head around the vastness of space and to explain it to all of us or try to anyway. How he also goes about his daily life when he knows how insignificant we really are, and what he makes of NASA's new telescope and those amazing images.",https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dp8PhLsUcFE,5535,2022-10-22 08:01:47
17130," We really are. And what he makes of NASA's new telescope and those amazing images. Welcome to the programme. Thank you so much for coming to talk to me and to all of our viewers. And I actually wanted to start with the new NASA telescope. We'll come to your particular project in a moment. But it's named after the man who ran the agency in the 60s and oversaw the first man mission to the Moon, James Webb. What do you make of what we're seeing so far? Because it's pretty incredible. Yeah, it's a remarkable instrument. I mean, you think of the predecessor, which is the Hubble Space Telescope. I think it's almost impossible to imagine a world without that. Even if you don't know, the images that we're familiar with, the universe, many of them, the spectacular galaxies in star-forming regions, they're from Hubble. But the web is a significant step forward. And technically, one of the most important things is it can see what we call longer wavelength light, or infrared light. And that's important because if you think about, we want to see the first galaxies forming. So we want to understand how the first stars and galaxies formed in the universe. And so what you do is you look far out into the universe. And because light travels quite slowly across cosmic distances. Let's say you have a galaxy that's the most distant one you can see with the naked eye. It's about 2 million light years away. So that means that the light has been traveling for 2 million years to reach us. And it's a remarkable thing actually to think, when you look, it's called the Andromeda Galaxy. And if you know where you're looking, you can just catch you out of the corner of your eye. If you think about it, you're seeing that as it was, 2 million years ago. Yes, although I don't. Because it takes a light 2 million years to travel. I don't like being late to information. So that makes me feel very out of date. Well, it's remarkable. I mean, it began its journey before we had evolved on Earth. So in the time, it took, and that's the nearest neighbouring galaxy. The web looks so far out that it's capturing light that's been traveling for over 13 billion years. But the universe has been expanding. And so the light has been stretching. And so for the most distant galaxies, we're looking back back in time, almost to the big bang. The Hubble was not sensitive to that light. So that the web can see the formation of the first galaxies. It's essentially looking all the way back to very close to the beginning of time. And that's very important because we're not entirely sure exactly how those first galaxies form. The idea of what you just talked about in terms of how much time this has taken and what it's covering. Do you think we will ever be able to see the big bang? Well, we almost can. It's not the web telescope. There's something called the Cosmic Microwave Background Radiation, which is light that was emitted in the universe. And it's a very precise number. It's 380,000 years after the big bang. We should not very long at all about the universe is 13.8 billion years old. So we can see that. It's microwaves because it's been stretched so much by the expansion of the universe. Going back that the problem with light is that in those earliest times, the universe was so hot and so dense that light couldn't travel through it. So it was opaque. So you can't use light to go back earlier than that. But what we can potentially do, not yet. We're not good enough yet. But the technology we use to now to detect colliding black holes, which is another remarkable thing. But I'll leave that one aside for now. But we have the technology to do that. And that technology possibly could allow us to probe right back to this thing, the big bang. And again, whether or not that's the origin of time, we can talk about as well. Brian, you've dedicated your life to explaining the scale of the universe to people. You have a new world tour and show called horizons. What's the goal? Are you trying to teach people new things and understand the world they're living in better or what are you aiming for? Well, actually all those things. So it works. I hope on different levels. So I talk about cosmology. We've spoken about what we call the large scale structure of the universe, the galaxies and how they formed how the universe has evolved since the big bang. But also, I've got very interested.",https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dp8PhLsUcFE,5536,2022-10-22 08:06:07
17131," that what we call the large scale structure of the universe, so the galaxies and how they formed, how the universe has evolved since the Big Bang. But also, I've got very interested in my academic work in Black holes. And Black holes, and they're really evocacy things. I think everyone's heard of these strange things, these totally collapsed stars, from which nothing apparently can escape. But in the past few years, past few decades really, beginning work that Stephen Hawking really began back in the 1970s and many others. And we've begun to suspect there's a lot more to them. And they've started forcing us to reassess our understanding of what space and time are. And that's a really weird sentence you might think, well, space is the arena in which we live in time just ticks. But it really isn't, it looks like, from studying these things, there are building blocks of space and building blocks of time. And what I say in the show is, that's a mind-blowing idea. And I talk about that. But the key point is, is a great quote from Einstein, a beautiful story that Einstein told about when he was a little boy, he was six or seven years old. And his dad gave him a compass. And so he looked at the compass and he saw, well, there's this thing, this needle, and it always points north, points in this direction. So there's something invisible that I can't see that underlies our reality, that's making this needle point north. And he said, later in life, it was my first encounter with an idea, which is, if you look at nature carefully, and really pay attention, and you're lucky, you can catch your glimpse of something deeply hidden. Which is a beautiful phrase, something deeply hidden, which is the deep structure of reality. That's what our reality is. And so black holes, they're kind of a metaphor in a way. I talk about them as rosetta stones in the sky, that they're the things that, by studying them, and you say, why would we study these things? Well, in studying these things, we're beginning to get a deep, a deep picture of what our reality actually is. And that's a remarkable idea. But it's a beautiful idea that runs through all of science. How do you define a black hole? Well, it's in Einstein's theory, which again, it's a remarkable thing. It's probably in 1915, over 100 years old. But it's just a region of space from which even light can't escape. Bloomberg has enhanced search on the terminal to deliver what you need when you need it.

And I think we've moved from this attitude, from its indulgence, a waste of time, almost an illness that needs a cure. For something as universally important to human life as sleep, mysteries surrounding its necessity and utility have only just been recently uncovered. Some of our biggest discoveries were in the 1970s or 1980s. And so it makes that a really exciting field, because it seems as though we're uncovering new insights each and every day. Some scientists are going further to find out how sleep and what happens there can be harnessed to further expand our understanding. It's easy to memorize things that makes you smart. If you can spit back a lot of facts. But if you want to be wise, if you really want wisdom, you've got to know when and how and why to use that information. And that's what you bring, figures out what you're sleeping.",https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dp8PhLsUcFE,5537,2022-10-22 08:10:24
17132," And by understanding what they are and knowing more about them, what do we then learn? Well Stephen Hawking back in the 70s published a paper, the initial one was called Blackhole or explosions, just create tile for a paper. He calculated, he found out that black holes in his language, he said black holes ain't so black, they glow in the sky, like holes in the sky and they radiate and so over time they lose energy and mass and ultimately disappear of a huge time scales. And that's so important, I show this picture in the show that if you go into Westminster Abbey and look on the floor of Westminster Abbey on Stephen's memorial stone then you find his equation for the temperature of a black hole literally chiseled in stone on the floor of an abbey. So you might say why, why is it so important? This was the key, this was this Rosetta stone idea in trying to understand what happens, what happens to the stuff that fell in. When you thought these things existed forever, which is pre-hawking, then you think well it's okay, it gets locked up inside, it can never get out, we don't care. But the thing evaporates away, one day it will be gone. So then suddenly you have to be faced with this question, what happened to everything then? If I throw a book into a black hole, is it somehow possible in the far future of you collect all this so called Hawking radiation that comes off? Is it possible to reconstruct the information in the book? And that's been a question, simple question that's driven, this tremendous amount of research for 50 years and it was pretty much sold in 2019 actually in 2020, pretty much, I mean it's still a huge number of questions. But roughly, well, the statement is everything comes out again, all the information comes out. So everything that fell in, in principle, in the far future you could reconstruct the information of everything that fell in, it's just an astonishing idea. Because actually the last thing I'll say is that before that, before the Hawking papers and before this modern understanding, inside a black hole, just according to Einstein, sits the end of time, which is an astonishing thing to say, because we can see them. We have a photograph of one of these things in the centre of a galaxy too actually. And you're looking, when you look at that photograph, you're looking at the end of time in space. So then you think, well, if things go to the end of time, how does everything get out again? And that's the content of this tremendous work in theoretical physics. And this work, studying black holes, which is probably, it's one of those things that a certain kind of person says is useless, right? He said, why? Who cares? It turns out that the techniques that have been developed and the understanding that's being gained from looking at these things has got a very strong crossover with building quantum computers, right? Which is the quantum computers are in laboratories now. They have a tremendous potential to revolutionise our civilization, incredibly powerful computer devices. Yes, and also that's sometimes the defence given, isn't it, about, you know, what's going into man going back to the moon or woman going back to the moon? The other things are discovered in the pursuit of those missions. Yeah, I mean, it's always a cliche, but it's true, a friend of mine, an astronomer always says, when people criticise these spacecraft and they say, you know, let's say the James Webb Space Telescope, what, six billion dollars or so. But it's appropriate to point out that nobody put six billion dollars in a suitcase and launched it on the rocket. And the six billion dollars didn't go into space. It was spent on earth. And what is often the case, so putting aside the glory and wonder of the discoveries that are made, basically you're paying people to do high tech jobs and do research and build machines that operate at the edge of the possible. And history tells us that that tends to be extremely...",https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dp8PhLsUcFE,5538,2022-10-22 08:14:42
17133," and do research and build machines that operate at the edge of the possible. And history tells us that that tends to be extremely useful. You're inventing things and trying to do things that are difficult. And that expertise never stays in one place. It then spreads out across our civilization in ways that you can't really predict or even quantify. Indeed. And you did sound very excited early. I mean, you sound excited the whole time about all of this, which is infectious, even if people are trying to keep up, including myself. But when you talk about the golden possibility of there being life out there, and that question of, are we alone? Where are you with that? What do you say to people right now with the latest information? Well, so this, again, I think there's a cosmology, I say this in the show as well. It's one of the most challenging subjects, because at one level it makes us feel very, very small and insignificant. And it's true, you know, physically. I mean, the Earth is one planet around one star amongst 400 billion stars in one galaxy amongst two trillion galaxies in the part of the universe we can see. So we're definitely small, right? You can't argue that. Yes, you've clarified that. But, but, but. You're right. If you ask the question about life, the answer is we don't know. We've found nothing, nothing alive beyond the Earth. But I've missed it that we haven't been very far or looked tremendously hard, although to suspect there might have been microbes on Mars, because there was one's water on Mars, and it was geologically active. And all the things that we think led to the origin of life on Earth were present on Mars around the same time, about three and a half to four billion years ago. So we wouldn't be surprised if we find that microbes existed, probably subsurface on Mars, or maybe on some of the moons of Jupiter or Saturn, where there's water today. However, nobody expects anything more complicated than the microbes. And it's interesting. So if you look at the history of life on Earth, you have microbes around 3.8 billion years ago, pretty much not long after the Earth formed in geological time. And, but, if you look for evidence of complex life on Earth, then really there isn't any in the fossil record, until about 600 million years ago or so. So on this planet, for most of the history of the planet, there was slime, basically, single-celled things, doing interesting stuff, photosynthesis and things, but nothing more complicated than a single cell. And it's only in the last half of billion years or so, that you get this explosion of life on Earth. And only, as I said, it's only in the last, less than a million years that we've had home-issapiens on Earth. And in the last few tens of thousands of years, we've had a civilization. So here, it took pretty much four billion years to go from cell to civilization. And that's the third of the age of the universe. And so that leads many biologists that I speak to to suggest that whilst microbes might be common, civilizations might be rare. Actually, I asked a friend of mine at Great Physician Carol, how many civilizations do you think there will be in the Milky Way galaxy, a typical galaxy? How many in a typical galaxy? And he said, non. Non. And I think he's, I tend to say one. So somewhere between zero and one, probably. But that's a guess. But what do you, do you want that? I think it's a good guess. Brian, is that what it is? You sound like perhaps you have an optimism for it, and I wonder what's underpinning that? I would love that to be. And actually, because it worries me, and this is the way that I end my show, actually, it worries me that let's take that position, let's imagine that in our galaxy, 400 billion Suns, there's just us that thinks. Right, the microbes are all over the place, but in terms of things that think and can feel, and in a very real sense, bring meaning to the universe. All these things we've talked about, the beauty of these galaxies, they're not beautiful if there's nothing there to perceive them, right, they're just galaxies. So if that's eight in this galaxy, then the decisions that we make now, as a civilization, have a galactic implications, right, we destroy it.",https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dp8PhLsUcFE,5539,2022-10-22 08:19:07
17134," They're just galaxies. So if that's it in this galaxy, then the decisions that we make now as a civilization have a galactic implications. We destroy ourselves, for example, deliberately or through inaction. Then it's possible that we eliminate meaning, perhaps forever, in a galaxy of 400 billion stars. And so that's it. I think that leads you to, it's a good work in assumption that we have a tremendous responsibility in a sense, not to do that. So I would be much more comfortable with our current predicament if the galaxy was filled with civilizations. Then I'd say, well, okay. It would be rather stupid of us to eliminate all this beautiful culture and science and art and music that we built up. But at least there's someone else that's doing that. But I'm not actually sure there is. Access the financial world on demand. Here from leading economists, policymakers and industry experts, be alive and on demand webinars, only from Bloomberg. Start exploring to see what's moving the markets. Visit Bloomberg.com webinars. A lot of the satellites have propulsion systems they can kind of move to get out of the way of each other or change their orbit a little bit. It's a service that you guys offer to help these companies know how to maneuver their machines. Yeah, we offer a collision avoidance service. It's a subscription service. We'll send you an alert up to seven days in advance if your satellite's going to come dangerously close to a piece of debris or another satellite. Companies have been doing that for decades moving satellites around, but it's sort of like a harder problem now. The risk of a collision is a lot higher now. Just because we've installed so much more hardware into space, you have a big collision that creates a cloud of debris. And now all the other satellites are flying through this whizzing mess of debris as we add all of the new satellites into space, the risks of a collision, the likelihood of the collision is going up. How comfortable are you with space tourism and the pursuit of that knowledge and meaning being left largely to a very small group of rich men? You're right, the idea that the technology is used. If all it was useful, it was to send a few very, very rich people into space on a joyride, then there'll be a real criticism there. But that's not all the technology is useful. So I think it's important to understand that the space industry is about operating initially in near-earth orbits. And we've already industrialized that. We all use it every day. We all switch on our sat nav in the car, satellite navigation. It requires infrastructure in orbit. A lot of the stuff we know about climate change, resource use, and so on. That's coming from satellites. So I think you have to look at the space industry as a whole, really, and then say, well, it's not just about. The same argument was made for intercontinental travel by aircraft. And when the first aircraft were built, it was extremely expensive in the preserve of the rich. But of course, within a few decades, it had democratized travel. And we all take advantage of that every day. So I think that's the right way to look at space. It's not to focus on particular bits of it that we might not like for moral reasons or whatever it is. So it's actually, I really do advocate for the facts of looking at the whole industry, which is tremendously important now. It is. I mean, I am interested, though, that you did say, and correct me if I'm wrong, that all political leaders should go to space, perhaps for some perspective. Do you still think that? Do you still think that? Most of them should come back. Most of them. Most of them. That's enough.",https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dp8PhLsUcFE,5540,2022-10-22 08:23:39
17135," Perhaps for some perspective. Do you still think that? Most of them should come back. Most of them. That's the last part of that quote. Yeah, it was based on an idea, which is a very famous idea called the overview effect, which is well known that astronauts change their view of the... Not always as far as I'm aware. When they come back, they have a more positive view of the value of this planet and are very much more focused on preserving it as a beautiful place, perhaps a unique place in a galaxy, as I said. So I felt that... And I do feel that having had the good fortune speaking to many astronauts, for the people who make the decisions, the big decisions of our future, could have that experience. I think it would be good investments. It's extremely hard arguments to make. We should actually spend money allowing, you know, in our case at the moment, our Prime Minister writes, in the UK, you'd say, well, we just spend money sending Boris Johnson into space and bringing him back safely to Earth again, because it would change his view. So, I think I win that argument. No, but I think there's a serious point there, which is that it does seem to change people for the better when they see our Earth as it really is, which is a fragile thing against the blackness of space. So I think it's an argument that I would try to make. I would lose it, because it's very expensive. Do you want to go? Are you willing to go? I would love to, because as I said, I'd love to share that experience of seeing our world from space. I think it's really unarguably. It appears to be a life-changing experience, and it seems to change individuals for the better. You won't be scared. Well, I don't know. I mean, I remember one of my great heroes, John Young, who flew on the Apollo missions, walked on the moon, test flew the first space shuttle. And he said that anyone who sits on top of however many thousands of tons of liquid hydrogen, at liquid hydrogen oxygen and isn't a bit worried, doesn't understand the problem. So, it's probably right. Do you have people come and talk to you about faith? So they talk to you about how religion and that side of life fits into your level of knowledge, because I know you've traveled around the world talking to people. Yeah, a lot. It comes up as a question, because cosmology is the science of origins. And actually, with the study of black holes, I mentioned, we're even beginning now to think about what space and time are. So naturally, I say in the show, actually, I say when we talk about this, it's the moment of creation. So we're asking, was there a moment of creation? And that's the correct language to use, I think. Or it's the evocative language, but it's really what we're talking about. Did everything come into being? Or has it always been here? We actually don't even know the answer to that question, really. So yeah, I can ask you a lot, because I think cosmology is a challenging science that challenges us to think about these things. We associate that with theology or philosophy. And I think that's a good thing, because something I very strongly believe in is that segmenting or making little canisters and putting different bits of human experience or different music and art and theology and philosophy and science and segmenting them all is just the wrong way to look at it. What we're doing is a deep level trying to understand what it means to be human in this tremendous, potentially infinite universe. And so I, those questions get asked. And ultimately, I say, I'm quite straightforward. I say, I don't, I'm not a religious person myself. But the correct thing to say, even about the question, did the universe have a beginning in time, is we don't know. We don't know.",https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dp8PhLsUcFE,5541,2022-10-22 08:27:48

17137," Over the world. From the New York courts filled with mob bosses to those accused in the Me Too era, she has seen it all. So what is it like drawing Gilein Maxwell, Jeffree App's scene and Bill Cosby? Here's what's coming up. The now convicted sex trafficker Gilein Maxwell who were obviously making eye contact, when did you realize she was sketching you? She had, she was leaning on a piece of paper and she took out a piece of paper and she was going up and down, looking at me, looking at me, so I, you know, I knew as she was sketching me, you could tell when somebody's sketching you. And is it right? I mean, I don't know if this is right, but Weinstein asked for more hair in one of your drawings. He did. He was walking, I was sitting in an aisle seat and he was walking out with his lawyers and he looked over at my sketch and he said, can't you give me more hair? I just kept drawing and I did not give him more hair. Jane, thank you so much for talking to me and to our viewers today. It's lovely to be with you. And I wonder how it does feel to be the subject instead of the one drawing and creating the work. I really hate it and that's why I don't think camera should be in the court. Well, no, that would slightly put you out of work, but you've been in this line of work for more than 40 years. And I just wanted to ask because the clip that has gone or the image rather I should say that's gone viral recently is of the now convicted sex trafficker, Gelae Maxwell, drawing you as you drew her. Yes, that didn't make me nervous. It didn't make you nervous. No, sketchers are fine. I think if she took out a big fat camera and put it into my face, I'd feel a little differently. But was that not quite an audit experience? Because I imagine that doesn't happen that often. No, that it did happen to me about 30 years ago when there was a comedian named Eddie Murphy. I don't know if you know who he is. Heard of him? Yeah, definitely. He did a little sketch of me in a court case. He was the defendant or he was actually suing or some kind of dispute with his agent. And he was bobbing up and down and sketching, making fun of me, you know, like point of view. He did a little sketch of me on a little post it. And he gave it to me. And I have it here in my apartment somewhere. I found it within five years. It's still here somewhere. OK, so once in 30 years, it's definitely not the norm. No, it's not the norm. So it was odd. You were obviously making eye contact. When did you realize she was sketching you? She had, she was leaning on a piece of paper. She took out a piece of paper and she was going up and down, looking at me, looking at me. So I knew as she was sketching me, you could tell when somebody's sketching you. And it didn't put you off. It didn't really put me off. But I felt I better get this, I better sketch this because now this is what's happening in the courtroom. And I have to draw what I see. Yeah, I was just going to say, I imagine that was pretty meta. You know, you being drawn and her drawing you. And also do you think there's a kind of, is there a psychological element to that, do you think? There could be a lot of people are throwing in their opinions about what it means and what it meant to her, what she actually was trying to have power. I don't really know. I don't read minds. I can't figure out what she was doing, but I had to draw her. And I was really happy she was looking straight ahead as you may be right now. Because a lot of times I'm seated right behind it, and I can't see anything but the back of their head. So if I can get a front view, it's great. A lot of times photographers outside of a courthouse will shout out somebody's name as when they're trying to get their image just so that they get them to turn front view. So it was an important thing for me. And I wanted to keep it going as long as possible. It was great. Well, that's interesting. Well, I mean, did you get to see what she drew? Did she leave it on the table? I did go running out. When I was a break and I went out and ran after her lawyer, I said, can I see, you know, I'd like to know what was she sketching? And she said, you know Jane, I can't discuss that with you. So I really don't know. I never saw it. You're of course drawing as well. And it has been a remarkable time at the pandemic where you have a lot of people's faces now obscured with the mask. Yeah, how does that be?",https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dp8PhLsUcFE,5543,2022-10-22 08:36:34
17138," with the mask. Yeah, how was that be? Um, it's partly easier and partly harder. It depends on who the person, Glenn Maxwell had a great eyebrows and eyes and a good shape hair because that's all I've got to work with. It made it harder for me to sketch because I use pastels and I'm used to blowing some of the dust off. I'd be going, but then it's in my mask. So it was hard for me to wear a mask and work. By drawing everybody else in a mask, it's not as interesting, I'm sure, to make a portrait of somebody with a mask on, but I had to draw what I had to, what I saw. Well, some have also felt, you know, it's hidden people's faces at the time where you do normally get. Certainly even going into the court, some people have felt, you know, it's been helpful to those who are on trial in some way. I think it's been hard for a defendants team, the lawyers to pick a jury because you can't see their faces. It's hard to read. You want to pick a certain type, you know, when you're trying to select a jury, I think it really made it hard for them to... People look different when they take their mask off. I was working with a reporter with a mask on and then I saw them outside with no mask. I had no idea that was the same person. No, I know I've had that exact same experience myself, quite a lot of times and I just want to see in check that I've actually met that person before. With this particular image, because it really did captivate people. I know you're not actually on social media, but this really did go viral. I know you can keep the images as well that you draw, you submit a scan of them or you give a copy and then you keep the original. Have you been offered money? Oh, yeah. Sure. Are you going to sell it? No, I'm not selling it yet. I have a collection of almost 43 years of sketches, thousands of them and there's certain precious ones that I think are more important to me in my collection to make it all worth whatever. And I don't know, I'm not ready to sell it. Caraaaaaaaaa... Bloomberg has enhanced search on the terminal to deliver what you need when you need it.

And it's a safe bet that some of them will eventually find their way to the seasweet. Just about something you were saying though with Gilaen, which is I think speaks to your work, is that you've got to draw what you see. And it's obvious that you have had to take the emotion out of it. Take my emotion out of it. Yeah, exactly. Because if somebody else shows emotion, I do have to put that in. But it's fine.",https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dp8PhLsUcFE,5544,2022-10-22 08:40:58
17139," motion, out of it. Take my emotion out of it. Yeah, exactly. Because if somebody else shows a motion, I do have to put that in. Of course. But of course, fine. I would have to capture their motion, but I have to try to not let my feelings go into the drawing, which sometimes I do have reactions on some cases. Sometimes I feel like I cry sometimes. And you know, tears are really bad for pastels. I just try to be neutral and journalistic. I witness some horrific cases. And I see horrible crime scene photos. Like I just did a Derek Chauvin case. I watched that tape over and over because it was shown from several different angles. And it was really hard for me to do that. I had to look. I had to look. I had to draw it. I couldn't look away. People have an instinct to look away from a horrific scene like that. But I had to really study the face. It was just horrible to watch somebody die over and over and over. What impact has your work had on you in your life outside the court? I think I do painting as well. And my subject matter is not crime. And it's just silly escapes of just more pleasant things, I think. You know, I don't want to see or watch any crime scene movies. I don't need, I just need to get escaped. But I don't touch pastels when I leave court. I only will use oils in my painting. Right. No, because I imagine some of what you've been exposed to. I don't know if it's made you... Has it changed the way you feel towards people? Do you sometimes think about the worst things you've seen and heard and maybe struggle to trust people or think of the bad things people can do? I try... People's faces don't, as I was saying to somebody about Bernie made off. He looked like such a kind old gentleman. It would be so easy to just fall prey to him and like give him all your money and trust him. You can't really always tell by somebody's face what they're really like inside. That's maybe something I've learned from trials, watching people. You can't always tell. There's a brilliant con artist out there who just can mask their true self and just have to be careful. Have you ever been frightened in calls? I was once... I was sketching a group of... I think I was at the Embassy Bombers. It was a group of terrorists and there were a lot of them and they sat them all inside the jury box because they had nowhere else to put them. They let me sit in the well, which is where the tables for the lawyers would be. I was sketching and one of the defendants jumped out of the well, leapt over. It was sort of like I think I'd just seen a Tarzan movie with my son. And he leapt over with both arms, took his feet and started running across the courtroom. The judge stood up and pressed the panic button and the marshals were standing in the back and started running up and tackled the guy against the wall right next to me. I was terrifying. I got on the floor. I held my past L-box. I was really afraid, which is resting on a little tripod next to me. I did not want that to go on the floor and I just squatted down on the floor next to that. So that was a pretty odd... Yeah, well, I mean, if you are regularly in the room with big criminals, something at some point, I'm sure, is going to go down. That was the time that it went down, right? And I had never been allowed in to sit where I was sitting again. They always... Then it was just a time where they just were extra cautious since that point about where they let anybody sit. What's it like sitting opposite household names? I'm thinking Arkele and to an extent Harvey Weinstein. Okay, household name. These are all sex predators. So it's the me-to era of a lot of the cases I've been covering. There are so many me-to's. What's it like? I don't know, I think they're all perverted in different ways. Like Weinstein, you know, they... I think when people have a lot of money, power and fame, it corrupts them. And they just become deviance. Is it right? I mean, I don't know if this is right, but Weinstein asked for more hair in one of your drawings? Oh, yeah, he did. He was walking... I was sitting again and I...",https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dp8PhLsUcFE,5545,2022-10-22 08:45:12
17140," Right, I mean, I don't know if this is right, but Weinstein asked for more hair in one of your drawings. Oh, yeah. He did. He was walking. I was sitting in an aisle seat and he was walking out with his lawyers and he looked over at my sketch. He said, can't you give me more hair? I just kept drawing and I did not give him more hair. You know, I mean, imagine as a woman and also someone who just heard the details you just heard, but he's also still going to be someone who's used to power that that is not something you would respond to pretty well. He's not going to have power over me, so I do not give him more hair. Although many, many years ago, John Gotti did ask me to like shave off his chin a little, double chin, and I did do that. Oh, why? Were you scared of him? I was, I don't think I was directly afraid of him, but there were a lot of mob trials back then in the 80s, a lot of them. I was surrounded by a lot of mafia people back then. I was a trial after trial after trial after that was like me to now back then it was a mafia trials commission trial. John Gotti, the pizza connection trial, there was, I can't remember, they went, they were constantly, there are five different families in New York and there were so many trials and they were switching, I couldn't have been following it anymore. I was switching power like Gotti had, during the commission trial, one of the defendants there vanished because Gotti had taken him out and then he rose to power. That was a whole different era. It's interesting that there would have been phases like that. The mobs now me too. Yes, that seems to be the way the news works. It's not, I hardly, I can't even think of a mafia trial I had covered recently. Maybe six years ago, nobody seems to care anymore. Now it's me too, me too, me too. There was an era of financial crimes. That was Martha Stewart and Bernie Matoff. There were a lot of financial crimes for a while and then terrorists was a big theme for a while. Have you ever, I mean a lot of the people you've mentioned don't get out of jail. Some of them will of course. Have you ever met them in real life? Once they get out of jail, they probably served such a long sense that I don't know. I've never met them after their trials. I'm usually on to the next trial. How long do you have to make the drawing? That all depends on if it's an arraignment. Somebody during the Boston Marathon bombing arraignment. He was there for six minutes. People timed it. I usually have no idea because I lose track of time and everything. I'm just so arraimants go very quickly. And in six minutes, I have to get as much information down as I can and then flush it out from my memory, finish it up. I can't obviously complete it in six minutes, but I have to have as much information as I can get. And sometimes I have a witness, the same witness on a, a, a amount of trial. They may be in the stand for days, the same person. So I have a lot more time. I might do a wide shot with a lot of people in it, take my time. I might do a wide try to tie a shot of it varies. So everything depends on what I'm covering that day and how much time I've got. Access the financial world on demand.

When you think of cutting edge technology at sea, you might be thinking of stuff like this. But there's an incoming revolution on the high seas that isn't quite as sexy but could be significantly more impactful. Consumershiping is the key component of global trade.",https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dp8PhLsUcFE,5546,2022-10-22 08:49:31
17141," that isn't quite as sexy, but could be significantly more impactful. Containershiping is the key component of global trade. About 80% or 90% of all the world's goods are transported to some point. But there's a significant unseen cost to the modern era of global commerce. About 3% of all the world's CO2 emissions come from shipping. 3% may not sound like a lot, but that's roughly comparable to the entire CO2 output of Germany. Since reducing trade isn't a likely option, what about a technological improvement? To help reduce the emissions from these well-stocked maritime behemoths? And early on, I believe you drew one of the first people to be executed by electric chair in Alabama when it reintroduced the death penalty. John Evans, what was that like and how did it impact you? It was pretty awful. The equipment malfunctioned. Flames came out of the knee pad. They came out of the helmet. And I think they had to redo it a few times. I looked around the room. You don't see who pulls the switch. And I look around the room and nobody's hands behind the back. I felt very responsible like I did it. My hands felt dirty. And then I remember driving home during a thunder lightning storm. I had to go another hour away to get to where I was staying. And driving through puddles, torrential rainstorm. And I felt like this is a message from the higher power. And I felt like I don't want to be part of murder. I think murder is wrong. I don't think the government should be doing murder. And I don't want to do it. I don't believe in the death penalty. So that was that in terms of those drawings. That was the only time I covered the electrocution. Wow. There are other horrible things. As I just told you about Derek Chauvin trial, that was pretty hard to watch. And I suppose being in New York as well, there's a particular, as you've described, there's a particular level of crime at times, you know, with the mafia, a lot of violence. There's been a lot that you've had to see. And then you also have the celebrities because a lot of the time this is where this happens. Well, New York City is running a violence going on all the time now, more than ever. Even that's why I'm not playing there painting on the streets of the city anymore. I don't feel comfortable standing out there, putting an easel up and getting lost in an easel. I don't know who's going to come up behind me. There's a lot of emotionally disturbed people. And there's a lot of violence. And it's just horrific. And the city is changing. And it needs to get fixed. It's pretty bad right now. New York City. So the trials I'm seeing, I feel safe. I'm usually there's a lot of court officers or marshals or CSO standing around. I feel like I'm safe to draw there. It's not like sitting on a subway where somebody could get angry if I'm sketching them. Nobody's going to come attack me. You went viral again. I mean, maybe you've been viral lots of times and you don't know because you're not social media. But there was also another time, which I think smart at all of the time. Because of your depiction of Tom Brady, the American footballer in court over a cheating accusation, people saying that your picture didn't look like him. I mean, that's not the same. Of course, as having art critics look at your art for art's sake. It's a kind of different lens on it. But does that upset you? Does that bother you? It did back then a lot. But I think I learned I had a lot of emails and there was fan to it depends on what team you're rooting for. Because some people love to sketch it. Some people like how could I make him look so ugly? You know, I didn't I don't tend to flatter people when I'm doing quick courtroom sketches. Well, you I'd imagine that not a lot of them look their best either. It's their day in court. That's right. They just come in the fluorescent lights and they get this over with. Get me out of here. Have you ever been surprised by a famous person coming in who doesn't actually really look like you thought they would? Just at the moment, I remembered Uma Thurman coming to court who's very beautiful and she sat down in the witness box and nobody would ever think the sketch I made was harboring.",https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dp8PhLsUcFE,5547,2022-10-22 08:53:51
17142," At the moment, I remembered Uma Thurman coming to court, who's very beautiful, and she sat down in the witness box, and nobody would ever think the sketch I made was her, because she's not looking glamorous. And I'm sure they've been a lot of these. I just can't remember them. You've mentioned around your work and how important it is to capture what's going on. And for you, I can tell it. It's a very important part of the justice system and transparency. But what do you say to those who think it's time for cameras? Well, as I said in the beginning, I don't really like being on camera. I'm not comfortable with it. I think it gives a lot of power in an editing room to the media. They can make people dump. When they see something on camera, they believe that's the truth. It's a photo. They don't lie. But there is power in the way things are edited. Things can be shown, clips of certain expressions that may not show the truth. When a sketch is shown, I don't think people have that, oh, this is the truth. This is where it just captures a feeling of what's going on. So I think you have to watch out with cameras in the court. They may be quiet or now they're not as obtrusive. They don't make loud clicking noises anymore. All that may be true, but what is true? What is the truth? Well, I mean, your country, where I am, this has been a big thing. What is truth, post-truth era, those sorts of things. I suppose it's one of those debates, isn't it? And I'm interested as well as a journalist because of transparency in courts and how we best do that. Well, courtrooms are open to the public. People are allowed to come in and watch trials. They're not sealed off unless it's a sealed case. And if a camera's running 24-7 in the courtroom, maybe that will give more information. But TV news tends to edit clips of what they think as the story they want to tell. And if the judge is yawning, they may show that and say, oh, he's not paying attention. Anything could happen. And I think there probably are witnesses like me who don't feel comfortable in front of a camera. Yeah, and also victims, of course, as well. Victims, of course. I can't even sketch their likes, it's not permitted. Not permitted to sketch their face. So I have to, during Galen Maxwell and Weinstein and plenty of cases, I've had to draw featureless faces. So I can get the gesture, maybe the tears, hands, hair, but no, I can't let their whole likeness show where somebody could pick them out and say, oh, I know. And jurors, I can't show their face too, especially anonymous jurors. I mean, in the case of Galen Maxwell, bringing it back up, a lot of people make a big thing of what the person looks like when they're found guilty. People want to read into that moment, don't they? Do you draw that exact moment, that response to the verdict? I'm watching what's going on. And if she broke down crying, yeah, I would draw that moment. But she didn't really have any reaction at that moment that I could see. Is that quite common? Yes. It's common. People don't always react. Maybe they're in shock, I don't know. Yeah, what a moment. What many moments you've been in in people's lives recording the biggest moment in many ways often for the very worst reasons. But sometimes they are exonerated as well, of course. And that will be a very important moment as well. Speaking of mafia trials, the last one I did, he was exonerated in a courtroom, erupted with his fans, like cheering, yay. They ran out, celebrating. So that's rare though. Yeah. Jane, if you could do it all again, do you think you'd go into this line of work knowing what you know about it? Yes, I do love what I do. I think I'm very lucky. I love drawing people. I'm very lucky I found a way to earn a living doing it. I feel safe. And I love it. And I would do it all over again, yes. What I've loved talking to you.

Some of our biggest discoveries were in the 1970s or 1980s. And so it makes it a really exciting field, because it seems as though we're uncovering new insights each and every day. Some scientists are going further to find out how sleep and what happens there can be harnessed to further expand our understanding. It's easy to memorize things. That makes you smart.

It's the largest fund ever raised by a single investor. Joining me on this edition of Bloomberg Studio 1.0, CEO and founder of Han Ventures, Katie Han. Katie, it's so great to have you. Great to be back here in the studio with you, Emily. I want to start with a vibe check. Okay. What state of the crypto cycle are we in right now? It was hot. Yeah. And then it got pretty cold. Well, look, Emily, zooming back because I've been in crypto for a decade, if you can believe it. We've seen crypto be really hot and then all of a sudden not. And so we've seen this before, however, I think one of the things that's a little bit different now is with each new crypto cycle, more and more people come into it. And so it's more and more pronounced each cycle. And I would push back on, it's not. I think it depends on what area of the ecosystem you're looking at. We think developers think crypto and Web3 is still really hot. I am seeing a lot less of those. We're all going to make it hashtags. I am seeing a lot less of them too, although I am spending less time on Twitter. So maybe that's why. But with each cycle, there are new acronyms. What hasn't happened is a crypto winter in the midst of really serious global macro conditions. So we have inflation, kind of at record highs for our generation, in our lifetime. And then we have also a war that's broken out in the Ukraine. And we have a number of other factors going on here. So that's very different. There was some serious carnage out there. Socius, Luna, three-houros. What's been your takeaways from what? I don't want to sit here and tell you that algorithmic stablecoins are bad, because I actually think they're really interesting. However, I think what happened is you had, in this case, you mentioned Luna and Tara. That was an algorithmic stablecoin that was getting pretty widespread adoption relative to what the tech could do. I didn't realize you spent your teenage years living in Egypt and learning Arabic. Tell me about your upbringing. I was always uprooted. My dad worked for a large company. And we were always moving just when I would get comfortable in one space. And I think, actually, that's pretty important. If you fast-forward and look at my career, I'm comfortable being in uncomfortable situations. I didn't know a lot about venture when I got into it initially. I didn't know a lot about crypto when I got into it initially. And I was OK asking questions. I was OK not knowing the local acronyms or the Namanclature of a particular field. And I'm taken right back to my teenage years in Cairo, moving from Houston, Texas one day to downtown Maddie in Cairo the next day. You studied law. I did. You clerked for Supreme Court Justice Anthony Kennedy. That's right. You became a federal prosecutor. You were taking on prison gangs and the mafia. That must have taken a really thick skin. I was doing it at each 25. And now if I take a step back and you know, I think that happens at different points in your career. Like, whoa, if I would have analyzed that a little more at the time. And I'm kind of in some ways glad I didn't. I just dove right in because I felt it fascinating. There was a human aspect to it and people's stories. And I felt like those stories mattered. So I was drawn to criminal law and became a federal prosecutor. And I did cases involving violent crime, but then really mistriing cases, being back in the courtroom, being before the grand jury. Like the prosecutor you would see on TV, going to try those murder cases. Doing those two hour closing arguments. That's right. And so moved out here to California. I died at the largest prison gang in the world at the time. I was on motorcycle gangs, hostage taking, bank robberies, armed bank robberies. There was really not a kind of criminal case by that point in my career. I hadn't done it. It was right around that time, 2012. One of my bosses came in and said, let's have that same energy that you brought to those gang cases, to those murder cases. And let's go ahead and have you investigate this new criminal technology that we really need to look into and possibly shut this down. So you created the first cryptocurrency task force. How would you describe it? Fortunately, several of us in the government realized at the time. And so I was living now in the U.S.",https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dp8PhLsUcFE,5550,2022-10-22 09:07:04
17145," really need to look into and possibly shut this down. So you created the first crypto currency task force. How did you describe it? Fortunately, several of us in the government realized at the time it's not possible, also not desirable, because Bitcoin is not an entity. It's not a person, right? It's a protocol. And it would be like saying, let's go shut down cash. Let's go shut down the internet. It's not possible. Probably wouldn't be a good idea, either. I was using crypto and technologies like the Bitcoin blockchain, because that's all it exists at then, this is 2012, 2013, to actually uncover criminal activity. So I didn't think that that technology was bad. Frankly, it was a tool that helped me uncover the various activity. And by the way, it was a step-level function improvement better than compliance by banks. I'll just go ahead and say it. That's a little bit controversial. But I had spent a decade subpoenaing large financial institutions and five times out of 10 didn't get back what I needed. One case I worked on, and people always say, oh, you shut down the Silk Road. What actually happened? I was looking into something completely, not having to do with anything at all of the Silk Road, and came across some, what looked to be some kind of odd activity. And it turns out that a couple of federal agents on the Silk Road Task Force out of Washington, DC were croaked. And that is the case that I ended up in dining. And I ended up prosecuting those agents, and they both went to prison. So that's the aspect of what Silk Road case that I worked on. I would never, never have been able to uncover that criminal activity by those agents, because they were federal agents. They knew how to cover their tracks. Had they not used Bitcoin blockchain. So that technology right there, if they had just used wires or cash or even bank wires, we would never have uncovered that. Just how hard is it to launch a crypto fund in front of scratch? MUSIC MUSIC Japan's critical role in the global economy is changing as the world recalibrates. After decades of stagnation, Japan's leaders are forging a more innovative and sustainable path forward to revitalize the nation. Corporate giants, policymakers, and pioneers tell us how they're doing just that. Every week on Japan ahead, right here on Bloomberg Television. Back in 1997, I was interested in the following question, which is there are a bunch of the dinosaurs called Saurapod dinosaurs, which had really long skinny necks. So Apatosaurus is an example. Now, it was a really long skinny tail. So I made a computer model that showed that, in fact, the tail of these Saurapod dinosaurs could actually act like a whip, a bullfip. Now, the way a bullfip makes that cracking noise is because the tip of the whip actually goes about twice the speed of sound. And that crack is a sonic boom. I think the way they got a date was to impress the females by making loud booms. So you became kind of a crypto convert after this. You joined the board of coinbase. That's right. Very early on. How did you and coinbase and Brian Armstrong come together? I hosted an event here in San Francisco at the Federal Reserve Bank. And I believe it was there that it wasn't just Brian. It was a lot of what I'll call legitimate actors in crypto who wanted to usher in this new wave, this new ecosystem. And then we brought together the heads of all kinds of agencies, really in an effort to kind of talk about building bridges. The government and the crypto industry were never going to see eye to eye on a lot of things, but we did think there were some commonalities. Coinbase is a company that has suffered. They've been losing share. The valuation of the public markets has plummeted. Why do you think that is? And how do you think it can be fixed? Yeah. Well, I think again, a few things it's tied to. One, a large aspect of coinbase.",https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dp8PhLsUcFE,5551,2022-10-22 09:11:10
17146," The public market has plummeted. Why do you think that is and how do you think it can be fixed? Yeah, well, I think again, a few things it's tied to. One, a large aspect of Coinbase's business now, of course, is trading revenue. And that's down when prices are down. And the company's been very transparent about that long before going public. I mean, also, if you look at its S1, it specifically identifies that. And just how volatile crypto cycles are. So I think that's part of it. It's judged by public markets as a technology stock, or as a financial services company. By the way, I think it's both. I think it's not just a financial services company. I think it's so much more. I think it's really a portal to this whole new ecosystem. You were also on the board of OpenC until recently, there's an insider trading situation or accusation going on there. Coinbase has also had employees accused of insider trading. How much is this happening within crypto companies and within the industry and how big a problem is it? I think crypto is under the microscope. So where you have a case, two cases, three cases, in crypto ecosystem, which now is a trillion dollar industry, I think multi-billion approaching trillion dollar industry, you're always going to be able to find examples like that. So I don't want to make too much out of a handful of cases. That's that. The company, Coinbase, OpenC, take these things incredibly seriously. Along with your position at Coinbase, you became a partner at one of the most storied venture capital for industrial Silicon Valley in the United East and Dresden, Horowitz. What was your experience at A16Z-like? There I met Chris Dixon and I met Ben Horowitz and I met Mark Andreson. And I had worked with them for just about a year, maybe a little bit over when they asked me to come and co-run their crypto funds at Andreson Hearts. Again, I jumped at that chance. And I think really that speaks to the fact that, as I said before, things are a hell yes or there are no. And it was a hell yes for me. So Andreson Horowitz is the kind of place where if you make a partner, you don't leave. How did Mark and Ben respond when you said, yeah, I want to leave to start a crypto fund of my own. As you might know, Emily, they're an anchor. They're an anchor check into my fund. And I'm very grateful for that. Mark and Chris and folks like them are also personal LPs. So I felt very supported when I shared that decision. And I will say that it was not running away from Andreson Hearts. It was running to another opportunity. And crypto is not, what do they say? It's not a spectator sport. It's like, you're in it. It excuse very young. It's 24-7. It's global. And it's hustle. And that's a trade-off. It's a life trade-off. And at this point in my career and in my life, if I was going to continue to make that trade-off, I just wanted to do it and do it in a way that was really true to me. So you struck out on your own? Yes. To launch on Ventures, what gave you the courage to do that? What was the spark that lit the fire? Yeah. That got you to say, I need to do this and do this now. Sure. What I set out to do was to continue to invest in this ecosystem that I think is so broad that decision was very purposeful. And the timing was very purposeful. We have an early stage fund that does seed stage, Series A, even Series B. And then we have what we call an acceleration fund, which is, it's not a growth fund. It's a crypto growth fund. And I think those are different things. But it's later stage. It might be crypto-publics. Certain kinds of public tokens were set up to hold tokens and participate in the token ecosystem. Or later stage companies. I mean, there are now several crypto, many crypto unicorns. The space has become really competitive. Even though you say, crypto's had its ups and downs, the thing is, a lot of people in some of those last cycles have seen the kind of venture style returns that can be had in crypto. And so you've had a lot of new funds enter the space. And that's driven up competition. So what differentiates on ventures then? From all of these other crypto funds, or even the more traditional venture capitalists, like entries in Harowitz or Sequoia, they also have crypto funds now. Well, I think a lot of traditional venture capital funds now have crypto funds. It used to just be like a regulatory designation. It was like, are you an RIA, which is a registered investment advisor? I would say for crypto founders today, it's not enough to just be an RIA, right? They, frankly, I don't even know if a lot of them care. That's a regulatory designation. What crypto founders today want to know is, do you live in Brith crypto? Do you inhale the discourse?",https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dp8PhLsUcFE,5552,2022-10-22 09:15:35
17147," Right, they, frankly, I don't even know if a lot of them care. That's a regulatory designation. What crypto founders today want to know is, do you live in Brith crypto? Do you inhale the discourse? Are you part of the community? Do you participate in governance? Are you going to be staking these kind of crypto verbs out there? And if you're not really in this space full time, I think it's very hard to run a successful crypto fund. We don't have a hedge fund component. So we're not sitting here buying and trading and selling. That's a hedge fund structure. And there are crypto hedge funds. We're not one. We're making seven to 10-year bets. Just how hard is it to launch a crypto fund from scratch? You know, it's hard, but it's not impossible. We don't have a crystal ball. I don't know. I can't predict cycles, but I knew that we were in a cycle, where you saw so much further an excitement around the space. And I already talked about what makes this different. But I think one thing also is we are a nimble strike force. We don't fish in the same pond. We have the crypto natives. We have efficient execution. We have operators, seasoned operators, who really know how to stick the landing. And I think that's reflected on our culture. I would say the only thing that's changed in our strategy as a result of the market correction is really more of a focus on early stage, but we still have our late stage fund. And when we see valuations, which I think will still see correct, spoiler. I think we'll continue to see some corrections. And so we might deploy our later stage fund a little bit more slowly. It might not be on an even 50-50 cadence. And that's OK. Long-term, our strategy hasn't changed. Long-term, we're committed to this space. How much do you think valuations are going to correct? It's just, I can't give you a one-size-fits-all answer because crypto is not a monolith. You have some crypto companies that really follow more of an enterprise-sass business model. You have others that are layer one protocols. You have still others that are consumer-facing applications. And I think one of the things we're seeing right now is the infrastructure layer. And that's where we're spending a lot of our time, by the way. And we think more and more use cases will come about when the infrastructure layer is in place. So my own view is we are not rushing to deploy. We're certainly not getting caught up. You do get VC FOMO. I try not to avoid that. You know, look, I think it's very easy to get into that mindset, right? It's because it's a competitive sport. It's a competitive space. And I think I'd be lying if I said, that that doesn't influence anyone. I try to, what I do, and I think I do differently, is I try to take stock of that. Oh, that's the FOMO mentality kicking in. That's bad. Again, you don't want to over-correct, though. What we look for is we look for amazing founders. It doesn't matter if I think valuations will correct. If there are amazing founders, there's a huge tam. We also look for what's your regulatory plan? If you're launching a token, what's your plan to comply with the law? What's your plan for security, by the way? We've seen a lot of hacks in the space. We want to really dive in there and make sure that the founders have been thoughtful about, especially if they're custodian customer funds, keeping those funds secure. If it's a cross-chain bridge, what are the exploits? Have you changed your strategy at all, given the downturn? What? Have you backed out of any deals or decided not to do certain deals? Because the conditions have changed. Don't you raise the phone? We have decided not to do certain deals. We've never backed out of a deal. We have decided not to do a few deals. Because? Because we think that pricing was ahead of progress, candidly. And we might have been wrong about that, Emily. We might have been wrong about that. But I think if we were wrong not to do a couple of deals, better that we might have been right. Because if we were wrong about that, I think we can find a way to still invest in those projects later. Well, one thing I'm hearing is that a lot of dry powder has just sifted up. Because all these funds raised a lot of money. Yeah. What was the biggest fund ever for a single person, not just a woman? Yeah. Anyone? Are you confident you're going to have a place to put all that money? I am. But if I don't have a place to put it, I'm not just going to go willing, nearly deploy it. One of the things that we told our LPs, even during the period when we raised our fund, which was when crypto was undeniably still on a bull run, we said that we are going to be pretty steadfast, sticking to a tier deployment cycle. And I think one thing that's changed is that might have lengthened. It certainly hasn't shortened. But we will, again, we have, we feel very good that we have the capital to back routines when we see them. So you think we're going to fall behind the United States? We already are falling.",https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dp8PhLsUcFE,5553,2022-10-22 09:19:59

And we're falling behind. No one covers the world like Bloomberg. The pressure cooker just got far too hot in banning him for the government to handle.

What about NFTs? Are you concerned about the declining demand? We are going to increasingly live in a digital world. And I happen to think that if you live in a digital world, you're going to want to own digital goods in that world. You're not just going to be satisfied to rent them, which is what we do now. We buy our content from walled gardens without digital scarcity, which is what NFTs unlock. You don't really own anything. You're subject to the whims of a platform. And I think NFTs and digitally scarce goods fundamentally change that. I think you'll see NFTs back again. But we are spending a lot of time in the infrastructure layer. Like I tell you, zero knowledge, technology, scalability. We think of that as the plumbing. If you think of the fiber-hubtic cables. Remember, you couldn't have had YouTube and Netflix with dial-up. You couldn't have streamed content. The same is true of crypto use cases. We think that there will be a lot of new use cases unlocked when the infrastructure is there, when it's more efficient, when it's more user-friendly. And so we're spending a lot of our time there. President Biden issues this crypto executive order. There are a number of ports that are coming due. What do you want to see from the administration when it comes to regulation? Are you optimistic that we will get there? Yeah. We were so delighted to see that executive order. This is not something you should normally be delighted about. But why we were is because it was to us a real recognition that this is a US government saying, this field isn't going anywhere. This field is growing. It's growing so much that we are going to direct every single agency in the federal government to come up with a plan here. I think we take a step forward, but then you see we're a big government. We're a big system. We have states. We have local entities. So we take a step forward with the EO. And then we take some steps back sometimes too. And I think what I see as crypto founders are confused by that. They're starting to think, well, I could go to this jurisdiction where there's a single regulator. And you don't have 50 states with different rules. It's the US government that needs to start taking stock of the fact that right now, Emily in China, there's a quarter of a billion ECNY wallets, a quarter of a billion. We're still talking about whether there should be a government central bank digital currency. We're still studying that. So you think we're going to fall behind the United States? I think we already are falling behind. Fall behind China. And we're falling behind. What are the dangers of falling behind China and the rest of the world? This is years ahead. So I don't want people to take a headline and say, oh, I think the US dollar will be no longer the global currency. Reserve global currency. I'm not saying that now. But fast forward decades. And if you no longer need to use the dollar because you have an alternative, I think that's a real problem. What would we use instead? Well, I think that there are going to be stable coins out there that people who have access to a smartphone will use. There is a demand for it. We see 285% of your growth with stable coins. So people.",https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dp8PhLsUcFE,5554,2022-10-22 09:24:11
17149," That people who have access to a smartphone will use. There is a demand for it. We see our 285% year-over-year growth with stablecoins. So people are clearly liking the idea of this. Now, again, there have been some spectacular failures too, but not all stablecoins are created the same. But I think the important thing is that we really do need to not just quash innovation. What do you think of how Gary Gensler, the chair of the SEC and how he's approaching it? One of the things that I hear from founders is that they're very confused because they get told, come in, register, just come in and talk to us. But you have the one company who's done the ultimate act of going in and registering Coinbase, filed an S1. And still, there's a lot of saber rattling still going on, I think. And again, I don't want to single out the SEC. And I don't want to suggest that anything they're doing is bad. I do think that right now there's a lot of confusion. And one of the pieces of confusion stems from the fact that, you know, and it started with the ICO, Mania back in what, 2016, 2017, I can't even remember which year now, where the SEC was very loud about securities. A lot of them were securities, but the space has changed. And so to still view it through the ICO lens when so much has happened over the last five years in the space, I think is a mistake. What do you have to say to the skeptics out there who just don't believe in the future of Wem 3? And don't see where this is going. Yeah. I would say don't judge the current state of innovation by the end state of innovation. I hear from a lot of these skeptics. And by the way, I'm friends with a lot of these skeptics too. I don't only want to live in a crypto bubble. They want to see the use cases, especially if they're not technical. Well, when am I going to use it? What will I use it for? And I think one of the things that's not appreciated is how quickly the infrastructure here is catching up. And once you have really scalable blockchains that can handle a lot of thorough put and are very efficient, I think that unlocks a whole lot of use cases. People are spending more time on screens. That curve is up and to the right. Whether we like it or not, that is the future. I mean, those who have kids know that kids spend more time online. They want digital things too. And I think to dismiss it, it is a bit generational. I do find not always, but it is a bit generational. If you talk to kids about being able to have money online, they instantly get that concept. They're comfortable not having to hold something in their hand to think it has value. Take us to the end state. Do Google and Amazon and Facebook and Apple still exist? I believe they will still exist. I mean, it depends what you talk about when you talk about the end state. I mean, I think that I think for decades, those companies will still be around. But the important thing is I think this new ecosystem is going to represent a challenge to them. I do think that those entities, decentralized forces, are coming and will cut into those entities, profits and revenues. So we have a little rapid fire section. If you could belong to any altcoin tribe, which would it be? Gosh. There is no way I'm answering that, because I will get trolled on Twitter by every other altcoin tribe. I'm a crypto maximalist.

We all remember that time at the middle of March of 2020 where the world changed. And for packaged food in general, that was a great thing. For packaged food broadly, anything you could stock up for a meal time, it was an incredible run to the grocery store. The kind of volumes no one really ever expected. Anything that is center store, shelf stable and the supply chain could keep up with it. Boomed. Consumers stuck at home are finding comfort in comfort food. And they're stocking up on snacks as new COVID variants threaten to create new supply disruptions. Mondalees, the maker of Oreos, Cadbury and many other iconic brands has been keeping a close eye on these developing trends. As we went through the pandemic, we started to realize, hmm, in our categories, biscuits and chocolate. The consumption is going up. There is the need for physical and mental well-being and chocolate and biscuits provide some sort of relief to these 10 stays. Few companies are better positioned to provide that relief than Mondalees, with a portfolio of more than 60 brands led by nine global powerhouses ranging from chocolate to crackers to cheese. And few snack food companies have a broader consumer.",https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dp8PhLsUcFE,5556,2022-10-22 09:32:55
17151," And led by nine global powerhouses, ranging from chocolate to crackers to cheese. And few snack food companies have a broader consumer base. Mondalees draws more than two-thirds of its revenue from sales outside the United States. But for the company to make the most of its opportunities, CEO, Dark Vanderputt, depends on CFO, Lucas Aramella, to cut through the clutter and keep this huge ship on course. When the pandemic started and when we started to realize that this was going to take on a global nature look as the CFO started to play a key role, make sure it was clear for everybody in the organization what the expectation was. I mean, this is the most recent performance of the company. As you see, most of the business is doing quite well. Like every CFO in 2022, Aramella faces some headwinds, global supply chain challenges, inflation, and ongoing uncertainties around the pandemic, just to name a few. But he brings experience in savvy that gives Mondalees executives and investors confidence in their chief future officer. He is like a walking and psychopedie of knowledge. He doesn't forget anything. He has an understanding of the details of a business that I've very rarely seen in any person. Defining the CFO role as only finance is very limiting. I think the key differentiator is about understanding the business, knowing the business, making decisions, and be selective about what you do, how you do it, and when you do it. When I talk about countries, it is because I visited them, I spend time on them, and I know our products, I know our people, I know our customers. Lucas Aramella has been at Mondalees since 1996, joining the company in his native Italy. Over the ensuing two decades, he worked in Latin America, Europe, and North America. I tell my daughters, I have three daughters, I always tell them that when they ask me, what is your job? I study. I have a lot of study in my role. I want to know what's going on in the countries, etc. And so it is about different products, different consumers. We tend to believe that all consumers are equal, they are not. The issues you deal with in the US are very different with issues in Latin America or in Europe. And so I think it's a huge benefit to have grown up in the company. I came from the outside, so the combination of the two of us, that gives a huge strength to our business and the way we look at things. CEO, Dirk Bandeput, arrived at Mondalees in 2017, and a year later, Tapsaramella, to lead the finance team. I enter the company as new, and you start to look for somebody that can really be your sounding board on what you're thinking. You can play ping pong, I call it, with him about ideas and so on. That started very early, and it sort of grew over time. Our CEO, particularly, and our board, they are looking for someone that can understand the business, can drive decisions that are sound from a business standpoint. Especially for a company that has such strength in its local market management. That CFO role effectively gets reframed when everything's less decision-making is inherently a little bit less centralized. If you're going to keep a P&L, whether it's a formal P&L, or it's a marketing P&L, you're going to measure something. And you're going to do it on a local market area, as opposed to a business silo globally, that inherently creates a challenge that Lou has been able to solve. It requires more capabilities that maybe you wouldn't think of a traditional CFO role, where you'll oversee a finance function. The ability to drive decisions became critical in 2020, when the jolt from the pandemic suddenly disrupted the company's traditional path of the company. This is traditional pattern.",https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dp8PhLsUcFE,5557,2022-10-22 09:37:08
17152," The ability to drive decisions became critical in 2020 when the jolt from the pandemic suddenly disrupted the company's traditional patterns of performance. At the beginning of the pandemic, I didn't really know what was going on with the business because you can imagine in places like India, for instance, the business came to a complete stop. The India for us is an operation that sells more than $1 billion a year and all of a sudden we went to zero sales. And I didn't know what was going on not only with our people but with the business itself. I didn't know if we had cash and for how long that cash would support the operation. So a boost the consumption in the US but then India closed suddenly and our sales went to almost zero. So dealing with this variation around the world and how to make sure that as a global company, as a total company, we go through this in a way that would allow the best for every single country around the world that required a lot of attention as you can imagine from the CFO. I have to say we bounced back tremendously well. I have to say if I look back at the last couple of years and I look at the numbers, it seems like the pandemic didn't happen to our business at all. Mondalees revenues haven't missed a beat rising year over year in both 2020 and 2021. The company projects even stronger top line growth in the next two years. But maintaining margins may be challenging with supply chain still under pressure and the cost of labor and materials rising. I've never seen physical supply chain disruption like this. Sure, normally you get cycles, you have to take some pricing to cover the cost inflation but it's not like you can't get the products to the shelves. I think it starts with labor shortages around the world that's causing knock on impacts on freight costs, on ingredient costs, on physical movement of plants. I'm not necessarily worried about supply at this point. I'm more worried about prices and prices, particularly around logistics and the run transportation have been going up worldwide. Are they hitting your margins or are you passing those on to the consumer? In the US, for instance, we just announced pricing of 6%. Across the portfolio. That is a vote that effectively saying this is not transitory. If you're passing on those prices of the consumer, that's here to stay. Are you not expecting some of those input costs to go down then anytime soon? I don't expect them to go down anytime soon. I think transportation, for instance, has been quite high in terms of inflation for the last three years. I also know that packaging costs and costs related to some of our commodities are going up and have been going up. So far, despite the highest food inflation in decades, leading producers have been able to pass on costs to customers. Mondalees saw US retail sales take a healthy jump in December 2021 versus the previous year. When you pass those costs on to the consumer, you are confident that they can accept those higher prices? I am. And I also would like to say that it is not necessarily a straight price increase. We use what we call revenue growth management. It is optimizing the size of the packs that is providing multiple choices. For instance, based on consumer occasions, you might realize that you don't necessarily carry with you all the time a big pack of Oreo, but so making the product available in smaller sizes is critical. We optimize promotional spending. And so making sure that promotions in terms of that, which means the price benefit that you give to the consumers and in terms of frequency, they are optimized. And so it is a full array of things that we are trying to leverage to make sure that there is the least amount of elasticity. But reality is, if you look at the market, you see prices going up and volume going up. So the old concept of elasticity, higher price, lower volume is not necessarily there anymore.",https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dp8PhLsUcFE,5558,2022-10-22 09:41:28

Mondalee set a long-term target of 3% organic net revenue growth in 2018 when it launched a new consumer centric growth strategy. And the company is not backing off that goal. Reality is, I believe, the 3% plus algorithm is achievable for this company. Also, we have been making acquisitions. We have been adding around about a couple of billion dollars of revenue of platforms that are high growth single digit in terms of the revenue potential. I think going forward, we now have a recipe. We are growing our global brands. We have developed local brands that play on the needs of the local consumers. We have found a financial algorithm that allows us to constantly increase the investment in our brands. Coming up, Mondalee has developed an appetite for M&A. Lucas Aramella tells me how the company makes sure that its acquisitions deliver maximum value. He's about, yes, feeling geographical gaps, but it is also about ensuring that we feel gaps in our portfolio. This is Bloomberg. Take that. Be prepared. Be ahead of the game.

So before you invent pioneer, disrupt, before you change the world, Bloomberg. Mondaleys is a young company with old roots. It was created in 2012 in a split with craft foods, which dates all the way back to 1932. In its early years, Mondaleys was a takeover target, attracting the attention of billionaire activists, investors, Bill Ackman, and Nelson Peltz. Peltz pushed for a merger with PepsiCo, and when that failed, he later joined the board to oversee a cost-cutting push. He'd taken a chunk of shares, put pressure on the company, eventually took a board seat from 2014 onwards, and really just said, don't worry about the top line. If your margins, if your operating margins are only 12%, why are you worried about the top line? You've got to focus on improving those in order to create long-term value for the company. So with that in mind, they did exactly that. And for three or four years from 2013 to 2017, 2018, we saw monstrous margin improvement. So when Dirk van der Pooke came in, his remit was to get the top line going. And he did. It's because of the work that was done before I arrived that we were able to focus on growth after my arrival. Let's now focus on what drives our growth, building our grants, investing more in our grants, getting distribution in the channels where we were under development, building our geographical presence.",https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dp8PhLsUcFE,5559,2022-10-22 09:45:50
17154," drives our growth, building our grants, investing more in our grants, getting distribution in the channels where we were under development, building our geographical presence and so on. Mondalease is also building through acquisition. Since 2018, the company has added about one and a half billion dollars in revenue in deals across a number of consumer segments and geographic markets. If you think about the latest acquisition of Gita, that is a platform that allows us to start competing in croissant with a seven-day brand. We can apply our brands to those portfolios that we acquire. So it is about, yes, feeling geographical gaps, but it is also about ensuring that we fill gaps in our portfolio. And particularly in the case of Bakesnext, we are very keen because it is a category that is massive. There is no consolidation in that category yet in terms of manufacturers around the world. It is high growth and we can apply our brands and now we're know how to deliver cost synergies. I think what Mondalease has done is very small. They've targeted areas that are still quite fragmented, but growing and profitable. So areas like snack bars, areas like cakes and pastries. And I think the deals that they've made are pretty small. With a growing lineup of brands and a widening global footprint, portfolio optimization is a priority for Mondalease. Portfolio optimization is really ongoing. Priority is as a company, we have a lot of brands and a lot of local brands that mean a lot to our local consumers. So the Indian consumer and the way you reach them and target them is very different than the way you would reach and target an American consumer, for example. Yes, it is. Having said that, one of the biggest success stories in India is Oreo. And we have been able to sell quite a bit of Oreos in the last couple of years. I think we crossed the $100 million mark for that brand in India. And so there are a lot of nuances, but there are also a lot of similarities. Our brands still have a huge runway of growth for instance, Oreo. One of our biggest brands is growing double digit or close to double digit for a $3 billion brand. That's pretty impressive. In 2020, Mondalease opened its new global headquarters in Chicago. One of the places Lucas Aramella spends a lot of time is this conference room where teams can display and discuss data, stay informed and stay connected. Here we can track and monitor the performance of our company throughout the world of our competitors. We can measure and take a look at balance sheet, cash flow, etc. And every month we spend three hours with the CEO in this room where we go through a Q&A session and where we analyze data, we point to things that are working very well, where we need to make further investments. But we also talk about things that don't work that well. And so we have follow-ups with the segments and the regions and the business units about it. When Lucas Aramella isn't crunching numbers or working with his team to solve strategic problems, you can often find him on his bicycle. It's a past time he tries to pursue every day. It is about performing well, but also having a strategy on how you compete with others. It is an individual sport, but it is also a team sport. And it gives me the opportunity to talk to a lot of people and see an always moving environment. Always on the stationary bike or do you have an outdoor bike? I also go outdoor and we are in Chicago. The temperature outside is around about 10 degrees this days. And I have to say yesterday I went out with my bike at freezing temperature. And yeah, I prefer going outside if I can. They say the physical toughness makes you mentally stronger as well. Maybe that's part of it. Yeah, I think cold is just a perception. If you don't think about it, you can go and exercise outdoor.

17155," Lucas Aramella shows me around Mondaleez's glittering new global headquarters. He tells me how he sees the future of office work. We want to give our people flexibility and if anything what we have learned over the last couple of years is that we can run the company effectively from remote. And helping a chief future officer is as much an art as a science. I think to be successful in a role like this it is not only technical knowledge. It is about passion, it is about caring. This is Bloomberg. It is crucially important and I think we've moved from this attitude from its indulgence a waste of time almost an illness that needs a cure. For something as universally important to human life as sleep, mysteries surrounding its necessity and utility have only just been recently uncovered. Some of our biggest discoveries were in the 1970s or 1980s and so it makes that a really exciting field because it seems as though we're uncovering new insights each and every day. Some scientists are going further to find out how sleep and what happens there can be harness to further expand our understanding. It's easy to memorize things that makes you smart if you can spit back a lot of facts. But if you want to be wise, if you really want wisdom you've got to know when and how and why to use that information. And that's what you bring figures out while you're sleeping. In 2020, Mondalees moved its global headquarters from suburban Chicago to a building in the city's booming, Fulton Market neighborhood. The roots of the company are half being in Chicago. I think when I thought about opening a new headquarters, the main thing we were looking for was to make sure that we were in the middle of the consumers and Fulton Market where we are is one of the areas in the US with the highest number of millennials and generations. He has a percentage of the population. About 400 employees are slated to occupy these new offices, which were designed with productivity and community in mind. We wanted to have a lot of common areas and make working easier for people. And so we have a lot of light, as you can tell. We have a lot of shared areas. The meeting rooms you literally walk in and the computer who caps on the screen almost automatically. And so we wanted to make these a contemporary, fashionable place and something that is easy for people to use as a space. But over the past year, the new space has been largely empty. It's grand opening postponed, as Mondalees, like so many companies, complies with public health guidelines and many employees work from home. How are you dealing with a still remote workforce, a labor force that is demanding flexibility? We want to give our people flexibility. And if anything, what we have learned over the last couple of years is that we can run the company effectively from remote. I still believe there is a lot of value, particularly for young people to come into the office and absorb a little bit the culture of the company. And I know for sure that many people that work for me, they would like to come to the office and have that social aspect of working that is somewhat missed. Do you think this flexible work from the office, work from home, is with us to stay? I think it is with us to stay. I know for sure that many people don't like spending hours commuting. And I know for sure that it might be more productive if they spend that time doing something else, working or spending time with their family. So as a company, we embrace flexibility. If the future offers flexibility to workers, it also offers opportunity to businesses, to assess their need for office space and potentially redo-",https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dp8PhLsUcFE,5561,2022-10-22 09:54:27
17156," If the future offers flexibility to workers, it also offers opportunity to businesses, to assess their need for office space and potentially redirect some resources. It has been different country by country and so there have been some countries where we have reduced the office space and we are putting that money back into the business either by giving more opportunities for people to operate as they like and giving them the tools that they need but also investing in our brands. It's all about investment for Lucas Aramella and he realizes that patient long-term planning yields the best returns. What's the biggest challenge in the next 10 years for you? The biggest challenge is about managing costs in a way that is sustainable because as a company I don't think we can shift away from growth. And so that good balance between cost management and investing is something that is required and sometimes I have to say it is challenging to cut costs in a context where as a company we are pursuing growth. Mondalease is also pursuing growth in a sustainable framework. The company targets a 10% reduction in emissions across operations and 100% recyclable packaging by 2025. I.S. Aramella if these goals are achievable just three years away. I think they are. A lot of companies are talking about it but I can tell you there is a lot of belief in the management team specifically that these are the right things and we have to do them because not only our consumers because it is right for the planet, it is right for our children, it is right for futures and our actions. That's the biggest change that a CFO role will undergo in the next 10 years. I think it will be about how we as CFO, CFOs run the company. It is the role of a CFO. As I said the information availability is quite extensive these days. I think as leaders we will keep on thinking about how we can make the company go better. But I also believe it is important that we spend time grooming our successors and the role of a leader today is about thinking about what is needed for our people in the next five to 10 years and making sure we equip them to be successful in five to 10 years. It is completely different than what it used to be. What then would be the biggest piece of advice you would give your successor? I think to be successful in a role like this, it is not only technical knowledge. It is about passion, it is about caring, it is about making sure that the future generations have something in their hands that was built over time by people like us. They have to love Oreos, right? They do. Lucas Aramella clearly loves what he does. He believes in his company's products and he's using that passion along with a whole lot of data to better its financial prospects. That's what makes Lucas Aramella a chief future officer. I'm Taylor Riggs, this is Bloomberg. So as you look back on your career, what would you say is the best investment advice you've ever received? Probably the best investment advice that I never received but that I've lived my whole life around is surround yourself with really good people. I thought about it just today like I do many times, you know, what makes a great investor. A great investment firm is comprised of people who are optimists and pessimists and realists because in the intersection of the debates that go across that wide range of personalities is where you find truth. It's part of the reason I'm so focused on freedom of expression. I see it my own four walls, the robust and false and debate.",https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dp8PhLsUcFE,5562,2022-10-22 09:58:49
17157," personalities is where you find truth. It's part of the reason I'm so focused on freedom of expression. I see it my own four walls, the robust and fulsome debates around how we commit our capital, what defines a good idea, what businesses to build or pursue. That's what drives the success at Citadel. And I've been very fortunate in life to have always had a group of friends who really push me, who make me better. And here I get to work with three and a half thousand colleagues who in their ways make me better each and every day and collectively as a team. We've had the opportunity to have an incredible impact on the financial landscape around the world. We will never break, we will never break. Build on a foundation strong enough to stay. We will never break, have the water rises and the mountains shake. All of them will remain. We will never, no, no. Call it the rescue week with a president trying to rescue buyers at the gas pump, earnings trying to rescue troubled markets and a British government just plain needing a rescue period. This is Bloomberg Wall Street Week. I'm David Weston. This week, special contributor Larry Summers on having to make hard choices to get inflation down. If your deficit projection starts to get out of control and your real interest rates starts to rise, you can get into a kind of doom loop. And Deborah Lair of the Pulse Institute on whether President Xi's ideology can get China's economy growing again. She's facing a lot of headwinds when it comes to the economy. It was a tough time on global Wall Street, but nowhere was it tougher than at number 10 downing street where Liz Truss is on her way to becoming the shortest serving Prime Minister in British history. Forced to resign after concluding she just couldn't get done what she'd set out to do. I cannot deliver the mandate on which I was elected by the Conservative Party. I have therefore spoken to his majesty the King to notify him that I am resigning as leader of the Conservative Party. It wasn't easy for President Biden either as he continued to fight high gas prices for which he largely blamed the oil companies and counted with yet another release from the Strategic Petroleum Reserve.

17158," through the month of December. The market spent the week looking for some form of rescue from earnings, and they did get a bit of it from companies like Netflix with Reed Hastings giving thanks. Well, thank God we're done with shrinking quarters. So that's a big feeling of we're back to the positivity. But Tesla didn't help much by disappointing on sales, though Elon Musk predicted it would make it up in the fourth quarter. As our factors ran, we're looking forward to a record breaking of Q4. So it's really not going to work. It looks like we'll have an epic end of year. And although Goldman Sachs earnings were a pleasant surprise, Chief DJ officer David Solomon said they have a fair amount of work to do. Importantly, talent is moving around tremendously at Goldman Sachs to align behind David Solomon's new, new vision. What is this? The remix. I like that. Oh boy. And at the end of what was a wild week, the markets did find similarly finally with the S&P 500 up 4.74% for the week, while the NASDAQ was up 5.22%. And it was all pretty much driven by anticipation of where the Fed is heading, as the yield in the 10-year climb for much of the week. But after peaking over 4.33% mid-day on Friday, it fell to 4.2% to end the week. While the two year, well, the two year fell 13 basis points on Friday alone after speculation grew that the S&P might just slow its rate hikes after November. To take us through the week in the markets, we welcome now Yuri and Timmer, he's director of Global macro for Fidelity Management and Sinaldecy, CIO for the Franklin Templeton Fixed Income Group. Welcome both of you back to Wall Street Week. Good to have you here. Sinalde, let me start with you because so much of this week, I think, was driven off of fixed income, particularly those treasury rates. So what did we see this week? And why were there so many apparently violent moves up and down? So you know, David, I think that we're going to continue to, it was a crazy week. But it's been several crazy weeks. I think until the market gets a sense of where the Fed is going to go and stop, we're going to keep getting these wild bouts of volatility. We've been expecting it for a while. In a sense, you know, there was not that much of news in the Fed saying that they're close to being done. Well, of course they are. We already know that we're going to get up to 5, maybe 5.25, maybe a bit more, but quite early in the New Year, it's pretty clear that they will be getting close to an end. We get a 75. Maybe we get another 50. After which do we get another 50? Another 25? I think the more interesting thing is what happens after that? Once the market feels that they know that the Fed is not going to pivot on a dime, I think we might get to a point where we stop seeing these wild back and forth. Because these are truly massive moves in the Treasury market. And I would just note that every single data point is going to carry with it this level of gravity in terms of the moves that we see until we get to the stage that the market buys what the Fed is selling. And that is they're going to raise and then they're going to keep it high for a while. And you're in where are we headed? Where is the Fed headed? I look at Bloomberg right now, the Fed futures rate looks like it's about 5.05. At one point this week was up close to 5.2 in terms of a terminal rate. Yeah, so when you look at the SOFR curve, it peaks at around 5%. And you look at the implied terminal rate. It's around the same. The markets have been in a relentless mode of price discovery this year. And the glass has been half empty for the last nine months where every time we think maybe the markets are bottoming and the Fed's going to be close to being done. That moving target starts to move again in the wrong direction. But I do think we're getting to a more glass half full mode. And I think that's what the stock market is starting to signal here that at this point the expectations for the Fed are so bad. That meaning they're going to go so far that the possibility of a surprise may start to go more in our favor. So maybe the Fed doesn't have to go all the way to 5. Maybe only needs to go to 4.5. And the financial conditions have tightened significantly.",https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dp8PhLsUcFE,5564,2022-10-22 10:07:33
17159," So maybe the Fed doesn't have to go all the way to five. Maybe only needs to go to four and a half. You know, financial conditions have tightened significantly. So maybe the Fed is closer to being done than we think. But, you know, as Sunnell mentioned, that's only half the equation, right? Like, even if we know with clarity where the Fed's going to go and when, whether it's four and a half or five or five and a half, we don't know what the path will look like after that in terms of reverting back to a neutral policy. And we don't even really know what neutral is. Is it three percent? Is it three and a half? But, you know, I think the Fed is pretty committed to getting inflation back towards its target of, let's say, two, two and a half percent. And, you know, we're a long ways from that. And so I think the risk is not so much that the Fed overshoots or undershoots in the near term, but that it's going to take longer to get back to a neutral policy after it gets to that terminal point. So, you're, you know, we were talking about this earlier today. And I, when I listen to what you're saying, I can't help but feel that for most in the market, there is this desperate desire to believe that we have the Fed that we've had for the last 17 years. And we can't because the environment is so different than it has been. Well, maybe not last 17 because the last year, year and a half has certainly been this new world we're living in. But don't you think that a part of the volatility is markets which have become used to dramatic V-shaped recoveries and asset prices. So you miss the trade. So people keep jumping in, suddenly realize it's not going to happen yet. Come out and so you see these bouts of extreme volatility, largely because the market's been trained to expect that the Fed is going to step in when it gets too shaky. Yeah, now I agree. And, you know, since the financial crisis, the Fed has been able to, not so much put the inflation mandate on the back burner because I don't think it ever is, but it was able to spend most of its time dealing with the full employment mandate. And then when financial conditions were tightening, they could exercise the Fed put, as we call it, of course, and ease conditions and get the economy going. And inflation was never a clear and present danger. And of course, now it is. And ironically, now the Fed is in the position where it needs to not only maybe tolerate a higher unemployment rate, but even have that at its goal in order to compensate for the overstimulation that clearly was happening a year or two ago in the economy with that combination of fiscal and monetary policy. So that Fed put is either gone or out the money. And that does create a different response function in the markets. And so, and again, you know, to the point I made earlier, knowing with clarity, which we don't know anyway, where the Fed's going to go and whether it's going to overshoot because it waited too long to start tightening policy in the first place. So now, instead of doing too little too late, it's doing perhaps too much too late. But even then, we don't know how quickly the Fed will be able to go to a neutral policy. And I do think that that factors into valuation, because as you know, short rates, the Fed's terminal rate, real rates are important drivers, not only, of course, of the bond market, but of equity valuations as well, per the discounted cash flow and calculating that present value of future cash flows does depend on where rates go and how far they go up and how quickly they go back down is going to be an important factor. So now, let me jump in here with a question to you. Is the Fed put ever truly gone? Because we thought maybe a BOE put was gone over the UK, but when the things got really rocking the guilt market, it had to come back in. What about what happened in the UK? What does it tell us potentially here as well about the fragilio markets and maybe the need for a central bank to step back in to give support? So, you know, I think that the UK, I'm not going to say the UK historically, we always use...",https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dp8PhLsUcFE,5565,2022-10-22 10:11:49
17160," Maybe the need for a sentiment to step back in to give support. So you know, I think that the UK, I'm not going to say the UK historically, we always use that phrase, right, canary and a coal mine. However, I think in this particular case, the UK, what happened there is emblematic of what can go wrong. The immediate cause, certainly, was the mini budget, which was quite disastrous, the combination of spending and tax cuts. Clearly, it was the wrong time for a budget like that. But we tend to forget it was 17 years again in the making. We've had a very extended period of extremely loose monetary policy and that forced the UK, where you have a higher proportion of defined benefit pension plans. The UK is in a different position. Let's put it that way, which is not to say that the US and other countries should not look at the UK and worry about the unknowns. We don't know where markets will break and the reality is we are in a position where there is some possibility that something breaks. Will the Fed put, has it gone away? I think the Fed might be left in this completely internally in coherent position that the Bank of England is in, where simultaneously buying guilt, but will continue to raise rates. You're in, we're talking about the same sense. Sorry, go ahead. The Fed put may be gone for the stock market, but I think it will be coming back for the bond market. Actions have consequences, right? And policy actions have consequences. We only have to look to the Bank of Japan to see an example where they have the Bank of Japan owns half of the JGB market and has completely tamed the bond market. The annualized volatility of long JGB is three. In the US, the long treasuries have an annualized vol of about, I think, 12 or 13. And so if you're going to make fiscal decisions that have wide ranging impact and you're a central bank that has really dominated the bond market as, of course, the Fed has, as the Bank of England has, as the Bank of Japan has. You can't really leave that market. So I think that's how the Fed put is going to reappear, but just in a different market. So now one more here, maybe the Bank of Japan has tamed the bond market. It sure hasn't tamed the FX market. And then on Friday, we got that news at a Nika, at least, that they are now intervening to support that yen, which we can so much. We've got the BOJ next week. Tell us about that. What does that mean? Is the yen broken? So, you know, what we're seeing is something we haven't seen in a very long period of time. We have the EU, Japan and the US, all the dramatically different monetary policies. You know, so I think about this. And when times were good to, uh, fiscal tolls toy, all good markets, functioning markets look the same. And all of these markets, as they're breaking, they're breaking in different ways. And I think that is, that could just, it could, it's never been more apparent than what you see in Japan. The reality is the yen is moving in line with interest rate differentials with the US. You look at US 10 year yields and you look at where Japan's yen is. And it continues to move. Can the bank of Japan actually be, actually, can they control the yen? Uh, I have my doubts. You know, they might take some of the air out of it, but ultimately this is a global system, which is very interlinked. And the interest rate differential is simply too extreme right now, to simply intervene, to fix it. And the other issue, of course, is Japan does not have the US's inflation issue. And uh, speaking to the side of the bond market that is held, the US, you're depending on what bonds you're looking at, the fair loans between 25 and 33 percent of the bond market, right? So it's huge, it's a huge impact. So now the side and you're in Timber are going to be staying with us as we turn to what investors should be doing in these uncertain times. That's going to be next on Wall Street Week on Bloomberg.",https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dp8PhLsUcFE,5566,2022-10-22 10:16:07

That of course is Lewis Rurkhaizer talking with a pre-chairman Alan Greenspan on Wall Street week back on October 24 1980 back when Alan was simply part of Townsend Greenspan and company. It was just before Governor Reagan was elected president and the concern back then was about tax cuts without spending cuts, something that frankly we're still talking about today. The top movie back then was Goldie Hans private Benjamin and Woman in Love. Remember it by Barbara Streisand, top the billboard hot 100 chart for the week. Still with us our Senegal Decide of Franklin Templeton and you're in Timber of Fidelity Management. So let's start with you what's an investor to do in this environment where we do have inflation that seems to be broad, maybe entrenched, we have a Fed that's on the move, what does an investor do, what's overpriced, what's underpriced? Well you know the good news is in a period where there isn't very much of it is that both the 40 and the 60 side of the 60 40 paradigm I think are now you know really attractively valued. I mean you can get a 10 year yield at a 10 year note at 4.2, a two year note at 4.5. You can buy the S&P 500 at around 15, 16 times forward earnings. Now that PE is only as good as the forward earnings so we will find out whether the earnings hold so far they have. So valuations have had a tremendous reset from the over valuation days you know following the COVID lockdown when the Fed basically repressed interest rates down to much lower levels than they really deserve to be and that raised you know asset price inflation in the stock market because again interest rates are an important factor in valuation and so it's been a very painful nine months during which neither the 40 nor the 60 has worked. That's a very unusual environment to be in but I think you know the good news is that if the Fed does overshould I think the 40 will really.",https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dp8PhLsUcFE,5567,2022-10-22 10:20:29
17162," has worked. That's a very unusual environment to be in. But I think, you know, the good news is that if the Fed does overshoot, I think the 40 will really present a lot of value at 4% plus yields. And maybe the 40 will start becoming negatively correlated again to the 60. And if our recession is averted, then the 60, I think, will do well because earnings then will likely hold up and valuations are now much more reasonable. So for me, the glass half full, you know, view here is that at least one of those two engines is going to start working. I can't tell you which one it is unfortunately. But I do think it's not going to be any longer this monolithic market where basically nothing works. So now when will the bond market be the engine that starts working? Are bonds getting cheap enough now there's time to go back in? They're beginning to look interesting. Let's put it this way because if I look at investment grade bonds, I look at short, short paper, you know, we already we just discussed her in just discussed that we were talking about 4.4 4.5. I think we're getting getting to interesting levels. We're seeing something finally that we haven't seen for again close to 17 years fixed income delivery. And income or concept, I think income becomes more and more important as we look forward. I do think that 10 year yields are likely to still go up. But having said that it does start becoming attractive. So over the coming weeks and sorry coming weeks and months, I think the first step would be areas like investment grade because you're getting paid. And then we're going to have a good credit and our baseline is not to have a steep recession. We'll have a recession. But I think we might be able to avoid a steep one, which means that fundamentals can still look good. And furthermore, if I look in areas like high yield and emerging market, you we are now getting paid between 18 to 10% in these areas, which means that finally liquid fixed income starts becoming a very decent alternative to alternatives, which up till now have really been the only area in the last multiple years that could deliver those style of style of return. I actually am also glossful at this point for the first time in quite a while. You're in just coming back to you and just kind of catch full of way of looking at stock valuations, as I understand in fact, you've taught me. In fact, the Fed has been buying bonds, but they've also been buying tips. Is that skewing that is a measurement. And so that's the fact that the Fed owns 33% of the Bloomberg tips index. So that may not be all of all tips. So the overall number will be less than that. And so it makes you wonder whether there's any price signal left. But, you know, when I compare for instance the tips break even to the inflation swap market, which is, you know, a direct swap. And so that's a tremendous amount of price distortion from the Fed owning so many tips. And of course the Fed owns a bunch of nominals as well. So maybe one cancels out the other. So I think the jury is still out. But clearly the tips market is saying a different message than the headline inflation numbers are because the tips break evens are around two and a half across the curve. That's totally different from an 8% CPI. It's a great discussion. I really owe it to both of you. Thank you so much. That's Sonal Desai of Franklin Templeton. And you're in Timmer of Fidelity Management. Coming up, we'll take a look at next week on Wall Street Week on Bloomberg.

China's closely watched party Congress wraps this weekend and investors will be awaiting the likely release of GDP and activity data that were delayed during the meetings. When the reports finally land, the audience expects them to show an anemic third quarter recovery. Elsewhere, the Bank of Japan will likely stand pat on its ultra low interest rate and asset purchases, despite a plunge in the yen that's driving up import costs. And in Australia, the central bank's preferred measure of core inflation is likely to hit a 31 year high. It is a big week for European earnings. It's an even bigger week for European bank earnings. We've got a whole range of numbers, including HSBC, UBS, Unicredits, Standard Chartered, Barclays and Deutsche Bank. But the big one really comes on Thursday with the numbers that we're going to get from Credit Suisse out of Zurich. But the numbers are not going to be the focus. The focus will be the upgraded strategic plan. The management is also expected to announce on Thursday in Zurich. In Frankfurt that day, we have the ECB on deck as well. We are expecting the ECB to hike by circa 75 basis points. But we're also potentially expecting the ECB to deliver some changes to other policies, including the cheap loans it offers to banks in the form of teletros. We could see some shifts there as well. Friday, we get the industrials. We get Airbus, and we get Volkswagen. More than 160 members in the S&P 500 are scheduled to report earnings next week. That includes big tech companies, Apple, Microsoft, Alphabet, Meta, and Amazon. There will also be earnings from UPS, Chipotle, General Motors, Craft Hines, and McDonald's. Economic data include the U.S. government's first estimate of third quarter GDP. Crost domestic product did contract in both the first and second quarters of the year, but is projected by economists to have reversed that trend, rising by more than 2%. The week rounds out with Friday's release of the Personal Consumption Expenditures data, which the Fed uses for its inflation target. That data expected to show a continued re-exceleration in consumer prices. David? Thanks to Julius Sally, Guy Johnson, and Romaine Bostic.

One more thing we want to say on suction the solar system. We want to make sure that power will increase on more power. And if we canriminately build but, I'm not sure what it is today. If you think about the computer, in all buildings will reduce 30% of U.S. greenhouse gas emissions. 10 years of remarkable growth, that's what President Xi Jinping of China focused on in his speech to the party Congress last Saturday. It brought about a historical rise in China's economic strength. In the past decade, China's GDP has grown from the 55 trillion to 114 trillion and come to account for 18.5% of the world economy. Not a bad track record during Xi's time in office, but if President Xi had been willing to go back to before he was President, the story is even more dramatic. Since Deng Xiaoping initiated the Open Door Policy in 1978, China's economy has gone from under $150 billion to nearly $18 trillion last year. Now that growth is slowing down, with possible repercussions for the rest of the world, according to the head of the WTO. If China's economy continues to slow, the way we are seeing that will have a big impact on what happens to the world economy. And U.S. officials like Deputy Treasury Secretary Wally Adyemo say that the Open Door isn't as open as it used to be. In addition to having resilient supply chains, we want to make sure that American companies are competing on a level playing field with companies in China and around the world, and that's why we've taken actions like restraining the ability to ship some key components. But Bridgewater's Ray Dalio, who's been back and forth to China over the last 30 years, insists that, despite all the problems, he wouldn't bet against Beijing over the long term. I think the longer term picture in China is still bright, because I know the people and I know the culture and I think it's good, but they have major issues now. And when it comes to China, the person we turn to here at Wall Street Week is Debra Lair. She is the CEO of Edelman Global Advisory and Executive Director of the Pulse and Institute.

17165," That good to have you. We are all focused on President Xi and what's going on over in Beijing this week. Give us your sense about what we're learning. It strikes me that one of the biggest challenges he has is the economy and growing the economy. And yet I'm not sure we're hearing much about his economic policy. I hear a lot about politics, a lot about security. That's right. I mean, Xi Jinping gave his all-important work report at the beginning of the plenum. And it gave a few previews of how he's going to start to look at the economy. One of the things that he's emphasizing is common prosperity, his slogan about how he brings greater equality. One of the things that he's looking at is also how the party can continue to play an important role in the economy. And also he did give reassurance to foreign companies that they will continue to push for market opening in key areas. So will we get a sense from the personnel that surround him of where it might be headed? Because as I understand it, eventually we will see him come out from behind the curtain. We assume every assumes that he will get his third term. But there's going to be a critical question of who's with him as he comes out. Absolutely. The important thing, and we're all watching for this weekend, when the new party lineup is going to be announced, there's a lot of rumors starting to fly around, although not as many as there usually are. But it's a big guessing game because that will give us really our first clue into what the third term is going to look like. And I think there are three important things to watch. One is going to be what happens to Lika Chang, the current premier. Does he continue to stay on the Standing Committee? He's turned out of staying on as the premier, but could they make him the number two and head of the National People's Congress? Two, who will be in the lineup to then take the premier position? And the two leading candidates appear to be Wang Yang, who's viewed as being one of more open on the economic issues, and Wang Hunyeng, who really is an idiotia log. And the third to watch is what happens to Leo He, who's currently the vice premier, who's in charge of the economy and finance. Does he stay? He has good relations with many foreign firms, or who really comes in to take his portfolio? There were one of the things that we watch in the West, and we may be right or wrong in watching it, is the extent to which the markets in some way play a substantial role in economic policy over there. It strikes me that it's possible to interpret President Xi thus far as moving somewhat away from the markets. A lot of what he emphasis right now is ideology. And I think it's what he came out of more than perhaps we've seen in the past. Absolutely. We're seeing much more emphasis on ideology under Xi Jinping. And if we look back under Chang Zemin, Chang Zemin was saying the party is big enough to include business. She takes it in a different way. He says the party is all encompassing, and it should be forced into business. And so ideology is playing a much bigger role. Also we need to keep an eye on how Xi's favorite slogan, common prosperity is going to be implemented. China, surprisingly, is actually much more unequal than the United States. And one of the things that he's trying to do through this common prosperity slogan is say there should be a cap on executive salaries. We should be looking at big companies, particularly the private sector giving back to the community. And how that's going to be implemented at the same time when he's trying to grow the economy, when he's trying to encourage entrepreneurship and create jobs, is going to be a very tough thing for him to balance. Well, I was going to ask exactly about that, Dehru, because through history, a lot of people have said we should have more equality, less inequality, whether it's income or wealth. But a lot of attempts to get that done actually do get in the way of growth overall. Absolutely. I mean, in China, and we've talked about this before, the overwhelming majority of Chinese companies are small and medium-sized enterprises. It's up into the 90s. They are responsible for about 60 percent of China's growth and about 60 percent of job creation. And so if you can't create the right atmosphere for them to grow, you're going to have a significant impact on China's ability. And right now, she's facing a lot of headwinds when it comes to the economy. He's got issues still to deal with with real estate market. It's one of the only places that Chinese people.",https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dp8PhLsUcFE,5571,2022-10-22 10:37:50
17166," ability. And right now, she's facing a lot of headwinds when it comes to the economy. He's got issues still to deal with with the real estate market. It's one of the only places that Chinese people can invest. And obviously, housing prices are going down at the moment. The world is facing a global recession, and she is still very dependent on exports to grow the economy. He needs to find a way to unlock consumer spending. And that's very hard to do when you don't have confidence in the path of the economy. And particularly when you don't have the kind of social safety nets in place, particularly around health, that make people feel comfortable enough and have confidence to spend their money. If you put it in the longer course of Chinese history because you've been really very active in China for a good long time now, are we seeing something of a turn back toward Mao in a way from a Deng Xiaopeng? Well, certainly we're seeing a difference in the way that she is governing the economy. The Chinese Communist Party has about 93 million members. And to put that in context, that's 10 million more people than the whole population of Germany. And he used this as the way to govern the economy. And so therefore, the party is involved in every aspect. As we look at this new leadership coming in, watching the ideology versus the technocrats is going to be really important and give us a sense of what the government appointees which will take place next March will look like and how they're going to approach the economy. Is there going to be this emphasis on a more socialist economy? Or are they going to be more emphasis in what they call the socialist market economy? The fact that they didn't put out the GDP numbers this week on time, I think, is very disconcerting for the world's second largest economy to place politics over just the standard transparency of publication of data is not an encouraging sign. Debra, looking into your crystal ball there, what do you think this might mean for U.S.-China relations? I mean, it strikes me at least that going back five or 10 years, a lot of it was about economics. It was about trade, things like that, increasingly from Beijing, but also from Washington when they talk about one another. It's about geopolitics. It's about Taiwan. It's about Russia. It's about security in the Asia area. Well, national security definitely dominates the headlines. And there are some very serious issues that we're dealing with. I was just in the UK and they were telling me Taiwan didn't even use to really be on their agenda and now they're spending about 75 percent at their time. These are the China experts focused on this. So those are absolutely definite important issues to watch. But I think the real story here is going to be what happens with the economic and trade relationship. Traditionally, it's been the foundation of their relationship and it's created the people-to-people ties and built some levels of trust. Without these exchanges, with Western companies reconsidering both because of the politics, but also because of the state of the Chinese economy and the complications that have come with dealing with COVID-0, they're reconsidering their strategies. And not having that level of trust, I think really is going to have an impact and ensure that there are going to continue to be fraught relations between the United States and China. Do you have Deborah Hoap's, if not expectations, that after we're through the party congress and maybe actually after they meet in the spring and confirm that he's president of the country? That that will free President Xi up to reach out to the United States or will it embolden him to become even more assertive? Well, I think once we know what the lineup looks like, I think it's going to be easier to answer that question. I think whatever happens on the political front Xi Jinping needs to find a way to grow his economy, because his power both internally and internationally stems from their economic might. China right now is the largest trading partner to 70% of the world. The US used to have that role 20 years ago. And in order to maintain that, he has to show that he can grow the economy and he can't grow the economy through ideology. He has to go and grow it through basic economics.

This is Wall Street Week on Bloomberg. MUSIC So what's the best investment advice you've ever been given by anybody? The compound interest, the compounding of returns is an incredible miracle of business, finance and human existence. Everything you learn is additive every day and if you keep added and don't quit, it's an incredible miracle. And it's not just interest. It was always said above compound interest returns, compound business returns, compound human returns. They're all very additive because you learn every day. And if you keep at it, it's very, very helpful. In your observation of investors, what do you think is the biggest mistake that average investors make selling at the wrong time? And they sell when the prices go down? Yes. Or not keeping, people have conviction or they invest for the, if they invest for the right reasons, just keep at it. This is Wall Street Week. I'm David Weston. We welcome once again our very special contributor in Wall Street Week. He is Professor Larry Summers, of course, former Treasury Secretary. So thank you so much for being with us, Larry, once again. Much of the week was consumed with the drama over the United Kingdom, which is good and serious business for people who are living in Great Britain. But what lessons might it have for the rest of us? Look at one level. Britain is unique. They went through Brexit. They've had some unique political challenges that have taken place within their Tory party. We've rarely seen the kind of extreme incompetence that was represented by the original trust proposals. But I think there are two lessons that policymakers around the world need to heed. The first is that things can change extraordinarily fast if you lose credibility. Just as it takes a long time to grow a forest, but you can burn it down very quickly, something similar is true with respect to credibility and confidence. And I think at a time of rising government debts and rising interest rates, that's a lesson to be careful that policymakers in many different countries need to take a counter. I would say the second, more specific, lesson just goes to the potential instability in government debt markets. And that's got both a macroeconomic aspect that if your deficit projection starts to get out of control and your real interest rates start to rise rapidly, you can get into a kind of doom loop. And it also has to do with...",https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dp8PhLsUcFE,5573,2022-10-22 10:46:24
17168," It starts to rise rapidly. You can get into a kind of doom loop. And it also has to do with liquidity in the markets. And the possibility that you'll get a situation where they'll be selling, but there won't be buying, which will be get a kind of liquidation cycle. And I think given the magnitude of the increases and interest rates that you're seeing in other parts of the world, that's something that policymakers are going to have to be very careful of. I thought Secretary Yellen was right to warn about issues around illiquidity in the US Treasury markets. I think we're going to need to be watching our own fiscal projections in the United States very carefully, because I think they're going to look different with current market interest rates. If you factor in the recession, it's likely to come. That's going to have some significant effects. If you factor in all the different steps that are being taken, whether it's the student loan debt relief or the emergency funding that's going to take place because of the hurricane in Florida or the increases in national security expenditures that I think are almost inevitable, given what's happening in other parts of the world, I suspect that the fiscal issue is going to need sooner or later to be back on the table in the United States. So I think that we can be amused, those of us who don't live there by some of the things that are happening in Britain. But if we think of it as an experience that's entirely outside of any kinds of concerns that other countries could have, that would be a real mistake. Well, and Larry, as you say, we have to perhaps pay much more attention to the fiscal side, be a bit more responsible. That's at the same time that many people, and you included our warning that we may well be heading to a recession here. In the past several years, it's thought that if there's a recession, we can just write some fiscal checks for it. If we don't have the ability, that way it turns out, that Liz Truss did not have over in the United Kingdom. What does that mean about our ability to pull out of it? What is the prospect that when we've had so many years of feast, we may be headed for some famine on higher interest rates, lower growth, and lower productivity increase? Look, David, there's always a tendency at the beginning, or in the early stages of very problematic periods, to assume that everything is going to be resolved much more quickly than actually proves to be the case. Think about COVID. I was early on your program and was very worried about COVID. But I certainly didn't envision that it would be something that would still be on people's minds going into the winter of 2023. And I think it's a mistake to think that all of our economic challenges are going to be met quickly, particularly if we heed what I think would be the dangerous advice that are coming from the erstwhile members of Team Transitory that the Fed can back off already and not carry through on the increases that the market is now expected. I think for that to happen would be to almost guarantee a protracted period of stagflation. As we had both, we lacked both price stability and confidence. I think we need to remember that, apart from anything we do with discretionary policy, we have a whole set of natural stabilizers that kick in in our economy. As the economy goes down, tax collections go down, as unemployment crosses certain thresholds, their increases in unemployment insurance payments. But unfortunately, I think we fired the fiscal canon so strongly that there's going to be limited room.",https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dp8PhLsUcFE,5574,2022-10-22 10:50:47
17169," but unfortunately I think we fired the fiscal canon so strongly that there's going to be limited room for discretionary fiscal policy if we have another recession. Finally, Larry, one of the other events of the week was the release for the release from the Strategic Petroleum Reserve by President Biden, who swears this is not a political issue, but could you give us the economic potential effects of those sorts of releases? David, I think the initialspro release was a powerful thing that over the last month has done a lot to contain oil prices. And I think the Biden administration was exactly right to do it strongly, do it for a long time, do it in coordination with others. I think it's much less clear how much scope there is for that policy to work further going forward. In part that's because of the many of the constraints are on the refining side. In part that's because it's a little bit like QE for the Fed. Whatever you put out there, you're going to have to get back in at some point and that's going to have the opposite impact on oil prices. So I think you've got to be careful about that instrument from here. And I think that we've all got to be very apprehensive about the degree of confrontation that now exists between the United States and what might be called the Russian Saudi axis. This is going to be a very complex time. And I hope that we get through it while avoiding oil price spikes. My guess is that that's going to happen. But I think that's a major downside wild card from here, both with respect to inflation and with respect to recession. Okay, Larry. Thank you so much once again for joining us on Wall Street Week. That's Larry Summers of Harvard. Coming up, what's up and down with Great Britain?

17170," MUSIC Finally, one more thought. And this week, it comes from Bloomberg's senior executive editor for economics and government. And it's about her native land. Here is Stephanie Flanders. I think Liz Truss started off with the right idea, which is the UK has been held back by a slow growth since the global financial crisis, actually in the two decades before 2008, we'd averaged around two and a half percent growth, which was higher than many of our trading partners. We sort of caught up a bit with Germany. We caught up a bit with the US during that period. But since then, growth has been less than half that, and certainly much slower than other countries. So it did make sense to focus on growth. And it made sense to also to be spending some money in her initial mini budget on supporting households through a massive energy squeeze as we approach the winter. I think the problem for financial markets is that the government showed no willingness to engage with the difficult trade-offs that all governments are facing in this environment where they want to stimulate growth. They want to help households face rising energy bills, but they don't want to make it harder for the central bank to bring down inflation. And they don't want to be building up a lot of debt just at a time when we know the cost of money, the cost of borrowing all around the world is going up. So it was not what she did, but the way she did it and the kind of gay abandon with which the government was proposing tax cuts that were not funded by any form of spending constraint and not targeted to the people who in this particular environment needed help the most. I think what we also saw in the UK, there had been this nervousness in financial markets that maybe dates back to the Brexit referendum. That some of the constraints, the institutional constraints on policymakers in the UK that had prevented, you know, silly politicians from doing silly things, that those have been worn away in the years in the tumult since Brexit. And I think what happened when you saw the new Chancellor installed, the seventh since 2016, you saw potentially those institutional constraints come back. That the Treasury, the Bank of England, is still in charge. That's the message to markets, even if politicians are still messing around at the edges. There's a lot of Shaddon Freude, potentially, and certainly there, but for the grace of God, go eye central bankers and Treasury officials around the world. They are looking at the UK and wondering what's happened to this previously great nation. But they should also be looking at potential pitfalls that they too will face as we go into this environment in which interest rates are going to be higher. The cost of government borrowing is going to be higher. And potentially strains are going to be put on financial markets. We saw a particular investment strategy, the liability driven investments in the UK, which are particular to the UK, mess up the pension market, force the Bank of England to intervene. But we know we saw similar fragility in the US Treasury market back in March of 2020. And there may be other things out there that we should be nervous about, as we see this very significant shift to a higher interest rate environment. That does it for this episode of Wall Street Week. I'm David Weston. This is Bloomberg. See you next week.",https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dp8PhLsUcFE,5576,2022-10-22 10:59:33
17171," κι Okay, so you're moving in on me quick. Just stradding me with your fancy hands. I'm going to deal with your night because it's really bothering me. Ah, my night. Yeah, he's a troublemaker. Yeah. What did you get up to this weekend? You know, just robot stuff. A lot of chess. I was practicing for, uh, for you. I know you're pretty good. Ooh, I don't like that. I will take this. Oh, put it over here. Not cool. Not cool. All right. I will. I will concede. I can see. You've got me, Bid. Very good game. Well played. Thank you, sir. Thank you. Innovation, money and power collide in Silicon Valley and beyond. Bloomberg Technology with Emily Chang. Weekdays at 5 p.m. in New York and 2 p.m. in San Francisco. It was meaningful. Thank you so much for joining us. Thank you for having me. What drives you? What drives me? Oh, my God. I love, you know, the idea of just, uh, I think as simple as this, an inclusive world, a world where people see themselves reflected. Because I was supposed to be invisible by your accounts. I was supposed to not be where I am. I'm supposed to have disappeared a long time ago. And every turn in my life was about visibility. Yes, I will be this person who's not supposed to be here. Yes, I will fight through the hard times. Yes, I won't give up. And even though I was sort of the token black editor in the industry in the 90s, I knew even then that I needed to bring people up with me. I needed to bring other people up with me. And so that's really been a part of, you know, maybe it's maybe it was growing up in a family of six. I don't know. When you run a team, how do you instill that work ethic that kind of answering emails at all time? I mean, you know, I think you see an example, you know, if you're an editor who leads and has lunches and it's never in the office, you know, you don't really sort of instill faith. My team know that, you know, we're on a mission. We have to reflect the world we live in. We have to reflect the beauty of multiculturalism. We have to reflect, you know, the beauty and diversity and inclusivity. So everybody takes it really seriously and we really have intense conversations about the side guys and the world. And so, you know, I'm very lucky to have a team who are as passionate. And you know, I could call my team, you know, I could call somebody at 6 a.m. Or they can call me at 6 a.m. and I'll pick up and they'll pick up. So, you know, we have something very special that we've built over the past sort of five years. But there were difficult moments, right? I think the first time one of your first issues, you thought that you could have been fired for it. Is that, right? I lived in America for a bit and I was working for W Magazine and there was talk of Brexit. And of course, Americans were like your country's really, you know, xenophobic. So, you know, I came back and I thought, you know, I'm going to be welcome with open arms and they're going to love me and oh my god, literally.",https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dp8PhLsUcFE,5577,2022-10-22 11:03:50
17172," You know, xenophobic. So, you know, I came back and I thought, you know, I'm going to be welcome with open arms and they're going to love me and oh my god, literally back to them by fire. But I remember thinking, you know, I wanted to create a magazine where every woman could see themselves. You know, where every woman, regardless of the backgrounds, regardless of their age, could just literally see themselves. And at the time, now it looks like it's the norm when you look at other magazines, but in 2017, that was that was a radical idea. But I also remember thinking, you know, with my background, you know, I've lost so much and gained so much that I thought, if I knew, if I'm fired, I'd rather be fired for what I believed in. I'd rather be fired for creating a magazine that reflected the world as it was than try to sort of create a second rate version of someone's vision. And that continues. I mean, there's this idea of always pushing forward. Yeah. Right? What's the end? How do you measure success? How do I measure success? I'm definitely not not financial. I mean, I think it's more about, for me, when I'm really exhausted, when I'm really tired, when I'm really questioning if I can go on, you know, I walk on the street and I see a little girl, a little black girl who's seen the magazine and it's the norm for them or a curvy woman on a traitor palace who's like, thank you for, you know, seeing me, you know, that makes it worth what? That for me is success. You know, anybody who knows or has known me for a while will witness that that for me is success. You know, my job is done when that happens. Do you think, I mean, do people come up to you? They do, but it's always in a positive way. It's always thank you for seeing us, you know, but I can relate because, like I said, you know, by all accounts, I was meant to be invisible, you know? So for me, shining in light on people and making them seen, it's natural for me. They say that the fashion industry is changing. You're changing it. Are others around you changing it? I mean, now, you know, you look at other magazines and seeing real women in there, it's no longer a radical act, seeing, you know, people of color, women of color on covers is no longer a radical act. So it's been normal, you know, it's been normalized. And for me, I'm quite happy when I see that, you know, when you put Dame Judy Dengue on the cover, and she's 85 years old, and the world just laughed at it. Nobody questioned her, you know, should she be on the cover or you put, you know, a girl with a hijab on the cover. And it's not a problem that for me shows that, you know, we're advancing, we're progressing. So, you know, progress for me is very important. Which is important. And so how do you take care of your team? How do you build a team around you? My team, I mean, some, you know, somebody said to me once, when you build a team, make sure you employ people, you like, people, when you see them working towards your office, you're just so excited to see. That was it. You build up your job and sort of a connection and being excited to see, you know, team members because you only have to do that to your team, you know. No man is an island, you know, I don't create the magazine on my own. And so it's great to have a team who, you respect and who's views you respect, you know, and who respect yours. How do you think you're seen by your team? Do you have to be fearful? Do you have to be, I'm going to tell you more. I'm a worker, I work very hard, but I think I'm pretty open, you can have conversations with me, you know, ultimately the final decision rests with me, but I do listen, I like conversation, I like interaction. And so that's, I mean, that's how I hope they think I'm a good boss and that's, you know, really all you can hope for because, you know, they work on a very good magazine, they can get other jobs anywhere. So the fact that they're there makes me think that they must be happy. Edward, how do you see the publishing world changing? So people buy less magazines. You've been, I mean, you've been doing pretty well in terms of selling more. But in five years, how does it look? How does it look? I mean, I was like, you know, five years ago, I, you know, even, I mean, let's go back to ID when I was 18, you know, I heard it to the magazine, you know, which will come out.",https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dp8PhLsUcFE,5578,2022-10-22 11:08:12
17173," I mean, I was like, you know, five years ago, I... I mean, let's go back to ID when I was 18, you know, I inherited a magazine, you know, which would come out. It was all about club kids and you had to be out there. And the only way you could see street fashion was through ID. And then 2017, I inherited a magazine. But now I oversee a brand. You know, the magazine is still there. The magazine is sort of the highest, the best paper, you know, the best photographers, the best, you know, cultural messages. But at the moment, you know, when you manage a brand, it's not just about that. It's about digital. It's about video. It's about audio. It's about events. So for somebody who's so forward looking, it's so great for me. And people always ask, oh, it's a magazine instead. When we launch a cover, Instagram, it's our cover, essentially. So I've, you know, found a way, we found a way of sort of making it work hand in hand. And it's so great for me, you know. I think how do I just been doing the magazine? I probably would have been bored. So magazines aren't dead. Are they going to go down? No, I mean, yeah, but they're going to work in hand with digital platforms. You know, but also I'll tell you something. New readers of folk, young readers, don't necessarily come to us to the new stands. They come through that, you know, digital platforms or, you know, audio or videos we put out. So yes, now it's increased tenfold. So yeah. Well, do you think that will change the kind of readership that you will quartz, the either age of your readers, but also where they come from? Yes, I mean, at the moment, you know, I think the readership is getting younger because of, you know, the whole digital landscape. And I hope that, you know, as we move forward, it kind of, yeah, we have new readers and we also keep our loyal readers, you know. Do you think there's ever a time where actually we won't have print magazines anymore? No, I think print will always exist sort of a long-side digital, but it'll probably be something more precious, sort of better paper, something more collectible that you want to keep in your house, almost like artwork. So no, I don't think print is going to die. So fewer copies. But more quality. I mean, quality, you know, almost like a book. The cable book. I love that. I need to. Imagine simply climbing a cable into space. The concept is known as the space elevator. Not only could it significantly change how we leave planet Earth, but it could also completely transform humanity's relationship with space. And they're a scientist who think we could have already built it. We have the material. We have the technology. We have the lasers. We have the climbers. We have all of it. If a private entity wants to build it, or a government, they could build it. It'll change society. We have no clue how colonizing in the space, how really spreading out in the space, really change our society over the next 50 to 200 years. It'll be completely different.

17174," talking about that all day yesterday. I'm not one of those people that leaves work and shuts themselves in. I really want to be out there seeing the world as today. It's in all this beauty. So, you know, I'm very curious. I have a very curious mind and I'm glad. I'm glad, you know, it keeps everything moving and exciting. So is that for Gen Z? Is that a commercial purpose to get also get closer to that? No, it's just out of curiosity. I've always been like that. I've always wanted to know what's next, you know. I didn't want to be the one that's just being told, oh, you're 50 or whatever, you know. I pay attention to everything. But, you know, there was such a beautiful place for me, you know. And it goes back to my childhood again. Well, the biggest challenge to grow the brand in the next five years. Because we still keep it relevant. You know, we have such great digital traffic, you know, almost almost six million every month to British vote. But I'm really sort of excited about overseeing the European votes as well, Spain, Italy, Germany and France and sort of mentoring a whole new generation of editors, you know. When there was this whole abomination, the whole world thought there was a global view that was going to dominate. But it's very much about local conversations as well as global conversations. So I learned from these content leads and I hope that, you know, they also learn. So the local global conversation I'm very excited about moving into the future. Do you think it changes if we're in a recessionary environment? So you have such a, you know, glamorous lifestyle or what you sell is so glamorous. Is it impacted by the cost of living or inflation of what we can live through? I mean, you know, I remember a few years ago I put Taylor Swift on the cover and the byline was by better, by less. And it was a radical concept at the time. But now we all talk about sustainability. We know we can't keep shopping every day. We know we have to buy things that last, things that help the planet, things that we can pass on to sort of other generations. So I think that really is a conversation on the fashion industry is having right now that I find so exciting. And it's going to be sort of, you know, people are going to have less money so they have to buy things that last. And I'm really excited. And these are real changes. It's not just real changes. Real changes, it's not just conversation. It's actually happening. Do you think fashion brands always need to have a political point of view when they're great injustices? I think fashion brands can do more. I feel that having a black model in your show or having, you know, a feed on your Instagram post, it's not enough. We need diverse voices behind the scenes. I always say that I talk to sort of all the CEOs I know we need to employ more people from, you know, from, you know, diverse backgrounds because that's the only way you can even reach out to more people, you know. A variety of voices always better than just one. And I always also say, you know, let's not just have interns, let's have people on all different levels. And that's what I keep talking to people about. Do they listen? Some listen, but I think since, you know, George Floyd was murdered more and more companies sort of made pledges to people of color. And, you know, it's a slow, it's a slow process. Some have taken it seriously and some are still working their way through it. But, you know, we have to keep on. The problem is that you can make a pledge and then follow through. Right? You know, so you have to really sort of focus and keep asking that question for people to follow through. And it's, so do you feel like you're a guardian of, also of that, of making sure that when you get promised something, they'll do it. But.",https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dp8PhLsUcFE,5580,2022-10-22 11:16:58
17175," and asking them what they need and what we can do to help. Rather than, you know, I'll say, do this! This is how you do it, because we don't live that. You have a memoir out. Yeah. Why put it down on paper? You know something about when you turn 50. You know something about when it's your fifth year at Vogue. You know, I got married this year. And you know, I'm normally not someone who looks back all the time, but it felt like the right time for me to do that. And also, you know, I just felt that a lot of young people sort of see people like you and I, and they think, you know, we just got here and we were always here, and for me it was really important to share the story of a journey about, you know, successors and, you know, failures. And, you know, that's the reason why I got here. So I just wanted to share that story with them, sort of young people. And, you know, the kind of people who feel like they're on the outskirts of, you know, the outside of the industry, really. Do you feel like an outsider? I think I always feel like an outsider, but as I said before, you know, I grew up African in an African household in England, you know, different languages, different foods, and I'll go to school and I'll be in England. I've always seen myself as an outsider, but also an insider. And even when, you know, I took a job at Britishville, I was the black gay working class outsider, but, you know, I'd been in the industry since I was 18. I was, in essence, an insider. Something like that, really, is the other duality that plays out in my life. What, who do you think made you the person you are today? I know you left home twice, right, Ghana, but also you had to leave your home. I mean, the puzzle made me who I mean, really is my mother. I mean, I mean, I loved my mother. She taught me about sort of beauty. She taught me about clothes, about fascism. She also taught me that beauty came in all forms, that, you know, women were beautiful, no matter what shaped they were, no matter what color, what religion. And so that really stayed with me. And, I guess that my creativity comes from her. And of course, I also had a military father, so the idea of precision and organization, and sort of thinking ahead also comes from here. So the best of both worlds. How did your father, I know you had a difficult relation with your father. How did your father shape the person you are today? It's so funny you should ask this question, because I never thought I was like my father growing up. You know, I was very shy, very sensitive, you know, a little spacey. I prefer the company of women. To men, my dad was sort of, you know, a sort of a sort of a theory, a disciplinarian. You know, you had to, you know, be home at a certain time. He rogues on iron fist. And I thought, you know, I'm never going to be like, you know, he kicked me out of the house, you know, when I was 18. But I found out that over the years, when it comes to work and discipline, and sort of organization, that is him to a T. are you doubting myJeBiQah turned out in truth, expert analysis.

You need top analysts to bring you exclusive global insight into cross-asset markets. The mini-bond market. China is a really big focus. Bitcoin ain't buying it all today. It's going to be a short term. Bloomberg markets the close weekdays on Bloomberg. So at some point you lose your eyesight. What was that like? Yeah. Basically I have sort of very high myopia. So I've never had great eyesight. And I went through a series of retinal detachment for to be exact. And with each detachment I'll sort of have to end up looking down in a contraption for about three weeks. And in the dark room, it was very harrowing. It was very harrowing time in my life. But I always say you don't have to have vision to have vision. So in those dark rooms my imagination was even bigger. I dream bigger. And I came out to sort of the last surgery and the cover I did was for W Magazine with Rihanna after Queen with a golden eye. And I look back at the end and I thought, oh my God, there are the eyes. Subliminally. So yes, it was very challenging. And even to this day, I go for checkups to make sure my eyes are okay. They're great right now. And the more I look after myself, the better. The better I'm here. But it's amazing you power through adversity. Do you ever think actually this is too much? Have you ever thought this is too much? I mean, there have been times when I felt this is too much, but it's not in my vocabulary to start. It's not in my DNA to start. I am my mother's son, my father's son. The edge to move forward is always there. And that's why when I was young, I always get up and work. I had a reclutive touch when I still got on a plane to go shoot the Hollywood put folio. But now I'm learning to say no. Now I'm learning I can't do that job. I can't fly. No. It takes time, but it comes with age. It takes courage to say no. Right? Definitely. So when you look at all your covers and there are so many beautiful ones, is there one that's special to you? Well, I say to someone, they're like my children. We always have a favorite child. But I'm especially proud of the covers we did in lockdown. When the world had essentially shut down, the teams were sort of scattered all around London. And I had to go back to the days of I did when you had to really create user imagination. And we had a series of four covers, Judy Densch. And they said, you know, anybody over 60, she stayed at home, that essential workers cover a cover of landscapes, just so people could take a breather. And the activists cover when George Floyd was murdered. And I really think we create covers that, you know, in years time people can look back and see what the time, that period was like for me, an artist always has to reflect their times as Nina, to paraphrase Nina Simone. And that's really important for me. I mean, there was a bit of controversy with Linda Vanjolista. Yes. Yes, I mean, you know, there was a complaint that, oh, you know, she should have looked a certain way, you know. And for me, I've known Linda in the 90s. I've known this incredible icon who really defined what a model should be. And I also saw my friend go through really dark days, you know, due to the complications with surgery, literally disappear from the world, really not the Linda the world knew. So when we were doing this cover, it was the collaboration. She wanted to be that Linda that everybody knew. She wanted to feel good about herself again. And I wasn't going to deny her that. And also, you know, whatever I would like to say, whatever I would, whatever I would want to say.",https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dp8PhLsUcFE,5582,2022-10-22 11:28:15
17177," It's to be that Linda that everybody knew. She wanted to feel good about herself again. And I wasn't going to deny her that act. And also, you know, whatever I would like to say, whatever woman wants to do with her body, it's up to her. So, you know, I'm very proud of Linda and I'm very proud of that cover. I mean, sometimes you're almost like an activist. Is that how you're like a fashion activist or a political fashion? But I'm definitely a creative. But, you know, I've always believed, you know, look at my life story in my book. You know, I wasn't like I kept saying I wasn't supposed to be here. You know, had my dad not left, I don't know even what would have happened to my family. So even when we ended up in a room, two rooms in a voxel, six of us, we were so happy to be there, penniless, but so happy to be there. So, you know, every day, I just, you know, I'm an optimist and I know it's not the most fashionable thing, but that's why I'm sitting here with you today. Bye. Edward, thank you so much for your time today. Bye. And you're one of the most fascinating entrepreneurs because you all started really young. So, I think it's really fun starting a business. And fun growing a business. I feel it's a real privilege. And I started my business officially at 18, but I think I knew I wanted to do it very differently from about 15. But I'm sure it's, you know, you feel surrounded by it. It feels very natural. So, yes, it's fun. And it started how you started by making, you want to Florence. It was an Italy and you started handbags. Yeah. So, I knew I was actually given a handbag by my mother when I was about 61 and I remember how it made me feel and I think fashion is fascinating for the mood changing, the confidence boosting aspects and the tribal aspects of what fashion does. And so, I went at 18 to Florence knowing that was the home of Leviticus, which is what interested me. I just wanted to learn actually and be surrounded by craftsmen who are making things as important. And that's going to be very interesting, I think, over the next sort of ten years. I think the on-shoring of craft and manufacturing is going to be fascinating. And I watched the off-shoring and literally saw it. And I think we're going to be seeing that coming back to local we have to. When we're looking at objectives in terms of carbon, you know, proximity is going to be key. We make it very transparent to the shopper before they accept an order. What the order is going to look like. How much work on a piece of them and how much like the consumer is paying them. And so they can decide whether they take an order or whether they refuse it. And that's the kind of flexibility that our shoppers really value and the kind of transparency that they want. Are you seeing a labor shortage right now? And what are you doing to combat that? It's different in different places. All demographic of shoppers is completely different from food delivery and right sharing, where 70% women and half of them are moms. And that's because a lot of the job at Instacart is very different and just being in a car with strangers. It's about like going to the store, doing a good job of customer service of really picking the right products for the consumer. And we are seeing that being very appealing to women. It seems like everything is going green these days. But there's one mode of transportation that seems to be clinging to the traditional fuel loving ladies. And while commercial aviation has made strides through smarter design and cleaner engines, many of those gains have been nullified by more air traffic. It be challenges enormous. This is a large industry. It will take decades to convert. The good news is that we will have a solution as early as three years out that people can get into and start moving zero emission. And it turns out that the solution could be all around us. Hydrogen is the most abundant element.",https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dp8PhLsUcFE,5583,2022-10-22 11:32:24
17178," Get into and start moving zero emission. And it turns out that the solution could be all around us. Hydrogen is the most abundant element in the universe. And so if you had to use something, it would be great. The only product of the chemical reaction between hydrogen oxygen is water. We looked at the fundamentals of what it would require to take an aircraft, up in the air of significant size over significant distance, commercially relevant. You get to hydrogen fuel cell being the best approach from the cost of fuel, efficiency of utilization of the fuel, and the mitigation of the climate effects. Serial clean tech entrepreneur Val Miftikoff started zero aviare following his previous success in the EV charging industry. So the beauty about hydrogen in general is that the energy density of hydrogen as fuel is actually three times better than jet fuel. So you can see any size of aircraft going for any distance that jet fuel aircraft can go over time. It will just take significant amount of time to get the industry over, but this technology can scale to all sizes of aircraft that we use in commercial service. Zero aviare uses a hydrogen fuel cell to produce electricity to turn a propeller. Unlike a traditional engine which uses combustion to create energy, a fuel cell generates electricity through electrochemical reaction. In this case, hydrogen and oxygen are combined to generate electricity, heat, and water. Zero aviare has flown a six-seater aircraft on a hydrogen fuel cell, a world first. Now they're aiming bigger at 20 seats. That's technically commercial. One side of the aircraft, the left side, we replace the engine with our power plants. We still got the normal engine on the right side. And part of this is, you know, innovation you want to ramp up a East profile on meaningful steps. So anything happens, we have the second engine. But even in the first flight test campaign, what we're planning to do is to demonstrate operation of the aircraft, pure alone, zero emission power. On the left side engine, once we take off, we're able to switch over to completely zero emission power. Hydrogen is used throughout all sections of a flight that maximizes the efficiency of the entire operation. That reduces the weight, provides for best sort of mission capabilities, payload, and range. Building power plants in fuel cells is one thing. Creating a whole new infrastructure for supplying hydrogen is something entirely different. In automotive, the big part of the reason why hydrogen did not take off is because the fueling infrastructure needs to be so distributed. Let's say, in the United States, you have 100,000 fueling stations, compared that with aviation, where 95% or more traffic in the United States is concentrated in 100 locations. So that's a three-order magnitude difference, which makes build out of the infrastructure much simpler. It's much larger, much more concentrated stations, but there's much fewer in quantity. Calling it simpler might be underselling the challenge of distributing hydrogen, which unlike other fuels that can be easily transported in liquid form, is usually found instead in a gaseous state. How do you get the hydrogen from point eight to point B? We don't have pipelines for moving hydrogen around. We don't have all the specialized trucks to move them around. So we need a solution that can be a low capital expenditure solution, and that's the genesis of the company. Jumpall Clark is the co-founder and chief innovation officer of Universal Hydrogen, a startup that is designed a modular tank system for the domestic turbo prop market. Like ZeroAvia, it allows for retrofitting planes already in use. Each module has two engines.",https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dp8PhLsUcFE,5584,2022-10-22 11:36:37
17179," Hank system for the domestic turbo prop market. Like Zura Avia, it allows for retro fitting planes already in use. Each module has two capsules. And so what we do is load it into the aircraft as if it was cargo, strap it down, connect it to the aircraft, close the loading door, and that would be it. When you get to your destination, you basically unload it, put it back in a truck, send it back to the production site to get refilled. We needed to basically come up with something that could both fit in containers and also fit in the aircraft, not require increases in the maximum takeoff way to the aircraft. This compromise is one of the biggest hurdles that may prevent widespread adoption of hydrogen. Obviously you're going to have to take out some seats because the energy density of hydrogen is less than jet fuel, and you can't store it in the wings practically. So you're going to have to take away some space and a few of that. In the ultra fine margins of aviation, removing 10 to 20% of your seats is a tough ask. But that hasn't deterred startups like Zura Avia or universal hydrogen. The maintenance costs of a fuel cell motor system goes down and it goes down significantly because motors and fuel cells have much fewer moving parts than a gas turbine engine. And so the wear and tear is much lower and therefore the time between overhaul is longer. And so when you put all that together, our numbers indicate that the chasm, cost per available seat mile, actually goes down slightly or is at the worst equivalent to what you have now. So what you will have is a smaller cabin, a smaller number of seats. However, the cost for each of those seats to operate it is the same or better with the hydrogen. Back in 1997, I was interested in the following question, which is there are a bunch of the dinosaurs called Saurapod dinosaurs, which had really long skinny necks. So Apatosaurus is an example. Now it's had really long skinny tails. So I made a computer model that showed that in fact the tail of these Saurapod dinosaurs could actually act like a whip, a bullfip. Now the way a bullfip makes that cracking noise is because the tip of the whip actually goes about twice the speed of sound. OK. And that crack is a sonic boom. Yeah. I think the way they got a date was to impress the females by making loud booms. Bloomberg has enhanced search on the terminal to deliver what you need when you need it.

17180," engine is also working on engines, successfully testing their two megawatt iron bird that will allow them to retrofit planes carrying up to 55 passengers. Zero Avia is aiming for their first commercial hydrogen electric flight between London and Rotterdam with their 19-seater by around 2024. But much like the range anxiety that has plagued some battery-powered electric vehicles on land, hydrogen fuel cells are also fairly limited. At this point they still don't have the capacity to power a common 100 passenger jet. Beyond fuel cells however, there is another hope for our lightest most abundant element. Burning. The first Ureca moment I suppose is when we source steam and exhaust because we are thinking to ourselves, they're burning something here when they're producing absolutely no CO2. An expert in gas turbine combustion, Professor Bobby Saiti leads research at Cranfield University in the UK. Built on a former RAF base, the college runs multiple aeronautical programs. But what Bobby is focused on is burning hydrogen as cleanly as possible. So what we're trying to demonstrate in this rig is how we can conceive some hydrogen combustion technologies that can be integrated in the next generation aircraft engines which will deliver not to only low zero CO2 emissions but also ultra-low knock emissions. Nox or nitrogen oxides are a significant source of air pollution globally. They're the dirty particulates that cause smog in cities, usually spat out by diesel cars, scooters and buses. Hydrogen is characterized by much wider flammability limits which means we can go to much leaner combustion and as a result we can burn at much lower flame temperatures and that's better for reducing nox emissions. Going leaner means burning fuel with an excess of air in the engine, using something like gasoline, lean burn emits far fewer hydrocarbons. Doing it with hydrogen also delivers cleaner emissions. While nox is a polluted, hydrogen combustion produces up to 90% less nitrogen oxide than kerosene. So while burning hydrogen isn't technically as clean as using it inside a fuel cell, it's still a huge improvement over jet fuel. Unfortunately like any radically new idea, there are other potential byproducts of the process that aren't fully yet understood. Nox is clearly one of the main emissions we need to consider but the aviation communities also are asking themselves and the community in general what about all the water vaping emissions? And some studies have shown albeit there's still a large degree of uncertainty about it that controls and serious clouds that may be induced from controls could contribute to global warming about four times the amount than CO2 does. We know that if we're going to be burning hydrogen, we're going to produce much larger amount of water vapour emissions and if we are going to be producing a much larger amount of water vapour emissions then the propensity for contrail formation is also going to increase. In spite of all these challenges, hydrogen is being taken seriously by the broader industry. Companies like Universal Hydrogen and ZeroAvia are gaining the attention of investors looking for viable and eventually profitable solutions. Industry giant Airbus wants to introduce a hydrogen powered passenger aircraft by 2035. Recently announcing plans to retrofit a gas guzzling superjumbo with a hydrogen burning engine. The modified aircraft will add a fifth engine adapted for hydrogen and will be mounted on the rear fuselage. The A380 is the largest passenger aircraft in existence so it offers plenty of room to store the 400 kilograms of hydrogen. The company's designs for a blended wing concept to store extra hydrogen also offer a glimpse of our flying future. Apart from the complex engineering challenges faced by airplane manufacturers, there are also difficulties in production of hydrogen itself. Nowadays most of the hydrogen used in fuel is derived by splitting it off from molecules of natural gas. But that requires a good deal of energy and also produces carbon dioxide. To make green hydrogen, the electricity used to run the electrolyzer must come from a renewable resource, which is currently a lot more expensive. As with any new technology.",https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dp8PhLsUcFE,5586,2022-10-22 11:45:19
17181," To make green hydrogen, the electricity used to run the electrolyzer must come from a renewable resource, which is currently a lot more expensive. As with any new technology, however, initial costs are daunting, but time may be the best remedy here. If you look at economics of hydrogen fuel production, for example, versus fossil fuels, for instance, the cost of hydrogen is all based on capital expense, and very little operating expense is sort of similar to solar power. You put solar panels out there, and they produce power for 20-25 years. The operating expense is relatively low. What that means is that as scale grows, as we've seen with the solar panels, the cost of output drops dramatically. So the first phase is not about the most efficient aircraft. It's not about the aircraft that will deliver the lowest NOx emissions. It's about demonstrating that we can't carry hydrogen safely on board, we can't burn it safely on board, and it can be used to fly passenger aircraft. The key thing is that we don't try to put everything in the first generation, or we're just going to delay the entry into service, so to try and keep it as simple as possible. If there are some questions on the margin, they're all in the sort of business model and market adoption realm. It is very hard to create a technological argument, or impossible to create a technological argument that says, well, it's not going to work. It is going to work. Big, expensive cities have a lot going for them, but if you live in one, you've probably noticed that these big, expensive cities keep getting more, well, expensive. You could always move away. You might have just started working remotely, so there's really nothing keeping you there. But then again, moving is a hassle. Well, what if someone paid you 10 grand to do it? What if they threw in free office space, a bicycle, or a gym membership? Programs and cities and states around the US are doing exactly that, and they're getting a lot of interest. We've had over 50,000 applications. About 90,000 applications. We've had over 1800 applicants from all over North America. So are these nascent programs actually beneficial to their communities and the workers joining them? Or are they little more than flashy advertising campaigns for places looking for an injection of fresh talent? Watch Bloomberg surveillance early edition for the news you need when you need it.

I've ever been cruising on a highway and wondered where the heck are all those trucks going? There's a behind the scenes world of logistics that makes virtually everything in our modern lives possible. Not only do we take it for granted, we're completely oblivious to its environmental cost. But thanks to a handful of companies, there's a hidden revolution happening that, as it turns out, is perfectly suited to delivering a cleaner future. For years, online or terrain and rapid home delivery have been booming. And thanks to the pandemic, this trend has evolved into a way of life. But what actually happens when I click that tempting button to buy, let's say, an old school, real hardcovered book.",https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dp8PhLsUcFE,5587,2022-10-22 11:49:43
17182," often to a way of life. But what actually happens when I click that tempting button to buy, let's say, an old school, real hardcover book. For mighty Amazon, which tends to capture the lion's share of all book sales, they're crocked along with other books to one of several Amazon inbound fulfillment centers. Now the book is an Amazon's massive fulfillment network, copies then journey along the so-called middle mile, and can be redistributed to any of the hundreds of smaller warehouses or nodes closer to customers in major population centers. The last step is the so-called last mile, how it gets to a buyer's home. The book might be sent to an Amazon delivery station and put in the back of a Mercedes-Brencher van and dropped off by Amazon itself at the customers front door. This system, while it's a marvel of modern-day logistics, still relies mostly on traditional combustion engine vehicles for middle and last mile delivery. As demand for rush delivery rises, so does the number of gas guzzling trucks hustling between warehouses. Environmental, it's one of the biggest issues there is and the quicker that the globe can sort of decarbonize transportation, the better it's going to be. So if you look at total greenhouse gas emissions in the US, about 28% of that is transportation. And of that chunk of the 28% about a quarter of it come from mean, even heavy-duty trucks. So middle mile and sort of long haul trucking. If you really want to move the needle on carbon emissions, this is a really good place to look. So how do we solve this growing emissions problem and still satisfy our addiction to same-day delivery? As it turns out, the size, shape, and predictable limited range of these vehicles makes them the perfect candidate for a solution. I'm Dakota Semler. I'm the CEO and co-founder of Exos Trucks. So we are a manufacturer of commercial electric vehicles. We manufacture trucks that are in the class five size all the way up to class eight regional haul tractors. And those are things like the UPS or FedEx stepvans that you see delivering packages every day. We actually started this because we were fleet operators ourselves. We had a fleet of medium-duty vehicles, and we saw how challenging it was becoming to operate diesel vehicles. The technology exists to convert last mile fleets from diesel to electric batteries, and the prices of those batteries have fallen dramatically in the last 10 years. And any routes that are around 200 miles or less are really ready to make that transition. So Exos is trying to perfect the frame of the car. They call it the chassis. So this is everything is underpinning the car. The electric motors, the battery pack, all the battery software and cooling and technology, and kind of the brains of the car, if you will. And then the business model is basically to sell that and let the end consumer dictate what goes on top. Our platform, we call the X platform. UPS is using an X platform with a parcel delivery van body on top of it. Lumis, who operates an armored car fleet, uses the same exact X platform, but with an armored body on top of it. Exos is currently making their modular battery packs here in Los Angeles. And the packs can be customized for specific applications. But while one big problem, vehicle cost, is improving as battery prices continue to fall, there's still another major hurdle at the other end. The best way to describe the current state of charging infrastructure in the US is anemic. These companies don't want to build chargers unless they're electric vehicles. People don't want to buy electric vehicles unless there's chargers. That's a big problem for the personal EV space, where range anxiety is often cited as a roadblock to mass adoption. But when it comes to delivery, there's a much simpler solution. When you think about last mile vehicles, they're not operating in different bases of operation. They actually return to the same depot every single night where they do their charging. Exos actually has a division helping fleets install that charging infrastructure. These fleets will actually bring their vehicles back to the yard. They charge them overnight. And then by the time morning rolls around, for their next shift, those vehicles are fully charged, ready to go, with the infrastructure that's on site. With pilot programs up and running with delivery giants, UPS, FedEx, and Amazon, Jegs collapses, 휴,",https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dp8PhLsUcFE,5588,2022-10-22 11:54:12
17183," Those are fully charged, ready to go with the infrastructure that's on site. With pilot programs up and running with delivery giants, UPS, FedEx and Amazon, Exos is quickly becoming a major contender in the electrification game. But there's another enormous part of this puzzle, which may end up eliminating more than just gasoline. So I'm got them, Narang. I'm the co-founder and CEO of Gatik. At Gatik, we do autonomous vehicles for the middle mile segment of the supply chain. Again, middle mile is one step back from last mile, trucking the goes from one factory or warehouse to another. The middle mile is evolving at a rapid pace. And with the pandemic, the middle mile segment of the supply chain was put into high gear. The prominence and the significance of the middle mile is only going to grow in the coming years. So Gatik is a really interesting company. What they're doing is trying to both make middle mile delivery autonomous and electric. So they're trying to move the ball in two ways here. And what's really interesting with them is they focus specifically on a certain sector of users, namely large companies that have very fixed routes. Just as the predictable routes of shipping and delivery make electrification easier, they make autonomy a lot easier too. If your trucks are going the same way every single time, like Gatik's, that's a much easier puzzle for an AI to navigate. So what they do, they find the route they need to run, and they agonize over it for four to six weeks, just mapping it inside and out, figuring out where all the trouble spots might be and coding their vehicles to deal with it. And often they're not taking the most direct route, they're taking the safest route, they're taking the route that's most predictable in terms of traffic. There's a common understanding in the industry that unprotected left turns and doing multiple lane changes are some of the most trickiest problems in the AV space. With middle mile, frankly, you can avoid all of that. You can take three right turns to make a left turn. You know, a bag of potatoes won't care. Gatik's ultimate goal is to provide a cheaper, cleaner alternative to the middle mile of today by saving money on gas and maintenance, by electric motors, and saving money on, well, drivers by going autonomous. They've already sold some major players on their vision and scoring Walmart as a customer votes well for the future. Startups like Gatik and Exos are betting that the delivery industry is ready for a full-on high-tech refit. In a sector where only about 1% of vehicles have been electrified, that's a lot of potential for change. The usual suspects are where you're going to see adoption come first. You know, the larger, more stable companies. So Walmart, Amazon, UPS, FedEx, etc. I think you'll see them experimenting with it more and the more routes that they can get it to make sense on that the faster adoption is going to be. And as the technology matures and batteries continue to get cheaper, there's another huge category of vehicles that's ripe for this kind of upgrade. So the Biden administration has been super aggressive about a pledge to electrify the entire federal vehicle fleet, which is just under 700,000 vehicles. What's interesting is the federal fleet is both really old and really inefficient. The average age of these cars and trucks about 14 years and the average cost is about $1 a mile. When you add up fuel and maintenance and depreciation, which are the three big ones. It's a good place to look if you're looking to get carbon out of the transportation system. While the most exciting and flashy developments in the world of electric vehicles are usually around personal EVs, the more impactful transition is happening behind the scenes. So the next time you order something online and it effortlessly appears in your doorstep, your package might have made at least some of its hidden journey without consuming an ounce of gasoline.",https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dp8PhLsUcFE,5589,2022-10-22 11:58:19

It's pretty much full service shadow banking with nobody in charge. So what happens is that we create some icons and call them tags and they have a signal within them. And when you stare at that, your eye responds to it in a particular way. The way in which that eye response occurs is a signal that we pick up on the visual cortex of the brain at the back of the brain. So the sensor is looking for the signals we create here that come through the eyeball, through the brain, and then onto the visual cortex. Once we've got it there as a signal, we can grab that. We understand what that signal looks like, and we can turn that into a command, whatever we're trying to control.

Music When Jack Hartung joined Chipotle 20 years ago, it was far from the powerhouse it is today. Chipotle was a special brand. It was an unknown brand, it was very small. It was founded in 1993 by Chef Turnodrapreneur Steve L. The company stood on the brink of the growth spurt that would create a category, fast casual dining. It was a really simple idea, Steve had. It was, look, why is fast food crappy? Why can't great food be done fast? I was there when there was a couple dozen restaurants, and I would visit restaurants like this, where Steve would go behind the line and he'd see somebody cutting an onion, and saying, well, hold on, let me show you how to do it. Two decades later, Jack Hartung is still the Chief Financial Officer of Chipotle. He's had a hand in just about every area of the operation. I feel like I've always been able to dabble in things outside of just financials. And while his central task is to create greater value for a chain that now has about 3,000 restaurants, he insists on staying true to the values that have defined Chipotle from day one. I think I'm really open-minded, but I really do want to protect the heritage of Chipotle and make sure that we don't lose the essence.

17185," But I really do want to protect the heritage of Chipotle. And make sure that we don't lose the essence. It's a powerful blend, a consistent mission that sustains the brand with a commitment to innovation that drives the business. Chipotle's future depends on investments that address both priorities. Jack Hartung embraces that challenge. He's always had a passion for what we do next in our company because he's always been really a champion of growth. I've got to make sure that the financials, the balance sheet, the way we source food, the way that we provide food, the way that our business works, needs to be strong so that we reach our full potential. I love working with people that can figure out how to thread the needle between the numbers and the purpose. Frankly, not everybody can do it. But luckily, Jack does it really well and we're pretty fortunate to have him at our company. Chipotle's growth in the last five years has been nothing short of spectacular. Revenues have jumped nearly 70%. The company's market capitalization has more than quadrupled. All this despite a global pandemic that's disrupted the restaurant industry and all this following a food safety crisis that caused sales at the company to crater and forced to shake up in the sea suite. Individually, the team was phenomenal. Individually, people were very talented. They were very talented. But it's almost like they didn't have the right people in the right places to handle how big the brand and the platform became the enhanced food safety procedures, enhanced standards and training. They really enhanced the management team took marketing dollars, you know, transition them to more effective marketing, brand building efforts with a big focus on reminding consumers of why they love Chipotle. The food safety issue was the most challenging because we were alone in that one. That was unique to Chipotle. The pandemic is certainly a challenge, but everyone's in it together. The things that really got us through it is we stay true to our purpose. So during each of these challenges, we made sure we invested in the food safety issue. And we were really looking forward to seeing the food safety issue that was the most challenging because we were alone in that one. That was unique to Chipotle. The pandemic is certainly a challenge, but everyone's in it together. We stay true to our purpose. So during each of these challenges, we made sure we invested in the things that made Chipotle special, invest in higher quality food, invest in our people, and then invest in our growth and invest in things like technology. We have the same around here. I think it actually comes from West Point. We will choose the harder right over the easy road. How do you and Jack work on things like that, those black swan events, those things that can be fundamentally changing for you as a company? When we are successful in focusing on the really important things that can strategically drive growth for us, they seem to be having resiliency in these unexpected events. The other thing I think is to make sure you have a strong balance sheet, to make sure you can weather the storm. And we've had a strong balance sheet, we've never had debt. We've always had more cash in the balance sheet than we need for our normal ongoing business. And that has come in, you know, great, you know, really happy. Chipotle carries no long-term debt, and it's free cash flow almost tripled in 2021. When you think about the future, how do you take advantage of this and what is the flexibility that that enables? What it really affords us is we're going to be able to invest in our future no matter what. Like we accelerated our open, we accelerated our pursuit of new restaurant sites during the pandemic when some of the restaurant companies were laying off their development team. Chipotle not only expanded its footprint over the last two years, it reshaped its restaurants. A venture to drive through dining that began several years ago became a thriving profit center when the pandemic struck. The thing that's changed the most is just most of our restaurants now have a Chipotle. So three years ago we had maybe five or six Chipotle and now we have over 350 and 80% of our new openings have a Chipotle. The sales and our Chipotle restaurants are higher and our margins are higher too because the digital orders are our highest margin transaction.

17186," The Portland restaurants are higher and our margins are higher too because the digital orders are our highest margin transaction. And when you can serve the customer through the Portland without the delivery fees that we pay in the customers pay, it's a great margin opportunity for us. The convenience of Chipotleans contributed to soaring digital sales in 2020. There was little erosion in 2021, even as in-restaurant sales returned to 80% of 2019 levels. Meanwhile, membership in loyalty programs has boomed, giving Chipotle valuable insight into its customers' omnichannel preferences. What we've seen is that our digital customers, they come the most often and they spend the most each time they come. Customer loyalty could face a test if inflation continues to push higher. Chipotle hiked menu prices roughly 9% in 2021. Jack Hartung says it's not just wages and food costs that are putting on the pressure. It's hitting everything. Titting material is too for a restaurant so our new restaurants are costing more as well. You guys have had incredible pricing power. Is there a tipping point where it's like enough? We haven't seen it. Why is that Jack? Well, part of it is we've over the years been slow to raise prices. We've always tried not to go to the menu board to raise prices whenever we've had a challenge from a cost standpoint. We'll do other things to try to find efficiencies somewhere along the line. We raised prices in the second quarter of last year. We did that just to cover the cost of raising wages. We raised wages up to $15. It was an average of 15% increase. And we raised prices just to cover the dollar cost of that. So we didn't increase our margins. Our margins actually went down. But our profitability stayed the same. Our customers actually said, we really applaud what you're doing. We're fine with a 4% price increase. Not a chicken burrito, that's 30 cents. But the fact that you increase wages to that extent, we'd like you to eat a more spoiled. CEO Brian Nichol has warned that Chipotle may raise prices again if cost pressures intensify. With the cost of eating out already at historic levels, consumers may just have to get used to paying more. The industry is used to type an inflation. Call it 2%, you know, level inflation. They take, you know, a little bit of priced offset. It flows through and margins are just naturally restored. The fact of the matter is labor was the pressure point. So the industry today is definitely sitting on a high single digit price versus what is typically a low single digit price inflation or level of menu price increase. In relative terms, everyone has to do this. In fact, I would say, Carl, we could be more patient than others because we own all of our restaurants. When you're a franchise organization, when you have franchisees that have borrowed to invest in their business, they can't necessarily afford to let inflation eat away at their ability to pay the debt for very long. It is full speed ahead when it comes to store growth. Chipotle just up its goal to 7,000 from 6000 restaurants in the US. Thanks in large part to strong performance, it's seeing its smaller towns. Based on, we're already in more than a hundred of them. Based on the ones we're in, based on the results so far, which are extraordinary, we think there is as many as almost a thousand more restaurants. So even though you're talking about a small town with maybe 20,000, 30,000 people, the sales volumes are almost the same as if you're in a city like Chicago or a Chicago suburb. But the investment costs are lower, the rents are certainly lower, and the operating costs are lower. So you end up getting higher margins and higher returns. Paulie reaps the full benefit of these returns since it owns and operates all its stores and advantage that's not lost on Wall Street. It's extremely unusual in not only restaurants, but from a restaurant stock perspective to have a large cap stock that's growing its unit level economic model, meaning the revenues are getting better and the margins are getting better as growth is accelerating. It's just it's like almost unheard of. So there's little reason for Chipotle to begin franchising in the United States. But for the chain's 45 international restaurants, Bloomberg intelligence notes that partnering with local operators overseas might boost margins and accelerate expansion. We're open to the idea of some kind of franchise model. You know, there are areas of the world where it's going to be harder for us to own and to run the businesses ourselves when they're process of bringing our digital system to Europe.

Like Chipotle's menu, Jack Hartung's professional resume is in patented with exotic ingredients. He went straight to an accounting job at Cooper's in Lyberton. His next stop, 18 years at McDonald's. They called me up and McDonald's was just a few miles down the road. This place is great. What they told me was great about it was you started in one area, but then when a job opens up, they would post it and you can interview for it. So I felt, well, that sounds great. So I can learn a job. And then if I'm looking for another opportunity, I can interview for it. And if I've done a good job, I'll get those opportunities. Which is what happened? I am curious when you went from McDonald's to Chipotle where folks like, Jack, here you've got the established company. You're going to a startup. I mean, did people think you were crazy? Yeah, I mean, a lot of people thought I was crazy. In fact, one memorable person was a CEO of McDonald's at the time because I had a great career at McDonald's and the future looked really, really, really good. At Chipotle, it was in its infancy and it had this vision for food. That was like no other than I've seen. How much of it was, but downed, oh, 90% of Chipotle. How much of it was, all right, Jack, keep an eye on these guys. You know, that's how it started. And it wasn't keep an eye on it, but it was more, their food culture was very advanced. Their business culture was not. And so it was more of bringing some of your experience to Chipotle, just so you can get them on a stronger track. Once I got into Chipotle environment and I realized, oh my God, I want to be part of this. There was a passion about what we were doing. So it wasn't a finance job anymore. It was a job that was really changing food culture in this country. And it was a mission and it was a mission that I totally bought into. Chipotle's culture and mission have long differentiated it as a place to eat. With restaurants competing fiercely for employees in the wake of the pandemic, companies are going to have to show that they are great places to work as well. It's not just about that person coming back to work in the restaurant. They're going to come back, but they're not going to come back and work the way they did before. I think that the companies that win are those that are investing in their employees, their teams that are developing a.",https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dp8PhLsUcFE,5593,2022-10-22 12:15:39
17188," back and work the way they did before. I think that the companies that win are those that are investing in their employees, their teams that are developing a strong culture that people want to be a part of. The real win on a micro level is if restaurants can figure out how to make that employee work better and more efficiently, but in a way that makes them more satisfied. At this new location just outside Chicago, Jack Hartung told me what it will take to build a workforce to meet Chipotle's goals. You've got to start with attractive wages, but then you've got to go away beyond that. You've got to offer developmental opportunities, promotional opportunities. We have 100,000 employees, as we grow from 3,000 restaurants to 7,000 restaurants, we're going to need 200 or 250,000 employees. So our future depends on hiring great crew today that will be great managers in the future. Double the locations, double the staff, and along with investing in people, Chipotle plans to invest in technology to support them. There is so much still that can be done with artificial intelligence, robotics. When you think about our system, there are a lot of processes that, frankly, people don't know what we're doing. Cutting and courting avocados in the restaurant. Not a fun job. Very repetitive. I think there's a way where we could use robotics to help us do that. And then, as you think about artificial intelligence, we could be better at figuring out how many avocados we have to cut and courting it so that we never run out of walkablely throughout the day. As digital orders have surged, Chipotle has adapted its processes. The most dramatic change has been the addition of a second make line. This is very familiar to customers, our front line. And this is what for the first, you know, call it 18 years of Chipotle, this was you come in Chipotle along the line, you interact with the crew and you customize your meal. You've got this separate make line and it's digitized. And so the orders come in and they're really kind of staged so that if you say at noon, I want to commit at one o'clock, we hold that order and we will send it to the crew like a maybe 10 to one. So it's ready right when you pull up your car. How do you manage these kind of two different staffing needs, right? Making sure you have the right amount of people at the right time. We spend a lot of time projecting sales. A lot of it is, you know, it's part, part science. We're trying to bring more science and more AI into it. Because if you get the right sales projection, then you know exactly what your, what your staffing needs to be. So if you get the sales right, you can get the entire restaurant staff perfectly with just a couple of people. Our average restaurant now does about over a million dollars per restaurant in digital sales. Data science meets culinary art into Chipotle's commitment to menu innovation. By releasing several new items each year, management hopes to boost same store sales. It seems to be working, but it's more complicated than it looks. The most important thing is to make sure that the economics work, meaning when you bring something new, does it bring in additional customers? Does it bring existing customers more often? There's always going to be trade off from, you know, one menu item to another. And there could be economic either advantages or disadvantages. We just want to understand that, you know, when a customer comes in, if they're trading from a high margin item to low margin item, that's going to be a loser for us. And any new offering must meet Chipotle's rigorous sourcing standards. It will take us a year and a half from the time that we are experimenting in the test kitchen to, we'll put it into a few restaurants to see how does it work operationally and do customers like it. But it'll take us a year and a half because we've then got to build up a splicing. It's a challenge, but we take our time and we're not going to roll it out before it's ready. Jack Hartung clearly places a high value on the customer experience and the experience of those who work at Chipotle restaurants. He's a people person and a family man with five children and ten grandchildren. Even his favorite hobby brings family into play. It's a passion for collecting and restoring classic cars. I drive here very conservatively, so I'm not like ripping down the highway or anything, but these are cars that I really cared about and really admired and aspired to when I was young. And so I still love these cars. There's a bonding that goes on as well. One of my sons is a mechanic. So he's a mechanic for Tesla. And he loves cars. And so we send time at car shows together. We'll go to auctions and look for cars. And so we have a great time and he knows how to fix the car.",https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dp8PhLsUcFE,5594,2022-10-22 12:20:05
17189," He's a mechanic for Tesla and he loves cars and so we send time to car shows together. We'll go to auctions and look for cars and so we have a great time and he knows how to fix the cars and I know how to drive the cars and so that's kind of the partnership that we have but we have a great time together. Up next, sustainability is much more than a buzzword for Chipotle and it's more than figures on a spreadsheet for Jack Carton. Jack is 100% bought into our purpose of cultivating a better world. Bernie tells me what a chief future officer has to learn not to do. Every CFO knows how to read financial statements and go through what a CFO is supposed to do. But I think what you have to do is put those aside at some point. This is Bloomberg. I think that it's hard to put your head around any narrative. Like just be honest, we've had sort of a shift in, are we in some sort of circulation fears moment before talking about that all day yesterday? A lot of the satellites have propulsion systems they can kind of move to get out of the way of each other or change their orbit a little bit. It's a service that you guys offered to help these companies know how to maneuver their machines. Yeah, we offer a collision avoidance service. It's a subscription service. We'll send you an alert up to seven days in advance if your satellite is going to come dangerously close to a piece of debris or another satellite. These have been doing that for decades moving satellites around, but it's sort of like a harder problem now. The risk of a collision is a lot higher now. Just because we've installed so much more hardware into space, you have a big collision that creates a cloud of debris and now all the other satellites are flying through this whizzing mess of debris as we add all of the new satellites into space, the risks of a collision, the likelihood of the collision is going up. Essential pillar of Chipotle's business has always been a commitment to fresh food and support of sustainable agriculture. From responsibly raised meat to local and organic produce, the company's crafted a supply chain carefully over decades. Every company is facing supply chain challenges. Chipotle has a great infrastructure. They have a sophisticated team. They have relationships with their suppliers, a lot of whom are local. And a lot who have gotten to know Jack Hartung. He's done much more to build those relationships than just sign checks. Within my first year, I was spending time on hog farms, cilantro farms. Believe it or not, I drove a combine, that's the size of this restaurant, to harvest rice, organic rice. These are things that they had a lasting impression on me because when I would go back to my office and I would be working on spreadsheets of financial analysis, I saw how the hogs were raised. I saw how they were raised conventionally versus with our farmers. And I'm like, I've got to make sure that our financials and all everything we spend money on needs to be thoughtful so that we can invest in the better way, raising food. It's more expensive to buy this food. I would try to make sure that the economic model supported investing in this food and not through higher-memor prices. Jack is 100% bought into our purpose of cultivating a better world. One of those key plans is sustainability and doing the right thing for the planet. And as a result, he's all in bored with investing and understanding the implications on the business and then obviously our purpose. We know what matters. We know what matters, not just to our customers, to our crew as well. We do the right things. We do what's right for our people. We do what's right for the farmers. We do what's right for the environment. For the last 20 years at Chipotle, Jack Hartung has made strategic decisions based on what matters, even in times of turmoil and crisis. Looking back, more often than not, it's paid off. So I wanted to know what he sees when he looks ahead. What's the opportunity for Chipotle in the next 10 years that excites you the most? Well, I think the most exciting thing is that we're not even halfway to our potential in the US. So, you know, when I joined a company with a few hundred restaurants and we were talking about a thousand, maybe a two thousand. Here we are at three thousand talking about seven. I believe as we approach seven, that number is going to be higher. A lot higher? Well, I don't know how much higher, but for sure it's going to go up. And international, we're just scratching the surface. So.",https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dp8PhLsUcFE,5595,2022-10-22 12:24:28
17190," I believe as we approach seven, that number is going to be higher. A lot higher? Well, I don't know how much higher, but for sure it's going to go up. And international, we're just scratching the surface. And we've been very responsible in the international where we've taken that same food ethos. We've owned the restaurant so far. And so it's been a very slow, let's make sure we get this right. You know, sometimes you have to go slow before you go fast. That's kind of been our approach. We've gone slow and now we're positioning ourselves to, I think in the not-to-distant future, go fast in the international. So those are the two things that are exciting the most. All right, what's the challenge for the next 10 years that is on your mind the most that Nadia keeps you up at night? People. When we run all of our restaurants like we do today, we have around 100,000 employees. As we grow, we're going to need more employees. We promoted 19,000 people last year. 90% of our promotions were in-house. So we always have to be on our game in terms of higher and great people that believe in Chipotle and our purpose today that have the desire to learn how to cook, learn how to run a business, learn how to lead people. If we do a great job with that, the future only gets brighter. So we're in great shape from the people's standpoint, but that's something that I'll always worry about. Are we hiring and developing the right people? You don't want to be losing people. If we lose people, then we might have to resort to franchising. And it's hard to follow a purpose during tough times, like during a pandemic. It's hard to invest in things like food and people. You win margin for under pressure. When you own your own restaurants, you can make those investments. How do you see your role as CFO changing in the next 10 years? Safe to say, it's changed a lot in the past 10 years. How about the next 10? It has. I think it'll just evolve with the challenges. I mean, again, I'm already fortunate that I've been able to get involved in real estate and supply chain. I spend time in a restaurant, spend time in suppliers, spend time in international as well. So I always, I already get to spend a lot of time in a lot of these areas. I think in terms of evolution, it's probably more a matter of the folks on my team, some of which are new to Chipotle in the last few years, some of which have been with us for a long time, to help them rise up so they can take on bigger responsibilities. And we become a bigger company. Everybody in the company will need to step up and take on bigger responsibilities. So my main goal will be to make sure that they're ready to take those on. What's the skill set that you think every CFO should be acquiring in this environment? I think being a digital savvy is probably the most important thing. Trying to stay, you know, keep up or even stay ahead of where technology is going, not just in the next five years, the next 10 or 15 years. I think that's the most critical for CFO. What's the best advice for the future that you give to somebody a person who just got promoted to CFO today? I would say be really, really curious. Try to learn as much as you can about every part of the business. Every CFO knows how to read financial statements and go through what a CFO is supposed to do. But I think what you have to do is put those aside at some point. Go spend time in your business. In our case, spend time in restaurants. Spend time with suppliers. I think get to know how other people within the business, what their challenges are, what their opportunities are, what really makes the customer care about your brand or your business. And I think the more you do that, when you go back to the spreadsheets, you're going to be thinking about things from a different standpoint. Your priorities might change a little bit. And it might change how you make investments to make sure that the customer experience is better next time, rather than the margin is better. I mean, if you invest in the customer in a way where they become loyal to your customer, the margin will come. Hartfeld and Hanson, Jack Hartung is put Chipotle in position to go forward by always making sure the business goes back to the start and stays true to its roots. That's what makes him Chipotle's chief future officer. I'm Carol Masser. This is Bloomberg.",https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dp8PhLsUcFE,5596,2022-10-22 12:28:50

17192," Katie, it's so great to have you. Great to be back here in the studio with you, Emily. I want to start with a vibe check. Okay. What state of the crypto cycle are we in right now? It was hot. Yep. And then it got pretty cold. Hmm. Well, look, Emily, zooming back because I've been in crypto for a decade, if you can believe it. We've seen crypto be really hot, and then all of a sudden not. And so we've seen this before. However, I think one of the things that's a little bit different now is with each new crypto cycle, more and more people come into it. And so it's more and more pronounced each cycle. And I would push back on its knot. I think it depends on what area of the ecosystem you're looking at. We think developers think crypto and Web3 is still really hot. I am seeing a lot less of those, we're all gonna make it hashtags. I am seeing a lot less of them too, although I am spending less time on Twitter, so maybe that's why. Well, but with each cycle, there are new acronyms. What hasn't happened is a crypto winter in the midst of really serious global macro conditions. So we have inflation, kind of at record highs for our generation, in our lifetime. And then we have also a war that's broken out in the Ukraine, and we have a number of other factors going on here. So that's very different. There was some serious carnage out there. Socius, Luna, three hours. What's been your takeaways for more of that? I don't want to sit here and tell you that algorithmic stablecoins are bad because I actually think they're really interesting. However, I think what happened is you had, in this case you mentioned Luna and Tara, that was an algorithmic stablecoin that was getting pretty widespread adoption relative to what the tech could do. I didn't realize you spent your teenage years living in Egypt and learning Arabic. Tell me about your upbringing. I was always uprooted. My dad worked for a large company and we were always moving just when I would get comfortable in one space. And I think actually that's pretty important. If you fast-forward and look at my career, I'm comfortable being in uncomfortable situations. I didn't know a lot about venture when I got into it initially. I didn't know a lot about crypto when I got into it initially. And I was okay asking questions. I was okay not knowing the local acronyms or the Namanclature of a particular field. And I'm taken right back to my teenage years in Cairo moving from Houston, Texas one day to downtown Maddie in Cairo the next day. You studied law. I did. You clerked for Supreme Court Justice Anthony Kennedy. That's right. You became a federal prosecutor. You were taking on prison gangs and the mafia. That must have taken a really thick skin. I was doing it at 8 to 25. And now if I take a step back and you know, I think that happens at different points in your career. Like, whoa, if I would have analyzed that a little more at the time and I'm kind of in some ways glad I didn't. I just dove right in because I found it fascinating. There was a human aspect to it and people's stories. And I felt like those stories mattered. So I was drawn to criminal law and became a federal prosecutor. And I did cases involving violent crime. But then really mistrying cases, being back in the courtroom, being before the grand jury. Like the prosecutor you would see on TV going to try those murder cases. You and those two hour closing arguments. That's right. And so moved out here to California. I indicted the largest prison gang in the world at the time. Outlaw motorcycle gangs, hostage taking, bank robberies, armed bank robberies. There was really not a kind of criminal case by that point in my career. I hadn't done it. It was right around that time, 2012. One of my bosses came in and said, let's have that same energy that you brought to those gang cases, to those murder cases. And let's go ahead and have you investigate this new criminal technology that we really need to look into and possibly shut this down. So you created the first cryptocurrency task force. How would you describe it? Fortunately, several of us in the government realized at the time it's not possible, also not desirable. Because Bitcoin is not an entity. It's not a person. It's a protocol. And it would be like saying, let's go shut down cash. Let's go shut down the internet. It's not possible. Probably wouldn't be a good idea, either. I was using crypto and technologies like the Bitcoin blockchain, because that's all it existed then. This is 2012, 2013, to actually uncover criminal activity.

17193," Using crypto and technologies like the Bitcoin blockchain, because that's all that existed then, this is 2012, 2013, to actually uncover criminality. So I didn't think that that technology was bad. Frankly, it was a tool that helped me uncover the various activity. And by the way, it was a step-level function improvement better than compliance by banks. I'll just go ahead and say it. That's a little bit controversial, but I had spent a decade subpoening large financial institutions and five times out of 10 didn't get back what I needed. One case I worked on, and people always say, oh, you shut down the Silk Road. What actually happened? I was looking into something completely, not having to do with anything at all of the Silk Road and came across some, what looked to be some kind of odd activity. And it turns out that a couple of federal agents on the Silk Road Task Force out of Washington, DC were croaked. And that is the case that I ended up in dining and I ended up prosecuting those agents, and they both went to prison. So that's the aspect of what Silk Road case that I worked on. I would never have been able to uncover that criminal activity by those agents, because they were federal agents, they knew how to cover their tracks, had they not use Bitcoin blockchain. So that technology right there, if they had just used wires or cash or bank wires, we would never have uncovered that. Just how hard is it to launch a crypto fund in front of scratch? You will put a woman on Mars. You will bring forth global cooling. You will be the first chief crypto officer. Because when you subscribe to Bloomberg, you won't just get news. You'll get insight into limitless possibilities, knowledge and inspiration to feed your ambition. So before you invent pioneer, disrupt, before you change the world, Bloomberg. It is crucially important. And I think we've moved from this attitude, from its indulgence, a waste of time, almost an illness that needs a cure. For something as universally important to human life as sleep, mysteries surrounding its necessity and utility have only just been recently uncovered. Some of our biggest discoveries were in the 1970s or 1980s, and so it makes that a really exciting field, because it seems as though we're uncovering new insights each and every day. Some scientists are going further to find out how sleep and what happens there can be harnessed to further expand our understanding. It's easy to memorize things that makes you smart. If you can spit back a lot of facts. But if you want to be wise, if you really want wisdom, you've got to know when and how and why to use that information. And that's what your brain figures out while you're sleeping. So you became kind of a crypto convert. After this, you joined the board of coinbase. That's right. Very early on. How did you and coinbase and Brian Armstrong come together? I hosted an event here in San Francisco at the Federal Reserve Bank. And I believe it was there that it wasn't just Brian. It was a lot of what I'll call legitimate actors and crypto, who wanted to usher in this new wave, this new ecosystem. And then we brought together the heads of all kinds of agencies, really in an effort to kind of talk about building bridges. The government and the crypto industry, we're never going to see eye to eye on a lot of things. But we did think there were some commonalities. Coinbase is a company that has suffered. They've been losing share. The valuation of the public markets has plummeted. Why do you think that is? And how do you think it can be fixed? Yeah. Well, I think again, a few things it's tied to. One, a large aspect of Coinbase's business now, of course, is trading revenue. And that's down when prices are down. And the company's been very transparent about that long before going public. I mean, also, if you look at its S1, it specifically identifies that. And just how volatile crypto cycles are. So I think that's part of it. It's judged by public markets as a technology stock, or as a financial services company. By the way, I think it's both. I think it's not just.",https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dp8PhLsUcFE,5599,2022-10-22 12:41:51
17194," So I think that's part of it. It's judged by public markets as a technology stock or as a financial services company. By the way, I think it's both. I think it's not just a financial services company. I think it's so much more. I think it's really a portal to this whole new ecosystem. You were also on the board of OpenC until recently there's an insider trading situation or accusation going on there. Coinbase has also had employees accused of insider trading. How much is this happening within crypto companies and within the industry and how big a problem is? Yeah, I think crypto is under the microscope. So where you have a case, two cases, three cases in crypto ecosystem which now is a trillion dollar industry. I think multi billion approaching trillion dollar industry. You're always going to be able to find examples like that. So I don't want to make too much out of a handful of cases. That said, the company Coinbase OpenC, take these things incredibly seriously. Along with your position at Coinbase, you became a partner at one of the most storied venture capital for Silicon Valley and the reason for these Andreessen Harwitz. What was your experience at A16Z? There I met Chris Dixon and I met Ben Harwitz and I met Mark Andreessen. And I had worked with them for just about a year, maybe a little bit over when they asked me to come and co-run their crypto funds at Andreessen Harwitz. Again, I jumped at that chance and I think really that speaks to the fact that as I've said before, things are a hell yes or there are no. And it was a hell yes for me. So Andreessen Harwitz is the kind of place where if you make a partner you don't leave. Yeah. How did Mark and Ben respond when you said, yeah, why don't we have to start a crypto fund of my own? As you might know, Emily, they're an anchor. They're an anchor check into my fund. And I'm very grateful for that. You know, Mark and Chris and folks like them are also personal LPs. So I felt very supported when I shared that decision. And I will say that it was not running away from Andreessen Harwitz. It was running to another opportunity. And you know, crypto is not, what do they say? It's not a spectator sport. It's like, you're in it. It's excuse very young. It's 24-7. It's global. And it's hustle. And at this, and that's a trade-off. It's a life trade-off. And at this point in my career and in my life, if I was going to continue to make that trade-off, I just wanted to do it and do it in a way that was really true to me. So you struck out on your own to launch on ventures. What gave you the courage to do that? What was the spark that lit the fire? Yeah. That got you to say, I need to do this and do this now. Sure. What I set out to do was to continue to invest in this ecosystem that I think is so broad that decision was very purposeful. And the timing was very purposeful. We have an early stage fund that does seed stage, Series A, even Series B. And then we have what we call an acceleration fund, which is, it's not a growth fund. It's a crypto growth fund. And I think those are different things. But it's later stage. It might be crypto-publics. Certain kinds of public tokens were set up to hold tokens and participate in the token ecosystem. Or later stage companies. There are now several crypto, many crypto unicorns. Space has become really competitive. Even though you say, you know, crypto has had its ups and downs. The thing is, a lot of people in some of those last cycles have seen the kind of venture style returns that can be had in crypto. And so you've had a lot of new funds enter the space. And that's driven up competition. So what differentiates on ventures then from, you know, all of these other crypto funds or even the more traditional venture capitalists like entries in Harowitz or Sequoia? They also have crypto funds now. Well, I think a lot of traditional venture capital funds now have crypto funds. It used to just be like a regulatory designation. It was like, are you an RIA, which is registered investment advisor? I would say for crypto founders today, it's not enough to just be an RIA, right? They, frankly, I don't even know if a lot of them care. That's a regulatory designation. What crypto founders today want to know is, do you live and breathe crypto? Do you inhale the discourse? Are you part of the community? Do you participate in governance? Are you going to be staking these kind of crypto verbs out there? And if you're not really in this space full time, I think it's very hard to run a successful crypto fund. We don't have a hedge fund component. So we're not sitting here buying and trading and selling. That's a hedge fund structure. And there are crypto hedge funds. We're not one. We're making.",https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dp8PhLsUcFE,5600,2022-10-22 12:46:13
17195," We don't have a hedge fund component. So we're not sitting here buying and trading and selling. That's a hedge fund structure. And there are crypto hedge funds. We're not one. We're making seven to 10 year bets. Just how hard is it to launch a crypto fund from scratch? You know, it's hard, but it's not impossible. We don't have a crystal ball. I don't know. I can't predict cycles, but I knew that we were in a cycle where you saw so much further an excitement around the space. And I already talked about what makes this different. But I think one thing also is we are an embellished strike force. We don't fish in the same pond. We have the crypto natives. We have a fish and execution. We have operators, seasoned operators, who really know how to stick the landing. And I think that's reflected on our culture. I would say the only thing that's changed in our strategy as a result of the market correction is really more of a focus on early stage. But we still have our late stage fund. And when we see valuations, which I think will still see correct, spoiler. I think we'll continue to see some corrections. And so we might deploy our later stage fund a little bit more slowly. It might not be on an even 50-50 cadence. And that's OK. Long-term, our strategy hasn't changed. Long-term, we're committed to this space. How much do you think valuations are going to correct? You know, I can't give you a one-size-fits-all answer because crypto is not a monolith. You have some crypto companies that really follow more of an enterprise-sass business model. You have others that are layer one protocols. You have still others that are consumer-facing applications. And I think one of the things we're seeing right now is the infrastructure layer. And that's where we're spending a lot of our time, by the way. And we think more and more use cases will come about when the infrastructure layer is in place. So my own view is we are not rushing to deploy. We're certainly not getting caught up. You do get VC FOMO. I try not to avoid that. You know, look, I think it's very easy to get into that mindset, right? It's because it's a competitive sport. It's a competitive space. And I think I'd be lying if I said that doesn't influence anyone. I try to, what I do, and I think I do differently, is I try to take stock of that. Oh, that's the FOMO mentality kicking in. That's bad. Again, you don't want to over-correct, though. What we look for is we look for amazing founders. It doesn't matter if I think valuations will correct. If there are amazing founders, there's a huge tam. We also look for what's your regulatory plan? If you're launching a token, what's your plan to comply with the law? What's your plan for security, by the way? You've seen a lot of hacks in the space. We want to really dive in there and make sure that the founders have been thoughtful about, especially if they're custodian customer funds, keeping those funds secure. If it's a cross-chain bridge, what are the exploits? Have you changed your strategy at all, given the downturn? What? Have you backed out of any deals or decided not to do certain deals? Because the conditions have changed. Since you raised the phone. We have decided not to do certain deals. We've never backed out of a deal. We have decided not to do a few deals. Because. Because we think that pricing was ahead of progress, candidly. And we might have been wrong about that, Emily. We might have been wrong about that. But I think if we were wrong not to do a couple of deals, better that we might have been right. Because if we were wrong about that, I think we can find a way to still invest in those projects later. Well, one thing I'm hearing is that a lot of dry powder has just stepped up. Because all these funds raised a lot of money raised. What was the biggest fund ever for a single person, not just a woman, anyone? Yep. Are you confident you're going to have a place to put all that money on? I am, but if I don't have a place to put it, I'm not just going to go willing, nearly deploy it. One of the things that we told our LPs, even during the period when we raised our fund, which was when crypto was undeniably still on a bull run, we said that we are going to be pretty steadfast, sticking to a tier deployment cycle. And I think one thing that's changed is that might have lengthened. It certainly hasn't shortened. But we will, again, we have, we feel very good that we have the capital to back great teams when we see them. So you think we're going to fall behind the United States? I think we already are falling behind. Fall behind. I think we're falling behind.",https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dp8PhLsUcFE,5601,2022-10-22 12:50:33
17196," MUSIC From the world of politics to the world of business, Balance of power with David Weston, and analysis inside from and about politics power players. This is Bloomberg. So before you invent pioneer disrupt, before you change the world, Bloomberg. What about NFTs? And if you are concerned about the declining demand? We are going to increasingly live in a digital world. And I happen to think that if you live in a digital world, you're going to want to own digital goods in that world. You're not just going to be satisfied to rent them, which is what we do now. We buy our content from walled gardens without digital scarcity, which is what NFTs unlock. You don't really own anything. You're subject to the whims of a platform. And I think NFTs and digitally scarce goods fundamentally change that. I think you'll see NFTs back again. But we are spending a lot of time in the infrastructure layer. Like I tell you zero knowledge, technology, scalability. We think of that as like the plumbing. If you think of the fiber-hubtic cables. Remember, you couldn't have had YouTube and Netflix with dial-up. You couldn't have streamed content. The same is true of crypto use cases. We think that there will be a lot of new use cases unlocked when the infrastructure is there, when it's more efficient, when it's more user-friendly. And so we're spending a lot of our time there. President Biden issues this crypto executive order. There are a number of ports that are coming due. What do you want to see from the administration when it comes to regulation? Are you optimistic that we will get there? Yeah. We were so delighted to see that executive order. This is not something you should normally be delighted about. But why we were is because it was to us a real recognition that this is a US government saying this field isn't going anywhere. This field is growing. It's growing so much that we are going to direct every single agency in the federal government to come up with a plan here. I think we take a step forward, but then you see we're a big government. We're a big system. We have states. We have local entities. So we take a step forward with the EO. And then we take some steps back sometimes too. And I think what I see as crypto founders are confused by that. They're starting to think, well, I could go to this jurisdiction where there's a single regulator. And you don't have 50 states with different rules. It's the US government that needs to start taking stock of the fact that right now, Emily in China, there's a quarter of a billion ECNY wallets, a quarter of a billion. We're still talking about whether there should be a government central bank digital currency. We're still studying that. So you think we're going to fall behind the United States? I think we already are falling behind. Fall behind China. And we're falling behind. What are the dangers of falling behind China and the rest of the world? This is years ahead. So I don't want people to take a headline and say, oh, I think the US dollar will be no longer the global currency. Reserve global currency. I'm not saying that now. But fast forward decades. And if you no longer need to use the dollar because you have an alternative, I think that's a real problem. What would we use instead? Well, I think that there are going to be stable coins out there that people who have access to a smartphone will use. There is a demand for it. We see our 285% year of your growth with stable coins. So people are clearly liking the idea of this. Now, again, there have been some spectacular failures too, but not all stable coins are created the same. But I think the important thing is that we really do need to not just quash innovation. What do you think of how Gary Gensler, the chair of the SEC, and how he's approaching it? One of the things that I hear from founders is that they're very confused because they get told, come in, register. Just come in and talk to us. But you have the one.",https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dp8PhLsUcFE,5602,2022-10-22 12:54:51
17197," SEC and how he's approaching it. One of the things that I hear from founders is that they're very confused because they get told, come in, register, just come in and talk to us. But you have the one company who's done the ultimate act of going in and registering coinbase, filed an S1. And still, there's a lot of saber rattling still going on, I think. And again, I don't want to single out the SEC. And I don't want to suggest that anything they're doing is bad. I do think, though, that right now there's a lot of confusion. And one of the pieces of confusion stems from the fact that, you know, and it started with the ICO mania back in what, 2016, 2017, I can't even remember which year now, where the SEC was very loud about securities. A lot of them were securities, but the space has changed. And so to still view it through the ICO lens, when so much has happened over the last five years in the space, I think is a mistake. What do you have to say to the skeptics out there who just don't believe in the future of Web3? And don't see where this is going. Yeah. I would say don't judge the current state of innovation by the end state of innovation. I hear from a lot of these skeptics. And by the way, I'm friends with a lot of these skeptics, too. I don't only want to live in a crypto bubble. They want to see the use cases, especially if they're not technical. Well, when am I going to use it? What will I use it for? And I think one of the things that's not appreciated is how quickly the infrastructure here is catching up. And once you have really scalable blockchains that can handle a lot of thorough put and are very efficient, I think that unlocks a whole lot of use cases. People are spending more time on screens. That curve is up and to the right. Whether we like it or not, that is the future. I mean, those who have kids know that kids spend more time online. They want digital things, too. And I think to dismiss it, it is a bit generational. I do find not always, but it is a bit generational. If you talk to kids about being able to have money online, they instantly get that concept. They're comfortable not having to hold something in their hand to think it has value. Take us to the end state. Do Google and Amazon and Facebook and Apple still exist? I believe they will still exist. I mean, it depends what you talk about when you talk about the end state. I think that I think for decades, those companies will still be around. But the important thing is I think this new ecosystem is going to represent a challenge to them. I do think that those entities, decentralized forces, are coming. And we'll cut into those entities, profits and revenues. So we have a little rapid fire section. If you could belong to any altcoin tribe, that's what it be. Gosh. There is no way I'm answering that because I will get trolled on Twitter by every other altcoin tribe. I'm a crypto maximalist. I'm a crypto maximalist. I'm not picking one. Booker podcast, you're binging now. Okay. Yes, I am. Gosh, I'm binging on wheat crashed. Something that brings you simple joy. You know, one of the things that I love and I've missed being away from this summer is swimming. I just love, I find like some of my best thoughts come to me while I'm moving. Career philosophy. Yeah. Do a job where you know 50% of the job and where you're going to learn 50% of the job. Again, that goes back to no growth in the comfort zone, no comfort in the growth zone. Well, good work.

Bloomberg, your global business authority. This is my kitchen table and also my filing system. Over much of the past three decades, I've been an investor. The highest calling of me in time, I've often thought was private equity. And then I started interviewing. I watch your interviews because I know how to do something. I've learned in doing my interviews how leaders make it to the top. I asked him how much he wanted. He said 250, I said fine, I didn't negotiate with him. I did no due diligence. I have something I'd like to sell and how they stay there. You don't feel inadequate. Now, because being on the second wealthiest man in the world, is that right? One of the president's most senior economic advisors is Brian D's, who heads the National Economic Council at the White House. I recently had a chance to sit down with Brian to talk about interest rates, inflation, and the general state of the economy in the United States and around the world. So let me ask you the first and most important question. Are we going to go into a recession anytime in their foreseeable future? Well, thank you for having me. I thought we were going to start on a grossy note, but I should have expected nothing less. I'll join this side. Thank you for having me and thank you for putting this together. We are no doubt in uncertain times. But I think that if you look at the US economy, my perspective, the most striking feature of the US economy right now is resilience. The resilience of households and consumer balance sheets. The resilience of business and business investment. And globally, the resilience of the US economy in an uncertain global environment. So we're certainly in a complicated and in many ways unprecedented transition. But I think that there's every reason to have a lot of confidence in the US position in the context of a globally uncertain environment.",https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dp8PhLsUcFE,5604,2022-10-22 13:03:25
17199," complicated and in many ways unprecedented transition. But I think that there's every reason to have a lot of confidence in the US position in the context of a globally uncertain environment. I'll take that as maybe. You don't know. Well, let me ask you an easier question. Yeah, please. All right. I'll take any out. You want to give me? You think England is, and you think the UK is in a recession? Well, I think the situation in Europe and the UK is very, very difficult right now. They face a very difficult situation. And they are, as I was saying, in terms of the US position, they're significantly more exposed to the energy price volatility. And they don't have some of the incumbent strengths that we have here economically. So I think it is and is going to be a tough period for the UK and for the European Union. Normally, in the United States, when you cut taxes, it's designed to stimulate the economy. And that's what happened in Britain. They now cutting taxes to stimulate the economy. But it seems an unfortunate impact on the British economy. Stock markets going down. And people are very upset about it. Are you surprised about that? I wasn't surprised with the market reaction. I think that if we, you have to, any economic policy has to be in the context of the situation that we are in. And in a monetary tightening cycle like this, the challenge with that policy apertures, it just puts the monetary authority in a position of potentially having to move even tighter. I think that that's what you saw in the reaction. And also, I would say it is important, particularly important, to maintain a focus on fiscal prunes, fiscal discipline. It's certainly something that we have been focused on here. And the markets take notice. So let's talk about another easy subject inflation. Inflation is as high as it's been since I was in government. I managed to get a higher rate than you've gotten so far. But I wanted to know, in your view, is inflation now coming down a bit as a result of the Fed's hiking? And do you expect the Fed to continue to hike in November and December FOMC meetings? Well, the good news is the second part of your question is the easy one, as you know, because part of respecting the independence of the Fed is leaving to them. Yes, if you expect. Look, the market expects that. OK, I don't have any wisdom beyond that. I think, but if you look at most of the data points over the course of the last couple of months, we've certainly seen headline inflation on a month over a month basis, slow dramatically. Basically, it's been flat for the last couple of months. That's a function of the fact that we've seen energy prices come down, gas prices. And that's offset price increases elsewhere. But I think if you look broadly across the economy, you are seeing a number of places where you're seeing this shift and this transition happen in real time. Community prices have come off. You've seen that in a number of durable goods segments. And at the same time, as you know, this process operates with some lags. And so that's why, even as you look over the course of the last couple of months, you've got to really, even at a moment of heightened uncertainty that we are in right now, have to do whatever we can to lift up from individual monthly data points. Now, when I went to college many years ago, the standard textbook said that inflation was on average, three or four percent a year. That was relatively normal. For the last 25 years, we've had 2% inflation. And so we've gotten used to 2% inflation. My children have never seen higher inflation. But the Fed now says they want to get inflation back to 2%, which is what it was. But why not three or four percent is? Why does 2% have to be a goal? And how hard is it going to be to get down to 2% without putting unemployment up to 6% or higher? A big part of inflation is expectations. And the risk with inflation is not only the immediate impact on purchasing power, but also the risk that expectations get on more, get unanchored. And then it gets much more difficult to bring inflation down. So when you ask that question about bringing down to a level, I think one of the most important questions is the shape of policy focused.",https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dp8PhLsUcFE,5605,2022-10-22 13:07:48
17200," So when you ask that question about bringing down to a level, I think one of the most important questions is the, is the shape of policy focused on making sure that we don't lose control of those expectations. That's obviously something that the Fed keeps a close eye on. And so, you know, to your question of the process, look, I am fundamentally optimistic about the American economy. And I'm optimistic that we can navigate through this transition in a way where we come out of this as a country and as an economy in a stronger position than when the pandemic hit. So, yeah, I, I, I, I, I, I do believe that that's, that's, there's, there's no, no certainty in any way or no, no way inevitable that we are, you know, we're going into a downturn. For people who live in Washington, politicians, is it more difficult when unemployment is going up or when inflation is going up? So, if inflation affects everybody, unemployment does affect everybody. So, how do you, the way the, the political trade-off between unemployment going up and inflation going up, which is more difficult for politicians or for, let's say, the administration? There's no question that inflation affects everybody and it affects the, it affects the psyche. And I think that when it, it, it, it, it affects a sense, I think also of people sentiment and a sense in which things are, you know, in or out of, out of control and, and we see that in, in consumer sentiment data. At the same time, we also as, you asked the question about, on the political side, as economic policymakers need to recognize that the way that economists think about inflation and the way that Americans think about inflation often differs, that we have this idea of headline inflation versus core. And economists say you really should pay less attention to headline because it has food and gas. And it's typical, typical people, what inflation is, it's food and gas. And so, you know, understanding the, you know, the interplay between the economics and the politics of inflation is, is something that we, we haven't been as used to. We haven't been as used to saying that this is such a program that, you know, there's no public mand�� here, and nowhere. has a very special place in the universe. It's the first element on the periodic table. It is the most abandoned element in the universe. And when clean energy advocates think about what can we find which would be as easy to use, as fossil fuels, they think about hydrogen. The fuel that will wind burn only produced water. We like to imagine that if we just built enough of these and these, we could ditch fossil fuels and save the planet. Unfortunately, it's not that simple. There are some things we just need a good old-fashioned combustible fuel. Now startups around the world are betting that hydrogen can become the fuel of the 21st century. Music Music Music So let me go back to the NAC. If NAC was started under President Clinton and Bob Rubin was the first person to hold that job, can you explain to people what it actually does and what the NAC does day to day? For example, who's in the NAC, who's on the NAC? What is your job actually to do? So the National Economic Council, the job, the mandate, the mission of the organization is to coordinate economic policy across the executive branch and across the cabinet to make sure that the president is getting the benefit of when making decisions of his entire economic cabinet and also that the economic cabinet is getting clear direction from the president as well. So that two ways. So it's a coordination function. On the NAC itself are all of the relevant cabinet members. This is your call.",https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dp8PhLsUcFE,5606,2022-10-22 13:12:25
17201," from the president as well, so that two ways. So it's a coordination function. On the NEC itself are all of the relevant cabinet members, the sort of core economic team, OMB, Council of Economic Advisors, Treasury, but also Secretary of Labor, Secretary of Commerce. My team, the NEC team, is a small team within the White House that is, our job is to do that coordination across the range of economic policy. Now you were the deputy in the Obama administration at the NEC, and now you're the director. Which NEC work better, the Obama administration one or the Biden one? Well, on the issues that I worked on in the Obama administration, it worked very, very well. And the current NEC works very well as well. So it's that subset of the ones I didn't work on. OK, let's talk about your own background from moment. I mentioned before you grew up in Boston area. And what did your family do? Were they in business, academics, politics, important things like private equity? Did they do that? My father's an educator. He teaches. And my mother is a civil engineer by training and worked as an environmental engineer. OK, so you went to Middlebury, and what did you study there? I studied political science and economics with an international focus. OK, and after you graduated, what did you do then? I came here to DC on a fellowship to the Carnegie Endowment for International Peace. And I was doing international economics, international economic development. I had spent the better part of the year in Argentina in 1999, right before the collapse there, became fascinated with trade and development issues. And so I came here to DC and the Argentinian economy collapsed while you were there. No, right after I left. Right after I left. Right after you left. You got out. Correlation and causation. OK, so then you came back to Washington to do what? So I stayed here. I worked, I sort of shifted from international policy, economic policy, domestic policy. Then I went to law school, left DC, and I came back here. Oh, you went to law school to be a lawyer or not? I went to law school to, no, not to be a lawyer. But because I was fascinated as I was working on the economic, more economic elements, it became clear that most of policy is actually understanding law in different ways. And so I went to, I went with the idea that I would continue to work in policy. But then, so you didn't want to practice law ever? It wasn't my objective. OK, so how did you get involved with the Obama administration? Did you volunteer in the campaign? Or how did you get involved in the campaign or the administration? So I started working on the 2007-2008 campaign. I actually worked for, I had the most important experience. I campaigned against candidate Obama for about nine months working for Senator Clinton, Secretary Clinton. And then after they lost, I was fortunate enough to then join the Obama campaign in campaign for more. And what did then Senator Obama say about that? The good news was, I was junior enough in the campaign that Senator Obama was, I don't think particularly aware of my transition to his stain at this time. So he got elected and then you got this position as a special assistant to President for Economic Policy. And what was the biggest thing that you accomplished during the Obama administration in your view? My first project upon coming into government was to work as part of the team that did the restructuring of General Motors and Chrysler, as well as the finance companies as well. And so that was basically from, you will all, many of you will recall November, December of 2008, right through to the summer of 2009. That was my overriding focus. So after the Obama administration, you joined the dark side of money management. And you worked for BlackRock, but in charge of global sustainability. So what does that mean? What were you doing at BlackRock? So two things. One was trying to actually do financial research to understand what are drivers of long-term economic performance that are financially relevant, but that may not be on the mind of traditional investors to give you a concrete example. One of the most persistent.",https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dp8PhLsUcFE,5607,2022-10-22 13:16:28
17202," naturally relevant, but that may not be on the mind of traditional investors to give you a concrete example. One of the most persistent measures of financial performance uncorrelated is the rate of change at which a company brings down its carbon emissions, not just the level of carbon emissions, but the rate of change of doing so. And we did a lot of research around that to find that is, in part because it is an uncorrelated measure of operational performance, better management teams actually better manage against that. And so that becomes the kind of thing that you can invest against, but it also expands the universe of what investors are thinking about. So when President Biden was starting to run for president, you knew him when he was vice president, you were in the Obama administration. Did you support him, were you working in the campaign for then vice president Biden, or did you work for somebody else? I was a, for most of that time I was busy, I had a job, had a family, I would, anytime anyone called I would offer. Right, but so when did you actually get involved with the Biden people, was it after you come on the election, then you asked you to help with the transition? So I did some work in volunteering to help on the, developing some elements of the platform during 2020 that came together in sort of his, his general election economic policy. A White House staff jobs are notoriously long hour and you have two little children. So how do you manage your time and how come you have no gray hair as a result of working these long hours in two administrations? If the camera gets close enough you'll see some. I, it's a, it's a, it's a, it's a constant challenge and it's, it's, I don't have, I don't have a particular wisdom or insight into how to answer it other than, you know, needing to be extremely efficient with the time that you have higher great staff and build a great team. There's, I've got an extraordinary, any see team and core team inside the White House without which I wouldn't be able to do this and also, but it also takes a, an understanding family because no matter how good you are at prioritization, time management and productivity with your own time, there is always, there was always something that happens and there was something that comes up. Your children are young. So do you go to PTA meetings and people give you economic advice at the PTA meetings so they kind of say, I have an idea for you when I'm fighting inflation, is that ever happen? People are extraordinarily generous with their advice. What would you like to do most in economic policy in the next two years? The first and most important thing that we're gripped by and focused on now is effectively implementing this historic set of legislation that we have accomplished. While Tesla's in the like make for good headlines, the reality is that even if every car on the roads today won electric, it wouldn't be enough to curb global emissions to avoid catastrophic climate change. greenhouse gas emissions from transportation account for about 29% of total U.S. greenhouse gas emissions. So what about the other 71%? Building across America burned fossil fuels to operate. What we want to do is make that all electric. Instead of burning oil and gas to give us the energy and electricity we need, we want to do 100% clean energy, all electric. We want to turn buildings into Tesla's. Just like a Tesla or an electric vehicle is all electric with no fossil fuels. We want to do that with our buildings. If we can do it in one building, we can do it in all buildings. And if we do it in all buildings, we'll reduce 30% of U.S. greenhouse gas emissions.",https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dp8PhLsUcFE,5608,2022-10-22 13:20:52
17203," monopoly on unemployment. Every Friday with 30 minutes dedicated to fixed income, I'm Jonathan Ferro this is with Berg Ruyot. So, recently we had an act they ask called the Inflation Reduction Act. I mean, who came up with that name, really? It's a great name. I guess so, but you really think it's going to reduce inflation. It seemed like it was spending a lot of money and how is inflation going to be reduced by that? See, it's because of the Inflation Reduction Act. So, joking aside, I actually think that it is an appropriate name and it goes to the structure of, if I could say it in a walkie-way, the role of fiscal policy in a period of monetary tightening. What you want to do is you want to take measures that will lower costs for individuals and do it in a way that lowers the federal deficit. Because if you're lowering the federal deficit at the same time that you're lowering costs for individuals, then you're actually operating in the same direction. Now, that's complicated to do from a policy perspective, but that is exactly what the Inflation Reduction Act accomplished. But does it really lower federal debt and federal deficit because I thought it was just lowering it below where it would otherwise have been, but it's not actually producing a net reduction in total debt, is it? So reducing it below where the policy people set of would have otherwise been, right? So, the appropriate way to judge any piece of legislation is is it going to reduce or increase the deficit compared to the baseline at the time. And the Inflation Reduction Act will reduce the deficit compared to the baseline by about $260 billion depending, in the first decade, probably more than a trillion dollars in the second decade. And importantly, it doesn't in ways like, you know, probably the simplest way to understand is the provision that allows Medicare for the first time to negotiate for better prices for prescription drugs. That will mean that Medicare is spending less money on drugs that will lower federal spending. But it will also lower the cost of drugs to Medicare recipients and also to recipients in the private market since Medicare is such a large purchaser. Okay. In the Inflation Reduction Act, a lot of the tax increases that the President had previously proposed to build back better act did not get in there. Those tax increase off the table for the remainder of the Biden term or you're not precluded from. Those are policies the President thought made sense was would have supported if they were in the legislation and continues to support going forward. And I will say even for all the things that weren't in there, one of the reasons to go back to your previous question, why that bill reduces the deficit and actually helps in reducing inflation across time is that what is in there, for example, is a new 15% minimum tax, book minimum tax for the largest corporations, those with over a billion dollars in earnings. I think that that's the kind of reasonable common sense tax reform that makes sense. It does mean that some people will pay more in taxes, but certainly that kind of base broadening reform, there's a lot of important sensibility to it. On the day that the inflation reduction act was signed, record high inflation numbers came out. So did you ever consider maybe adjusting the schedule of the signing ceremony or was it something you said that who told the President that numbers were going to be that high that morning and maybe you should change the signing ceremony? I think that that number and others go to how people are experiencing inflation today, because one of the principal reasons why that headline number was basically flat was because in the month prior gas prices had come down by a very significant amount. And that is really important for typical Americans monthly balance sheets, but it also is important because it's one of the most visible price signals in our economy. Now you're two in years into almost two.",https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dp8PhLsUcFE,5609,2022-10-22 13:25:14
17204," monthly balance sheets, but it also is important because it's one of the most visible price signals in our economy. Now you're two years into almost two years into this administration and you expect to stay for another two years. I think otherwise it's a long two years so you're not worn out and you can see you doing this for another two years at least if not more. I've got no plans to leave and I've got my head down and certainly fully fully absorbed in the work we're doing. So in the next two years let's oppose you control Congress. What is you what you'd like to do most in economic policy in the next two years? What would be your highest goal other than getting inflation down and unemployment keeping at a reasonable level? Is there another type of chips act or some other major piece of legislation that you want to get through? Look I think there's there's a number of priorities that that I would love to see us make more progress on. I'll answer a question but as a decide the first and most important thing that we're gripped by and focused on now is effectively implementing this historic set of legislation that we have accomplished. The implementation of this to your point about chips and otherwise the effective implementation across the board is going to make a difference a big difference in terms of the the broader economic impact but look I think we need to make more progress on tax reform. We made some steps here but it's showing that we can as a country effectively fund our priorities and also build fairness into the tax code is important it's important for trust it's important for strengthening our democratic institutions. We need to make more progress on underscoring that issues that often get referenced as care or the care economy are not social issues they're core economic issues they're core to our labor force they're core to our productivity as a country and there's other issues that are now you know coming to floor like housing and housing costs the fact that we have persistent under supply of affordable housing in this country is a policy choice decades in the making we can do something about that and now is a really important time to do that given the the period in the monetary policy cycle there's a number of places where we can make progress places where there is a lot of actual bipartisan support so I and I would I could I could go through a much longer list if you think time. So what's the greatest pleasure of your job and what's the worst part of your job other than interviewing like this but what's the greatest pleasure and what's the greatest less pleasurable part so you know having gone out out and being in a couple of administrations but far the greatest pleasure is the people you spend so much time with them but also the quality of people that can come you know a White House is it's a in a sense it's a terrible place to work it's very hard and all the like but it's also a place where you know the the you know the reservation price or the wage that you would pay is negative because you know everybody wants to come and and and have an opportunity so you can attract great people diverse people with diverse backgrounds and extraordinary things to bear so you make friendships and and bonds with people and so that's at core the best what's the worst part the best part I think the most challenging part is that your time is never your own that something can owe something you have to be prepared that something always can happen and usually something does happen or have long been thought of as the peak of cool and technology in them is also helping to pull down our produce aisles. Engineers from Williams are using their knowledge from nine constructors championships working with company Aerofoil to help reduce the energy consumption of supermarkets. The device they're building is based on the design of an F1 cars rear wing. It attaches to fridges to keep more cool air in the unit. They estimate it can reduce supermarket energy consumption by 25%. One innovation from F1 is also helping hybrid reduce their carbon footprint.

17205," One innovation from F1 is also helping hybrids reduce their carbon footprint. That's hers or the kinetic energy recovery system. In common parlance, it's known as regenerative braking and works by storing energy of the car decelerating in a battery for later use. If that's not enough, F1 is now looking at hers or a thermal energy recovery system looking to harness the heat produced from braking and the engine exhaust. That could allow cars to generate the same power using 30% less fuel. So while F1 may have a reputation as a gas-duzzler, some of its innovations in the name of speed are helping in the everyday fight against climate change.

Write their rise, their success and what the future holds. It's one of the biggest sports on the planet. Formula One. There's an estimated global audience of 70 million people for every race and home to some of the most famous rivalries ever. So 2005, the biggest disruptors in this sport have been Red Bull. An amazing five drivers championships and four constructors championships testify to that. The man behind this success is the team principal Christian Horne. An achievement made even more impressive as Christian was the youngest ever F1 team boss when he joined this sport at the age of 31. Bloomberg's Tom McKenzie went to speak to him for a brand new series. Bloomberg Power Players. Christian Horne, thank you very much for your time. Pleasure. When you think about your career trajectory, principal of course of Red Bull Formula One but also now a Netflix star in your own right, how do you think about that career trajectory and how you ended up where you are now? I was completely by accident. I started my career as a aspiring young driver. I drove for several years and then finance was always a limiting factor. So the sponsorship that I had, I decided to go and buy my own car and start my own team in what is now Formula Two. I didn't recognise that my talent was not enough to propel me to my aspirations of Formula One. I then focused on working in the sport that I'd...",https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dp8PhLsUcFE,5611,2022-10-22 13:33:40
17206," My talent was not enough to propel me to my aspirations of Formula One. So I then focused on working in the sport that I'd fallen in love with. And having won that championship as a team principal and team owner, in Formula 2 for three years in succession, it's been quite a journey during the past 17 seasons. Indeed. And just going back to 1998, you were 25 years old, you'd make that decision. Thinking back on it now as a young driver, you'd have success in your early 20s. How challenging was that decision to say, I'm going to step away now and pursue a different angle within this industry? I think it was just a question of being honest with myself that I was racing against talented drivers like Juan Pablo Montoya or Nick Hydefeld, drivers that went on to race in Formula One. I could see that I just wasn't quite at their level. So I think sometimes you've got to be honest with yourself. But I love the sport. I love working within a team. And I wanted to apply what I'd learned from a driver to apply that and how to run a team. Do you miss driving racing? That sensation, that feeling? No, not at all. I mean, it seems such a lifetime ago now. But it was a great experience. It gave me a great insight. Occasionally, I'll get behind the wheel in an old time or a good wood. But that's about my limit these days. Will you touch on this, the experience, the skill set that you develop as a driver and the overlap then to being a team principal? What are the skills that you're able to bring with you? Well, I think as a driver, it's a very lonely environment. You're sat in the car, you're looking at them. What you want to feel is that the team, up behind you, that they are one with your aspirations. And I think that that was one of the key lessons that I taught from being a driver of running a team or how I would have liked to drive for a team. And having that interaction with the driver and creating an environment that brings the best out of them. How do you describe your leadership style? Let's say it's inclusive. I'm not a specialist. I'm not an engineering. I don't have management qualifications, but I do very much believe in empowering your staff and making sure that you've got the right people around you. And they're not telling them how to do their job, setting the goal, setting the vision, ensuring that everybody's focusing on the right targets and aspirations. In whatever workplace, they're always tensions. But they're pretty unique when it comes to Formula One between the drivers, the engineers, what's the commercial side as well. How do you manage and navigate those tensions and what lessons have you learned along the way? I think experience is always a big factor. And I think people are different. And whether that be drivers, whether that be engineers, whether it be technicians or marketers, you have such an array of personalities and characters. But if your main focal point is the performance of that car, that is the one thing that everybody is aligned on and that they are working together to help support and all play a key and vital role in. How do you think about the managing the big personalities of the drivers, particularly given your background, your experience? I think it's just a matter of being honest with them. And I think having an open and honest relationship where you can communicate, that's a vital element. And we've watched it. We've seen it. But we haven't felt it being trackside, being plugged in, watching the drivers, the lights go red, then they go off foot to the pedal. What does it feel like? What is that visceral sensation? It's a huge adrenaline rush. I mean, Formula One is an energized business and these cars are incredible pieces of machinery and engineering, you know, excellence. So when you win a race, it's the culmination of everything coming together. It's a culmination of all the departments having done their bit to ensure that the car is delivering, you know, at its optimum. And of course, we have some incredible opponents, you know, some, you know, manufactured teams, iconic teams that we're racing against. And that just heightens, you know, that intensity of the competition. Constant calculation. An incredible amount of stress. What are your methods for coping with that stress? For having that clarity of mind to make split second decisions? I think experience counts for a great deal. But of course, you try and apply your knowledge to the areas that you can influence instead of worrying about.",https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dp8PhLsUcFE,5612,2022-10-22 13:38:11
17207," a guarantee of mind to make split second decisions. I think experience counts for a great deal, but of course you try and apply your knowledge to the areas that you can influence, instead of worrying about everything. And I think to be physically fit as well, it helps you to stay mentally fit. So I endeavoured to try and put a few runs in every week to ensure that just mentally I'm sharp. It's always an early night, the night before a race. Again, because you want to give your best, you don't want to let anybody down. This will not be news to you, but of course there are rivalries within the teams of Formula One between personalities, between team leaders, between drivers. How do you think about those rivalries? Do you see them as healthy? Do you see them as a catalyst? How do you manage them? Well, they have to be ultimately healthy, because an unhealthy rivalry is a destructive situation and that can't continue within any team. An element of rivalry can be a positive thing and you want competition. We want people to compete to be on the race team. When they see that team sheet go up before a weekend who's on the pit crew, you want there to be a sense of pride in that, that to be representing your team fills you with pride. And that's the same as it's a driver, a technician, an engineer that you generate that culture of pride in your work. And your rivalry with Total Wolf is now famous. You thrive on it, don't you? Formula One is a competition and it's a competitive business and people deal with competition and pressure in different ways. And so of course Mercedes has been a dominant team the last eight years and last year was the first time that a team has managed to beat them with Max for staffing. Take them all the way to the final race and you saw emotions run high, you saw that pressure, how it permeates, how people sometimes deal with pressure. I want to just look back to the rival question and what you learned from the rivalry between Weber and Vettel and how that informed the way that you deal with drivers now. I think the Weber Vettel rivalry was extremely intense and you had one driver that was near in the end of his career and other driver that was obviously at the pinnacle of his career and indeed in the ascendancy at the time. So it was a dynamic that spilled over into the team and that it was unhealthy, it was divisive. And I think the lessons that we learned from that was to not allow a situation to develop like that to create any division within the company within the team. Who'd you prefer to have a beer with Hamilton or Verstappen? Verstappen. I don't think Louis String's beer. Coming up, Omblinboan's power players. Christian Horner talks about the huge changes to the finances of Formula One and documentaries like the Netflix series have had such a enormous impact. Welcome back to Blinboan Power Players. Formula One is trying to widen its global appeal. India and Saudi Arabia.",https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dp8PhLsUcFE,5613,2022-10-22 13:42:26
17208," Welcome back to Bloomberg Power Players. Formula One is trying to widen its global appeal. India and Saudi Arabia and Miami all added as new venues. Qatar and Las Vegas are set to become permanent race hosts going into 2023. Now also, this changes ahead. Porsche and Audi, they will join the sport. We caught up with Christian Horner and we asked him, what is the future of Formula One hold? What's your take on the change? The dramatic change that we've seen within the sport after the ownership of Liberty stepped in. The cultural change, the change, the economics of the business. Has it all been for the better? I think the sport has changed its evolved immensely. I mean Bernie Eccleston did a wonderful job in in creating the brand that is Formula One and the exclusiveness of Formula One. Liberty have just taken that ball and run with it. And they've brought in new initiatives. They've opened up the whole digital media and social media side of the world, which is where we were negligent previously. And I think that that has brought a whole new fan base together with initiatives and flowering the wall documentaries like the Netflix series. They've had such a enormous impact that we're starting to break markets where previously we've been very poor. So the United States is currently flying with Formula One with its new found popularity. And of course, out of that comes commercial revenues by attracting new partners and commercial partners into the sport. So it's a win-win scenario. Is there more that can be done on that front to grow the fan base? Absolutely. I think we're just scratching at the service and what we're seeing is more and more youngsters coming to sport, more and more young girls coming into following Formula One. And I think that's a really encouraging thing. And I think that once they come to look at it, the most important thing is to keep them engaged. So the racing's got to be good. The product has to be good. It has to stand up for itself. It has to be inclusive. It has to tick all of those boxes. And you talked about that expansion, the US, Miami, success, of course, for you, the team, but also for the sport. What is the impact of that push into the US? Well, it's considerable. I mean, we've got several US-based partners now. We've got a title partner in Oracle joining us this year. We have companies like AT&T. We announce hard rock, you know, American entities, you know, ExxonMobil, for example. You know, it's great to see so many American companies coming and getting involved in the sport in Formula One. There's a lot of demand, obviously, for the eyeballs of Americans. They love their sports. What are the biggest challenges, though, to building out the sport in that market? Well, I think it's about keeping them engaged. I think ultimately we also need a home hero. We need an American driver. That it's not just there for the sake of it, but there is there competing at the front for world championships and race victories. What for you would be the other priority parts of the world? The sport should focus on to build out its success. Well, I think it needs to have balance around the world. So it doesn't need to be too US-centric. It's important that we have a strong presence in Asia, obviously, retaining its historical presence in Europe. You know, South America. Is there a country that stands out to you where you think, happy, fantastic, to have an F1 there? I think there's so much demand. I mean, South Africa now wants to have a race, which will be great to racing on that continent. I think China's an important market for us once that reopens. So I think there's many markets that are pushing to have the presence of Formula One in their territory. We've got a little snapshot here of the innovation cycles that we're seeing within F1, within your team. Where are we within that innovation cycle? How much more can Adrian, Uri, and the team innovate around this car? A huge amount. I mean, the regulations introduced for this year are the biggest regulation changes in the last 40 years. So they're still very mature. And so the development rate is fast. It's furious. But of course, constrained as well by a budget cap this year, which means we have to be efficient in the way that we develop the cars, because we're heavily constrained on the financial side. So it'll be fascinating to see how that development race pans out during the course of this year. So the budget cap does constrain innovation to some extent.",https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dp8PhLsUcFE,5614,2022-10-22 13:46:51
17209," So it'll be fascinating to see how that development race pans out during the course of this year. So the budget camp does constrain innovation to some extent? Yeah, absolutely. I mean, we're limited to $140 million to design, develop and operate these cars, which, while seeming a lot of money, is significantly less than the teams were operating on say two years ago. So it means, you know, return on investment is crucial, that you want to be sure that when you're spending a development dollar, that you're getting a significant return. Do the budget caps, do you think, do they ultimately going to compel the teams, force the teams that aren't already to become profitable businesses? I think ultimately it will, because I think with revenues increasing, with the cap containing cost, ultimately the franchise value of these teams is going to increase significantly, and I think you can already see that. The all teams, probably the first time in a long time, are in great health. You know, there's great stability amongst the 10 entrants, and now there's an awful lot of interest to come into the sport from new entrants, from manufacturers, and that only drives up the value of those teams and franchises. I think it's great to see, you know, the interest that we're currently experiencing in Formula One, I think manufacturers like Porsche and like Audi, you know, showing real keen interest to get involved in the sport is a reflection of where the sport currently is. I think that's fantastic. You talked to the about this at the top, it's interesting, how you make this sport more inclusive, not just here at Red Bull, but more broadly the sport, and lower the barriers to entry for drivers for engineers. How do you think about that? I think that's about getting involved at the grassroots level, whether that's with drivers, is engaging with them from a very early age, from 11, 12-year-olds that are racing in go-carts. From engineers, it's getting involved with the universities that we're actively with, and then of course apprenticeships and placements, working with local colleges, and so on, to lower the barrier to entry, to make it more inclusive, to make it more diverse. That Formula One shouldn't be seen as just an elitist sport, we want to attract, you know, a larger and broader talent pool coming into the sport, and as we invest in our drivers, that's what we will do and continue to do with the engineering staff to ensure we've got as broad a catchment as we possibly can help. You've got more female fanbase, it's growing, it's expanding, women love the sport increasingly. What about a female driver? Is that on the cards, and the next 10 years is that possible? I think it certainly is a possibility, I think that with more girls getting interested in Formula One, hopefully getting involved in carting at the grassroots of the sport, we'll see more talent coming through the systems. Of course there are categories like Formula W that are there to assist girls in motorsport, and I think it's only a matter of time before we see a girl that's capable of racing at the highest level and going, you know, turtato with the boys. Coming up, Christian Horner, on the pressure of inflation on the teams like Red Bull, and is Formula One going green quickly enough. Watch Bloomberg surveillance early edition for the news you need when you need it. A lot of little cately lines in New York and Ann Edwards in London. In the United States, the United States is going to be a very serious central bank, raises interest rates twice as much as four cars. Then surveillance for in-depth analysis. A lot of sides on keen, and Lisa Brownbottes, I'm Jonathan Ferro, the RPA, at a time when everybody else is facing a very different surveillance.",https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dp8PhLsUcFE,5615,2022-10-22 13:51:03
17210," Raising red. It's normal at a time when everybody else is facing a very different way. Bloomberg surveillance. Be informed. Be prepared. Be ahead of the game. Innovation, money, and power collide in Silicon Valley and beyond. Bloomberg Technology with Emily Chan. Weekdays at 5 p.m. in New York and 2 p.m. in San Francisco. Welcome back to Bloomberg Power Players. Formula One has tried to adapt to changing times with improved safety regulations, credited with saving many serious injuries. But it is also under pressure to make changes in a very different way as it faces questions over its green credentials. And that is something that Tom McKenzie put to Christian Horner. Do you see as we focus on our electrification across obviously the auto sector more generally that there's going to be a push now for F1 to electrify into and beyond the E series that they're going to see an end to the combustion engine when it comes to Formula One ultimately? I don't think that will be for a while to come. I think we're going to increase the electrification for 2026. So we'll go to a ratio of much closer to 50 percent combustion power, 50 percent electrical power. We're going to go to 100 percent sustainable fuels, which again is an interesting area. And that could be a key development area for Formula One. Could it involve fuel such as liquid hydrogen, which could be a very, very interesting technology. Formula One can be a proving ground for these technological advancements and it doesn't necessarily need to be fully electric. And the sport, of course, not just on the track, but more broadly around all of the logistics has a big footprint when it comes to emissions. Is there more that you would advocate that the industry that the business can do to reduce those emissions? I think that's where collectively we need to do more. I think that the cars, actually, we're very bad at telling the story of the cars, actually emission-wise a car during the course of a season will have less emissions than a cow. But it's of course the carbon footprint created by the air freight, the sea freight of moving the parts of people around the world. I think that's where we need to work closely with Formula One to find ways of reducing our carbon footprint. You've touched on the logistical feat that is F1. We've rolled into that supply chains and the constraints we've seen, whether it's semiconductors or other input parts within the business. How has it impacted you? It is having an impact because, obviously, supply is a key issue and I think with other issues going on in the world at the moment we're seeing inflation, we rates exponentially go through the roof. I think particularly in areas like freight, their materials, we not only have Brexit to deal with, we then had COVID followed by the Ukraine crisis. What have you been able to do to mitigate some of those supply chain constraints and the impact on the business? We've had to be creative, we've had to be forward-ordering as well, we've had to take on more in-house manufacturing, but of course there's certain components that you simply can't. Wages is another factor, talent, the attraction for talent, the battle for talent. How intense is that battle for talent now? Especially in the UK where we are based here, the seven-grown pre-teams within a 50-mile radius, so the competition for talent is aggressive and therefore it's not just about how much you pay, it's about the environment, it's about the culture, it's about how you look after your employees. I think at Red Bull we've been very, very good at looking after our employees about creating opportunities and career progression. As you look ahead, the future for Red Bull five years, ten years down the line, what does it look like? Particularly exciting part of our development at the moment, this is our 18th season in Formula One and I think with the advent of the pow-train side of the business coming online for 2026 as we gear up for that to produce our own engines, other than Ferrari with the only-grown pre-team in Formula One that has engine and chassis on one site, on one campus and that's tremendously exciting and of course then how we can utilise the skillset that we have.",https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dp8PhLsUcFE,5616,2022-10-22 13:55:25
17211," pre-team in Formula One that has engine and chassis on one site, on one campus. And that's tremendously exciting. And of course, then how we can utilize the skill set that we have in other applications like America's Cup, whether we design our own hypercar, it's a project that is potentially on the cards for the future. And so many, many exciting projects that complement Formula One activities. What about the future for Christian Horner? What are your longer term ambitions? I think winning becomes addictive. It almost becomes like a drug. And I think that once you've experienced it, you don't want to let that go. And we have four very competitive years from 2010 to 2013. And having got back into a situation of winning with Max last year, the whole team is totally motivated to defend that title this year and hopefully add to it. And I think I need no motivating for what the future holds. I'm just eye-watering the excitement that we have for the future with the engine side of the business, with the way that the sport is developing, the new markets that we're approaching, the partners that we're bringing into the sport, the young talent that we're developing, the drivers that we have and the youth as well. So it's a tremendously exciting period of our story. If you could change one thing about the sport, click of your fingers. What would it be? I think I'd reduce the amount of regulations that we have to comply with or make the regulations simpler. I think the regulations are over complicated that therefore consume time, resource and effort. So I think I would simplify some of the regulations that we have in both the sporting and technical side of the business. And what do you see as the biggest challenge for the sport this year and beyond? I think Formula One is enjoying an incredible moment where it's in the spotlight and it's how it's, and last year was an epic season. It was the best season in probably 60 years, Formula One racing for it to get all the way down to the last race as it did. And I think for it to maintain that element of excitement is probably its biggest challenge so that there is no one dominant team that we're in the first five races this year been fantastic. And that's what you want to see at every race of the 23 races in a goal preseason. That's all for this episode of Blumberg Power Players. We'll be back with another influential figure from the world of sport next time. So what's the best investment advice you've ever been given by anybody? The compound interest, the compounding of returns is an incredible miracle of business, finance and human existence. Everything you learn is additive every day and if you keep added and don't quit, it's an incredible miracle. And it's not just interest. It was always said above compound interest returns, compound business returns, compound human returns. They're all very additive because you'll learn every day and if you keep at it, it's very, very helpful. And you're absolutely right.",https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dp8PhLsUcFE,5617,2022-10-22 13:59:51
17212," It's very, very helpful. In your observation of investors, what do you think is the biggest mistake that average investors make? Selling it the wrong time. And they sell when the prices go down? Yes, or yes. Not keeping, but people have conviction or they invest for the, if they invest for the right reasons, just keep at it.

This is Bloomberg Wall Street Week. I'm David Weston. This week, Special contributor Larry Summers on having to make hard choices to get inflation down. If your deficit projection starts to get out of control and your real interest rates start to rise, you can get into a kind of doom loop. And Deborah Lair of the Pulse Institute on whether President Xi's ideology can get China's economy growing again. Xi's facing a lot of headwinds when it comes to the economy. It was a tough time on global Wall Street, but nowhere was it tougher than at number 10 Downing Street, where Liz Truss is on her way to becoming the shortest serving Prime Minister in British history. Forced to resign after concluding, she just couldn't get done what she'd set out to do. I cannot deliver the mandate on which I was elected by the Conservative Party. I have therefore spoken to his majesty, the King, to notify him that I am resigning as leader of the Conservative Party. It wasn't easy for President Biden, either, as he continued to fight high gas prices for which he largely blamed the oil companies and counted with yet another release from the strategic petroleum reserve. The Department of Energy will release another 15 million barrels from the strategic petroleum reserve, extending our previously announced release through the month of December. The market spent the week looking for some form of rescue from earnings, and they did get a bit of it from companies like Netflix with Reed Hastings giving thanks. Well, thank God we're done with shrinking quarters. So that's a big feeling of we're back to the positivity. But Tesla didn't help much by disappointing on sales, though Elon Musk predicted it would make it up in the fourth quarter. As our factors round, we're looking forward to a recovering Q4. So it's really not going to work. It looks like we'll have an epic end of year.

And it was all pretty much driven by anticipation of where the Fed is heading, as the yield in the 10-year climb for much of the week, but after peaking over 4.33 percent mid-day on Friday, it fell to 4.2 percent to end the week. While the two-year, well the two-year fell 13 basis points on Friday alone after speculation grew that the S&P might just slow its rate hikes after November.

So you know, David, I think that we're going to continue just, it was a crazy week, but it's been several crazy weeks. I think until the market gets a sense of where the Fed is going to go and stop, we're going to keep getting these wild bouts of volatility. We've been expecting it for a while. In a sense, you know, there was not that much of news in the Fed saying that they're close to being done. Well, of course they are. We already know that we're going to get up to five, maybe five point two five, maybe a bit more, but quite early in the New Year, it's pretty clear that they will be getting close to an end. We get a 75, maybe we get another 50, after which do we get another 50 and another 25? I think the more interesting thing is what happens after that? Once the market feels that they know that the Fed is not going to pivot on a dime, I think we might get to a point where we stop seeing these wild back and forth, because these are truly massive moves in the Treasury market. And I would just note that every single data point is going to carry with it this level of gravity in terms of moves that we see until we get to the stage that the market buys what the Fed is selling. And that is they're going to raise and then they're going to keep it high for a while. And you're in where are we headed? Where is the Fed headed? Because I look at Bloomberg right now, the Fed futures rate looks like it's about 5.05. At one point this week was up close to 5.2 in terms of a terminal rate. Yeah. When you look at the sofa curve, it peaks at around 5% and you look at the implied terminal rate, it's around the same. You know, the markets have been in a relentless mode of price discovery this year, right? And the glass has been half empty for the last nine months where every time we think maybe the markets are bottoming and the Fed's going to be close to being done, that moving target starts to move again in the wrong direction. But I do think we're getting to a more glass half full mode. And I think that's what the stock market is starting to signal here that at this point the expectations for the Fed are so bad in meaning they're going to go so far that the possibility of a surprise may start to go more in our favor. So maybe the Fed doesn't have to go all the way to 5. Maybe only needs to go to 4.5. Financial conditions have tightened significantly. So maybe the Fed is closer to being done than we think. But as Sunal mentioned, that's only half the equation, right? Like even if we know with clarity where the Fed's going to go and when, whether it's 4.5 or 5.5, we don't know what the path will look like after that in terms of reverting back to a neutral policy. And we don't even really know what neutral is. Is it 3% is it 3.5? But I think the Fed is pretty committed to getting inflation back towards its target of, let's say, 2.2.5%. And we're a long ways from that. And so I think the risk is not so much that the Fed overshoots or undershoots in the near term, but that it's going to take longer to get back to a neutral policy.",https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dp8PhLsUcFE,5619,2022-10-22 14:08:31
17214," long ways from that. And so I think the risk is not so much that the Fed overshoots or undershoots in the near term, but that it's going to take longer to get back to a neutral policy after it gets to that terminal point. So, Yoreen, you know, we were talking about this earlier today and I, when I listen to what you're saying, I can't help but feel that for most in the market, there is this desperate desire to believe that we have the Fed that we've had for the last 17 years and we can't because the environment is so different than it has been. Well, maybe not last 17 because the last year, year and a half has certainly been this new world we're living in. But don't you think that a part of the volatility is markets which have become used to dramatic V-shaped recoveries and asset prices so you miss the trade so people keep jumping in suddenly realize it's not going to happen yet come out and so you see these bouts of extreme volatility largely because markets been trained to expect that the Fed is going to step in when it gets too shaky. Yeah, now I agree and you know since the financial crisis, the Fed has been able to not so much put the inflation mandate on the back burner because I don't think it ever is but it was able to spend most of its time, you know, dealing with the full employment mandate and then when financial conditions were tightening, they could, you know, exercise the Fed put as we call it of course and ease conditions and get the economy going and inflation was never a clear and present danger and of course now it is and ironically now the Fed is in the position where it needs to not only maybe tolerate a higher unemployment rate but even have that at its goal in order to compensate for the overstimulation that clearly was happening a year or two ago in the economy with that combination of fiscal and monetary policy. So that Fed put is either gone or out the money and that does create a different response function in the markets and so and again, you know, to the point I made earlier knowing with clarity which we don't know anyway, where the Fed is going to go and whether it is going to overshoot because it waited too long to start tightening policy in the first place so now instead of doing too little too late, it is doing perhaps too much too late but even then we don't know how quickly the Fed will be able to go to a neutral policy and I do think that that factors into valuation, you know, because as you know short rates, the Fed's terminal rate, real rates are important drivers not only of course of the bond market but of equity valuations as well per the discounted cash flow and calculating that present value of future cash flows does depend on where rates go and how far they go up and how quickly they go back down is going to be an important factor. So now let me jump in here with a question to you. Is the Fed put ever truly gone because we thought maybe a BOE put was gone over the UK but when the things got really rocking in the gilt market it had to come back in. What about what happened in the UK and what does it tell us potentially here as well about the fragilio markets and maybe the need for a central bank to step back in to give support? So you know, I think that the UK I'm not going to say the UK historically we always use that phrase right, canary and a coal mine. However I think in this particular case the UK what happened there is emblematic of what can go wrong. The immediate cause certainly was the mini budget which was quite disastrous the combination of spending and tax cuts it clearly was it was the wrong time for a budget like that but we tend to forget it was 17 years again in the making. We've had a very extended period of extremely loose monetary policy and that forced the UK where you have a higher proportion of defined benefit pension plans. The UK is in a different position let's put it that way which is not to say that the US and other countries should not look at the UK and worry about the unknowns. We don't know where markets will break and the reality.",https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dp8PhLsUcFE,5620,2022-10-22 14:12:49
17215," US and other countries should not look at the UK and worry about the unknowns. We don't know where markets will break. And the reality is, we are in a position where there is some possibility that something breaks. Will the Fed put, has it gone away? I think the Fed might be left in this completely internally, in coherent position that the Bank of England is in, where it's simultaneously buying gilts, but will continue to raise rates. You're in it, we're talking about it. Well, in sense. Sorry, go ahead. Yeah, and exactly, the Fed put, maybe gone for the stock market, but I think it will be coming back for the bond market. And, you know, actions have consequences, right? And policy actions have consequences. And we only have to look to the Bank of Japan to see an example where, you know, they have, you know, the Bank of Japan owns half of the JGB market and has completely tamed the bond market. You know, the annualized volatility of long JGB is three. In the US, the long treasuries have an annualized vol of about, I think, 12 or 13. And so if you're going to make, you know, fiscal decisions that have wide ranging impact, you know, and you're a central bank that has really dominated, you know, the bond market, as of course, the Fed has, as the Bank of England has, as the Bank of Japan has. You know, you can't really leave that market. So I think that's how the Fed put is going to reappear, but just in a different market. So now, one more here, maybe the Bank of Japan has tamed the bond market. It sure hasn't tamed the FX market. And then on Friday, we got that news at a Niki, at least, that they are now intervening to support that yen, which we can so much. We've got the B.O.J. next week. Tell us about that. What does that mean? Is the yen broken? So, you know, what we're seeing is something we haven't seen in a very long period of time. We have the EU, Japan and the US, all with dramatically different monetary policies. You know, so I think about this. And when times were good to, you know, it's called Tolstoy, all good markets, functioning markets look the same. And all of these markets, as they're breaking, they're breaking in different ways. And I think that is, that could just, it could, it's never been more apparent than what you see in Japan. The reality is the yen is moving in line with interest rate differentials with the US. You look at US 10-year yields and you look at where Japan's yen is. And I continue to move. Can the bank of Japan actually be, actually, can they control the yen? I have my doubts. You know, they might take some of the air out of it, but ultimately this is a global system, which is very interlinked. And the interest rate differential is simply too extreme right now, to simply intervene, to fix it. And the other issue, of course, is Japan does not have the US's inflation issue. And speaking to the side of the bond market that is held, the US, depending on what bonds you're looking at, the fair loans between 25 and 33 percent of the bond market, right? So it's huge, it's a huge impact. So now the side, and you're in Timber, are going to be staying with us as we turn to what investors should be doing in these uncertain times. That's going to be next on Wall Street Week on Bloomberg. Okay, so you're moving in on me. Quick. That's just saptight. Yeah, that's a cool move. The árinds are a lot stronger than you've ever seen elsewhere.",https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dp8PhLsUcFE,5621,2022-10-22 14:17:23
17216," Good night, because it's really bothering me. Ah, my night. Yeah, he's a troublemaker. Yeah. What did you get up to this weekend? You know, just robot stuff. A lot of chess. I was practicing for, uh, for you. I know you're pretty good. Ooh, I don't like that. I will take this. Uh, put it over here here. Not cool. Not cool. All right, I will, I will concede. I can see. Ah. Got me, Bid. Very good game. Well played. Thank you, sir. Thank you. Everything you need to get set for the start of U.S. trading, Bloomberg, the Open with Jonathan Perl. Billing down in the numbers and preparing you as only Bloomberg can weekdays on Bloomberg. Does Governor Reagan now concede that it would be inflationary if we just cut federal taxes and didn't cut federal spending? I don't know whether he does or doesn't, but that's not his program. His program is in fact to cut taxes significantly, 10 percent a year over the next three years each year, but also to restrain the growth in federal spending. That of course is Lewis Rukhizer talking with a pre-chairman, Alan Greenspan on Wall Street week back on October 24, 1980, back when Alan was simply part of Townsend Greenspan and company. He was just before Governor Reagan was elected president and the concern back then was about tax cuts without spending cuts, something that frankly we're still talking about today. The top movie back then was Goldie Hawn's private Benjamin and Woman in Love. Do you remember it? By Barbara Streisand, top of the billboard, Hot 100, chart for the week. Still with us, Arsenao Desai of Franklin Templeton and you're in Timber of Fidelity Management. So, you're going to start with you. What's an investor to do in this environment? Where we do have inflation that seems to be broad, maybe entrenched. We have a Fed that's on the move. What does an investor do? What's overpriced? What's underpriced? Well, you know, the good news is in a period where there isn't very much of it is that both the 40 and the 60 side of the 60-40 paradigm, I think are now, you know, really attractively valued. I mean, you can get a 10-year yield at a 10-year note at 4.2, a two-year note at 4.5. You can buy the S&P 500 at around 15, 16 times forward earnings. Now, that PE is only as good as the forward earnings. So we will find out whether the earnings hold so far they have. So valuations have had a tremendous reset from the overvaluation days, you know, following the COVID lockdown when the Fed basically repressed interest rates down to much lower levels than they really deserve to be. And that raised asset price inflation in the stock market because, again, interest rates are an important factor in valuation. And so it's been a very painful nine months during which neither the 40 nor the 60 has worked. That's a very unusual environment to be in. But I think, you know, the good news is that if the Fed does overshoot, I think the 40 will really present a lot of value at 4% plus yields. And maybe the 40 will start becoming negatively correlated again to the 60. And if our recession is averted, then the 60, I think, will do well because earnings then will likely hold up. And valuations are now much more reasonable. So for me, the glass half full, you know, view here is that at least one of those two engines is going to start working. I can't tell you which one it is, unfortunately. But I do think it's not going to be any longer this monolithic market where basically nothing works. So now, when will the bond market be the engine that starts working? Are bonds getting cheap enough now that it's time to go back in? They're beginning to look interesting. Let's put it this way because if I look at investment grade bonds, I look at short paper, and it will become more stable here.",https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dp8PhLsUcFE,5622,2022-10-22 14:21:38
17217," Time to go back in. They're beginning to look interesting. Let's put it this way. Because if I look at investment-grade bonds, I look at short paper, you know, we just discussed, her interest, discussed that we were talking about 4.4, 4.5. I think we're getting to interesting levels. We're seeing something, finally, that we haven't seen for, again, close to 17 years, fixed income, delivering income, what a concept. I think income becomes more and more important as we look forward. I do think that 10-year yields are likely to still go up. But having said that, it does start becoming attractive. So over the coming weeks and, sorry, coming weeks and months, I think the first step would be areas like investment-grade because you're getting paid healthily to hold good credit. And our baseline is not to have a steep recession. We'll have a recession, but I think we might be able to avoid a steep one, which means that fundamentals can still look good. And furthermore, if I look in areas like high yield and emerging market, we are now getting paid between 8% and 10% in these areas, which means that, finally, liquid fixed income starts becoming a very decent alternative to alternatives, which up till now have really been the only area in the last multiple years that could deliver those style of return. So I actually, I'm also gloss-outful at this point for the first time in quite a while. You're in just coming back to you and just kind of cash flow away of looking at stock valuations. As I understand it, in fact, you've taught me. In fact, the Fed has been buying bonds, but they've also been buying tips. Is that skewing that as a measurement? It's interesting you mentioned that because I'm trying to figure that out, actually, in my latest research, because the Fed owns 33% of the Bloomberg Tips Index. So that may not be all of all tips. So the overall number will be less than that. And so it makes you wonder whether there's any price signal left. But when I compare, for instance, the tips break even to the inflation swap market, which is a direct swap, I don't really see a tremendous amount of price distortion from the Fed owning so many tips. And of course, the Fed owns a bunch of nominals as well. So maybe one cancels out the other. So I think the jury is still out. But clearly, the tips market is saying a different message than the headline inflation numbers are, because the tips break evens are around two and a half across the curve. And that's totally different from an 8% CPI. It's a great discussion. I really owe it to both of you. Thank you so much. That's Sonal Desai of Franklin Templeton. And you're in Timmer of Fidelity Management. Coming up, we take a look at next week on Wall Street Week on Bloomberg. Interesting. Okay. We're taking a more talk than the sales department.",https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dp8PhLsUcFE,5623,2022-10-22 14:26:21
17218," Lord,旗! This is Wall Street Week. I'm David Weston. It's time to look ahead at next week on Global Wall Street, starting with Juliet Sally in Singapore. Thanks David. China has closely watched party congress wraps this weekend and investors will be awaiting the likely release of GDP and activity data that were delayed during the meetings. When the reports finally land, Bloomberg economics expects them to show an anemic third quarter recovery. Elsewhere, the Bank of Japan will likely stand pat on its ultra low interest rate and asset purchases, despite a plunge in the yen that's driving up import costs. And in Australia, the central bank's preferred measure of core inflation is likely to hit 31 year high. The focus will be the upgraded strategic plan. We are expecting the ECB to hike by 75 basis points. We can see some shifts there as well. More than 160 members in the S&P 500 are scheduled to report earnings next week. That includes big tech companies Apple, Microsoft, Alphabet, Meta and Amazon. There will also be earnings from UPS, Chipotle, General Motors, Kraft Hines and McDonald's. Economic data include the US government's first estimate of third quarter GDP. Crost domestic product did contract in both the first and second quarters of the year, but is projected by economists to have reversed that trend, rising by more than 2%. The week rounds out with Friday's release of the personal consumption expenditures data, which the Fed uses for its inflation target. That data expected to show a continued re-exceleration in consumer prices. David? Thanks to Julius Sally, Guy Johnson and Romain Bostic. Coming up, what ails the Chinese economy and does President-G have what's needed to fix it? We're going to talk with Deborah Lair of Edelman Global Advisory. This next on Wall Street Week on Bloomberg. We have reached a top 10 First realmente competitive,"" Teah Banda was asked. This is Bloomberg Daybreak with Lake. Welcome to Daybreak Australia. This is Bloomberg Technology. Welcome to Daybreak Australia.",https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dp8PhLsUcFE,5624,2022-10-22 14:30:20
17219," This is Bloomberg Daybreak, but let's do it. Welcome to Daybreak Australia. This is Bloomberg Technology. Welcome to Bloomberg crypto. Imagine simply climbing a cable into space. The concept is known as the space elevator. Not only could it significantly change how we leave planet Earth, but it could also completely transform humanity's relationship with space. And there are scientists who think and could have already built it. We have the material. We have the technology. We have the lasers. We have the climbers. We have all of them. If a private entity wants to build it or a government, they can build it. It'll change society. We have no clue how colonizing in the space, how really spreading on the space will really change our society over the next 50 to 200 years. It'll be completely different. The DNA of Mexico and Juan Mario interactions and billions of times. And look. Look. Like it didn't stop anything. If you can't spread it, the product will develop a problem. There are only a few home events planned. So you can run 16,000 downtems down. 10 years of remarkable growth. That's what President Xi Jinping of China focused on in his speech to the party Congress last Saturday. He wrote about a historical rise in China's economic strength. In the past decade, China's GDP has grown from the 55 trillion to 114 trillion and come to account for 18.5% of the world economy. Not a bad track record during Xi's time in office, but if President Xi had been willing to go back to before he was president, the story is even more dramatic. Since Deng Xiaoping initiated the Open Door Policy in 1978, China's economy has gone from under $150 billion to nearly $18 trillion last year. Now that growth is slowing down, with possible repercussions for the rest of the world, according to the head of the WTO. If China's economy continues to slow, the way we are seeing that will have a big impact on what happens to the world economy. And US officials like Deputy Treasury Secretary Wali Adyemo say that the Open Door isn't as open as it used to be. In addition to having resilient supply chains, we want to make sure that American companies are competing on a level playing field with companies in China and around the world. And that's why we've taken actions like restraining the ability to ship some key components. But Bridgewater's Ray Dalio, who's been back and forth to China over the last 30 years, insists that despite all the problems, he wouldn't bet against Beijing over the long term. I think the longer term picture in China is still bright because I know the people and I know the culture and I think it's good, but they have major issues now. And when it comes to China, the person we turn to here at Wall Street Week is Debra Lair. She is the CEO of Edelman Global Advisory and Executive Director of the Paulson Institute. Debra, welcome back. Good to have you. We are all focused on President Xi and what's going on over in Beijing this week. Give us your sense about what we're learning. It strikes me that one of the biggest challenges he has is the economy and growing the economy. And yet I'm not sure we're hearing much about his economic policy. I hear a lot about politics, a lot about security. That's right. Xi Jinping gave his all-important work report at the beginning of the plenum. And it gave a few previews of how he's going to start to look at the economy. One of the things that he's emphasizing is common prosperity, his slogan about how he brings greater equality. One of the things that he's looking at is also how the party can continue to play an important role in the economy. And also he did give reassurance to foreign companies that they will continue to push for market opening in key areas. So will we get a sense from the personnel that surround him of where it might be headed? Because as I understand it, eventually we will see him come out from behind.",https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dp8PhLsUcFE,5625,2022-10-22 14:34:39
17220," Yes. So, will we get a sense from the personnel that surround him of where it might be headed? Because as I understand it, eventually we will see him come out from behind the curtain. We assume every assumes that he will get his third term. But there's going to be a critical question of who is with him as he comes out. Absolutely. The important thing, and we're all watching for this weekend, when the new party lineup is going to be announced, there's a lot of rumors starting to fly around, although not as many as there usually are. But it's a big guessing game because that will give us really our first clue into what the third term is going to look like. And I think there are three important things to watch. One is going to be what happens to Lee Kachang, the current premier. Does he continue to stay on the standing committee? He's turned out of staying on as the premier, but could they make him the number two in head of the National People's Congress? Who will be in the lineup to then take the premier position? And the two leading candidates appear to be Wang Yang, whose view is being more open on the economic issues, and Wang Hunyeng, who really is an ideologue. And the third to watch is what happens to Liolchah, who's currently the vice premier, who's in charge of the economy and finance. As he stay, he has good relations with many foreign firms, or who really comes in to take his portfolio. David, one of the things that we watch in the West, and we may be right or wrong in watching it, is the extent to which the markets in some way play a substantial role in economic policy over there, it strikes me that it's possible to interpret President Xi thus far as moving somewhat away from the markets. A lot of what he emphasis right now is ideology. And I think it's what he came out of more than perhaps we've seen in the past. Absolutely. We're seeing much more emphasis on ideology under Xi Jinping. And if we look back under Jiang Zemin, Jiang Zemin was saying the party is big enough to include business. She takes it in a different way. He says the party is all encompassing, and it should be forced into business. And so ideology is playing a much bigger role. And so we need to keep an eye on how Xi's favorite slogan, common prosperity, is going to be implemented. China, surprisingly, is actually much more unequal than the United States. And one of the things that he's trying to do through this common prosperity, slogan is say there should be a cap on executive salaries. We should be looking at big companies, particularly the private sector, giving back to the community. And how that's going to be implemented at the same time when he's trying to grow the economy, when he's trying to encourage entrepreneurship and create jobs, is going to be a very tough thing for him to balance. Well, I was going to ask exactly about that, Debu, because through history, a lot of people have said we should have more equality, less inequality, whether it's income or wealth. But a lot of attempts to get that done actually do get in the way of growth overall. Absolutely. I mean, in China, and we've talked about this before, the overwhelming majority of Chinese companies are small and medium-sized enterprises. It's up into the 90s. They are responsible for about 60 percent of China's growth and about 60 percent of job creation. And so if you can't create the right atmosphere for them to grow, you're going to have a significant impact on China's ability. And right now, she's facing a lot of headwinds when it comes to the economy. He's got issues still to deal with with real estate market. It's one of the only places that Chinese people can invest. And obviously, housing prices are going down at the moment. The world is facing a global recession, and she is still very dependent on exports to grow the economy. He needs to find a way to unlock consumer spending. And that's very hard to do when you don't have confidence in the path of the economy. And particularly when you don't have the kind of social safety nets in place, particularly around health, that make people feel comfortable enough and have confidence to spend their money. If you put it a longer course of Chinese history because you've been really very active in China for a good, long time now, are we seeing something of a turn back toward Mao in a way from a Deng Xiaoping? Well, certainly we're seeing a difference in the way that she is governing the economy. The Chinese Communist Party.",https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dp8PhLsUcFE,5626,2022-10-22 14:38:54
17221," on a way from a Deng Xiaping? Well, certainly we're seeing a difference in the way that she is governing the economy. The Chinese Communist Party has about 93 million members. And to put that in context, that's 10 million more people than the whole population of Germany. And he've used this as the way to govern the economy. And so therefore, the party is involved in every aspect. As we look at this new leadership coming in, watching the ideology versus the technocrats is going to be really important and give us a sense of what the government appointees, which will take place next March, will look like and how they're going to approach the economy. Is there going to be this emphasis on a more socialist economy? Or are they going to be more emphasis in what they call the socialist market economy? The fact that they didn't put out the GDP numbers this week on time, I think is very disconcerting. For the world's second largest economy to place politics over just the standard transparency of publication of data is not an encouraging sign. Debra, looking into your crystal ball there, what do you think this might mean for U.S.-China relations? I mean, it strikes me at least that going back five or 10 years, a lot of it was about economics. It was about trade, things like that. Increasingly from Beijing, but also from Washington, when they talk about one another, it's about geopolitics. It's about Taiwan, it's about Russia, it's about security in the Asia area. Well, national security definitely dominates the headlines. And there are some very serious issues that we're dealing with. I was just in the UK and they were telling me Taiwan didn't even use to really be on their agenda and now they're spending about 75% at their time. These are the China experts focused on this. So those are absolutely definite, important issues to watch. But I think the real story here is going to be what happens with the economic and trade relationship. Traditionally, it's been the foundation of their relationship and it's created the people-to-people ties and built some levels of trust. Without these exchanges with Western companies reconsidering both because of the politics, but also because of the state of the Chinese economy and the complications that have come with dealing with COVID-0, they're reconsidering their strategies. And not having that level of trust, I think really is going to have an impact and ensure that there are going to continue to be fraught relations between the United States and China. Do you have Deborah Hoap's, if not expectations, that after we're through the party congress and maybe actually after they meet in the spring and confirm that he's president of the country, that that will free President Xi up to reach out to the United States or will it embolden him to become even more assertive? Well, I think once we know what the lineup looks like, I think it's going to be easier to answer that question. I think whatever happens on the political front, Xi Jinping needs to find a way to grow his economy because his power both internally and internationally stems from their economic might. China right now is the largest trading partner to 70% of the world. The US used to have that role 20 years ago. And in order to maintain that, he has to show that he can grow the economy and he can't grow the economy through ideology. He has to go grow it through basic economics. Okay, Debra, it's always such a pleasure to have you here. You are really our China expert. That's Debra Lair and she's CEO of Edelman Global Advisory. Thank you for having me. Coming up, we'll wrap up the week with our special contributor, Larry Summers of Harvard. This is Wall Street Week on Bloomberg. We make it very transparent.",https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dp8PhLsUcFE,5627,2022-10-22 14:43:10
17222," We make it very transparent to the shopper before they accept an order. What the order is going to look like, how much work on it pays them and how much like the consumer is paying them. And so they can decide whether they take an order or whether they refuse it. And that's a kind of flexibility. That our shoppers really value and the kind of transparency that they want. Are you seeing a labor shortage right now and what are you doing to combat that? It's different in different places or demographic of shoppers is completely different from food delivery and right sharing where 70% women and half of them are moms. And that's because a lot of the job at Instacart is very different than just being in a car with strangers. It's about like going to the store, doing a good job of customer service of really picking the right products for the consumer and we are seeing that being very appealing to women. This is Wall Street Week. I'm David Weston. We welcome once again our very special contributor in Wall Street Week. He is Professor Larry Summers, of course former Treasury Secretary. So thank you so much for being with us Larry once again. Much of the week was consumed with the drama over the United Kingdom which is good and serious business for people who are living in Great Britain. But what lessons might it have for the rest of us? Look at one level Britain is unique. They went through Brexit. They've had some unique political challenges that have taken place within their Tory party. We've rarely seen the kind of extreme incompetence that was represented by the original trust proposals. But I think there are two lessons that policymakers around the world need to heed. The first is that things can change extraordinarily fast if you lose credibility. Just as it takes a long time to grow a forest but you can burn it down very quickly. Being similar is true with respect to credibility and confidence. And I think at a time of rising government debts and rising interest rates, that's a lesson to be careful that policymakers in many different countries need to take a counter. I would say the second more specific lesson just goes to the potential instability in government debt markets. And that's got both a macroeconomic aspect that if your deficit projection starts to get out of control and your real interest rates starts to rise rapidly, you can get into a kind of doom loop. And it also has to do with liquidity in the markets and the possibility that you'll get a situation where they'll be selling but there won't be buying which will be get a kind of liquidation cycle. And I think given the magnitude of the increases and interest rates that you're seeing in other parts of the world, that's something that policymakers are going to have to build. And I think that's going to be very careful of. I thought Secretary Yellen was right to warn about issues around illiquidity in the U.S. Treasury markets. I think we're going to need to be watching our own fiscal projections in the United States very carefully because I think they're going to look different with current markets.",https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dp8PhLsUcFE,5628,2022-10-22 14:47:26
17223," We're going to need to be watching our own fiscal projections in the United States very carefully because I think they're going to look different with current market interest rates. If you factor in the recession, it's likely to come. That's going to have some significant effects. If you factor in all the different steps that are being taken, whether it's the student loan debt relief or the emergency funding that's going to take place because of the hurricane in Florida or the increases in national security expenditures that I think are almost inevitable given what's happening in other parts of the world, I suspect that the fiscal issue is going to need sooner or later to be back on the table in the United States. So I think that we can be amused. Because of us who don't live there by some of the things that are happening in Britain, but if we think of it as an experience that's entirely outside of any kinds of concerns that other countries could have, that would be a real mistake. Well, and Larry, as you say, we have to perhaps pay much more attention to the fiscal side, be a bit more responsible. That's at the same time that many people, and you included, are warning that we may well be heading to a recession here. In the past several years, it's thought that if there's a recession, we can just write some fiscal checks for it. If we don't have the ability, that way it turns out Liz Truss did not have over in the United Kingdom, what does that mean of our ability to pull out of it? What is the prospect that when we've had so many years of feast, we may be headed for some famine on higher interest rates, lower growth and lower productivity increase? Look, David, there's always a tendency at the beginning or in the early stages of very problematic periods to assume that everything is going to be resolved much more quickly than actually proves to be the case. Think about COVID. I was early on your program and was very worried about COVID, but I certainly didn't envision that it would be something that would still be on people's minds going into the winter of 2023. And I think it's a mistake to think that all of our economic challenges are going to be met quickly, particularly if we heed what I think would be the dangerous advice that are coming from the erstwhile members of Team Transitory that the Fed can back off already and not carry through on the increases that the market is now expecting. I think for that to happen would be to almost guarantee a protracted period of stagflation as we had both we lacked both price stability and confidence. I think we need to remember that apart from anything we do with discretionary policy, we have a whole set of natural stabilizers that kick in in our economy as the economy goes down, tax collections go down as unemployment crosses certain thresholds, their increases in unemployment insurance payments. But unfortunately I think we fired the fiscal canon so strongly that there's going to be limited room for discretionary fiscal policy if we have another recession. Finally, Larry, one of the other events of the week was the release for the release from the Strategic Petroleum Reserve by President Biden, who swears this is not a political issue, but could you give us the economic potential effects of those sorts of releases? David, I think the initial sprow release was a powerful thing that over the last month has done a lot to contain oil prices. I think the Biden administration was exactly right to do it strongly, do it for a long time, do it in coordination with others. I think it's much less clear how much scope there is for that policy.",https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dp8PhLsUcFE,5629,2022-10-22 14:51:48
17224," long time, do it in coordination with others. I think it's much less clear how much scope there is for that policy to work further going forward. In part, that's because of the, many of the constraints are on the refining side. In part, that's because it's a little bit like QE for the Fed. Whatever you put out there, you're gonna have to get back in at some point and that's gonna have the opposite impact on oil prices. So I think you gotta be careful about that instrument from here and I think that we've all gotta be very apprehensive about the degree of confrontation that now exists between the United States and what might be called the Russian Saadi Axis. This is gonna be a very complex time and I hope that we get through it while avoiding oil price spikes. My guess is that that's gonna happen but I think that's a major downside wild card from here both with respect to inflation and with respect to recession. Okay Larry, thank you so much once again for joining us on Wall Street Week. That's Larry Summers of Harvard. Coming up, what's up and down with Great Britain? Bloomberg Stephanie Flanders gives us one more thought on a wild and wacky week for the British government and the economy. That's next on Wall Street Week on Bloomberg. However you get your news. This is Bloomberg Daybreak, but thanks. Welcome to Daybreak Australia. This is Bloomberg Technology. I'm so Bloomberg crypto. On TV, radio and the web, this is Bloomberg. there is a real reason for it. This is really a reminder isn't it just how sensitive the markets are to any commentary about trade. We did see some pressure on the U.A. and we did see some pressure on the futures. That is now being reversed. You will shed light on dark matter. You will make aging optional. You will turn 5G up to 11. As when you subscribe to Bloomberg, you won't just get news. You'll get insight into limitless possibilities, knowledge and inspiration to feed your ambition. So before you invent pioneer, disrupt. Before you change the world, Bloomberg. Finally one more thought. I think Liz Truss started off with the right idea which is the UK has been held back by slow growth since the global financial crisis. Actually in the two decades before 2008 we'd averaged around 2.5% growth which was higher than many of our trading partners. We caught up a bit with Germany, we caught up with the US during that period. But since then growth has been less than half that and certainly much slower than other countries. So it did make sense to focus on growth. And it made sense to also be spending some money in her initial mini budget on supporting households through a massive...",https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dp8PhLsUcFE,5630,2022-10-22 14:56:15
17225," in her initial mini budget on supporting households through a massive energy squeeze as we approach the winter. I think the problem for financial markets is that the government showed no willingness to engage with the difficult trade-offs that all governments are facing in this environment, where they want to stimulate growth, they want to help households face rising energy bills, but they don't want to make it harder for the central bank to bring down inflation, and they don't want to be building up a lot of debt just at a time when we know the cost of money, the cost of borrowing all around the world is going up. So it was not what she did, but the way she did it and the kind of gay abandon with which the government was proposing tax cuts that were not funded by any form of spending constraint, and not targeted to the people who in this particular environment needed help the most. And then what we also saw in the UK, there had been this nervousness in financial markets that maybe dates back to the Brexit referendum, that some of the constraints, the institutional constraints on policymakers in the UK that had prevented silly politicians from doing silly things, that those have been worn away in the years in the tumult since Brexit. And I think what happened when you saw the new Chancellor installed, the seventh since 2016, you saw potentially those institutional constraints come back, but the Treasury, the Bank of England, is still in charge. That's the message to markets, even if politicians are still messing around at the edges. There's a lot of Shaddon Freude, potentially, and certainly there, but for the grace of God, go eye, central bankers and Treasury officials around the world, they are looking at the UK and wondering what's happened to this previously great nation, but they should also be looking at potential pitfalls that they too will face as we go into this environment in which interest rates are going to be higher. The cost of government borrowing is going to be higher, and potentially strains are going to be put on financial markets. We saw a particular investment strategy, the liability driven investments in the UK, which are particular to the UK, mess up the pension market, force the Bank of England to intervene, but we know we saw similar fragility in the US Treasury market back in March of 2020, and there may be other things out there that we should be nervous about, as we see this very significant shift to a higher interest rate environment. That does it for this episode of Wall Street Week. I'm David Weston, this is Bloomberg. See you next week. I was interested in the following question, which is there are a bunch of the dinosaurs called Saurapod dinosaurs, which had really long skinny necks, so Apatosaurus is an example. That was at really long skinny tails.

Now the way a bull whip makes that cracking noise is because the tip of the whip actually goes about twice the speed of sound. Okay. And that crack is a sonic boom. Yeah. I think the way they got a date was to impress the females by making loud booms. Markets come down in Europe from the financial centers of the world. Bloomberg markets European close with Guy Johnson in London and Alex Deel in New York real time numbers real time analysis weekdays. While many industries have seen business suffer during the COVID pandemic, the snack food sector has soared. We all remember that time at the middle of March of 2020 where the world changed and thought packaged food in general. That was a great thing. For packaged food broadly, anything you could stock up for a meal time, it was an incredible run to the grocery store. The kind of volumes no one really ever expected. Anything that is center store, shelf stable and the supply chain could keep up with it. Boom. Consumers stuck at home are finding comfort in comfort food and they're stocking up on snacks as new COVID variants threaten to create new supply disruptions. Mondalees, the maker of Oreos, Cadbury and many other iconic brands has been keeping a close eye on these developing trends. As we went through the pandemic, we started to realize, in our categories, biscuits and chocolate, the consumption is going up. There is the need for physical and mental well being and chocolate and biscuits to provide some sort of relief to these 10 states. Few companies are better positioned to provide that relief than Mondalees with a portfolio of more than 60 brands led by nine global powerhouses ranging from chocolate to crackers to cheese. And few snack food companies have a broader consumer base. Mondalees draws more than two thirds of its revenue from sales outside the United States. But for the company to make the most of its opportunities, CEO Dirk Vandiput depends on CFO, Lucas Aramela, to cut through the clutter and keep this huge ship on course. When the pandemic started and when we started to realize that this was going to take on a global nature look as the CFO started to play a key role, make sure it was clear for everybody in the organization what the expectation was. I mean, this is the most recent performance of the company. As you see, most of the businesses doing quite well. Like every CFO in 2022, Zara Mella faces some headwinds, global supply chain challenges, inflation and ongoing uncertainties around the pandemic, just to name a few. But he brings experience in savvy that gives Mondalees executives and investors confidence in their chief future officer. He is like a walking and cyclopedia of knowledge. If he doesn't forget anything, he has an understanding of the details of a business that I've very rarely seen in any person. Defining the CFO role as only finance is very limiting. I think the key differentiator is about understanding the business, knowing the business, making decisions and be selective about what you do, how you do it and when you do it. When I talk about countries, it is because I visited them, I spent time on them.",https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dp8PhLsUcFE,5632,2022-10-22 15:04:53
17227," When I talk about countries, it is because I visited them. I spend time on them and I know our products. I know our people. I know our customers. Lucas Aramella has been at Mondelese since 1996, joining the company in his native Italy. Over the ensuing two decades, he worked in Latin America, Europe, and North America. They tell my daughters, I have three daughters. I always tell them that when they ask me, what is your job? I study. I have a lot of studies in my role. I want to know what's going on in the countries, etc. And so it is about different products, different consumers. We tend to believe that all consumers are equal. They are not. The issues you deal with in the US are very different with issues in Latin America or in Europe. And so I think it's a huge benefit to have sort of grown up in the company. I came from the outside, so the combination of the two of us, that gives a huge strength to our business and the way we look at things. CEO, Dirk Bandeput, arrived at Mondelese in 2017. And a year later, Tapsaramella to lead the finance team. I enter the company as new and you start to look for somebody that can really be your sounding board on what you're thinking. You can play ping pong, I call it, with him about ideas and so on. That started very early and it sort of grew over time. Our CEO, particularly, and our board, they are looking for someone that can understand the business, can drive decisions that are sound from a business standpoint. Especially for a company that has such strength in its local market management. That's CFO role effectively gets reframed when everything's less decision making is inherently a little bit less centralized. If you're going to keep a P&L, whether it's a formal P&L, or it's a marketing P&L, you're going to measure something. And you're going to do it on a local market area as opposed to a business style of globally that inherently creates a challenge that Louis has been able to solve. It requires more capabilities that maybe you wouldn't think of a traditional CFO role where you'll oversee a finance function. The ability to drive decisions became critical in 2020 when the Jolt from the pandemic suddenly disrupted the company's traditional patterns of performance. At the beginning of the pandemic, I didn't really know what was going on with the business because you can imagine in places like India, for instance, the business came to a complete stop. We business, India for us is an operation that sells more than $1 billion a year. And all of a sudden we went to zero sales. And I didn't know what was going on not only with our people, but with the business itself. I didn't know if we had cash and for how long that cash would support the operation. It saw a boost in consumption in the US, but then India closed suddenly and our sales went to almost zero. And so dealing with this variation around the world and how to make sure that as a global company, as a total company, we got through this in a way that would allow the best for every single country around the world that required a lot of attention as you can imagine from the CFO. I have to say we bounce back tremendously well. I have to say if I look back at the last couple of years and I look at the numbers, it seems like the pandemic didn't happen to our business at all. Mondalees revenues haven't missed a beat, rising year over year in both 2020 and 2021. The company projects even stronger top line growth in the next two years, but maintaining margins may be challenging with supply chains still under pressure and the cost of labor and materials rising. I've never seen physical supply chain disruption like this. Sure, normally you get cycles, you have to take some pricing to cover the cost inflation, but it's not like you can't get the products to the shelves. I think it starts with labor shortages around the world.

17228," I think it starts with labor shortages around the world. That's causing knock on impacts on freight costs, on ingredient costs, on physical movement of plants. I'm not necessarily worried about supply at this point. I'm more worried about prices and prices, particularly around logistics and the run transportation, have been going up worldwide. Are they hitting your margins? Are you passing those on to the consumer? In the US, for instance, we just announced pricing of 6%. OK. Across the portfolio. That is a vote that, effectively saying, this is not transitory. That if you're passing on those prices of the consumer, that's here to stay. Are you not expecting some of those input costs to go down then any time soon? I don't expect them to go down any time soon. I think transportation, for instance, has been quite high in terms of inflation for the last three years. I also know that packaging costs and costs related to some of our commodities are going up and have been going up. So far, despite the highest food inflation in decades, leading producers have been able to pass on costs to customers. Mondalees saw US retail sales take a healthy jump in December 2021 versus the previous year. When you pass those costs on to the consumer, you are confident that they can accept those higher prices? I am. And I also would like to say that it is not necessarily a straight price increase. We use what we call revenue growth management. That is optimizing the size of the packs, that is providing multiple choices, for instance, based on consumer occasions. You might realize that you don't necessarily carry with you all the time, a big pack of Oreo, but so making the product available in smaller sizes is critical. We optimize promotional spending. And so making sure that promotions in terms of that, which means the price benefit that you give to the consumers and in terms of frequency, they are optimized. And so it is a full array of things that we are trying to leverage to make sure that there is the least amount of elasticity. But reality is, if you look at the market, you see prices going up and volume going up. So the old concept of elasticity, higher price, lower volume, is not necessarily there anymore. Mondalees set a long-term target of 3% organic net revenue growth in 2018, when it launched a new consumer-centric growth strategy. And the company is not backing off that goal. Reality is, I believe, the 3% plus algorithm is achievable for this company. Also, we have been making acquisitions. We have been adding around about a couple of billion dollars of revenue of platforms that are high-grow single-digit in terms of their revenue potential. I think going forward, we now have a recipe. We are growing our global brands. We have developed local brands that play on the needs of the local consumers. We have found a financial algorithm that allows us to constantly increase the investment in our brands. Coming up, Mondalees has developed an appetite for M&A. Lucas Aramella tells me how the company makes sure that its acquisitions deliver maximum value. It is about, yes, feeling geographical gaps, but it is also about ensuring that we feel gaps in our portfolio. This is Bloomberg.

Are we close? The European Union will support and defend Ukraine's territorial integrity. With unmatched reach in resources from more than 120 countries, the moment news breaks 24 hours a day. Bloomberg, you are global business authority. Mondaleys is a young company with old routes. It was created in 2012 in a split with craft foods which dates all the way back to 1932. In its early years, Mondaleys was a takeover target, attracting the attention of billionaire activist investors Bill Ackman and Nelson Peltz. Peltz pushed for a merger with PepsiCo and when that failed, he later joined the board to oversee a cost-cutting push. He'd taken a chunk of shares, put pressure on the company, eventually took a board seat from 2014 onwards, and really just said, don't worry about the top line. If your margins, operating margins are only 12%, why you worry about the top line? You've got to focus on improving those in order to create long-term value for the company. So with that in mind, they did exactly that. And for three or four years, from 2013 to 2017, 2018, we saw monstrous margin improvement. So when Dirk van der Poet came in, his remit was to get the top line going. And he did. It's because of the work that was done before I arrived that we were able to focus on growth after my arrival. Let's now focus on what drives our growth, building our brands, investing more in our brands, getting distribution in the channels where we were underdeveloped, building our geographical presence and so on. Mondalease is also building through acquisition. Since 2018, the company has added about one and a half billion dollars in revenue, and deals across a number of consumer segments and geographic markets. With a seven-day brand, we can apply our brands to those portfolios that we acquired. It is about, yes, filling geographical gaps, but it is also about ensuring that we fill gaps in our portfolio. And particularly in the case of Bakesnext, we are very keen because it is a category that is massive. There is no consolidation in that category yet in terms of manufacturers around the world. It is high growth, and we can apply our brands and now we know how to deliver cost synergies. I think what Mondalease has done is very small. They've targeted areas that are still quite fragmented, but growing and profitable. So areas like snack bars, areas like cakes and pastries. And I think the deals that they've made are pretty small. With a growing lineup of brands and a widening global footprint, portfolio optimization is a priority for Mondalease. Portfolio optimization is really ongoing. But reality is, as a company, we have a lot of brands and a lot of local brands that mean a lot to our local consumers. So the Indian consumer and the way you reach them and target them is very different than the way you would reach and target an American consumer, for example. Yes, it is. Having said that, one of the biggest success stories in India is Oreo. And we have been able to sell quite a bit of Oreos in the last couple of years. I think we crossed the $1 million mark for that brand in India. And so there are a lot of nuances. But the...",https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dp8PhLsUcFE,5635,2022-10-22 15:17:53
17230," I'll quite a bit of Oreos in the last couple of years. I think we crossed the $100 million mark for that brand in India. And so there are a lot of nuances, but there are also a lot of similarities. Our brand still have a huge runway of growth for instance, Oreo, one of our biggest brands, is growing double digit or close to double digit for a $3 billion brand that's pretty impressive. In 2020, Mondaleys opened its new global headquarters in Chicago. One of the places Lucas Aramella spends a lot of time is this conference room where teams can display and discuss data, stay informed and stay connected. Here we can track and monitor the performance of our company throughout the world of our competitors. We can measure and take a look at balance sheet, cash flow, etc. And every month we spend three hours with the CEO in this room where we go through a Q&A session and where we analyze data, we point to things that are working very well, where we need to make further investments, but we also talk about things that don't work that well. And so we have follow-ups with the segments and the regions and the business units about it. When Lucas Aramella isn't crunching numbers or working with his team to solve strategic problems, you can often find him on his bicycle. It's a past time he tries to pursue every day. It is about performing well, but also having a strategy on how you compete with others. It is an individual sport, but it is also a team sport. And it gives me the opportunity to talk to a lot of people and see an always moving environment. Always on the stationary bike or do you have an outdoor bike? I also go outdoor and we are in Chicago. The temperature outside is around about 10 degrees this days. And I have to say yesterday I went out with my bike, a freezing temperature. And yeah, I prefer going outside if I can. They say the physical tapness makes you mentally stronger as well. Maybe that's part of it. Yeah, I think cold is just a perception. If you don't think about it, you can go and exercise outdoor. Up next, Lucas Aramella shows me around Mondaleez's glittering new global headquarters. He tells me how he sees the future of office work. We want to give our people flexibility and if anything, what we have learned over the last couple of years is that we can run the company effectively from remote. And helping a chief future officer is as much an art as a science. I think to be successful in a role like this, it is not only technical knowledge. It is about passion, it is about caring. This is Bloomberg. I think that it's hard to put your head around any narrative. Like just be honest, we've had sort of a shift in are we in some sort of sideflation fears? Moment, people were talking about that all day, yesterday. And they're getting a lot of interest. We've had over 50,000 applications. About 90,000 applications. We've had over 1800 applicants from all over North America. So are these nascent programs actually beneficial to their communities and the workers joining them? Or are they little more than flashy advertising campaigns for places looking for an injection of fresh talent? In 2020, Mondalees moved its global headquarters from suburban Chicago to a building in the city's booming Fulton Market neighborhood. The roots of the company have been in Chicago.",https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dp8PhLsUcFE,5636,2022-10-22 15:22:12
17231," to a building in the city's booming, The roots of the company have been in Chicago. I think when I thought about opening a new headquarters, the main thing we were looking for was to make sure that we were in the middle of the consumers. And full-time market where we are is one of the areas in the US and the operations, as a percentage of the population. About 400 employees are slated to occupy these new offices, which were designed with productivity and community in mind. We wanted to have a lot of common areas and make working easier for people. And so we have a lot of light, as you can tell. We have a lot of shared areas. The meeting rooms you literally walk in and a computer who caps on the screen almost automatically. And so we wanted to make these a contemporary, fashionable place and something that is easy for people to use as a space. But over the past year, the new space has been largely empty. It's grand opening postponed, as Mondalees, like so many companies, complied with public health guidelines and many employees, work from home. How are you dealing with a still remote workforce, a labor force that is demanding flexibility? We want to give our people flexibility. And if anything, what we have learned over the last couple of years is that we can run the company effectively from remote. I still believe there is a lot of value, particularly for young people to come into the office and absorb a little bit the culture of the company. And I know for sure that many people that work for me would like to come to the office and have that social aspect of working that is somewhat missed. Do you think this flexible work from the office, work from home, is with us to stay? I think it is with us to stay. I know for sure that many people don't like spending hours commuting. And I know for sure that it might be more productive if they spend that time doing something else, working or spending time with their family. So as a company, we embrace flexibility. If the future offers flexibility to workers, it also offers opportunity to businesses to assess their need for office space and potentially redirect some resources. It has been different country by country and so there have been some countries where we have reduced the office space and we are putting that money back into the business either by giving more opportunities for people to operate as they like and giving them the tools that they need, but also investing in our brands. It's all about investment for Lucas Aramella and he realizes that patient long-term planning yields the best returns. What's the biggest challenge in the next 10 years for you? The biggest challenge is about managing costs in a way that is sustainable because as a company, I don't think we can shift away from growth. And so that good balance between cost management and investing is something that is required. And sometimes I have to say it is challenging to cut costs in a context where as a company we are pursuing growth. Mondalease is also pursuing growth in a sustainable framework that company targets a 10% reduction in emissions across operations and 100% recyclable packaging by 2025. I.S. Aramella, if these goals are achievable, just three years away. I think they are. A lot of companies are talking about it but I can tell you there is a lot of belief in the management team specifically that these are the right things and we have to do them because not only our consumers, because it is right for the planet, it is right for our children, it is right for future generations.

17232," The biggest change that a CFO role will undergo in the next 10 years. I think it will be about how we as CFOs run the company. It is the role of a CFO. As I said, the information availability is quite extensive these days. I think as leaders, we will keep on thinking about how we can make the company go better. But I also believe it is important that we spend time grooming our successors. And the role of a leader today is about thinking about what is needed for our people in the next 5 to 10 years and making sure we equip them to be successful in 5 to 10 years. And it is completely different than what it used to be. What then would be the biggest piece of advice you'd give your successor? I think to be successful in a role like this, it is not only technical knowledge. It is about passion, it is about caring, it is about making sure that the future generations have something in their hands that was built over time by people like us. They have to love Oreos, right? They do. Lucas Aramella clearly loves what he does. He believes in his company's products and he's using that passion, along with a whole lot of data to better its financial prospects. That's what makes Lucas Aramella a chief future officer. I'm Taylor Riggs. This is Bloomberg. At some point you had to fight for the trademark, right? For the red soul. Is that stressful? Very stressful. Especially, we are a small company in a way and we have to fight people who have those huge companies who put you 27 lawyers on your back for something which is very stressful. I wish it didn't happen. Everything which happened to me is a lesson in a way that are good and once it's done it's done and you're sort of happy. I'm happy about it. I think I could have definitely avoided but it's done. Did you realize at the time when you started the company that you would become so successful and actually so big? No. When I started the company I wanted to have a shop in Paris which is my hometown and I wanted to do pretty shoes for pretty girls. That was my goal. Now you look back and you say actually I still make pretty shoes but for many more women. Yeah, absolutely. Do you think you would have been so successful without the red soul? I think the red soul definitely of course participates to my work but also to the fame of my shoes because it's instantly recognizable but then you know the design is very important but definitely when you have such a strong sign of recognition it participates to yeah. It's a way of life. For something as universally important to human life as sleep, mysteries surrounding its necessity and utility have only just been recently uncovered. Some of our biggest discoveries were in the 1970s or 1980s and so it makes that a really exciting field because it seems as though we're uncovering new insights each and every day. Some scientists are going further to find out how sleep and what happens there can be harness to further expand our understanding. It's easy to memorize things that makes you smart if you can spit back a lot of facts but if you want to be wise you really want wisdom you gotta know when and how and why to use that information and that's what your brain figures out while you're sleeping.",https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dp8PhLsUcFE,5638,2022-10-22 15:30:50
17233," use out while you're sleeping. The markets are preparing to close, but the day is not over yet. Talk that is now up about 45% of volatility, right? You need the power of the Bloomberg terminal to get you market moving data before anyone else. There's numbers much higher than expected. Upgraded today to overweight. You need top analysts to bring you exclusive global insight into cross-asset markets. The tiny bit is a really big focus. Bitcoin ain't playing along today. It's going to be a short term. Bloomberg markets that close weekdays on Bloomberg. It was meaningful. Thank you so much for joining us. Thank you for having me. What drives you? What drives me? Oh my God, I love the idea of just a simple as this uninclusive world. A world where people see themselves reflected. Because I was supposed to be invisible by your accounts. I was supposed to not be where I am. I was supposed to have disappeared a long time ago. And every turn in my life was about visibility. Yes, I will be this person who's not supposed to be here. Yes, I will fight through the hard times. Yes, I won't give up. And even though I was sort of the token black editor in the industry in the 90s, I knew even then that I needed to bring people up with me. I needed to bring other people up with me. And so that's really been a part of, you know, maybe it's maybe it was growing up in a family of six, I don't know. No. When you run a team, how do you instill that work ethic, that kind of answering emails at all time? Yes. I mean, you know, I think you say an example. You know, if you're an editor who leaves and has lunches and it's never in the office, you know, you don't really sort of instill faith. My team know that, you know, we're on a mission. We have to reflect the world we live in. We have to reflect the beauty of multiculturalism. We have to reflect, you know, the beauty and diversity and inclusivity. So everybody takes it really seriously. And we really have intense conversations about the side guys and the world. And so, you know, I'm very lucky to have a team who are as passionate and, you know, I could call my team, you know, I could call somebody at 6 a.m. or they can call me at 6 a.m. and I'll pick up and they'll pick up. So, you know, we have something very special that we've built over the past sort of five years. But there were difficult moments, right? I think the first time one of your first issues, you thought that you could have been fired for it. Is that right? I mean, I lived in America for a bit and I was working for W Magazine and there was talk of Brexit and of course Americans were like your country's really, you know, xenophobic. So, you know, I came back and I thought, you know, I'm going to be welcome with open arms and they're going to love me and oh my god, literally back to them by fire. But I remember thinking, you know, I wanted to create a magazine where every woman could see themselves, you know, where every woman regardless of the backgrounds, regardless of their age could just literally see themselves. And at the time, now it looks like it's the norm when you look at other magazines. But in 2017, that was, that was a radical idea. But I also remember thinking, you know, with my background, you know, I've lost so much and gained so much that I thought, if I knew, if I'm fired, I'd rather be fired for what I believed in. I'd rather be fired for creating a magazine that reflected the world as it was than try to sort of create a second-rate version of someone's vision. And that continues. I mean, there's this idea of always pushing forward. Yeah. Right? What's the end? How do you measure success? I'd rather measure success. I'm definitely not financial. I mean, I think it's more about, for me, when I'm really exhausted, when I'm really tired, when I'm really questioning if I can go on, you know, I walk on the street and I see a little girl, a little black girl who's seeing the magazine and it's...",https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dp8PhLsUcFE,5639,2022-10-22 15:35:18
17234, really questionin if I can go on you know I walk on the street and I see a little a little girl a little black girl who's who's seen the magazine and and it's the norm for them or a curvy woman on a traitor palace who's like thank you for you know seeing me you know that makes it worth what that for me is success and anybody who knows or has known me for a while we'll witness that that for me is success you know my jaw is done when that happens. Do you think I mean do people come up to you? They do but it's always it's always in a positive way it's always thank you for seeing us you know but I can relate because like I said to you know by all accounts I was meant to be invisible you know so for me shining in light on people and making them seen it's it's natural for me. They say that the fashion industry is changing you're changing it. Are others around you changing it? I mean now you know you look at other magazines and seeing real women in there it's no longer a radical act. Seem you know people of color women of color on covers is no longer a radical act so it's being normal you know it's been normalized and for me I'm quite happy when I see that you know when you put Dame Judy Dengie on the cover and she's 85 years old and the world just laughed it nobody questioned her you know should she be on the cover or or you put hit you know a girl with a hit a hit job on the cover and it's not a problem that for me shows that you know we're advancing we're progressing so you know progress for me is very important. Which is important and so how do you take care of your team? How do you build a team around you? My team I mean some you know somebody said to me once when you build a team make sure you employ people you like people when you see them working towards your office you're just so excited to see that was it being good at your job and sort of a connection and being excited to see you know team members because you only have good as your team you know no man is an island you know I don't create the magazine on my own and so it's great to have a team who you respect and who's views you respect no and who respect you. How do you think you're seen by your team? Do you have to be fearful? Do you have to be also terrible? I'm a worker I work very hard but I think I'm pretty open you can have conversations with me you know ultimately the final decision rests with me but I do listen I like conversation I like interaction and so that's I mean that's how I hope they think I'm a good boss and that's you know really all you can hope for because you know they work on a very good magazine they can get other jobs anywhere so the fact that they're there makes me think that they must be happy. Edward how do you see the publishing world changing so people buy less magazines you've been man I mean you've been doing pretty well in terms of selling more but in five years how does it look how does it look? I mean I was like you know five years ago I even I mean let's go back to I.D. when I was 18 you know I inherited a magazine you know which would come out was all about club kids and you had to be out there and the only way you could see street fashion was through I.D. and then 2017 I inherited you know I inherited a magazine but now I oversee a brand you know the magazine is so that the magazine is sort of the highest of the high the best paper you know the best photographers the best you know cultural messages but at the moment you know when you manage a brand it's not just about that it's about digital it's about video it's about audio it's about events so for somebody who's so forward looking it's so great for me and people always ask oh it's our magazine's dead when we launch a cover Instagram it's our cover essentially so I've you know found a way we found a way of sort of making it work hand in hand and it's so great for me you know I think how do I just been doing the magazine I probably would have been bored yeah some magazines aren't dead are they gonna you know yeah but they're gonna work in hand with with digital platforms you know but also I'll tell you something new readers of old young readers don't necessarily come to us to the new stands they come through that you know did you sell platforms or you know audio or videos we put out so,https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dp8PhLsUcFE,5640,2022-10-22 15:39:35

I'm not one of the people that leaves work and shuts themselves in. I really want to be out there seeing the world as today. All is beauty. I'm very curious. I have a very curious mind. I'm glad. I'm glad. It keeps everything moving and exciting. Is that for Gen Z? Is that a commercial purpose to get closer? No, it's just out of curiosity. I've always been like that. I've always wanted to know what's next. I didn't want to be the one that's just being told, oh, you're 50 or whatever. I pay attention to everything. But the world is such a beautiful place for me. Any goes back to my childhood again. Well, be your biggest challenge to grow the brand in the next five years. We still keep it relevant. We have such great digital traffic. Almost almost six million every month to Britishville. But I'm really excited about overseeing the European Vogue as well. Spain, Italy, Germany and France, and mentoring a whole new generation of editors. When there was this whole agonization, the whole world thought there was a global view that was going to dominate. But it's very much about local conversations as well as global conversations. I learn from these content leads. And I hope that they also learn. The local, global conversation I'm very excited about moving into the future. Do you think it changes if we're in a recessionary environment? You have such a glamorous lifestyle. What you sell is so glamorous. Is it impacted by the cost of living or inflation? What we can live through? A few years ago, I put Taylor Swift on the cover. And the by-line was by-better, by-less. And it was a radical concept at the time. But now we all talk about sustainability. We know we can't keep shopping every day. We know we have to buy things that last. Things that help the planet. Things that we can pass on to sort of other generations. So I think that really is a conversation on the fashion industry is having right now that I find so exciting. And it's going to be sort of, you know, people are going to have less money so they have to buy things that last. And I'm really excited. And these are real changes. It's not just real changes. Real changes. It's not just conversation. It's actually happening. Do you think fashion brands always need to have a political point of view when they're great injustices? I think fashion brands can do more. I feel that having a black model in your show or having, you know, a feed on your Instagram post, it's not enough. We need diverse voices behind the scenes. I always say that I talk to sort of all the CEOs I know we need to employ more people from, you know, from, you know, diverse backgrounds. Because that's the only way you can even reach out to more people, you know. Ever, right?",https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dp8PhLsUcFE,5641,2022-10-22 15:46:01
17236," more people from, you know, from, you know, diverse backgrounds, because that's the only way you can even reach out to more people, you know. A variety of voices always better than just, just one. And I always also say, you know, let's not just have interns, let's have people in all different levels. And that's what I keep talking to people about. Do they listen? Some listen, but I think since, you know, George Floyd was murdered more and more companies sort of made pledges to people of colour. And, you know, it's a slow, it's a slow process. Some have taken it seriously and some are still working their way through it. But, you know, we have to keep on. The problem is that you can make a pledge and then follow through. You know, so you have to really sort of focus and keep asking that question for people to follow through. And so do you feel like you're a guardian of, also of that, of making sure that when you get promised something, they'll do it and you'll hold them into account? Yes, if they promise something, you know, that I asked for, then I would literally wear you down. I would literally chase you until you keep your promise, not just who I am. We actually have one of the diverse, diverse cabinets here in the UK with Liz Truss. Is that important to you? It is so important as somebody who came from another country and was sort of welcomed by the UK. And, you know, it's very important to have a diverse cabinet. That's how change happens. You know, going back to what we discussed before. That's how you understand people who are on the periphery or who've been avid. It's so important to have a diverse cabinet. But this you think in terms of policies and what they can bring to the table or just also seeing a daily a diverse cabinet. And how many effects on policy? I hope they can have an effect on the parties themselves as well as policy. For me, it's about policy that makes people's lives better. I know you're also very close to Ghana still. I mean, there's a pretty scandalous anti-LGBT bill getting through. I mean, you know, it's so funny. I was invited back to Ghana a few years ago by the President. It was the year of the return. And I remember the last time we were in Ghana, we were fleeing. And I really supported the changes. I love the changes that we're going through. But yes, they do have an LGBT problem. Some friends and I signed a whole. I don't know if you saw it. And we're doing what we can to change things on the ground. I think you can't also sit in the West and tell the country what to do. So it's about sort of forming alliances on the ground and seeing what is needed and how we can help. Rather than standing on our soap boxes going, do this, do that, do this. So that's through what grounds, I mean, ground work, trying to change from with it. Yes, from with it. Trying to change from within, you know, talking to heads of LGBTQ members and asking them what they need and what we can do to help. Rather than, you know, I say, do this. This is how you do it because we don't live that. You have a memoir out. Why put it down on paper? You know something about when you turn 50. You know, I got married this year. I'm normally not someone who looks back all the time, but it felt like the right time for me to do that. And also, you know, I just felt that a lot of young people see people like you and I and they think, you know, we just got here. And we were always here and for me was really important to share the story of a journey about, you know, successors and, you know, failures. And, you know, that's the reason why I got here. So I just wanted to share that story with them. Sort of young people. That's what those people who, you know, feel like they're on the outskirts of, you know, the outside of the industry really. Do you feel like an outsider? I always feel like an outsider, but as I said before, you know, I grew up African in an African household in England.",https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dp8PhLsUcFE,5642,2022-10-22 15:50:28
17237," I always feel like an outsider, but as I said before, I grew up African in an African household in England, you know, different languages, different foods, and I now go to school and I've been in England. So I've always been about duality. I've always seen myself as an outsider, but I was also an insider. And even when I took the job at British folk, I was the black gay working class outsider, but I'd been in the industry since I was 18. So I was, in essence, an insider. So that's really, it's about the duality that plays out in my life. What, who do you think made you the person you are today? I know you left home twice, right, Ghana, but also you had to leave your home. Yes. I mean, the puzzle made me who I mean, really is my mother. I mean, I mean, I loved my mother. She taught me about sort of beauty. She taught me about clothes, about fascists. She also taught me that beauty came in all forms, that women were beautiful, no matter what shape they were, no matter what color, what religion. And so that really stayed with me. And I guess my creativity comes from her. And of course, I also had a military father, so the idea of precision and organization and sort of thinking ahead also comes from here. So the best of both worlds as well. How did your father, I know you had a difficult relation with your father, how did your father shape the person you are today? It's a funny, I should ask this question, because I never thought I was like my father growing up. I was very shy, very sensitive, a little spacey. I prefer the company of women. To men, my dad was sort of authoritarian, disciplinarian. You had to be home a certain time. He rogues on iron fist. And I thought, I'm never going to be like him. He kicked me out of the house when I was 18. But I found out over the years when it comes to work and discipline and sort of organization that is him to a T.

17238," life, but I always say, you know, you don't have to have vision to have vision. So in those dark rooms, my imagination was even bigger. You know, I dream bigger and I came out of sort of the last surgery and the cover I did was for W Magazine with Rihanna, after Queen, with a golden eye. And I look back at the end and I thought, oh my god, there are the eyes, some, some, limitly. So, yes, it was very challenging. And even to this day, you know, I go for checkups to make sure my eyes are okay. And they're great right now. And you know, once, the more I look after myself, the better, the better. But it's amazing, you power through adversity. Do you ever think actually, this is too much? Have you ever thought this is too much? I mean, there have been times when I felt this is too much, but it's not in my vocabulary to start. It's not in my DNA to start. You know, I am my mother's son, my father's son, you know, the edge to move forward is always there. And that's why, you know, when I was young, I would always get up and work. I had a reckoning touch when I still got on a plane to go shoot the Hollywood put folio. But now I'm learning to say no, now I'm learning I can't do that job, I can't fly. No, it tastes kind, but it comes with age. It takes courage to say no, right? Definitely. So when you look at all your covers and there's so many beautiful ones, is there one that's that's special to you? Well, I say to someone, they're like my children. I always have a favorite child. But I'm especially proud of the covers we did in lockdown, you know. When the world had essentially shut down, you know, the teams were sort of scattered all around London. And I had to go back to the days of I did when, you know, you had to really create user imagination. And we had a series of four covers, Judy Dantj, when they said, you know, anybody over 60 she stayed at home, the essential workers cover a cover of landscapes just so people could take a breather. And the activists cover when George Floyd was murdered. And I really think we create covers that, you know, in years time people can look back and see what the time, that period was like, for me, an artist always has to reflect their times to paraphrase, and in a Simone. And that's really important for me. I mean, there was a bit of controversy with Linda van Gelista. Yes. Yes, I mean, you know, there was a, there was a complaint that, oh, you know, she should, she should have looked a certain way, you know, and for me, I've known Linda in the 90s. I've known this incredible icon who really defined what a model should be. And I also saw my friend go through really dark days, you know, due to the complications for surgery, literally disappear from the world, really not the Linda the world knew. So when we were doing this cover, it was the collaboration. She wanted to be that Linda that everybody knew. She wanted to feel good about herself again. And I wasn't going to deny her that act. And also, you know, whatever I would like to say, whatever a woman wants to do with her body, it's up to her. So, you know, I'm very proud of Linda and I'm very proud of that cover. And I mean, some of that you're almost like an activist. Is that how you, you're like a fashion activist or a political fashion? I'm definitely a creative, but you know, I've always believed, you know, look at my, my life story in my book, you know, I wasn't like I kept saying I wasn't supposed to be here, you know, had my dad not left. I don't know even what would have happened to my family. So even when we ended up in a room, two rooms in a voxel, six of us, we were so happy to be there, penniless, but so happy to be there. So, you know, every day, I just, you know, I'm an optimist and I know it's not the most fashionable thing, but that's why I'm sitting here with you today. Bye. Edward, thank you so much for your time today. Thank you. We don't have enough women founder CEOs who are getting funding. So basically less than 2% of VC funds go to women, less than 1% go to women of color.",https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dp8PhLsUcFE,5644,2022-10-22 15:59:15
17239," CEOs who are getting funding, so basically less than 2% of VC funds go to women, less than 1% go to women of color. And so in this innovation space, I said to myself, what's the best way to use capital to move things for women? And that's when I started to say, okay, I actually need to move some money into the venture capital space. And I want to do it smartly. I mean, the first goal is to make money. I'm not putting my money out as a social impact. I'm putting it out to make money. But I wanted to go behind funds like aspect ventures that's run by Teresa Gao and Jennifer Fondstadt who are looking at these opportunities and they have a thesis around my gosh. There are so many opportunities there if we go towards funding some of these women businesses. Some LPs have said to me, all we care about is returns. Some of the best investors may not be the best people, but they have the best returns. What do you have to say to those people? I have to say you're investing in what you know. And so you need to look at what trends are coming in the nation and how you're going to dress them. Women are 85% of consumer dollars spent. Women control 70% of financial decisions in the house. So if you're not investing in products that go towards females or a women led company, you're missing an opportunity because you just don't see it. Hydrogen has a very special place in the universe. It's the first element on the periodic table. It is the most abandoned element in the universe. And when clean energy advocates think about what can we find which would be as easy to use as fossil fuels they think about hydrogen. The fuel that will when burn only produce water. We like to imagine that if we just built enough of these and these we could ditch fossil fuels and save the planet. Unfortunately it's not that simple. There are some things where you just need a good old-fashioned combustible fuel. Now startups around the world are betting that hydrogen can become the fuel of the 21st century. Hello and welcome to Emma Barnett Meet. And this week I'm meeting the space experts and physicist Professor Brian Cox. And I'm really looking forward to asking him about how he gets his head around the vastness of space and to explain it to all of us or try to anyway. How he also goes about his daily life when he knows how insignificant we really are and what he makes of NASA's new telescope and those amazing images. Welcome to the programme. Thank you so much for coming to talk to me and to to all of our viewers. And I actually wanted to start with a new NASA telescope. We'll come to your particular project in a moment but it's named after the man who ran the agency in the 60s and oversaw the first man mission to the Moon, James Webb. What do you make of what we're seeing so far? Because it's pretty incredible. Yeah it's a remarkable instrument. I mean you think of the predecessor which is the Hubble Space Telescope. I think it's almost impossible to imagine a world without that. Even if you don't know the images that we're familiar with at the universe, many of them, the spectacular galaxies and star-forming regions, they're from Hubble. But the web is a significant step forward and technically one of the most important things is it can see what we call longer wavelength light or infrared light. And that's important because if you think about we want to see the first galaxies forming. So we want to understand how the first stars and galaxies formed in the universe. And so what you do is you look far out into the universe and because light travels quite slowly across cosmic distances. Let's say you have a galaxy that's the most distant one you can see with the naked eye is about two million light years away. So that means that the light has been traveling for two million years to reach us. And it's a remarkable thing actually to think when you look it's called the Andromeda Galaxy. And if you know where you're looking you can just catch you at the corner of your...",https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dp8PhLsUcFE,5645,2022-10-22 16:03:31
17240," I has been traveling for two million years to reach us. And it's a remarkable thing actually, to think when you look, it's called the Andromeda Galaxy. And if you know where you're looking, you can just catch you out of the corner of your eye. If you think about it, you're seeing that as it was two million years ago. Yes, although I don't. Because it takes a light two million years to travel. I don't like being late to information, so that makes me feel very out of date. Well, it's remarkable. I mean, it began its journey before we had evolved on Earth. So in the time it took, and that's the nearest neighbouring galaxy. The web looks so far out that it's capturing light that's been traveling for over 13 billion years. But the universe has been expanding, and so the light has been stretching. And so for the most distant galaxies, we're looking back in time, almost to the big bang. Then the Hubble was not sensitive to that light, so that the web can see the formation of the first galaxies. It's essentially looking all the way back to very close to the beginning of time. And that's very important, because we're not entirely sure exactly how those first galaxies form. The idea of what you just talked about in terms of how much time this is taking and what it's covering. Do you think we will ever be able to see the big bang? Well, we almost can. It's not the web telescope. There's something called the Cosmic Microwave Background Radiation, which is light that was emitted in the universe. And it's a very precise number. It's 380,000 years after the big bang, which is not very long at all, but at the universe is 13.8 billion years old. So we can see that. It's microwaves, because it's been stretched so much by the expansion of the universe. Going back, that the problem with light is that in those earliest times, the universe was so hot and so dense that light couldn't travel through it. So it was opaque. So you can't use light to go back earlier than that. But what we can potentially do, not yet. We're not good enough yet. But the technology we use to now to detect colliding black holes, which is another remarkable thing, but I'll leave that one aside for now. But we have the technology to do that. And that technology possibly could allow us to probe right back to this thing, the big bang. And again, whether or not that's the origin of time, we can talk about as well. Brian, you've dedicated your life to explaining the scale of the universe to people. You have a new world tour and show called Horizons. What's the goal? Are you trying to teach people new things and understand the world they're living in better or what are you aiming for? Well, actually, all those things. So it works, I hope, on different levels. So I talk about cosmology. So we've spoken about what we call the large scale structure of the universe, the galaxies, and how they formed, how the universe evolves since the big bang. But also, I've got very interested in my academic work in black holes. And black holes, and they're really evocacy things. I think everyone's heard of these strange things, these totally collapsed stars, from which nothing apparently can escape. But in the past few years, past few decades, really, beginning work that Stephen Hawking really began back in the 1970s and many others. And we've begun to suspect there's a lot more to them. And they've started forcing us to reassess our understanding of what space and time are. And that's a really weird sentence. You might think, well, space is the arena in which we live and time just ticks. But it really isn't. It looks like, from studying these things, there are building blocks of space and building blocks of time. And what I say in the show is, that's a mind-blowing idea. And I talk about that. But the key point is, there's a great quote from Einstein, a beautiful story that Einstein told about when he was a little boy, he was six or seven years old. And his dad gave him a compass. And so he looked at the compass and he saw, well, there's this thing, this needle. And it always points north, points in this direction. So there's some kind of invisible that I can't see that underlies our reality that's making this needle point nor any said later in life. It was my first encounter with an idea, which is if you look at nature carefully, and really pay attention. And you're lucky, you can catch a glimpse of something deeply hidden. It's a beautiful phrase, something deeply hidden, which is the deep structure of reality. That's what our reality is.",https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dp8PhLsUcFE,5646,2022-10-22 16:07:58
17241," you can catch a glimpse of something deeply hidden. It's a beautiful phrase, something deeply hidden, which is the deep structure of reality. That's what our reality is. And so black holes, they're kind of a metaphor in a way. I talk about them as rosetta stones in the sky. They're the things that, by studying them, and you say, why would we study these things? Well, in studying these things, we're beginning to get a deep, a deep picture of what our reality actually is. That's a remarkable idea. But it's a beautiful idea that runs through all of science. How do you define a black hole? Well, it's in Einstein's theory, which again, is a remarkable thing. It's published in 1915 over 100 years old. But it's just a region of space from which even light can't escape. A lot's happening on Wall Street. I think J. Powell said things that were indefensible. Need to catch up? This is Bluebird Wall Street Week. I'm David Weston. We've got the information and insights. We think that's the next secular shift. From business's most influential and instrumental. It's knocking it out of the bull path. It's a challenging dynamic. This is a level of uncertainty that we haven't had to deal with. Bluebird Wall Street Week live Friday with replays all weekend on Bluebird Television and Radio. Companies now, they're getting hundreds, maybe even thousands of applications. So software has come in to automate the process. You want to write your resume for robots, not for humans. The only job your resume has is to be comprehensible to the software that is reading it. Because that software or robot is going to decide whether or not a human ever gets their eyes on it. These things are programmed by a certain segment of the population. That might not be totally inclusive or not be fully aware. Concerns about how this technology could exacerbate discrimination. For the FTC, I think foremost, the FTC needs to be making sure that we're fully understanding this technology. We don't trust companies to self-regulate when it comes to pollution. We don't trust them to self-regulate when it comes to workplace comp. Why on earth would we trust them to self-regulate AI? And by understanding what they are and knowing more about them, what do we then learn? Stephen Hawking, back in the 70s, published a paper. The initial one was called Black Hole Explosions. It was a great title for a paper. He calculated that in his language, he said, Black holes aren't so black. They glow in the sky, like holes in the sky. And they radiate. They lose energy and mass and ultimately disappear of a huge time scales. And that's so important. I show this picture in the show that if you go into Westminster Abbey and look on the floor of Westminster Abbey on Stephen's memorial stone, then you find his equation for the temperature of a black hole literally chiseled in stone on the floor of an Abbey. So you might say, why? Why is it so important? This was the key, this was this Rosetta Stone idea. In trying to understand what happens, what happens to the stuff that fell in? When you thought these things existed forever, which is pre-Hawking. Then you think, well, it's okay, it gets locked up inside. It can never get out, we don't care. But the thing evaporates away. One day it will be gone. So then suddenly you have to be faced with this question, what happened to everything then? Is it somehow possible in the far future of you collect all this?",https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dp8PhLsUcFE,5647,2022-10-22 16:12:08
17242," faced with this question, what happened to everything then? If I throw a book into a black hole, is it somehow possible in the far future of you collect all this so-called Hawking Radiation that comes off? Is it possible to reconstruct the information in the book? And that's been a question, simple question that's driven this tremendous amount of research for 50 years, and it was pretty much sold in 2019 actually in 2020. Pretty much, I mean, there's still a huge number of questions, but roughly, well, the statement is everything comes out, again, all the information comes out. So everything that fell in, in principle, in the far future, you could reconstruct the information of everything that fell in, it's just an astonishing idea, because actually the last thing I'll say is that before that, before the Hawking papers and before this modern understanding, inside a black hole, just according to Einstein, sits the end of time, which is an astonishing thing to say, because we can see them. We have a photograph of one of these things in the center of a galaxy, too, actually, and you're looking, when you look at that photograph, you're looking at the end of time in space. So then you think, well, if things go to the end of time, how does everything get out again? And that's the content of this tremendous work in theoretical physics. This work is still being black holes, which is probably, it's one of those things that a certain kind of person says is useless, right? He said, why? Who cares? It turns out that the techniques that have been developed and the understanding that's been gained from looking at these things has got a very strong crossover with building quantum computers, right? Which is that quantum computers are in laboratories now. They have a tremendous potential to revolutionise our civilization, incredibly powerful computer devices. Yes, and also that's sometimes the defense given, isn't it, about what's going into man going back to the moon or woman going back to the moon? The other things are discovered in the pursuit of those missions. Yeah, I mean, it's always a cliche, but it's true. A friend of mine, an astronomer always says, when people criticize these spacecraft and they say, you know, let's say the James Webb Space Telescope, it was what six billion dollars or so. But it's appropriate to point out that nobody put six billion dollars in a suitcase and launched it on the rocket, and the six million dollars didn't go into space. It was spent on earth. And what is often the case, it put inside the glory and wonder of the discoveries that are made, that basically you were paying people to do high tech jobs and do research and build machines that operate at the edge of the possible. And history tells us that that tends to be extremely useful. You're inventing things and trying to do things that are difficult. And that expertise never stays in one place. It then spreads out across our civilization in ways that you can't really predict or even quantify. Indeed. And you did sound very excited early. I mean, you sound excited the whole time about all of this, which is infectious, even if, you know, people are trying to keep up, including myself. But when you talk about the golden possibility of there being, you know, life out there. And that question of, are we alone? Where are you with that? What do you say to people right now with the latest information? Well, so this again, it's, I think there's a cosmology, I say this in the show as well. It's one of the most challenging subjects because at one level it makes us feel very, very small and insignificant. And it's true, you know, physically. I mean, the earth is one planet around one star amongst 400 billion stars in one galaxy amongst two trillion galaxies in the part of the universe we can see. So we're definitely small, right? You can't argue that. Yes, you clarified that. But, but, but you're right. If you ask the question about life, the answer is we don't know. We found nothing, nothing alive beyond the earth. But I've missed it that we haven't been very far or looked tremendously hard, although we are looking hard now on Mars because we suspect there might have been microbes on Mars because there was one's water on Mars and it was geologically active. And all the things that we think led to the origin of life on Earth were present on Mars.",https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dp8PhLsUcFE,5648,2022-10-22 16:16:34
17243," microbes on Mars because there was one's water on Mars and it was geologically active. And all the things that we think led to the origin of life on Earth were present on Mars around the same time, about three and a half to four billion years ago. So we wouldn't be surprised if we find that microbes existed, probably subsurface on Mars, or maybe on some of the moons of Jupiter or Saturn where there's water today. However, nobody expects anything more complicated than a microbe. And it's interesting, so if you look at the history of life on Earth, you have microbes around 3.8 billion years ago, pretty much not longer to the Earth formed in geological time. But if you look for evidence of complex life on Earth, then really there isn't any in the fossil record until about 600 million years ago or so. So on this planet, for most of the history of the planet, there was slime, basically, single-celled things, doing interesting stuff, photosynthesis and things, but nothing more complicated than a single cell. And it's only in the last half of billion years or so that you get this explosion of life on Earth. And I know it, as I said, it's only in the last, less than a million years that we've had home-issapiens on Earth. And in the last few tens of thousands of years, we've had a civilization. So here, it took pretty much four billion years to go from cell to civilization. And that's the third of the age of the universe. And so that leads many biologists that I speak to to suggest that whilst microbes might be common, civilizations might be rare. Actually, I asked a friend of mine at Great Physician Carol, how many civilizations do you think there will be in the Milky Way galaxy? A typical galaxy? How many in a typical galaxy? And he said, none. And I think he's, I tend to say one. So somewhere between zero and one, probably. But that's a guess. But what do you think is a good guess? Brian, is that what it is? You sound like perhaps you have an optimism for it, and I wonder what's underpinning that? I would love that to be. And actually, because it worries me, and this is the way that I end my show, actually, it worries me that let's take that position. Let's imagine that in our galaxy, 400 billion Suns, there's just us that thinks. Right, the microbes are all over the place. But in terms of things that think and can feel, and in a very real sense, bring meaning to the universe. All these things we've talked about, and beauty of these galaxies, they're not beautiful if there's nothing there to perceive them, right? They're just galaxies. So if that's it in this galaxy, then the decisions that we make now as a civilization have a galactic implications, right? We destroy ourselves, for example, deliberately or through inaction. Then it's possible that we eliminate meaning, perhaps forever, in a galaxy of 400 billion stars. And so that's it. I think that leads you to it's a good work in assumption that we have a tremendous responsibility in a sense, not to do that. So I would be much more comfortable with our current predicament. If the galaxy was filled with civilizations, then I'd say, well, okay, it would be rather stupid of us to eliminate all this beautiful culture and science and art and music that we've built up. But at least there's someone else that's doing that. But I'm not actually sure there is. No one covers the world like Bloomberg.

Add in the chief executives of Adobe, Deloitte, Gap, VMware, and that doesn't count Indians running companies all over the world. Why have so many Indians risen to the top? For no coastal appoints to India's incredibly competitive education system, if you can survive the pressure it takes to get into one of the Indian Institutes of Technology, it gives you confidence to handle American universities and later the business world. Meanwhile, the belief in India's ability to produce so many tech wizards is reinforced every year. Indians make up about three-force of the immigrants receiving coveted H1B visas for the US, and it's a safe bet that some of them will eventually find their way to the sea suite. How comfortable are you with with space tourism and the pursuit of that knowledge and meaning being left largely to a very small group of rich men? You're right, the idea that the technology is used. If all it was useful, it was to send a few very, very rich people into space on a joyride, then there will be a real criticism there, but that's not all the technology is useful. I think it's important to understand that the space industry is about operating initially in near-earth orbits, and we've already industrialized that. We all use it every day. We all switch on our sat nav in the car, satellite navigation, it requires infrastructure in orbit. A lot of the stuff we know about climate change, resource use, and so on, that's coming from satellites. I think you have to look at the space industry as a whole, really, and then say, well, it's not just about... The same argument was made for intercontinental travel by aircraft, when the first... it's true, when the first aircraft were built, it was extremely expensive in the preserve of the rich, but of course within a few decades it had democratised travel, and we all take advantage of that every day. So I think that's the right way to look at space. It's not to focus on particular bits of it that we might not like for moral reasons or whatever it is. It's actually... I really do advocate for the facts of looking at the whole industry, which is tremendously important now. It is. I mean, I am interested though that you did say, and correct me if I'm wrong, that all political leaders should go to space, perhaps for some perspective. Do you still think that? Most of them should come back. Most of them. That's the last part of that quote. Yeah, it was... That was... It was based on an idea, which is very famous idea called the overview effect, which is well known, that astronauts change their view of the... Always, as far as I'm aware, anyway, when they come back, they have a more positive view of the value of this planet and are very much more focused on preserving it as a beautiful place, perhaps a unique place in a galaxy, as I said. So I felt that... And I do feel that having had the good fortune of speaking to many astronauts, that that experience... For the people who make the decisions, the big decisions about our future, could have that experience. I think it would be good investments. It's extremely hard arguments to make, that we should actually spend money allowing, you know, in our case at the moment, our Prime Minister writes, in the UK, you'd say, well, we just spend money sending Boris Johnson into space and bringing him back safely to Earth again, because he would change his view. No, I don't think I win that argument. But I think there's a serious point there, which is that it does seem to change people for the better when they see our Earth as it really is, which is a fragile thing against the blackness of space. So I think it's an argument that I would try to make, I would lose it, because it's very expensive. Do you want to go?",https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dp8PhLsUcFE,5650,2022-10-22 16:25:08

I would love to, because as I said, I'd love to share that experience of seeing our world from space. I think it's really unarguably. It appears to be a life-changing experience and it seems to change individuals for the better. You won't be scared. Well, I don't know. I mean, I remember one of my great heroes, John Young, who flew on the Apollo missions, walked on the moon, test flew the first space shuttle. And he said that anyone who sits on top of however many thousands of tons of liquid hydrogen, helium, liquid hydrogen oxygen, and isn't a bit worried, doesn't understand the problem. LAUGHTER So he's probably right. Do you have people come and talk to you about faith? Do they talk to you about how religion and that side of life fits into your level of knowledge? Because I know you've traveled around the world talking to people. Yeah, a lot. It comes up as a question. Because cosmology is the... It's a science of origins. And actually, with the study of black holes, I mentioned, we're even beginning now to think about what's faith and time are. So naturally, I say in the show, actually, I say when we talk about this, it's the moment of creation. If that was... So we're asking, was there a moment of creation? And that's the correct language to use, I think. Or it's the evocative language, but it's really what we're talking about. Did everything come into being or has it always been here? We actually don't even know the answer to that question, really. And so, yeah, I can ask you a lot, because, I think, cosmology is a challenging science that challenges us to think about these things. Because we often associate that with theology or philosophy. And I think that's a good thing, because something I very strongly believe in is that segmenting or making little canisters and putting different bits of human experience or different music and art and theology and philosophy and science and segmenting them all is just the wrong way to look at it. But what we're doing is a deep level trying to understand what it means to be human in this tremendous, potentially infinite universe. And so I... Those questions get asked. And ultimately, I say, I'm quite straightforward. I say, I don't. I'm not a religious person myself. But the correct thing to say, even about the question, did the universe have a beginning in time, is we don't know. We don't know. And that's it.

It's really wonderful to have you here in person. It's my pleasure to be here. Thanks for having me. We actually lived in the same dorm in college just a few years apart. It's been almost a year since you took over from Jeff as CEO of Amazon, and it's been a year of first, the first Docsplit since the.com bloom. The first vote to unionize an Amazon warehouse, your first Bloomberg technology conference. Thank you. I want to start with a quick report card. In February 2021, Jeff Bezos shocked the world by announcing plans to step down as Amazon CEO. A few months later, he passed the reins to Andy Jassy, his longtime top lieutenant, the architect of one of the company's biggest profit engines, Amazon Web Services. Bezos has stayed on as executive chair. Leaving Jassy to navigate a critical inflection point in Amazon's history. How does the company manage market turmoil, rising inflation and regulatory scrutiny, and a push by some warehouse workers to unionize all while keeping customers coming back? Joining me on this edition of Bloomberg Studio 1.0, Amazon's second CEO, Andy Jassy, he joined us from our flagship Bloomberg Technology Summit in San Francisco. I'd like you to grade your view of Amazon's performance, and we've got time later to really dig in. But quickly, how would you grade Amazon's performance over the last year with customers? Well, I think we've, you know, I'm not sure I'm the right person to grade myself during the year or not, but I'll give you my take. You know, I think with respect to customers, I think we've done a lot of good. You know, and I think if you look at during the pandemic, which really has extended till the early part of this year, you know, so much of the PPE and food and essential items and people equipping their home offices were bought from Amazon, and, you know, to scale the way we needed to. Remember, in 2020, we grew 39 percent year over year on a $245 billion revenue run rate. I mean, it's unprecedented. It's never happened before, but it was really hard to do that. And we had to take the really big footprint of the development center footprint. We built the first 25 years.",https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dp8PhLsUcFE,5652,2022-10-22 16:33:46
17247," It's unprecedented. It's never happened before. But it was really hard to do that. And we had to take the really big footprint of the film center footprint. We built the first 25 years of Amazon and doubled it in 24 months. We built out that transportation network in just a couple of years. We nearly doubled the size of our workforce during that time. And I think you saw it in other businesses. AWS is a really big part of helping companies and governments have business continuity during the pandemic. And so many companies and organizations in the last year made the strategic decision that they were going to stop running their own infrastructure technology. And disproportionately chose AWS to help them move to the cloud. And we spent a lot of time helping them make that transformation. So what about investors? I mean, the stock is down significantly from a peak last year. Obviously, there's broader market turmoil. Yeah, I think for investors financially, I'd say it's mixed. And I think we have some businesses that are growing really strongly. If you look at AWS in 2021, grew 37% year-over-year. It's not a $74 billion revenue run rate business. It's pretty unusual growth. And we grew 58% year-over-year in our advertising business, which is a $32 billion revenue run rate business. So some businesses are growing really strongly. And we've continued to grow in our retail business despite pretty crazy comparable during 2020. But I think the real challenge for us there is on the cost side. And there have been several things that have happened, some of which are more controllable than others. I think the part that's less controllable is really around inflation. And I think we thought that inflation would start to attenuate in 2022. And with the war in Ukraine, it just went the other way. And has significantly accelerated. So the cost of trucking and line haul and ocean and air and fuel has just substantially gone up. And I think that will attenuate at some point. No one knows how long that will take. I think the more controllable areas for us are really around fulfillment-setter capacity and productivity. It was taking about 24 months to build new fulfillment centers during the pandemic. And so we had to make decisions in mid-2020 and early 2021 on how much demand we were going to plant for it. And so we end up with more capacity than we need right now. And there's a number of things that we're working on. We've stopped building on properties where we don't need yet and we've let a number of leases lapse and not a small number of both those things. We've had a lot of occasions in our history where we've worked on productivity and made improvements. And we have a lot of clearly defined niches. And I'm confident we're going to get back to the right level profitability. You are going to sub-lease 30 million square feet of space. Is there a mistake in the execution there because of the overblown? Again, because you have to make these decisions two years in advance. And again, if you put yourself back in 2020 where we were growing 39% year over year on a $245 billion revenue run rate, it's very hard to know what's the right amount to build and you have to make a decision. And we made the decision to err on the side of our consumers and sellers. Now, how would you grade Amazon's performance with employees, your colleagues? There has been some high profile. Yeah. I think that when I started in this gig, we had just created a new leadership principle to strive to be the Earth's best employer. And I think we spent a lot of time trying to think through what that really means is broad. And I think we've made a fair bit of progress, but it's still early, in my opinion. But I still think there are many areas that we can keep improving. And I think the first one I'd mention is safety. I think that in our fulfillment centers, that is the top priority. And when you get into the details and numbers and outside of all the spin of it all, we're about average there, but we're not trying to be average. We want to be the best in the industry and the best in the world at it. And that's a high priority and an area that I'm passionate about and the team is passionate about. And I think we have a lot of work we can do to make our employees everyday lives easier. And we've identified kind of a top 100 list of areas that we can be better at, that we are just metronomically stepping through. And so we've made a lot of progress, but we've a lot of work to you still. Elon Musk just came out saying he has a super bad feeling about the economy. Tesla laying off 10% of his staff.

17248," 10% of his staff. Jamie Dimon says he's preparing for an economic hurricane. The World Bank just slashed its forecast for global growth. How do you feel about the economic climate? Well I wasn't planning on giving any guidance to the government. Please. But, super bad or super bad. I think there's some things that relates to Amazon that are useful to remember. I think the first piece is remember that 85% of the worldwide retail market segment share is offline. And if you believe that that equation is going to flip at some point, which we do. I think it will flip over a long period of time. If you look at different downturns, should we have one at some point? And we've been through a few obviously in the 25 years that I've been at Amazon, customers change their habits. And so I also think there's, you know, those two reasons, those two factors give me some optimism that even if we have a downturn that we have the potential to still grow. We have a roadmap that's, you know, probably three to five years long. And we're going to continue to invent. We're going to continue to be insurgent. And we have a lot of work to do to get to where we think we ultimately can get for customers. Now, when it comes to the stock, as I mentioned, it has fallen significantly. Do you think investors are missing something or has tech just been overvalued? And this also of course matters to employees who are significantly paid in stock? Well, you know, I look, I haven't been at Amazon for 25 years. I arrived at the company three weeks before we went public. I have never tried to predict what the stocks are going to do. And anytime I've tried to a little bit, I've been wrong. So, you know, I think it's a pretty hard to predict what's going to be in any short period of time. I do really believe that Benjamin, you know, that Benjamin Graham maximum that in the short term, the stock market tends to be a voting machine and the long term it tends to be a waiting machine. And I think if you, you know, we've been through a lot of points in 25 years to be in Amazon where the macro factors are off and stocks are down. Our stock is down. But you can't really control that. You know, we have a concept we talk about a lot of Amazon inputs and outputs. You know, and the ultimate output for a company is share price. You know, and then other big outputs are free cash flow or profit or revenue. You can't really manage the outputs. You have to manage at the input level. And that's where we spend all our time. And so if you do the right things for the business long term, things tend to work out. I think we've had very good returns for investors. And I expect that to be true again. Do you see Amazon strategy as fundamentally different from Netflix and Disney and if so, how? I think it's crucial. And I think we've moved from this attitude from its indulgence, a waste of time, almost an illness that needs a cure for something as universally important to human life as sleep. Mysteries surrounding its necessity and utility have only just been recently uncovered. Some of our biggest discoveries were in the 1970s or 1980s. And so it makes that a really exciting field because it seems as though we're uncovering new insights each and every day. Some scientists are going further to find out how sleep and what happens there can be harnessed to further expand our understanding. It's easy to memorize that makes you smart if you can spit back a lot of facts. But if you want to be wise, if you really want wisdom, you got to know when and how and why to use that information. And that's what you bring figures out while you're sleeping.",https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dp8PhLsUcFE,5654,2022-10-22 16:42:31
17249," is out while you're sleeping. What are the moon shots at Amazon that are capturing most of your time and attention? What is going to define the next era of Amazon? I mean, is it, is it Astro the home row butter? Is it something else? Well, you know, we have a unique way that we go get big new investments. And I'm not sure it's right or wrong, it just happens to be our way. And we ask ourselves when we're considering something for questions. We ask, if it's successful, can it be big and move the needle in Amazon? Is it being well served today? Do we have a differentiated approach? And do we have confidence there? And if not, can we acquire quickly? And if we like the answer to those questions, we'll go pursue it with a single threaded team that isn't distracted by the rest of the business. And sometimes that leads to innovation and investments that seem pretty obvious. Like, you know, when I got to that company, it was a book's only retailer. And then we expanded to music and video and electronics and toys. It seems obvious to people. Other times that process does not lead to investments that seem obvious to people. I mean, AWS was something that people externally and internally thought was little bit nutty at the time. But just imagine what Amazon would be today without AWS. And I think that you see the same thing here. You know, there are so many significant investments we're making that I'm excited about. I'm going to have to constrain myself to a few. But you know, I'm really excited about what we're doing in the prime video space. I think we're clearly on the right track there and building a significant business. That's interesting because Netflix also just announced some layoffs. The first subscriber loss in a decade, Disney cutting back on costs. Do you see Amazon strategy as fundamentally different from Netflix and Disney and if so, how? Well, you know, we're very bullish on it. And remember, we all the models are a little bit different. But for prime video, we have 200 million plus prime subscribers who are, you know, get that entertainment for free by being part of prime. And so we have a little bit different pricing model than some of the others. But I'm incredibly encouraged by what we have coming. If you look, I mean, we launched this show. Reach earlier in the year was a huge hit. We, you know, we had the New Maisel season. We just launched the new boys season, which is how you made boys fan? I am a big boy. Because Amazon bought. It's very good. Of course, we have, what are the rings coming up in September and Thursday and football. So I'm very bullish about it. We also, you know, we're excited about what we've done with MGM. You know, I think some of the assets there will go very well with the rest of what we're doing. Entertainment-wise. And so if you look at Warner Brothers Discovery and Paramount and Stars and Global, they're building really significant subscription businesses. So I'm very bullish about that business. I'm optimistic that we have a chance to build a significant grocery business, which is, you know, early stages for us. I am excited about Kuiper, which is our low-Earth orbit satellite that we're building. You gotta remember, there are 300 to 400 million people in the world who have limited to no internet connectivity. I mean, just think about how different the world is when you don't have that type of connectivity. And so I think that's a really significant opportunity that has some AWS characteristics to it. I continue to be very optimistic about Alexa. You know, building the world's best personal assistant. We have, you know, 200 million endpoints already that are using Alexa. We're clearly on to something there. And then you know, our autonomous driving, ride-hailing service and zoos that we're building, you know, here in Bay Area. I just think with the way auto consumption is evolving, I think that also is a chance to be a really significant business. Now, I don't know if all of them are going to be successful, but if any one of them becomes the fourth pillar for us on top of marketplace and prime and AWS, we're a completely different company, just like we were when AWS became successful. So I think they're very worthwhile investments and bets and I'm optimistic about them. We didn't mention Astro, obviously, though, powered by Alexa. Alexa, but I mean, our home robot's going to be doing where I don't yet. Where is it? It is. It's not really widely available for sale. What's the status? Oh, if you go one. Okay. Thank you. Everyone's very curious about Jeff's role these days. What kind of executive chair he really is. He said when he was.",https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dp8PhLsUcFE,5655,2022-10-22 16:46:52
17250," OK, one. OK. Thank you. Everyone's very curious about Jeff's role these days. What kind of executive chair he really is. He said when he left that he'd focus his attention and energies on initiatives that he really cares about as at Amazon, but from the outside, it looks like he's really focusing on philanthropy. He's focusing on space. What kind of an executive chairmen is he? Well, Jeff is always going to be involved. And I feel very lucky to have been in Amazon for 25 years. I feel very lucky to have worked directly for Jeff for 20 of them. And we have a really close relationship and have for a long time. And I think we share a lot of the same values about customers and how important it is to optimize for customers and how high standards they need to be given how easy it is for people to switch and the importance of invention and speed. So I just feel very lucky to have had the chance to work so closely with him. So is your relationship, I mean, you're only boss for 25 years, right? Is your relationship fundamentally different than it was when you were the head of innovation? Yeah, of course. Every single job you have, the relationship's different. You know, remember, the first couple of years I worked for Jeff, I worked as what we call this shadow then, which is really like a teeth of staff. And that was different than when I was starting AWS, which was different from when we got AWS going. And it was a business that was starting to do well. And it's different when I'm in the CEO role. But the constant has always been that we have a great relationship and we collaborate really well. Amazon is poised to become the biggest private sector employer in the world. Second, right now Walmart is in that spot. But Amazon will probably soon surpass it. First vote to unionize at Amazon warehouse. I know you've been spending a lot of time at warehouses. When you look at someone like Chris Mals, who I think some people look at as this modern day hero who got fired, pulled off this union vote, what's your message to someone like him? Your message to the folks who think maybe we should join a union? Well, I know I think that the first thing to be clear about is that employees get to make that choice, whether they want to have a union or not. They always have had that choice and it continues to be their choice. And we happen to think they're better off without a union for a number of reasons, including the fact that it's much harder when you have a union to have a direct relationship with your manager and to get things done quickly. So if you see something on the line that you think could be better for your team or you or customers, you can't just go to your manager and say, let's change this. There's a whole process in bureaucracy that you have to go through to be able to do that. And when there's a union, we're going to get the feedback filtered by what the union decides is worth bringing up. And we'd much rather hear from every employee whatever is on their mind. And so I think if you want to continue to have the structure that we've had for all this time, you have to have really competitive benefits. And then I think if you look at Amazon's, they're very unusual in this space. We championed the $15 minimum wage several years ago, the starting salary is now over $18 an hour, which is more than double the federal minimum wage. You get full health insurance and 401K and up to 20 weeks of parental leave. And if you want to get a college education, you haven't had one. We have a career choice program that lets our fulfillment center associate be able to do so. That is a very unusual and compelling set of benefits. And those were all accomplished without a union. So I think that we realize that we have to continue to work on the relationship with our employees. And we need to continue to provide the right benefits. And we need to continue to work on safety. And that's our intention. You made a huge mark on Amazon with AWS, obviously. What is the mark that you want to make? Lots happening on Wall Street. I think Jay Powell said things that were indefensible. Need to catch up. This is Bloomberg Wall Street week. I'm David Weston. We've got the information and insights.

17251," Need to catch up. This is Bloomberg Wall Street week. I'm David Weston. We've got the information and insights. We think that's the next secular shift from business is most influential and instrumental. It's knocking it at the bull path. It's a challenging dynamic. This is a level of uncertainty that we haven't had to deal with. Bloomberg Wall Street week live Friday with replays all weekend on Bloomberg Television and Radio. Stadia Spence is on a path towards the two neutral mobility. So we have picked the switch there and really we're going to step by step electrify everything. And what does that mean? Combustion and your sketch electrified. No one covers the world like Bloomberg. Because Tristanomics is being dismantled, MPs behind the scenes are asking what's the point of having her at the top? Can the strong dollar amplify the world's risks of instability? She didn't think that complete re-inification must be realized. With unmatched reach in resources from more than 120 countries, the moment news breaks 24 hours a day. Bloomberg, your global business authority. The FTC has revamped its antitrust inquiry into Amazon and by some accounts is accelerating it. Are you preparing for an antitrust lawsuit from the FTC? If you are a large company that's growing to a significant extent like we have, you have to be prepared to be scrutinized. And we have known this for some time, you know, many years and we have tried to run the company with that in mind and knowing that if somebody look, that we would stand up to that scrutiny. And I think that's what we've tried to do in running the business. We can't control what, you know, whether organizations spring different suits against us. But I think if you look at our business, if you actually look at the fact, if you take out of the equation that there may not be the most objective leadership when it comes to Amazon in that organization, if you look at the facts, you know, in our retail business, we're about 1% of the worldwide retail market segment share. And remember, 85% of us is still offline. And if you look in our AWS business, we, you know, about, depending on you measure it, 95% of the worldwide global IT spend is on premises. You know, and then we have a cloud business and then we have a portion of that, you know, we were leading market segment share in the cloud part of this. But we operate, you know, who we compete with, AWS is really on premises, IT in addition to the cloud. So, you know, these are relatively small percentages of the entire pie and you can kind of step through all the businesses. And I think simply because you've been successful in a few different businesses, doesn't somehow mean that you have unnatural market power. It just means you've been successful in a couple of different customer experiences. But we still have a relatively small amount of market segment share on those areas. What about the SEC or being sued by them over third party data and how you've used it? Do you think in the past Amazon made mistakes with letting employees internally see how those third party sellers were doing? We have pretty good control. I mean, you know, we, of course, disagree with the premise of that. But I would say that we have very good controls with respect to the data that, that different employees sets are able to see. And by the way, I think that we can be better for sellers. You know, I think that, you know, we can have better tools from the get started. We can have better tools from the manage what they're doing across their different Amazon units. I think we can communicate better. There's a whole bunch of things we can do better. And we agonize over every single email or communication we get from sellers. And we do very regularly robust surveying. And a lot more sellers are happy with Amazon than unhappy with Amazon. And I think if you look at what they're able to do as a business by virtue of selling on Amazon versus not, it completely changes what's possible. Sellers don't really long for e-commerce software. That exists in lots of places. And it's not very expensive. What they love about selling on Amazon is that they get access to hundreds of millions of customers. And that completely changes what their prospects can be in terms of the businesses they're building. So.",https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dp8PhLsUcFE,5657,2022-10-22 16:55:35
17252," about selling on Amazon is that they get access to our hundreds and millions of customers, and that completely changes what their prospects can be in terms of the businesses they're building. So we have a lot of work to do there, like we do in a lot of other places, but I think we have a very strong partnership with sellers. What's the view of the supply chain right now, and how much pain there is going to continue to be and for how long? Well, you know, I think that there's a lot of challenges in the supply chain still. I mean, it's gotten better than it was, but there are all sorts of challenges, non-parasable goods, electronics, chips, that still really, you know, a significant issue for all sorts of businesses. We have worked really hard to open a lot more points of presence in ports and to increase our capacity and getting products in, but I think it's going to be something that companies battle with for some time. You made a huge mark on Amazon with AWS, obviously. What is the mark that you want to make still on Amazon? I mean, in this new role, what's going to define the Andy Jassy era? Well, I don't really think of it that way, Emily. I mean, I don't think it's really about any Andy Jassy era or any one person, you know, and by the way, AWS was not about any one person. That, you know, if you spend a time on AWS, that is an unbelievable team, not just an incredible leadership team, which it is, but just top to bottom, the number of inventors and people care about customers and operate, you know, something where it has to work almost like a dial tone. It's always teams. And so I look at every single one of our businesses and you know, take our retail business or our consumer business, which is the oldest of our businesses, 85% of it still lives offline. I think we have a lot of upside and a lot of growth. And I think as much invention as we've seen the last 25 years, you know, the time I've been there, I think it's going to look small compared to the next 25 years. There is a lot for us to invent on behalf of customers. And so, you know, I'm excited to be part of the team that makes that happen. You know, we are continuing to, you know, to increase the amount that we give back to the communities in which we have big presence. And that really matters to me. I think we have a responsibility to do that. And so, you know, it's a long journey that we're working on. But I'm excited to be part of it. And, you know, I hope to start it for a long time. Well, thank you for joining us and telling us about the way the journey is going so far. Thank you very much. I appreciate it. Thank you, Amanda.

We'll send you an alert up to seven days in advance. If your satellite's going to come dangerously close to a piece of debris or another satellite. Companies have been doing that for decades moving satellites around, but it's sort of like a harder problem now. The risk of a collision is a lot higher now.

Over much of the past three decades, I've been an investor. The highest calling of mankind I've often thought was private equity. And then I've started interviewing. Oh, I watch your interviews because I know how to do some interviews. I've learned in doing my interviews how leaders make it to the top. I asked him how much he wanted. He said 250. I said fine. It didn't go straight with him. I did no due diligence. I have something I'd like to sell and how they stay there. You don't feel inadequate now because being only the second wealthiest man that was at right. One of the president's most senior economic advisors is Brian D's, who heads the National Economic Council at the White House. I recently had a chance to sit down with Brian to talk about interest rates, inflation and the general state of the economy in the United States and around the world. So let me ask you the first and most important question. Are we going to go into a recession anytime in the foreseeable future? Well, thank you for having me. And I thought we were going to start on the ground. Rosie, no, but I should have expected nothing. I'll join this side. Thank you. Thank you for having me and thank you for putting this together. We are no doubt in uncertain times. But I think that if you look at the US economy, my perspective, the most striking feature of the US economy right now is resilience. The resilience of households and consumer balance sheets. The resilience of business and business investment and globally, the resilience of the US economy in an uncertain global environment. So we're certainly in a complicated and in many ways unprecedented transition. But I think that there's every reason to have a lot of confidence in the US position in the context of a globally uncertain environment. I'll take that as maybe. You don't know. Well, let me ask you easier questions. Yeah, please. All right. I'll take any out. You want to give? You think England is and you think the UK is in a recession? Well, I think the situation in Europe and the UK is very, very difficult right now. They face a very difficult situation. And they are, as I was saying, in terms of the US position, they're significantly more exposed to the energy price volatility. And they don't have some of the incumbent strengths that we have here economically. So I think it is and is going to be a tough period for the UK and for",https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dp8PhLsUcFE,5659,2022-10-22 17:04:31
17254," the strengths that we have here economically. So I think it is and is going to be a tough period for the UK and for the European Union. Normally in the United States, when you cut taxes, it's designed to stimulate the economy. And that's what happened in Britain. They now cutting taxes to stimulate the economy. But it seems like an unfortunate impact on the British economy. Stock markets going down, and people are very upset about it. Are you surprised about that? I wasn't surprised with the market reaction. I think that if we, you have to, any economic policy has to be in the context of the situation that we are in. And in a monetary tightening cycle like this, the challenge with that policy apertures, it just puts the monetary authority in a position of potentially having to move even tighter. I think that that's what you saw in the reaction. And also, I would say it is important, particularly important to maintain a focus on fiscal prunes, fiscal discipline. It's certainly something that we have been focused on here. And the markets take notice. So let's talk about another easy subject inflation. Inflation is as high as it's been since I was in government. I managed to get a higher rate than you've gotten so far. But I wanted to know, in your view, is inflation now coming down a bit as a result of the Fed's hiking. And do you expect the Fed to continue to hike in November and December FOMC meetings? Well, the good news is the second part of your question is the easy one, as you know, because part of respecting the independence of the Fed is leaving to them. So if you expect. Look, the market expects that. And all right, I have any wisdom beyond that. I think, but if you look at most of the data points over the course the last couple of months, we've certainly seen headline inflation on a month-over-month basis, slow dramatically. Basically, it's been flat for the last couple of months. That's a function of the fact that we've seen energy prices come down, gas prices. And that's offset, price increases elsewhere. But I think if you look broadly across the economy, you are seeing a number of places where you're seeing this shift and this transition happen in real time. Community prices have come off. You've seen that in a number of durable goods segments. And at the same time, as you know, this process operates with some lags. And so that's why, even as you look over the course of the last couple of months, you've got to really even at a moment of heightened uncertainty that we are in right now have to do whatever we can to lift up from individual monthly data points. Now, when I went to college many years ago, the standard textbook said that inflation was on average, 3 or 4% a year. That was relatively normal. For the last 25 years, we've had 2% inflation. So we've gotten used to 2% inflation. My children have never seen higher inflation. But the Fed now says they want to get inflation back to 2%, which is what it was. But why not 3 or 4% is? Why does 2% have to be a goal? And how hard is it going to be to get down to 2% without putting unemployment up to 6% or higher? A big part of inflation is expectations. And the risk with inflation is not only the immediate impact on purchasing power, but also the risk that expectations get on more, get on anchored. And then it gets much more difficult to bring inflation down. So when you ask that question about bringing down to a level, I think one of the most important questions is the shape of policy focused on making sure that we don't lose control of those expectations. That's obviously something that the Fed keeps a close eye on. And so to your question of the process, look, I am fundamentally optimistic about the American economy. And I'm optimistic that we can navigate through this transition in a way where we come out of this as a country and as an economy in a stronger position than when the pandemic hit. So yeah, at core, I do believe that there's no certainty in any way or no way inevitable that we are going into a downturn. For people who live in Washington, politicians, is it more difficult when unemployment is going up or when inflation is going up? Inflation affects everybody on the point.",https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dp8PhLsUcFE,5660,2022-10-22 17:08:33
17255," we are, you know, we're going into a downturn. For people who live in Washington, politicians, is it more difficult when unemployment is going up or when inflation is going up? Inflation affects everybody, unemployment doesn't affect everybody. So how do you weigh the political trade off between unemployment going up and inflation going up? Which is more difficult for politicians or for, let's say, the administration? There's no question that inflation affects everybody and it affects the psyche. And I think that when it affects a sense, I think, also of people's sentiment and a sense in which things are, you know, in or out of control. And we see that in consumer sentiment data. At the same time, you asked the question about on the political side, as economic policymakers need to recognize that the way that economists think about inflation and the way that Americans think about inflation often differs, that we have this idea of headline inflation versus core. And economists say you really should pay less attention to headline because it has food and gas. You ask typical people what inflation is. It's food and gas. And so, you know, understanding the interplay between the economics and the politics of inflation is something that we haven't been as used to. MUSIC Listen to Bloomberg Radio wherever you are online at Bloomberg Radio.com and around the globe, the other Bloomberg Business app. While Tesla's in the like make for good headlines, the reality is that even if every car on the road today went electric, it wouldn't be enough to curb global emissions to avoid catastrophic climate change. Greenhouse gas emissions from transportation account for about 29% of total US greenhouse gas emissions. So what about the other 71%? Building across America burned fossil fuels to operate. What we want to do is make that all electric. Instead of burning oil and gas to give us the energy and electricity we need, we want to do 100% clean energy, all electric. We want to turn buildings into Tesla's. Just like a Tesla or an electric vehicle is all electric with no fossil fuels. We want to do that with our buildings. And if we can do it in one building, we can do it in all buildings. And if we do it in all buildings, we'll reduce 30% of US greenhouse gas emissions. MUSIC MUSIC MUSIC So let me go back to the NAC. If NAC was started under President Clinton and Bob Rubin was the first person to hold that job, can you explain to people what it actually does and what the NAC does day to day? For example, who's in the NAC? Who's in the NAC? What is your job actually to do? So the National Economic Council, the job, the mandate, the mission of the organization, is to coordinate economic policy across the executive branch and across the cabinet to make sure that the president is getting the benefit of when making decisions of his entire economic cabinet. And also that the economic cabinet is getting clear direction from the president as well. So that two ways. So it's a coordination function. On the NAC itself are all of the relevant cabinet members, the core economic team, OMB, Council of Economic Advisors, Treasury, but also Secretary of Labor, Secretary of Commerce. My team, the NAC team, is a small team within the White House that is our job is to do that coordination across the range of economic policy. Now you were the deputy in the Obama administration at the NAC, now you're the director. Which NAC work better, the Obama administration one or the Biden one? Well, on the issues that I worked on in the Obama administration, it worked very, very well. And the current NAC works very well as well. So it's that subset of the ones I didn't work on. OK, let's talk about your own background for a moment. I mentioned before you grew up in Boston area. And what did your family do? Were they in business, academics?",https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dp8PhLsUcFE,5661,2022-10-22 17:12:50
17256," Let's talk about your own background for a moment. I mentioned before you grew up in Boston area. And what did your family do? Were they in business, academics, politics, important things like private equity, did they do that? My father's an educator. He teaches. And my mother is a civil engineer by training and worked as an environmental engineer. OK, so you went to Middlebury and what did you study there? I studied political science and economics with an international focus. OK, and after you graduated, what did you do then? I came here to DC on a fellowship to the Carnegie Endowment for International Peace. And I was doing international economics, international economic development. I had spent the better part of the year in Argentina in 1999, right before the collapse there, became fascinated with trade and development issues. And so I came here to DC and the Argentina economy collapsed while you were there. No, right after I left. Right after I left. Right after you left. You got out. Correlation and causation. All right, so then you came back to Washington to do what? So I stayed here. I worked, I sort of shifted from international policy, economic policy, domestic policy. Then I went to law school, left DC, and I came back here. But you went to law school to be a lawyer or not? I went to law school to, no, not to be a lawyer. But because I was fascinated as I was working on the, the economic, not more economic elements, it became clear that most of policy is actually understanding law in different ways. And so I went to, I went with the idea that I would continue to work in policy. But they, so you didn't want to practice law ever? It wasn't my objective. OK, so how did you get involved with the Obama administration? Did you volunteer in the campaign? Or how did you get involved in the campaign or the administration? So I started working on the 2007-2008 campaign. I actually worked for, I had the most important experience. I campaigned against candidate Obama for about nine months working for Senator Clinton, Secretary Clinton. And then after they lost, I was fortunate enough to then join the Obama campaign in campaign. What did then Senator Obama say about that? The good news was, I was junior enough in the campaign to Senator Obama was, I don't think particularly aware of that of my transition to his pain at this time. So he got elected and then you got this position as a special assistant to President of Economic Policy. And what was the biggest thing that you accomplished during the Obama administration in your view? My first project upon coming into government was to work as part of the team that did the restructuring of General Motors and Chrysler, as well as the finance companies as well. And so that was basically from, many of you will recall, November, December of 2008, right through to the summer of 2009. That was my over-riding focus. So after the Obama administration, you joined the dark side of money management. And you worked for BlackRock, but in charge of global sustainability. So what does that nearly mean? What were you doing at BlackRock? So two things. One was trying to actually do financial research to understand what are drivers of long-term economic performance that are financially relevant, but that may not be on the mind of traditional investors to give you a concrete example. One of the most persistent measures of financial performance, uncorrelated, is the rate of change at which a company brings down its carbon emissions, not just the level of carbon emissions, but the rate of change of doing so. And we did a lot of research around that to find that that is, in part, because it is an uncorrelated measure of operational performance, better management teams actually better manage against that. And so that becomes the kind of thing that you can invest against. But it also expands the universe of what investors are thinking about. So when President Biden was starting to run for president, you knew him when he was vice president, you were in the Obama administration. Did you support him? Were you working in the campaign for, then vice president Biden? Or did you?",https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dp8PhLsUcFE,5662,2022-10-22 17:17:15
17257," where you work in the campaign for, then vice president Biden, or did you work for somebody else? Sorry. I was, for most of that time, I was busy. I had a job, a family, I would, anytime anyone called, I would offer. So when did you actually get involved with the Biden people? Was it after you got one of the election, then they asked you to help with the transition? So I did some work in volunteering during, to help on the, developing some elements of the, the platform during 2020, that came together in sort of his, his general election economic policy. A White House staff jobs are notoriously long-houred, and you have two little children. So how do you manage your time, and how come you have no gray hair as a result of working these long hours in two administrations? If you, if the camera gets close enough, you'll see some. It's a, it's a, it's a, it's a constant challenge, and it's, it's, I don't have, I don't have a particular wisdom or insight into how to answer it, other than, you know, needing to be extremely efficient with the time that you have higher grade staff and build a great team. There's, I've got an extraordinary NEC team and core team inside the White House without which I wouldn't be able to do this. And also, but it also takes a, an understanding family, because no matter how good you are at prioritization, time management and productivity with your own time, there was always, there was always something that happens and there was always something that comes up. Oh, your children are young. So you go to PTA meetings and people give you economic advice at the PTA meetings, so they kind of say, I have an idea for you on an inviting inflation, is that ever happened? People are extraordinarily generous with their advice. Oh, yeah. What would you like to do most in economic policy in the next two years? The first and most important thing that we're gripped by and focused on now is effectively implementing this historic set of legislation that we have accomplished. So what's the best investment advice you've ever been, given by anybody? The compound interest, the compounding of returns is an incredible miracle of business, finance, and human existence. Everything you learn is additive every day, and if you keep at it and don't quit, it's an incredible miracle. And it's not just interest. It was always said above compound interest returns, compound business returns, compound human returns. They're all very additive, because you learn every day. And if you keep at it, it's very, very, very helpful. In your observation of investors, what do you think is the biggest mistake that average investors make? Selling it the wrong time. And they sell when the prices go down? Yes. Or, yes. Not keeping. But people have conviction, or they invest for the, if they invest for the right reasons, just keep at it. You will put a woman on Mars. You will bring forth global cooling. You will be the first chief crypto officer. Because when you subscribe to Bloomberg, you won't just get news. You'll get insight into limitless possibilities, knowledge, and inspiration to feed your ambition. So before you invent pioneer, disrupt, before you change the world, Bloomberg. So recently we had an act they asked called the Inflation Reduction Act. Who came up with that name? It's a great name. I guess so. But you really think it's going to reduce inflation. It seemed like it was spending a lot of money. And how is inflation going to be reduced by that?",https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dp8PhLsUcFE,5663,2022-10-22 17:21:36
17258," I guess so, but you really think it's going to reduce inflation. It seemed like it was spending a lot of money, and how is inflation going to be reduced by that? See, it's because of the inflation reduction act. So, joking aside, I actually think that it is an appropriate name, and it goes to the structure of, if I could say it in a walkie way, the role of fiscal policy in a period of monetary tightening. What you want to do is you want to take measures that will lower costs for individuals and do it in a way that lowers the federal deficit. Because if you're lowering the federal deficit at the same time that you're low and cost for individuals, then you're actually operating in the same direction. Now, that's complicated to do from a policy perspective, but that is exactly what the inflation reduction act. But does it really lower federal debt and federal deficit? Because I thought it was just lowering it, but the lower where it would otherwise have been. But it's not actually producing a net reduction in the title of debt, is it? So reducing it below where the policy people set of would have otherwise been, right? So, the appropriate way to judge any piece of legislation is, is it going to reduce or increase the deficit compared to the baseline at the time? And the inflation reduction act will reduce the deficit compared to the baseline by about $260 billion, depending in the first decade, probably more than a trillion dollars in the second decade. And importantly, it does it in ways like, probably the simplest way to understand is the provision that allows Medicare for the first time to negotiate for better prices for prescription drugs. That will mean that Medicare is spending less money on drugs that will lower federal spending. But it will also lower the cost of drugs to Medicare recipients and also to recipients in the private market since Medicare is such a large purchaser. Okay. In the inflation reduction act, a lot of the tax increases that the president had previously proposed to build back better act did not get in there. Those tax increases off the table for the remainder of the Biden term, or you're not precluded from. Absolutely. Those are policies the president thought made sense, would have supported if they were in the legislation and continues to support going forward. And I will say, even for all the things that weren't in there, one of the reasons to go back to your previous question, why that bill reduces the deficit. And actually helps in reducing inflation across time is that what is in there, for example, is a new 15% minimum tax, book minimum tax for the largest corporations, those with over a billion dollars in earnings. I think that that's the kind of reasonable common sense tax reform that makes sense. It does mean that some people will pay more in taxes, but certainly that kind of base broadening reform, there's a lot of important sensibility to it. On the day that the inflation reduction act was signed, record high inflation numbers came out. So did you ever consider maybe adjusting the schedule of the signing ceremony, or was it something you said that who told the president the numbers were going to be that high that morning, and maybe you should change the signing ceremony? I think that that number and others go to how people are experiencing inflation today, because one of the principal reasons why that headline number was basically flat was because in the month prior, gas prices had come down by a very significant amount. And that is really important for typical Americans monthly balance sheets, but it also is important because it's one of the most visible price signals in our economy. Now you're two years into almost two years into this administration, and you expect to stay for another two years. I think in other words, it's a long two years, so you're not worn out, and you can see you're doing this for another two years, at least, if not more. I've got no plans to leave, and I've got my head down, and certainly fully, fully absorbed in the work we're doing. So in the next two years, let's oppose you control Congress. What do you like to do most in economic policy in the next two years? What would be your highest goal, other than getting inflation down and unemployment, keeping it a reasonable level, is there another type of chips act, or some other major piece of legislation that you want to get through? Look, I think there's a number of priorities that I would love to see us make more progress on. I'll answer your question, but as a side, the first and most important thing that we're gripped by and focused on now,",https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dp8PhLsUcFE,5664,2022-10-22 17:25:57
17259," is that I would love to see us make more progress on. I'll answer a question, but as I decide, the first and most important thing that we're gripped by and focused on now is effectively implementing this historic set of legislation that we have accomplished. The implementation of this, to your point about chips and otherwise, the effective implementation across the board is going to make a difference, a big difference in terms of the broader economic impact. But look, I think we need to make more progress on tax reform. We made some steps here. But it's showing that we can, as a country, effectively fund our priorities and also build fairness into the tax code is important. It's important for trust. It's important for strengthening our democratic institutions. We need to make more progress on underscoring that issues that often get referenced as care or the care economy are not social issues. They're core economic issues. They're core to our labor force. They're core to our productivity as a country. And there's other issues that are now coming to floor, like housing and housing costs. The fact that we have persistent under supply of affordable housing in this country is a policy choice decades in the making. We can do something about that. And now is a really important time to do that, given the period in the monetary policy cycle. There's a number of places where we can make progress. Places where there is a lot of actual bipartisan support. So I and I could go through a much longer list if you need time. So what's the greatest pleasure of your job and what's the worst part of your job other than interviewing like this? But what's the greatest pleasure and what's the greatest less pleasurable part? So having gone out and being in a couple of administrations, by far the greatest pleasure is the people. You spend so much time with them, but also the quality of people that can come. A White House is in a sense, it's a terrible place to work. It's very hard and all the like. But it's also a place where the reservation price or the wage you would pay is negative because everybody wants to come and have an opportunity. So you can attract great people, diverse people with diverse backgrounds and extraordinary things to bear. So you make friendships and bonds with people. And so that's at core the best part. What's the worst part? The best part. I think the most challenging part is that your time is never your own. That's something you have to be prepared that something always can happen. And usually something does happen. When the price of anything goes up, the consequences reach far beyond what you'd expect. But perhaps most of all, when it comes to food. In 2010, surging food prices help spark the Arab Spring. Lives were lost, regimes fell, and the consequences are still with us. Once again, food prices are rising and fast. Energy costs, broken supply chains, and surging demand were just some of the factors that have driven food prices to their first record high since the Arab Spring. And that's all before a war between two of the world's biggest food producers. Ukraine is called the bread basket of Europe. And taken with Russia, the two account for about a quarter of global wheat train. They produce more than half of the world's sunflower seeds in oil, nearly 20% of the barley. Now throwing rising energy prices and processing, transporting, even refrigerating food gets more expensive. Plus, fertilizer production is extremely energy intensive. Less fertilizer means lower crop yield, and prices rise even more. The pandemic revealed how complicated and fragile global trade systems are. Global agriculture, perhaps even more so. Unlike metals, for example, food goes bad. And crops take months to grow and are vulnerable to unpredictabilities like the weather. Rising food prices will be felt everywhere, but the poorest countries in the world will be hit the hardest. And as all these factors compound, the real fear is that record high will lead to record high, and ultimately, to a global food crisis with vast consequences. Let's move.",https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dp8PhLsUcFE,5665,2022-10-22 17:30:30
17260," Нет. every Friday with 30 minutes dedicated to fixed income. I'm Jonathan Farrow. This is my back row. You will shed light on dark matter. You will make aging optional. You will turn 5G up to 11. Because when you subscribe to Bloomberg, you won't just get news. You'll get insight into limitless possibilities, knowledge and inspiration to feed your ambition. So before you invent high in year, disrupt, before you change the world, Bloomberg. I know you said you didn't want to talk about energy even for one episode, but I have bad news. What's that? We're doing two episodes when it comes to energy and crypto. Just can't stop talking about it. Can't. Should I do my merge joke about merging the two episodes together? Is that the joke? That was the whole joke. That was terrible. But do you think we should do a catch up for people who theoretically didn't watch the first episode? Yeah. How about this? Okay, but seriously, I think it's important to go to Texas, figuratively speaking, get the other side of the argument, talk to a traditional proof of work, Bitcoin minor, an air quotes, dirty minor and see what they're all about. We're talking Texas, we're talking energy usage. It's almost like if the classic TV show Dallas were around in this day and age. Okay. It would be about Bitcoin mining. That's cute. Kind of makes me think that we should have some sort of different intro for the show. Hey Liz, I just tell us what you do at our justice. Sure. We are a national organization and we work with clients and partners across the country to advocate for measures to fight the climate crisis, for more sustainable food and farming practices, to keep toxic out of our homes and in our water bodies, and to protect public health. So we started to get concerned about cryptocurrency mining in New York because New York actually has a landmark climate law on the books called the Climate Leadership and Community Protection Act. It's one of the country's strongest climate laws. So we have been watchdogging to make sure the state can meet those mandates and we learned about the energy consumption of cryptocurrency mining. We were concerned about what that would meet for New York's indillated meter mandates. So a lot of stuff that we do on our phones and online uses a lot of energy. And I guess my biggest question for you is our selfies more important than Bitcoin. I hate this photo because I hate this photo, but go on. We had to take this. This is very cute. It looks like you guys pull up a poll right? I wanted it bigger actually. You wanted like a bill. It was $90 to make it bigger though. We were told that that was too much. Yeah, but you were raising an important question, right? Like there are so many things that we use these days that use a lot of energy. But there's a couple points to respond to that. One is with cryptocurrency. You don't have to. There are other ways to validate cryptocurrencies that don't consume as much energy.",https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dp8PhLsUcFE,5666,2022-10-22 17:34:37
17261," But there's a couple points to respond to that. One is with cryptocurrency, you don't have to. There are other ways to validate cryptocurrencies that don't consume as much energy. Proof of policy. Yeah. So they've been speaking our language. OK, good. So go on. I'm amongst my people because it's quite nerdy. Most people don't. They're like mining. What mining? I think mail respectfully. She's a nerd. So you're good. Perfect. See you. Yeah, so proof of work versus proof of stake. But it's not even just about proof of stake. There's also proof of burn, proof of authentication. I'm the dean. I've never heard a proof of burn. You've lost us. Yeah. You had us. And then when you said proof of burn, we were just checked out. Good thing the show is recorded. It means we can just stop and add things like this and just drop them right into the conversation. So proof of burn. Proof of burn is another way through which participants in a blockchain network reach the consensus that's needed to approve transactions. It uses less energy than proof of work because it doesn't involve miners solving cryptographic puzzles. Instead, network participants gain the power to verify transactions by sending a portion of their tokens to a wallet where the coins will be burned. This essentially means that those tokens will be permanently removed from the circulating supply. Miners will then get rewarded for their work by receiving native tokens of that blockchain. Glad we cleared that up. Yes, there's actually validation methods beyond proof of work and proof of stake. I think those are the validation methods that are talked about the most. But there's others. And we don't particularly care about proof of stake per se. What we do care about is the energy consumption. And with proof of work, that validation method does come with huge energy consumption. So energy use for Bitcoin is often compared to traditional banking. Traditional banking does use a lot of energy. But when you talk about the number of consumers, it's very different. And also, at this point, energy consumption of crypto is already half of what traditional banking is. So it's almost it's getting closer to that much energy consumption. What you're saying is that the energy consumption taken up by the traditional financial institutions around the world is a lot of energy. And a lot of crypto advocates would point to that as being a reason why it's OK to do crypto because existing financial systems use a lot of energy. But you're saying that serves a lot more people. So it's in a sense, it's justified more. We have to cut energy consumption everywhere, right? So this is certainly not to say that the energy consumption of traditional banking is a good thing. There's definitely a ratio difference here. But ultimately, we need to be looking to make everything more energy efficient. And with cryptocurrency, we know that there are methodologies that are extremely less energy consumption than proof of work. So proof of stake is what most people are familiar with. There was a big merge with Ethereum, where they're switched. They've switched now from proof of work to proof of stake. That means their energy consumption has gone down over 99%. I mean, this is a huge way to cut down emissions and be more climate-forward. So how would you design a lot of rain that in? I mean, would you ban crypto mining? Would you ban currencies that use proof of work? So some of the ways that are currently being explored are... So I'll give an example. The federal government came out with a report a couple weeks ago looking at the energy and environmental impacts of proof of work. And what they've recommended is different agencies to come up with various standards that would rot it down energy consumption over time. So that could be one way to do it. But that being said, the report also notes that if those things don't work, the federal government should look into limiting what types of validation methods get used for cryptocurrencies. So that might not necessarily be the first step that's taken in terms of eliminating proof of work, but it's clear that given the environmental and energy impacts, even our federal government is thinking that might be where we have to take. Well, Tim and I have asked the question to a few people at this point, why can't the Bitcoin block?",https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dp8PhLsUcFE,5667,2022-10-22 17:39:00
17262," That's the question to a few people at this point. Why can't the Bitcoin blockchain also transition to proof of stake? And the answer we get is that you sacrifice security, you sacrifice other things. And basically the entire ecosystem has to agree, and they probably won't agree. And when you think about that, I mean, how do you respond to that? How do you go about campaigning that actually this is the white forward? Yeah. I won't disagree with like it would be complicated for the Bitcoin network to make a switch from proof of work to proof of stake. A lot of the arguments against proof of work through proof of stake regarding security and things like that, nonexper in these areas, I found a lot of them to be more philosophical and not actually based on the technology itself. I want to step back from the facts and talk about emotions because I've said this to Tim before, I tend not to like talking about energy uses and Bitcoin because it feels like there's so much emotion on both sides. Like it quickly devolves these discussions into people just talking back and forth. And I mean, from your stance at Earth, Justice, how do you navigate that and deal with, again, very hot emotions it can turn into on both sides? It is really tough emotions. I do have to say in the realm of environmental advocacy, it's not unusual, right? I do work around building electrification, for example, and people love their guestos. So there are a lot of emotions at play here. We try to keep things very based on the facts. And when it comes to the climate crisis, there's just such an urgency there. So that's why we're looking at this. We try our best to make it clear that we're not opposed to crypto. I think some of that sensitivity comes in is feeling like they're attacked, right? Because there are people who are very anti-crypto. And I think the perception is, oh, environmentalists are saying this is not a good use of energy. And it's not really that. It's pointing out this is very energy intensive. There are ways to do it that aren't. And we need to be doing this across the board when it comes to raining and energy consumption, right? Light fixtures. They're energy standards for light fixtures. They're energy standards for appliances. So that's the type of thing we need to look at for the cryptocurrency mining universe as well. OK, as painful as it was for another prop. I have another prop. No, you've no idea what's happening. It's not a photo of me. OK. As painful as it was for us to go and buy this, a single-use plastic water bottle. I have to ask, we're on the spectrum, something like this falls versus crypto. I mean, we're talking the entire spectrum here. Do you also have like a private jet? Well, the private jet would not fit in the room. Yeah, I tried to get one, but it was not approved. So which angle do you mean in terms of carbon impact, in terms of importance and addressing? I mean, I think if we look at it in a holistic way, right? The use of a single-use plastic bottle versus in the production that goes into it, then what happens to it after it gets recycled if it can get recycled. And that versus cryptocurrency industry in general, which one is worse, which one is more useful, which one has more utility? It's hard to weigh things in that manner, because both have serious impacts that we're seeking government to act on, right? So that single-use water bottle looks delicious. So it actually has government regulations that deal with the waste impact here, right? Certainly not enough, advocating for more. But for example, we're in New York. In New York, that has a 5 cent deposit on it. So that water bottle is much more likely to become another water bottle than a water bottle in like, I don't know, maybe like Missouri. So some other states? Well, they don't have a deposit law, right? Like the 5 cent fee, the idea is like, oh, that incentive is consumed by a recycling, right? So we have some kind of environmental standards for that water bottle. We want to do the same with cryptocurrency money right now. That really doesn't exist. It's a new industry that we're looking at. So we have to play catch up. So as we're going to speak to the CEO of Riot Blockchain, which of course operates into.",https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dp8PhLsUcFE,5668,2022-10-22 17:43:22
17263," It's a new industry that we're looking at. So we have to play catch up. So as we're going to speak to the CEO of Riot Blockchain, which of course operates in Texas. I said a lot of issues with energy uses in general, but also with crypto mining. What would you say to him? So Texas has been dealing with a number of issues related to the grid where there have been major power outages. Crypto companies have contracts to turn off when there's high energy demand. So something I would ask is, you know, what could be done to reduce energy consumption and make sure that they're 100% powered by renewable energy off the grid to make sure there aren't strains on the grid and that consumers utility bills don't go up because that has been happening in places across the country where you have these high energy users leading to so much energy consumption that everyday homeowners are paying more on their bills. So I'd be really curious to hear what her thoughts on that. Like as a business hopefully looking to do good in his community, how does he want to work with regulators to address that? Is that a line of messaging that you've thought about in terms of communicating this to the general public? Like, you know, I don't want to call it an attack ad necessarily, but couldn't, if it's indeed the case, couldn't you come out and say, crypto mining is leading to higher energy bills for the normal everyday person? Like, is that actually happening? Yeah, so this is something that we do talk about. Very often we don't get to point it out when it happens to these communities. People notice, so Plattsburg, New York, ended up addressing cryptocurrency mining in their community because they had like shipping containers of crypto mining industry that came into town. They get a lot of hydro, that's what keeps energy ruby cheap in Plattsburg. And what happened was energy bills started going up because the crypto mining company was using so much energy, they're kind of using the reserve of hydro powers. They were having to supplement their grid with more expensive energy, which is fossil fuels. So they're grid got dirtier and their bills went up because they had to supplement with more energy. So it kind of triggered an outrage right away. So in some ways, we don't even need to talk about it. When it happens, people notice, but it is something that we do talk about with the public that when miners are plugging directly into the grid, it can lead to utility bill hikes. This man, thanks a lot for hanging out with us, IRL. Yeah, thanks for having the IRL. Whether you get your news on TV, look like they break up on the radio.

17264," After decades of stagnation, Japan's leaders are forging a more innovative and sustainable path forward to revitalize the nation. Corporate giants, policymakers and pioneers tell us how they're doing just that. Every week on Japan ahead, right here on Bloomberg Television. Jason, good to see you. Jason, I feel like we can't have this conversation about energy rate at this moment without talking about proof of work versus proof of stake. Because Ethereum, that blockchain, just got a lot of press about the fact that it did switch to proof of stake. And the number we keep hearing is that that cut its energy usage by 99%. And we've asked this question in a few different ways to few different people. But I'd love to hear your thoughts on why Bitcoin can't just switch from proof of work to proof of stake. Yeah, a couple of thoughts come to mind on that topic. First, yeah, I've seen the same statistic that Ethereum has reduced its energy consumption by 99% by switching a proof of stake. But the fact is that energy consumption is still there. Ethereum might not be using it in the form of its consensus system, but all the GPUs out there that we're mining for Ethereum now are just going to do something else. They're going to mine another coin. They're going to be sold to gamers. They're going to be used for AI, machine learning. The price of these things didn't go to zero. So the energy consumption net net hasn't changed whatsoever. Proof of work drives security for something so important as money. Proof of stake maybe works for other applications, but Bitcoin will never change from proof of work to proof of stake. If anyone wanted to make that change, the development of Bitcoin is completely open. Someone could propose that code and they could see the consensus that it reaches. I'm optimistic it won't get much. Let's put that on the record. Bitcoin never going to go to proof of stake. We have established that. Interview over. Done. Done. No, not done. We're not done. So are those stats about crypto using more energy each year than the entire country of Argentina or one Bitcoin transaction? The power that it takes to do one of those, powering more than 50, one home for 50 days, one American home for 50 days. Are those stats just bunk? Transactions do not have an energy payload. Bitcoin mining is separate from transaction verification process and et cetera. In Bitcoin mining, we are simply putting work behind each new block we add to the blockchain within that block are new transactions. So if you're going to verify through node software that I can use, you can use anyone can use that it's help driving that peer-to-peer network. So the number of the amount of energy that Bitcoin mining uses is not related to transactions in any ways. It's all consensus system driven. Okay, so maybe maybe somebody who would criticize what you're doing would say something, you know, something along the lines of, okay, we need AI. We need a traditional financial system. It's nice to be able to have gaming. Those are all justifiable in the sense of energy consumption. Photos all go together.",https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dp8PhLsUcFE,5670,2022-10-22 17:52:12
17265," system, it's nice to be able to have gaming. Those are all justifiable in the sense of energy consumption. But they might say, I don't necessarily agree with the concept of creating this alternative money, the idea that the world needs this. What would you say to people like that? I'd say that's an interesting take in the environment that we're in, where our wealth is inflated away entirely outside of our control, our ability to transact with each other is controlled by third parties, whether it's businesses, governments, some collection of governments, what have you. I think a number of recent events have made the use case for Bitcoin more than ever. Money is the number one way that we communicate with each other. Tim and Katie, I could say something to you. You could say something to me. But we are only truly honest with how we spend our dollars. People ultimately vote with their pocketbook. They ultimately vote with their feet. And Bitcoin enables humans globally to communicate that way in commerce and what have you without third parties controlling that. That is very important to human freedom. And that is very important to the advancement of humans globally. So it is a very important and noble use of energy that Bitcoin has. It is giving freedom globally to everyone, giving the individual sovereign control over their money. Jason, I'm wondering if the bet gets harder to justify, though, in an environment where we're seeing the worst energy crisis that we've seen in decades. You're in California, but a lot of your operation is in Texas. I mean, wouldn't we hear from California just recently? Don't charge your cars because the grid can't handle it. Even the Texas grid asking some Bitcoin miners to go offline when it got hot so that people would be able to use their air conditioners. And the load on the grid would be limited. Does it get harder to justify this in an environment like this? It actually gets easier. When you look at these energy markets, something a lot of people don't understand necessarily is how their energy grid works. People think maybe there's energy being produced somewhere, and we're just all buying it as we need it. But in a transition to more renewable generation sources, that supply of energy is very volatile. Wind generation is only generating wind power when the wind is blowing. Solar generation is only generating solar power when the sun is shining. So those are not necessarily always correlated to when the demand for energy is. So Bitcoin miners play a very important role by what's known as valley filling by being a constant demand for power that does not impact the peak demand because as you noted Tim, we are shutting off when either the grid is calling on demand response or the economics are simply invoking that response itself. By being by valley filling and being this constant demand, we help give renewable generation sources greater visibility in their financing. And we help make all generation cost effective and efficient. We're eliminating the volatility in power demand, which make the miners are becoming Irkott's most trusted demand resource. And it was even Irkott interim CEO himself who said earlier this year that Bitcoin miners are helping Irkott keep renewable generation operational. Because a lot of that power is often curtailed because there's not an off-taker for it. And interesting stat for you, there was about 7.4 terawatt hours in West Texas where a lot of wind and solar generation is that was curtailed over 2021. There was no one to buy it and there was no way to transmit it. So there's a lot of inefficiencies in the power markets out there when you have a lot of renewable generation that is intermittent and not always match with demand. Bitcoin miners help level out that demand, keep the grid in the right frequency and we do not impact the peak because we are participating in demand response and shedding off in demand. We were talking about just the whole concept of this program today and we were thinking, OK, if we're talking.",https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dp8PhLsUcFE,5671,2022-10-22 17:56:20

We were thinking, OK, if we're talking Texas, we're talking energy, we're talking mining here and extracting some sort of resource, we thought of the TV show Dallas from the 80s. You thought of it. I had not heard of it. And I'm wondering if you consider yourself, like if Dallas were made today, would you be the J.R. Ewing of Texas in 2022? So Tim, I'm going to have to watch that show. I knew it. I knew it. I knew it. Thank you. But you myself, that way or not. I'm not familiar with the show. That makes two of us. Yeah, I see. Jason, good to see you. Thanks for joining us. Good to see you. Thank you, Tim and Katie. Are we in energy show now? Or are we really done with the energy discussions? We are done. I can guarantee you that our next show is not about energy.

Part of what I love about business is you get to build things from nothing. I don't have any investors. All this is all money and this is me just building. It's pretty much full service shadow banking with nobody in charge. Listen to Bloomberg Radio wherever you are online at BloombergRadio.com and around the globe, the other Bloomberg Business app. What are the moonshots at Amazon that are capturing most of your time and attention? Well, you know, we have a unique way that we go get big new investments. And I'm not sure it's right or wrong. It just happens to be our way. And we ask ourselves when we're considering something for questions. We ask if it's successful, could be big and move the needle in Amazon? Is it being well served today? Do we have a differentiated approach? And do we have confidence there? And if not, can we acquire quickly? If we like the answer to those questions, we'll go pursue it with a single threaded team that isn't distracted by the rest of the business. When it comes to the stock, it has fallen significantly. Do you think investors are missing something or has tech just been overvalued? I have never tried to predict what stocks might do. In any time I've tried to a little bit, I've been wrong. I do really believe that in the short term, the stock market tends to be a voting machine. And the long term tends to be a waiting machine. We have a concept we talk about a lot of Amazon inputs and outputs. And the ultimate output for a company is share price. And then other big outputs are free cash flow or profit or revenue. You can't really manage the outputs. You have to manage at the input level. And that's where we spend all our time. And so if you do the right things for the business long term, things tend to work out. I think we've had very good returns for investors. And I expect that to be true again. I think we've had a lot of good returns. Imagine simply climbing a cable into space. The concept is known as the space elevator.

17267," The concept is known as the space elevator. Not only could it significantly change how we leave planet Earth, but it could also completely transform humanity's relationship with space. And there are scientists who think we could have already built it. We have the material, we have the technology, we have the lasers, we have the climbers, we have all of it. If a private entity wants to build it or a government, they could build it. It will change society. We have no clue how colonizing in the space, how really spreading out in the space, really change our society over the next 50 to 200 years. It will be completely different. Hello and welcome to Emma Barnett Neats. And this week I'm meeting the space experts and physicist Professor Brian Cox. And I'm really looking forward to asking him about how he gets his head around the vastness of space and to explain it to all of us or try to anyway. How he also goes about his daily life when he knows how insignificant we really are and what he makes of NASA's new telescope and those amazing images. Welcome to the programme. Thank you so much for coming to talk to me and to all of our viewers. And I actually wanted to start with a new NASA telescope. We'll come to your project in a moment. It's named after the man who ran the agency in the 60s and oversaw the first man mission to the moon, James Webb. What do you make of what we're seeing so far? It's pretty incredible. Yes, a remarkable instrument. You think of the predecessor, which is the Hubble Space Telescope. I think it's almost impossible to imagine a world without that. Even if you don't know the images that we're familiar with at the universe, many of them, the spectacular galaxies in star-forming regions, they're from Hubble. But the Webb is a significant step forward. And technically, one of the most important things is that it can see what we call longer wavelength light, or infrared light. And that's important because if you think about, we want to see the first galaxies forming. So we want to understand how the first stars and galaxies formed in the universe. And so what you do is you look far out into the universe, and because light travels quite slowly across cosmic distances. Let's say you have a galaxy that's the most distant one you can see with the naked eye. It's about 2 million light years away. So that means that the light has been traveling for 2 million years to reach us. And it's a remarkable thing, actually, to think when you look, it's called the Andromeda Galaxy. And if you know where you're looking, you can just catch you out of the corner of your eye. If you think about it, you're seeing that as it was 2 million years ago. Yes, although I don't. Because it takes a light 2 million years to travel. I don't like being late to information, so that makes me feel very out of date. It's remarkable. I mean, it began its journey before we had evolved on Earth. So in its time, it took, and that's the nearest neighbouring galaxy. The Webb looks so far out that it's capturing light that's been traveling for over 13 billion years. But the universe has been expanding, and so the light has been stretching. And so for the most distant galaxies, we're looking back, back in time, almost to the big bang. Then the Hubble was not sensitive to that light. So that the Webb can see the formation of the first galaxies. It's essentially looking all the way back to very close to the beginning of time. And that's very important, because we're not entirely sure exactly how those first galaxies form. The idea of what you just talked about in terms of how much time this has taken and what it's covering. Do you think we will ever be able to see the big bang? Well, we almost can. It's not the Webb telescope. There's something called the Cosmic Microwave Background Radiation, which is light that was emitted in the universe. And it's a very precise number. It's 380,000 years after the big bang. Which is not very long at all. The universe is 13.8 billion years old. So we can see that. It's microwaves, because it's been stretched so much by the experiments.",https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dp8PhLsUcFE,5673,2022-10-22 18:05:05
17268," which is not very long at all, about the universe is 13.8 billion years old. So we can see that. It's microwaves because it's been stretched so much by the expansion of the universe. Going back that the problem with light is that in those earliest times, the universe was so hot and so dense that light couldn't travel through it. So it was opaque. So you can't use light to go back earlier than that. But what we can potentially do, not yet, we're not good enough yet. But the technology we use to now to detect colliding black holes, which is another remarkable thing, but I'll leave that one aside for now. But we have the technology to do that. And that technology possibly could allow us to probe right back to this thing, the big bang. And again, whether or not that's the origin of time, we can talk about as well. Brian, you've dedicated your life to explaining the scale of the universe to people. You have a new world tour and show called Horizons. What's the goal? Are you trying to teach people new things and understand the world they're living in better? Or what are you aiming for? Well, actually, all those things. So it works. I hope on different levels. So I talk about cosmology. So we've spoken about what we call the large scale structure of the universe. So the galaxies and how they formed, how the universe has evolved since the big bang. But also, I've got very interested in my academic work in black holes. And black holes, and they're really evocacy things. I think everyone's heard of these strange things, these totally collapsed stars from which nothing apparently can escape. But in the past few years, past few decades, really, beginning work that Stephen Hawking really began back in the 1970s and many others. And we've begun to suspect there's a lot more to them. And they've started forcing us to reassess our understanding of what space and time are. And that's a really weird sentence. You might think, well, space is the arena in which we live and time just ticks. But it really isn't. It looks like, from studying these things, there are building blocks of space and building blocks of time. And what I say in the show is, that's a mind-blowing idea. And I talk about that. But the key point is, there's a great quote from Einstein, a beautiful story that Einstein told about when he was a little boy, he was six or seven years old. And his dad gave him a compass. And so he looked at the compass and he saw, well, there's this thing, this needle and it always points north, points in this direction. So there's something invisible that I can't see that underlies our reality that's making this needle point nor any said later in life. It was my first encounter with an idea, which is if you look at nature carefully and really pay attention and you're lucky, you can catch a glimpse of something deeply hidden. It's a beautiful phrase, something deeply hidden, which is the deep structure of reality. That's what our reality is. And so black holes, they're kind of a metaphor in a way. I talk about them as rosetta stones in the sky. They're the things that, by studying them, and you say, why would we study these things? Well, in studying these things, we're beginning to get a deep, a deep picture of what our reality actually is. And that's a remarkable idea. But it's a beautiful idea that runs through all of science. How do you define a black hole? Well, it's in Einstein's theory, which again, it's a remarkable thing. It's published in 1950, you know, over 100 years old. But it's just a region of space from which even light can't escape.

You want to write your resume for robots, not for humans. The only job your resume has is to be comprehensible to the software that is reading it because that software or robot is going to decide whether or not a human ever gets their eyes on it. These things are programmed by a certain segment of the population that might not be totally inclusive or not be all fully aware. Concerns about how this technology could exacerbate discrimination. For the FTC, I think foremost, the FTC needs to be making sure that we're fully understanding this technology. We don't trust companies to self-regulate when it comes to pollution. We don't trust them to self-regulate when it comes to workplace comp. Why on earth would we trust them to self-regulate AI? And by understanding what they are and knowing more about them, what do we then learn? Stephen Hawking, back in the 70s, published a paper. The initial one was called Black Hole Explosions. It was just a great title for a paper. He calculated that Black holes in his language. He said, Black holes ain't so black. They glow in the sky, like holes in the sky, and they radiate. So over time, they lose energy and mass and ultimately disappear of a huge time scales. And that's so important. I show this picture in the show that if you go into Westminster Abbey and look on the floor of Westminster Abbey on Stephen's memorial stone, then you find his equation for the temperature of a Black Hole literally chiseled into stone on the floor of an Abbey. So you might say, why? Why is it so important? This was the key. This was this Rosetta Stone idea. In trying to understand what happens to the stuff that fell in. When you thought these things existed forever, which is pre-horking, then you think, well, it's okay. It gets lots of inside. It can never get out. We don't care. But the thing evaporates away. One day it will be gone. So then suddenly you have to be faced with this question, what happened to everything then? If I throw a book into a Black Hole, is it somehow possible in the far future of you collect all this so-called Hawking Radiation that comes off? Is it possible to reconstruct the information in the book? And that's been a question, simple question that's driven, this tremendous amount of research for 50 years. And it was pretty much sold in 2019, actually, in 2020. Pretty much. I mean, there's still a huge number of questions. But roughly, well, the statement is, everything comes out. Again, all the information comes out. So everything that fell in, in principle, in the far future, you could reconstruct the information of everything that fell in. It's just an astonishing idea. Because the last thing I'll say is that before that, before the Hawking papers and before this modern understanding, inside a Black Hole, just according to Einstein, sits the end of time, which is an astonishing thing to say. Because we can see them. We have a photograph of one of these things in the center of a galaxy, too, actually. And you're lucky, when you look at that photograph, you're looking at the end of time in space. So then you think, well, if things go to the end of time, how does everything get out again? And that's the content of this tremendous work in theoretical physics. And this work, studying Black holes, which is probably, it's one of those things that a certain kind of person says is useless, right? He said, why? Who cares? It turns out that the techniques that have been developed and the understanding that's being gained from looking at these things has got a very...",https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dp8PhLsUcFE,5675,2022-10-22 18:13:41
17270," Why? Who cares? It turns out that the techniques that have been developed and the understanding that's been gained from looking at these things has got a very strong crossover with building quantum computers, right, which is the quantum computers are in laboratories now. They have a tremendous potential to revolutionise our civilization, incredibly powerful computer devices. Yes, and also that's sometimes the defence given isn't it about what's going into man going back to the moon or woman going back to the moon. The other things are discovered in the pursuit of those missions. Yeah, I mean it's always a cliche but it's true, a friend of mine, an astronomer always says, when people criticise these spacecraft and they say, you know, let's say the James Webb Space Telescope is what, six billion dollars or so. But it's appropriate to point out that nobody puts six billion dollars in a suitcase and launched it on the rocket and the six billion dollars didn't go into space. It was spent on earth. And what is often the case, it put inside the glory and wonder of the discoveries that are made that basically you're paying people to do high tech jobs and do research and build machines that operate at the edge of the possible. And history tells us that that tends to be extremely useful. You're inventing things and trying to do things that are difficult and that expertise never stays in one place. It then spreads out across our civilization in ways that you can't really predict or even quantify. Indeed, and you did sound very excited early. I mean you sound excited the whole time about all of this, which is infectious even if you know people are trying to keep up including myself. But when you talk about the golden possibility of there being life out there and that question of are we alone? Where are you with that? What do you say to people right now with the latest information? Well, so this again, I think there's a in cosmology, I say this in the show as well. It's one of the most challenging subjects because at one level it makes us feel very, very small and insignificant. And it's true, you know, physically. I mean the earth is one planet around one star amongst 400 billion stars in one galaxy amongst two trillion galaxies in the part of the universe we can see. So we're definitely small, right? You can't argue that. Yes, you've clarified. But, but, but, you're right, if you have the question about life, the answer is we don't know, we've found nothing, nothing alive beyond the earth. But I've missed it that we haven't been very far or looked tremendously hard, although we are looking hard now on Mars because we suspect there might have been microbes on Mars because there was one's water on Mars and it was geologically active. And all the things that we think led to the origin of life on Earth were present on Mars around the same time about three and a half to four billion years ago. So we wouldn't be surprised if we find that microbes existed, probably sub-surface on Mars, or maybe on some of the moons of Jupiter or Saturn where there's water today. However, nobody expects anything more complicated than a microbe. And it's interesting. So if you look at the history of life on Earth, you have microbes around 3.8 billion years ago, pretty much not longer to the earth formed in geological time. But if you look for evidence of complex life on Earth, then really there isn't any in the fossil record until about 600 million years ago or so. So on this planet, for most of the history of the planet, there was slime, basically single-celled things, doing interesting stuff, photosynthesis and things, but nothing more complicated than a single cell. And it's only in the last half a billion years or so that you get this explosion of life on Earth. And only as I said, it's only in the last, less than a million years that we've had home-usapiens on Earth, and in the last 10 to 1000s of years we've had a civilization. So here, it took pretty much four billion years to go from cell to civilization. And that's the third of the age of the universe. And so that leads many biologists that I speak to to suggest that whilst microbes might be common, civilizations might be...",https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dp8PhLsUcFE,5676,2022-10-22 18:17:57
17271," And that's the third of the age of the universe. And so that leads many biologists that I speak to to suggest that whilst microbes might be common, civilizations might be rare. Actually, I asked a friend of mine at Great Physician Carol, how many civilizations do you think there will be in a Milky Way galaxy? Typical galaxy. How many in a typical galaxy? And he said, non. Non. And I think he's, I tend to say one. So somewhere between zero and one probably. But that's a guess. But what do you, do you want me to say? I think it's a good guess. Brian, is that what it is? You sound like perhaps you have an optimism for it. And I wonder what's underpinning that? I would love that to be. And actually, because it worries me, and this is the way that I end my show, actually. It worries me that let's take that position. Let's imagine that in our galaxy, 400 billion suns, there's just us that thinks. My crops are all over the place. But in terms of things that think and can feel, and in a very real sense, bring meaning to the universe. All these things we've talked about, the beauty of these galaxies, they're not beautiful. If there's nothing there to perceive them, they're just galaxies. So if that's it in this galaxy, then the decisions that we make now as a civilization have a galactic implications. We destroy ourselves, for example, deliberately or through inaction. Then it's possible that we eliminate meaning, perhaps forever, in a galaxy of 400 billion stars. And so that's it. I think that leads you to, it's a good work in assumption that we have a tremendous responsibility, in a sense, not to do that. So I would be much more comfortable with our current predicament. If the galaxy was filled with civilizations, then I'd say, well, OK, it would be rather stupid of us to eliminate all this beautiful culture and science and art and music that we build up. But at least there's someone else that's doing that. But I'm not actually sure there is. So, Just by thisember, we'll meet again again on the planet base. The tag on the product may read made in the USA, but the sign on the CEO's door often says made in India. AlphaBets Sundart Pichai, Microsoft Sacha Nadella, IBM's Arvind Krishna, Micron Technologies Sanjay Mayhotra, and that's just the start. We've added the chief executives of Adobe, Deloitte, Gap, VMware, and that doesn't count Indians running companies all over the world. Why have so many Indians risen to the top? For no coastal points to India's incredibly competitive education system, if you can survive the pressure it takes to get into one of the Indian Institutes of Technology, it gives you confidence to handle American universities and later the business world. Meanwhile, the belief in India's ability to produce so many tech wizards is reinforced every year. Indians make up about three-fourths of the immigrants receiving coveted H1B visas for the US, and it's a safe bet that some of them will eventually find their way to the seasweet. How comfortable are you with space tourism and the pursuit of that knowledge and meaning being left largely to a very small group of rich men? The right, the idea that technology is used, if all it was useful, it was to send a few very, very rich people into space on a joyride, then there will be real criticism there, but that's not all the technology is useful. I think it's important to understand that the space industry is about operating initially in near-earth orbits, and we've already industrialized that. We all use it every day.",https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dp8PhLsUcFE,5677,2022-10-22 18:22:22
17272," is about operating initially in near-earth orbits. And we've already industrialized that. You know, we all use it every day. I mean, we all switch on our sat nav in the car, satellite navigation. It requires infrastructure in orbit. A lot of the stuff we know about climate change, resource use and so on, that's coming from satellites. So I think you have to look at the space industry as a whole, really, and then say, well, it's not just about, the same argument was made for intercontinental travel by aircraft. And when the first, it's true, when the first aircraft were built, it was extremely expensive in the preserve of the rich. But of course, within a few decades, it had democratized travel. And we all take advantage of that every day. So I think that's the right way to look at space. It's not to focus on particular bits of it that we might not like for moral reasons or whatever it is. So it's actually, I really do advocate for the fact of looking at the whole industry, which is tremendously important now. It is. I mean, I am interested, though, that you did say, and correct me if I'm wrong, that all political leaders should go to space, perhaps for some perspective. Did you say, do you still think that? Most of them should come back. Most of them. Most of them. They're all right. That's the last part of that quote. Yeah. And yeah, it was, that was, it was, it based on an idea, which is a very famous idea called the overview effect, which is well known. The astronauts change their view of the, or always, as far as I'm aware, anyway, that when they come back, they have a more positive view of the value of this planet and are very much more focused on preserving it as a beautiful place, perhaps a unique place in a galaxy, as I said. So I felt that, and I do feel that, that having had the, the good fortune of speaking to many astronauts, that experience, for the people who make the decisions, the big decisions of our future, could have that experience. I think would be good investments. It's extremely hard arguments to make, you know, that we could, we should actually spend money allowing, you know, in our case, at the moment, in our Prime Minister, right? So in the UK, you'd say, well, we just spend money sending Boris Johnson into space, and bringing him back safely to Earth again, because it would change his view. Now, I don't think I win that argument. You know? No, but, but I think it's a serious point there, which is that it does seem to change people for the better when they see our Earth as it really is, which is a fragile thing against the blackness of space. So I think it's an argument that I would, I would try to make, I would lose it, because it's very expensive. Do you want to go? Are you willing to go? I would love to, because as I said, I'd love to share that experience of seeing our world from space. I think it's really unarguably. It appears to be a life-changing experience, and it seems to change individuals for the better. You won't be scared. Well, I don't know. I mean, I remember one of my great heroes, John Young, who flew on the Apollo missions, walked on the moon, test flew the first space shuttle. And he said that anyone who sits on top of, however many thousands of tons of liquid hydrogen, helium, liquid hydrogen oxygen, and isn't a bit worried, doesn't understand the problem. LAUGHTER No, it's probably right. Do you have people come and talk to you about faith? Do they talk to you about how religion and that side of life fits into your level of knowledge? Because I know you've traveled around the world talking to people. Yeah, a lot. It comes up as a question. Because cosmology is the science of origins. And actually, with the study of black holes, I mentioned, we're even beginning now to think about what space and time are. So naturally, I say in the show, actually, I say when we're talking about this, it's the moment of creation. So we're asking, was there a moment of creation? And that's the correct language to use, I think. Or it's the vocative language, but it's really what we're talking about.",https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dp8PhLsUcFE,5678,2022-10-22 18:26:42
17273," creation, if that was. So we're asking, was there a moment of creation? And that's the correct language to use, I think. Or it's the vocative language, but it's really what we're talking about. Did everything come into being or has it always been here? We actually don't even know the answer to that question really. And so yeah, I can ask you a lot because I think cosmology is a challenging science that challenges us to think about these things. We often associate that with theology or philosophy. And I think that's a good thing because something I very strongly believe in is that segmenting or making little canisters and putting different bits of human experience sort of different music and art and theology and philosophy and science and segmenting them all is just the wrong way to look at it. What we're doing is a deep level trying to understand what it means to be human in this tremendous potentially infinite universe. And so I, those questions get asked. And ultimately, I say I'm quite straightforward. I say I don't, I'm not a religious person myself, but the correct thing to say, even about the question, did the universe have a beginning in time is we don't know. I don't know. And that's it.

Bloomberg Wall Street week live Friday with replays all weekend on Bloomberg television and radio. No one covers the world like Bloomberg because Trussonomics is being dismantled. MPs behind the scenes are asking what's the point of having her at the top? In the strong dollar, amplified world's risks of instability. She didn't pay me a complete reunification must be realized. With unmatched reach and resources from more than 120 countries, the moment news breaks 24 hours a day. Bloomberg, your global business authority. When you think of cutting edge technology at sea, you might be thinking of stuff like this. But there's an incoming revolution on high seas that isn't quite as sexy but could be significantly more impactful. But there's a significant unseen cost to the modern era of global commerce. About 3% of all the world's CO2 emissions come from shipping. With a spring can take place, for at least a wartime purchase of $10,3.",https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dp8PhLsUcFE,5679,2022-10-22 18:31:06
17274," But there's a significant unseen cost to the modern era of global commerce. About 3% of all the world's CO2 emissions come from shipping. 3% may not sound like a lot, but that's roughly comparable to the entire CO2 output of Germany. Since reducing trade isn't a likely option, what about a technological improvement? To help reduce the emissions from these well-stocked maritime behemoths. It seems like everything is going green these days. But there's one mode of transportation that seems to be clinging to the traditional fuel loving waves. And while commercial aviation has made strides through smarter design and cleaner engines, many of those gains have been nullified by more air traffic. The challenge is enormous. This is a large industry. It will take decades to convert. The good news is that we will have a solution as early as three years out that people can get into and start moving zero emission. And it turns out that the solution could be all around us. Hygien is the most abundant element in the universe. And so if you had to use something, it would be great. The only product of the chemical reaction between Hygien and Oxygen is water. We looked at the fundamentals of what it would require to take an aircraft, up in the air of significant size over significant distance, commercially relevant. You get to hydrogen fuel cell being the best approach from the cost of fuel, efficiency of utilization of the fuel, and the mitigation of the climate effects. Serial clean-tech entrepreneur Val Miftikoff started zero-avio following his previous success in the EV charging industry. So the beauty about hydrogen in general is that the energy density of hydrogen as fuel is actually three times better than jet fuel. So you can see any size of aircraft going for any distance that jet fuel aircraft can go over time. It will just take significant amount of time to get the industry over, but this technology can scale to all sizes of aircraft that we use in commercial service. Zero-avio uses a hydrogen fuel cell to produce electricity to turn a propeller. Unlike a traditional engine which uses combustion to create energy, a fuel cell generates electricity through an electrochemical reaction. In this case, hydrogen and oxygen are combined to generate electricity, heat, and water. Zero-avio has flown a six-seater aircraft on a hydrogen fuel cell, a world first. Now they're aiming bigger at 20 seats. That's technically commercial. One side of the aircraft, the left side, will replace the engine with our power plants. We still got the normal engine on the right side. And part of this is, you know, innovation. You want to ramp up a East profile in meaningful steps. So anything happens. We have the second engine. But even in the first flight desk campaign, what we're planning to do is to demonstrate operation of this aircraft, pure-alone zero-emission power on the left side engine. Once we take off, we're able to switch over to completely zero-emission power. Hydrogen is used throughout all sections of a flight that maximizes the efficiency of the entire operation. That reduces the weight, provides for best sort of mission capabilities, payload, and range. Building power plants and fuel cells is one thing. Creating a whole new infrastructure for supplying hydrogen is something entirely different. And all the motive, the big part of the reason why hydrogen did not take off is...",https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dp8PhLsUcFE,5680,2022-10-22 18:35:17
17275," The first applying hydrogen is something entirely different. In automotive, the big part of the reason why hydrogen did not take off is because the fueling infrastructure needs to be so distributed. Let's say the United States, you have 100,000 fueling stations. Compare that with aviation where 95% or more traffic in the United States is concentrated in 100 locations. That's a three-order magnitude difference, which makes build out of the infrastructure much simpler. It's much larger, much more concentrated stations, but there's much fewer in quantity. Calling it simpler might be underselling the challenge of distributing hydrogen, which unlike other fuels that can be easily transported in liquid form, is usually found instead in a gaseous state. How do you get the hydrogen from point eight to point B? We don't have pipelines for moving hydrogen around. We don't have all the specialized trucks to move them around. So we got thinking we need a solution that can be a low capital expenditure solution. And that's the genesis of the company. Jumpall Clark is the co-founder and chief innovation officer of Universal Hydrogen, a startup that is designed a modular tank system for the domestic turboprop market. Like Zura Avia, it allows for retrofitting planes already in use. Each module has two capsules. And so what we do is load it into the aircraft as if it was cargo, strap it down, connect it to the aircraft, close the loading door, and that will be it. When you get to your destination, you basically unload it, put it back in a truck, send it back to the production site to get refilled. We needed to basically come up with something that could both fit in containers and also fit in the aircraft, not require increases in the maximum takeoff way through the aircraft. This compromise is one of the biggest hurdles that may prevent widespread adoption of hydrogen. Obviously you're going to have to take out some seats because the energy density of hydrogen is less than jet fuel, and you can store it in the wings practically. So you're going to have to take away some space in the fuselage. In the ultra fine margins of aviation, removing 10 to 20% of your seats is a tough ask. But that hasn't deterred startups like Zura Avia or Universal Hydrogen. The maintenance costs of a fuel cell motor system goes down, and it goes down significantly. Because motors and fuel cells have much fewer moving parts than a gas turbine engine. So the wear and tear is much lower, and therefore the time between overhaul is longer. So when you put all that together, our numbers indicate that the chasm, cost for available seat mile, actually goes down slightly or is at the worst equivalent to what you have now. So what you will have is a smaller cabin, a smaller number of seats. However, the cost for each of those seats to operate it is the same or better with the hydrogen. We make it very transparent to the shopper before they accept an order. What the order is going to look like, how much we're going to pay them and how much the consumer is paying them. And so they can decide whether they take an order or whether they refuse it. And that's a kind of flexibility. That's our shoppers really value and the kind of transparency that they want. Are you seeing a labor shortage right now? And what are you doing to combat that? It's different in different places. Or demographic of shoppers is completely different from food delivery and our right sharing. We're 70% women and half of them are moms. And that's because a lot of the job at Instacart is very different and just being in a car with strangers. It's about like going to the store, doing a good job of customer service of really picking the right products for the consumer. And we are seeing that being very appealing to women.",https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dp8PhLsUcFE,5681,2022-10-22 18:39:37
17276," for the consumer and we are seeing that being very appealing to women. No one covers the world like Bloomberg. The pressure cooker just got far too hot in banning them for the government to handle. You foresee two-thirds of the crypto hedge funds will disappear. Are we close? The European Union will support and defend Ukraine's territorial integrity. With unmatched reach in resources from more than 120 countries, the moment news breaks 24 hours a day. Bloomberg, you are global business authority. Like ZeroAvia, Universal Hydrogen is also working on engines. Successfully testing their two megawatt ironbird that will allow them to retrofit planes carrying up to 55 passengers. ZeroAvia is aiming for their first commercial hydrogen electric flight. Between London and Rotterdam with their 19-seater by around 2024. But much like the range anxiety that has plagued some battery-powered electric vehicles on land, hydrogen fuel cells are also fairly limited. At this point, they still don't have the capacity to power a common 100-pastur jet. Beyond fuel cells, however, there is another hope for our lightest most abundant element. Burning. The first Ureqa moment I suppose is when we source steam and exhaust because we are thinking to ourselves, we're burning something here when we're producing absolutely no CO2. An expert in gas turbine combustion, Professor Bobby Saty leads research at Kranfield University in the UK. Built on a former RAF base, the college runs multiple aeronautical programs. But what Bobby is focused on is burning hydrogen as cleanly as possible. So what we're trying to demonstrate in this rig is how we can conceive some hydrogen combustion technologies that can be integrated in the next generation aircraft engines, which will deliver not to only low zero CO2 emissions, but also ultra-low NOx emissions. Knox or nitrogen oxides are a significant source of air pollution globally. They're the dirty particulates that cause smog in cities, usually spat out by diesel cars, scooters and buses. Hydrogen is characterized by much wider flammability limits, which means we can go to much leaner combustion and as a result we can burn at much lower flame temperatures and that's better for reducing NOx emissions. Going leaner means burning fuel with an excess of air in the engine. Using something like gasoline, lean burn emits far fewer hydrocarbons. Doing it with hydrogen also delivers cleaner emissions. While NOx is a pollutant, hydrogen combustion produces up to 90% less nitrogen oxide than caracene. So while burning hydrogen isn't technically as clean as using it inside a fuel cell, it's still a huge improvement over jet fuel. Unfortunately, like any radically new idea, there are other potential byproducts of the process that aren't fully yet understood. Knox is clearly one of the main emissions we need to consider, but the aviation communities also are asking themselves and the community in general what about all the waterway permissions? And some studies have shown, albeit there's still a large degree of uncertainty about it, that controls and serious clouds that may be induced from controls could contribute to global warming about four times a month than CO2 does. We know that if we're going to be burning hydrogen, we're going to produce much larger amount of waterway permissions. And if we are going to be producing a much larger amount of waterway permissions, then the propensity for contrail formation is also going to increase.",https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dp8PhLsUcFE,5682,2022-10-22 18:43:57
17277," We pay emissions. And if we are going to be producing a much larger amount of water-based emissions, then the propensity for contra-information is also going to increase. In spite of all these challenges, hydrogen is being taken seriously by the broader industry. Companies like Universal Hydrogen and ZeroAvia are gaining the attention of investors looking for viable and eventually profitable solutions. Industry giant Airbus wants to introduce a hydrogen-powered passenger aircraft by 2035. Recently announcing plans to retrofit a gas guzzling superjumbo with a hydrogen burning engine. The modified aircraft will add a 5th engine, adapted for hydrogen, and will be mounted on the rear fuselage. The A380 is the largest passenger aircraft in existence, so it offers plenty of room to store the 400 kilograms of hydrogen. The company's designs for a blended wing concept to store extra hydrogen also offer a glimpse of our flying future. Apart from the complex engineering challenges faced by airplane manufacturers, there are also difficulties in production of hydrogen itself. Nowadays, most of the hydrogen used in fuel is derived by splitting it off from molecules of natural gas. But that requires a good deal of energy and also produces carbon dioxide. To make green hydrogen, the electricity used to run the electrolyzer must come from a renewable resource, which is currently a lot more expensive. As with any new technology, however, initial costs are daunting, but time may be the best remedy here. If you look at economics of hydrogen fuel production, for example, versus fossil fuels, for instance, the cost of hydrogen is all based on capital expense, and very little operating expense is sort of similar to solar power. You put solar panels out there, and they produce power for 20-25 years. The operating expense is relatively low. What that means is that as scale grows, as we've seen with the solar panels, the cost of output drops dramatically. So the first phase is not about the most efficient aircraft. It's not about the aircraft that will deliver the lowest NOx emissions. It's about demonstrating that we can carry hydrogen safely on board, we can burn it safely on board, and it can be used to fly a passenger aircraft. The key thing is that we don't try to put everything in the first generation, or we're just going to delay the entry into service, so to try and keep it as simple as possible. If there are some questions on the margin, they're all in the sort of business model and market adoption realm. It is very hard to create a technological argument, or impossible to create a technological argument that says, well, it's not going to work. Right, it is going to work. Back in 1997, I was interested in the following question, which is there are a bunch of the dinosaurs called SOROPOD dinosaurs, which had really long skinny necks, so Apatosaurus is an example. Now, I said really long skinny tails. So I made a computer model that showed that in fact the tail of these SOROPOD dinosaurs could actually act like a whip, a bullfip. Now, the way a bullfip makes that cracking noise is because the tip of the whip actually goes about twice the speed of sound. And that crack is a sonic boom. I think the way they got a date was to impress the females by making loud booms.",https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dp8PhLsUcFE,5683,2022-10-22 18:48:24
17278,"ension I've ever been cruising on a highway and wondered where the heck are all those trucks going. There's a behind the scenes world of logistics that makes virtually everything in our modern lives possible. Not only do we take it for granted, we're completely oblivious to its environmental cost. But thanks to a handful of companies, there's a hidden revolution happening that, as it turns out, is perfectly suited to delivering a cleaner future. For years, online or terrain and rapid home delivery have been booming. And thanks to the pandemic, this trend has evolved into a way of life. But what actually happens when I click that tempting button to buy, let's say, an old school, real hardcover book? For mighty Amazon, which tends to capture the lion's share of all book sales, they're crocked along with other books to one of several Amazon inbound fulfillment centers. Now the book is an Amazon's massive fulfillment network. Copies then journey along the so-called middle mile, and can be redistributed to any of the hundreds of smaller warehouses or nodes closer to customers in major population centers. The last step is the so-called last mile, how it gets to a buyer's home. The book might be sent to an Amazon delivery station and put in the back of a Mercedes-Brencher van and dropped off by Amazon itself at the customers front door. This system, while it's a marvel of modern-day logistics, still relies mostly on traditional combustion engine vehicles for middle and last mile delivery. As demand for rushed delivery rises, so does the number of gas-guzzling trucks hustling between warehouses? Environmental, it's one of the biggest issues there is, and the quicker that the globe can decarbonize transportation, the better it's going to be. So if you look at total greenhouse gas emissions in the U.S., about 28% of that is transportation. And of that chunk of the 28% about a quarter of it come from mean, even heavy-duty trucks, so middle mile and long haul trucking. If you really want to move the needle on carbon emissions, this is a really good place to look. So how do we solve this growing emissions problem and still satisfy our addiction to same-day delivery? As it turns out, the size, shape, and predictable limited range of these vehicles makes them the perfect candidate for a solution. I'm Dakota Semler, I'm the CEO and co-founder of XS Trucks, so we are a manufacturer of commercial electric vehicles. We manufacture trucks that are in the class five size all the way up to class eight regional haul tractors. And those are things like the UPS or FedEx stepvans that you see delivering packages every day. We actually started this because we were fleet operators ourselves. We had a fleet of medium-duty vehicles and we saw how challenging it was becoming to operate diesel vehicles. The technology exists to convert last mile fleets from diesel to electric batteries and the prices of those batteries have fallen dramatically in the last ten years and any routes that are around 200 miles or less are really ready to make that transition. So XS is trying to perfect the frame of the car, they call it the chassis. So this is everything is sort of underpinning the car, the electric motors, the battery pack, all the battery software and cooling and technology and kind of the brains of the car, if you will. And the business model is basically to sell that and let the end consumer dictate what goes on top. Our platform we call the X platform UPS is using an X platform with a parcel delivery fan body on top of it.",https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dp8PhLsUcFE,5684,2022-10-22 18:52:50
17279," consumer dictate what goes on top. Our platform we call the X platform UPS is using an X platform with a parcel delivery van body on top of it. Lumis, who operates an armored car fleet, uses the same exact X platform but with an armored body on top of it. Exos is currently making their modular battery packs here in Los Angeles, and the packs can be customized for specific applications. But while one big problem, vehicle cost is improving as battery prices continue to fall, there's still another major hurdle at the other end. The best way to describe the current state of charging infrastructure in the US is anemic. These companies don't want to build chargers unless they're electric vehicles, people don't want to buy electric vehicles unless there's chargers. That's a big problem for the personal EV space where range anxiety is often cited as a roadblock to mass adoption. But when it comes to delivery, there's a much simpler solution. When you think about last mile vehicles, they're not operating in different bases of operation. They actually return to the same depot every single night where they do their charging. Exos actually has a division helping fleets install that charging infrastructure. These fleets will actually bring their vehicles back to the yard, they charge them overnight, and then by the time morning rolls around for their next shift, those vehicles are fully charged, ready to go with the infrastructure that's on site. With pilot programs up and running with delivery giants, UPS, FedEx, and Amazon, Exos is quickly becoming a major contender in the electrification game. But there's another enormous part of this puzzle, which may end up eliminating more than just gasoline. So I'm got them, Narang. I'm the co-founder and CEO of Gatik. I'd Gatik, we do autonomous vehicles for the middle mile segment of the supply chain. Again, middle mile is one step back from last mile, trucking that goes from one factory or warehouse to another. The middle mile is evolving at a rapid pace, and with the pandemic, the middle mile segment of the supply chain was put into high gear. The prominence and the significance of the middle mile is only going to grow in the coming years. So Gatik is a really interesting company. What they're doing is trying to both make middle mile delivery autonomous and electric, so they're trying to move the ball in two ways here. What's really interesting with them is they focus specifically on a certain sector of users, namely large companies that have very fixed routes. Just as the predictable routes of shipping and delivery make electrification easier, they make autonomy a lot easier too. If your trucks are going the same way every single time, like Gatik's, that's a much easier puzzle for an AI to navigate. So what they do, they find the route they need to run, and they agonize over it for four to six weeks, just mapping it inside and out, figuring out where all the trouble spots might be, and coding their vehicles to deal with it. And often they're not taking the most direct route, they're taking the safest route, they're taking the route that's most predictable in terms of traffic. There's a common understanding in the industry that unprotected left turns and doing multiple lane changes are some of the most trickiest problems in the AV space. With middle mile, frankly, you can avoid all of that. You can take three right turns to make a left turn. You know, a bag of potatoes won't care. Gatik's ultimate goal is to provide a cheaper, cleaner alternative to the middle mile of today by saving money on gas and maintenance, by electric motors, and saving money on, well, drivers, by going autonomous. They've already sold some major players on their vision and scoring Walmart as a customer, oh it's well for the future. Startups like Gatik and Exos are betting that the delivery industry is ready for a full-on high-tech refit. In a sector where only about 1% of vehicles have been electrified, that's a lot of potential for change. You know, the usual suspects are where you're going to see adoption come first, you know, the larger, more stable companies. So Walmart, Amazon, UPS, FedEx, etc. I think you'll see them experimenting with it more and the more routes that they can get it to make sense on, that the faster adoption is going to be. And as the technology matures and batteries continue to get cheaper,",https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dp8PhLsUcFE,5685,2022-10-22 18:57:00
17280," The faster adoption is going to be. And as the technology matures and batteries continue to get cheaper, there's another huge category of vehicles that's right for this kind of upgrade. So the Biden administration has been super aggressive about a pledge to electrify the entire federal vehicle fleet, which is just under 700,000 vehicles. What's interesting is the federal fleet is both really old and really inefficient. The average age of these cars and trucks about 14 years, and the average cost is about a dollar a mile when you add up fuel and maintenance and depreciation, which are the three big ones. It's a good place to look if you're looking to get carbon out of the transportation system. While the most exciting and flashy developments in the world of electric vehicles are usually around personal EVs, the more impactful transition is happening behind the scenes. So the next time you order something online, and it effortlessly appears in your doorstep, your package might have made at least some of its hidden journey without consuming an ounce of gasoline. Part of what I love about business is you get to build things from nothing. I don't have any investors. All this is all money in. This is making this building. It's pretty much full service shadow banking with nobody in charge. So is there more pressure when you're trying to win a basketball championship than when you're trying to please investors? Where's the greater pressure? I think it's definitely trying to win a championship. It's hard because when you invest and you know this, when you're investing, you can control a lot more things. When in a basketball court, you can't control whether somebody's going to make a shot, you've got to get lucky. And what's the greater pleasure making five times your money on a distressed debt investment or winning the NBA championship? They're both fabulous. I wish I could do one each year. That would be great. But I think there's a great feeling in being right on an investment that you've done a tremendous amount of work and you've made money for your clients, which I think is great. I think winning a championship is, it's a very surreal feeling because there's a whole city or state that is actually behind you. You know, we had 70,000 people at the finals and we had them all outside. We had 17,000 in stands. And then literally like 60,000 people outside. And when we won, like just the joy that you had brought to the city was phenomenal. The markets are preparing to close, but the day is not over yet. It's the day is not over yet.

17281," This is Bloomberg Daybreak with Lake Bloomberg. Welcome to Daybreak Australia. This is Bloomberg Technology. Welcome to Bloomberg crypto. When Jack Hartung joined Chipotle 20 years ago, it was far from the powerhouse it is today. Chipotle was a special brand. It was an unknown brand. It was very small. Founded in 1993 by Chef Turnodrapreneur Steve L's, the company stood on the brink of the growth spurt that would create a category, fast casual dining. It was a really simple idea. Steve had it was, look, why is fast food crappy? Why can't great food be done fast? I was there when there was a couple dozen restaurants and I would visit restaurants like this where Steve would go behind line and he'd see somebody cutting an onion and saying, well hold on, let me show you how to do it. Two decades later, Jack Hartung is still the chief financial officer of Chipotle. He's had a hand in just about every area of the operation. I feel like I've always been able to dabble in things outside of just financials. And while his central task is to create greater value for a chain that now has about 3,000 restaurants, he insists on staying true to the values that have defined Chipotle from day one. I think I'm really open-minded, but I really do want to protect the heritage of Chipotle and make sure that we don't lose the essence. It's a powerful blend, a consistent mission that sustains the brand with a commitment to innovation that drives the business. Chipotle's future depends on investments that address both priorities. Jack Hartung embraces that challenge. He's always had a passion for what we do next in our company because he's always been really a champion of growth. I've got to make sure that the financials, the balance sheet, the way we source through, the way that we provide through, the way that our business works, needs to be strong so that we reach our full potential. I love working with people that can figure out how to thread the needle between the numbers and the purpose. Frankly, not everybody can do it, but luckily Jack does it really well and we're pretty fortunate to have him at our company. Chipotle's growth in the last five years has been nothing short of spectacular. Revenues have jumped nearly 70 percent. The company's market capitalization has more than quadrupled. All this despite a global pandemic that's disrupted the restaurant industry and all this following a food safety crisis that caused sales at the company to crater and forced to shake up in the sea suite. Individually, the team was phenomenal. Individually, people were very talented. But it's almost like they didn't have the right people in the right places to handle how big the brand and the platform became the enhanced food safety procedures, enhanced standards and training. They really enhanced the management team, took marketing dollars, you know, transitioned them to more effective marketing, brand building efforts with a big focus on reminding consumers of why they love Chipotle. The breakdown was the human capital. The breakdown was in culture. And that's what they've repaired and that's why they're coming back stronger. What have you learned in your CFO position going through those crises? What was the most challenging? The food safety issue was the most challenging because we were alone in that one. That was unique to Chipotle. The pandemic is certainly a challenge but everyone's in it together. The things that really got us through it is we stay true to our purpose. So during each of these challenges, we made sure we invested in the things that made Chipotle special, invest in higher quality food, invest in our people, and then invest in our growth and invest in things like technology. We have the same around here. I think it actually comes from West Point. You know, we will choose the harder right over the easy road. How do you and Jack work on things like that? Those black swan events, those things that can be, you know, fundamentally changing for you as a company? When we are successful in focusing on the really important things that can strategically drive growth for us, they seem to be having resiliency in these unexpected events. All right, it will caution us.",https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dp8PhLsUcFE,5687,2022-10-22 19:05:54
17282," full and focusing on the really important things that can strategically drive growth for us. They seem to be having resiliency in these unexpected events. The other thing I think is to make sure you have a strong balance sheet to make sure you can weather the storm. And we've had a strong balance sheet with never had debt. We've always had more cash in the balance sheet than we need for our normal ongoing business. And that has come in, you know, great, you know, really happy. Chipotle carries no long-term debt and it's free cash flow almost tripled in 2021. When you think about the future, how do you take advantage of this and what is the flexibility that that enables? What it really affords us is we're going to be able to invest in our future no matter what. Like we accelerated our open, we accelerated our pursuit of new restaurant sites during the pandemic when some of their restaurant companies were laying off their development team. Chipotle not only expanded its footprint over the last two years, it reshaped its restaurants, eventually to drive through dining that began several years ago became a thriving profit center when the pandemic struck. The thing that's changed the most is just most of our restaurants now have a Chipotle. So three years ago we had maybe five or six Chipotle and now we have over 350 and 80 percent of our new openings have a Chipotle. The sales in our Chipotle restaurants are higher and our margins are higher too because the digital orders are our highest margin transaction and when you can serve the customer through the Chipotle without the delivery fees that we pay in the customers pay, it's a great margin opportunity for us. The convenience of Chipotle is contributed to soaring digital sales in 2020. There was little erosion in 2021 even as in restaurant sales returned to 80 percent of 2019 levels. Meanwhile membership and loyalty programs has boomed giving Chipotle valuable insight into its customers omnichannel preferences. What we've seen is that our digital customers they come the most often and they spend the most each time they come. Customer loyalty could face a test if inflation continues to push higher. Chipotle hiked menu prices roughly 9% in 2021. Jack Hartung says it's not just wages and food costs that are putting on the pressure. It's hitting everything. Titting materials too for our restaurants or new restaurants are costing more as well. You guys have had incredible pricing power. Is there kind of a tipping point where it's like enough? We haven't seen it. Why is that Jack? Well part of it is we've over the years been slow to raise prices. We've always tried not to go to the menu board to raise prices whenever we've had a challenge from a cost standpoint. We'll do other things to try to find efficiencies somewhere along the line. We raised prices in the second quarter of last year. We did that just to cover the cost of raising wages. We raised wages up to $15. It was an average of 15% increase and we raised prices just to cover the dollar cost of that. So we didn't increase our margins. Our margins actually went down but our profitability stayed the same. Our customers actually said we really applaud what you're doing. We're fine with a 4% price increase. Not a chicken breeder that's 30 cents but the fact that you increase wages to that extent we'd like you to more Chipotle. CEO Brian Nichol has warned that Chipotle may raise prices again if cost pressures intensify. With the cost of eating out already at historic levels consumers may just have to get used to paying more. The industry is used of type of inflation. Call it 2% level inflation. They take a little bit of priced offset if flows through and margins are just naturally restored. The fact of the matter is labor was the pressure point. So the industry today is definitely sitting on a high single digit price versus what is typically a low single digit price inflation or level of menu price increase. In relative terms everyone has to do this. In fact I would say Carl we could be more patient than others because we own all of our restaurants. When you're a franchise organization. When you have franchise Z's that have borrowed to invest in their business they can't necessarily afford to let inflation eat away at their at their ability to pay the debt for very long. It is full speed ahead when it comes to store growth. Chipotle just up its goal to 7000 from 6000 restaurants in the US thanks in large part to strong performance it's seeing its smaller towns. Based on we're already in more than a hundred of them. Based on the one door and based on the",https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dp8PhLsUcFE,5688,2022-10-22 19:10:05
17283," Based on, we're already in more than a hundred of them. Based on the ones we're in, based on the results so far, which are extraordinary, we think there is as many as almost a thousand more restaurants. So even though you're talking about a small town with maybe 20, 30,000 people, the sales volumes are almost the same as if you're in a city like Chicago or a Chicago suburb. But the investment costs are lower, the rents are certainly lower, and the operating costs are lower. So you end up getting higher margins and higher returns. Chipotle reaps the full benefit of these returns since it owns and operates all its stores and advantage that's not lost on Wall Street. It's extremely unusual in not only restaurants, but from a restaurant stock perspective to have a large cap stock that's growing its unit level economic model, meaning the revenues are getting better and the margins are getting better as growth is accelerating. It's just, it's like almost unheard of. So there's little reason for Chipotle to begin franchising in the United States. But for the chain's 45 international restaurants, Bloomberg intelligence notes that partnering with local operators overseas might boost margins and accelerate expansion. We're open to the idea of some kind of franchise model. You know, there are areas of the world where it's going to be harder for us to own and to run the businesses ourselves when they're process of bringing our digital system to Europe that's going really, really well. We've also opened up some alternative sites. It gives us great optimism that international is going to be a growth vehicle for us and hopefully not to this future. Coming up, Jack Hartung shows me around one of Chipotle's newest restaurants and he explains the economics of menu innovation. When you bring something new, does it bring in additional customers? Does it bring existing customers more often? This is Bloomberg. Bloomberg has enhanced search on the terminal to deliver what you need when you need it.

Like Chipotle's menu, Jack Hartung's professional resume isn't patented out with exotic ingredients. After earning a bachelor's degree in MBA at Illinois State, he went straight to an accounting job at Cooper's in Lyberton. His next stop, 18 years at McDonald's. They called me up and McDonald's was just a few miles down the road and the status place is great. What they told me was great about it was you started in one area but then when a job opens up they would post it and you can interview for it. So I felt, well that's not great so I can learn a job and then if I'm looking for another opportunity, I can interview for it. And if I've done a good job, I'll get those opportunities. Which is what happened? I am curious when you went from McDonald's to Chipotle where folks like, Jack, here you've got the established company you're going to start it. I mean did people think you were crazy? Yeah, I mean a lot of people thought I was crazy. In fact one memorable person was a CEO of McDonald's at the time because I had a great career at McDonald's and the future looked really really good. Chipotle was in its infancy.",https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dp8PhLsUcFE,5689,2022-10-22 19:14:20
17284," Crazy. In fact, one memorable person was a CEO of McDonald's at the time because I had a great career at McDonald's and the future looked really, really, really good. At Chipotle it was in its infancy and it had this vision for food that was like no other than I've seen. How much of it was but Dowled only 90% of Chipotle? How much of it was RHA? Keep an eye on these guys. You know, that's how it started. And it wasn't keep an eye on it but it was more, their food culture was very advanced, their business culture was not. And so it was more of bringing some of your experience to Chipotle just so you can get them on a stronger track. Once I got into Chipotle environment and I realized, oh my god, I want to be part of this. There was a passion about what we were doing so it wasn't a financed job anymore. It was a job that was really changing food culture in this country and it was a mission and it was a mission that I totally bought into. Chipotle's culture and mission have long differentiated it as a place to eat. With restaurants competing fiercely for employees in the wake of the pandemic, companies are going to have to show that they are great places to work as well. It's not just about that person coming back to work in the restaurant. They're going to come back but they're not going to come back and work the way they did before. I think that the companies that win are those that are investing in their employees, their teams that are developing a strong culture that people want to be a part of. The real win on a micro level is if restaurants can figure out how to make that employee work better and more efficiently but in a way that makes them more satisfied. At this new location just outside Chicago, Jack Hartung told me what it will take to build a workforce to meet Chipotle's goals. You've got to start with attractive wages but then you've got to go away beyond that. You've got to offer developmental opportunities, promotional opportunities. We have 100,000 employees and as we grow from 3,000 restaurants to 7,000 restaurants, we're going to need 200 or 250,000 employees. So our future depends on hiring great crew today that will be great managers in the future. Double the locations, double the staff and along with investing in people, Chipotle plans to invest in technology to support them. There is so much still that can be done with artificial intelligence, robotics. When you think about our system, there are a lot of processes that frankly people don't love doing. Cutting and courting avocados in the restaurant, not a fun job, very repetitive. I think there's a way where we could use robotics to help us do that. And then as you think about artificial intelligence, we could be better at figuring out how many avocados we have to cut and court it so that we never run out of walkablely throughout the day. As digital orders have surged, Chipotle has adapted its processes. The most dramatic change has been the addition of a second make line. This is very familiar to customers, our front line. And this is what for the first, you know, call it 18 years of Chipotle, this was you come in Chipotle along the line, you interact with the crew and you customize your meal. We've got this separate make line and it's digitized. And so the orders come in and they're really kind of staged so that if you say, at noon, I want to come in at 1 o'clock, we hold that order and we will send it to the crew like a maybe 10 to 1. So it's ready right when you pull up your car. How do you manage these kind of two different staffing needs, right? Making sure you have the right amount of people at the right time. We spend a lot of time projecting sales. A lot of it is, you know, it's part art, part science. We're trying to bring more science and more AI into it. Because if you get the right sales projection, then you know exactly what your staffing needs to be. So if you get the sales right, you can get the entire restaurant staff perfectly with just a couple of people. Our average restaurant now does about over a million dollars per restaurant in digital sales. Data science meets culinary art in Chipotle's commitment to menu innovation. But releasing several new items each year, management hopes to boost same store sales. It seems to be working, but it's more complicated than it looks. The most important thing is to make sure that the economics work, meaning when you bring something new, does it bring in additional customers? Does it bring existing customers more often? There's always going to be trade off from one menu item to another. And there could be economic either advantages or disadvantages. So we just want to understand.",https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dp8PhLsUcFE,5690,2022-10-22 19:18:46
17285," existing customers more often. There's always going to be trade off from one menu item to another and there could be economic either advantages or disadvantages so we just want to understand that you know when a customer comes in if they're trading from a high margin item to low margin item that's going to be a loser more. And any new offering must meet Chipotle's rigorous sourcing standards. It will take us a year and a half from the time that we are experimenting in the test kitchen to we'll put it into a few restaurants to see how does it work operationally and do customers like it but it'll take us a year and a half because we've then got to build up a splicing. It's a challenge but we take our time and we're not going to roll it out before it's ready. Jack Hartung clearly places a high value on the customer experience and the experience of those who work at Chipotle restaurants. He's a people person and a family man with five children and ten grandchildren. Even his favorite hobby brings family into play. It's a passion for collecting and restoring classic cars. I drive here very conservatively so I'm not like ripping down the highway or anything but these are cars that I really cared about and really admired and aspired to when I was young and so I still love these cars. There's a bonding that goes on as well one of my sons is a mechanic so he's a mechanic for Tesla and he loves cars and so we spend time at car shows together we'll go to auctions and look for cars and so we have a great time and he knows how to fix the cars and I know how to drive the cars and so that's kind of the partnership that we have but we have a great time together. Up next sustainability is much more than a buzzword for Chipotle and it's more than figures on a spreadsheet for Jack Hartung. Jack is 100% bought into our purpose of cultivating a better world. Annie tells me what a chief future officer has to learn not to do. Every CFO knows how to read financial statements and go through what a CFO is supposed to do but I think what you have to do is put those aside at some point. This is Bloomberg. When US jobs numbers are released Bloomberg brings you crucial data at terminal speed and instant expert analysis. Nobody covers jobs day like Bloomberg. It is crucial important and I think we've moved from this attitude from its intelligence a waste of time almost an illness that needs a cure. For something as universally important to human life as sleep mysteries surrounding its necessity and utility have only just been recently uncovered. Some of our biggest discoveries were in the 1970s or 1980s and so it makes it a really exciting field because it seems as though we're uncovering new insights each and every day. Some scientists are going further to find out how sleep and what happens there can be harness to further expand our understanding. It's easy to memorize things that makes you smart if you can spit back a lot of facts but if you want to be wise if you really want wisdom you got to know when and how and why to use that information and that's what you bring to use out while you're sleeping. Essential pillar of Chipotle's business has always been a commitment to fresh food and supportive sustainable agriculture. From responsibly raised meat to local and organic produce the company's crafted a supply chain carefully over decades. Every company is facing supply chain challenges. Chipotle has a great infrastructure. They have a sophisticated team. They have relationships with their suppliers. A lot of whom are local. And a lot who have gotten to know Jack Hartung. He sent much more to build those relationships than just sign checks. Within my first year I was spending time on hog farms, cilantro farms. Believe it or not I drove a combine that's like the size of this restaurant to harvest rice, organic rice. And these are things that they had a lasting impression on me because when I would go back to my office and I would be working on spreadsheets of financial analysis I saw how the hogs were raised and I saw how they were raised conventionally versus with our farmers. And I'm like I've got to make sure that our financials and all everything we spend money on needs to be thoughtful so that we can invest in the better way raised to it is more expensive.",https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dp8PhLsUcFE,5691,2022-10-22 19:23:07
17286," I'm like, I've got to make sure that our financials and all, all everything we spend money on needs to be thoughtful so that we can invest in the better way raising food. It's more expensive to buy this food. I was trying to make sure that the economic model supported investing in this food and not through higher-many prices. Jack is 100% bought into our purpose of cultivating a better world. One of those key plants, this sustainability, and doing the right thing for the planet, and as a result, he's all in bored with investing in an understanding, the implications on the business, and then obviously our purpose. We know what matters. We know what matters, not just to our customers, to our crew as well. We do the right things. We do what's right for our people. We do what's right for the farmers. For the last 20 years at Chipotle, Jack Hartung has made strategic decisions based on what matters, even in times of turmoil and crisis. Looking back, more often than not, it's paid off. So I wanted to know what he sees when he looks ahead. What's the opportunity for Chipotle in the next 10 years to excite you the most? Well, I think the most exciting thing is that we're not even halfway to our potential in the U.S. So when I joined a company with a few hundred restaurants and we were talking about a thousand, maybe two thousand. Here we are at three thousand, talking about seven. I believe as we approach seven, that number's going to be higher. A lot higher? Well, I don't know how much higher, but for sure it's going to go up. And international, we're just scratching the surface. And we've been very responsible in the international world, where we've taken the same food ethos, we've owned the restaurant so far. And so it's been a very slow, let's make sure we get this right. You know, sometimes you have to go slow before you go fast. That's kind of been our approach. We've gone slow and now we're positioning ourselves to, I think in the not-too-distant future, go fast in the international. So those are two things that excite me the most. All right, what's the challenge for the next 10 years that is on your mind the most that maybe and keeps you up at night? People, when we run all of our restaurants like we do today, we have around 100,000 employees. As we grow, we're going to need more employees. We promoted 19,000 people last year. 90% of our promotions were in-house. So we always have to be on our game in terms of higher and great people that believe in Chipotle and our purpose today that have the desire to learn how to cook, learn how to run a business, learn how to lead people. If we do a great job with that, the future only gets brighter. So we're in great shape from the people's standpoint, but that's something that I'll always worry about. Are we hiring and developing the right people? You don't want to be losing people. If we lose people, then we might have to resort to franchising. And it's hard to follow a purpose during tough times, like during a pandemic. It's hard to invest in things like food and people. You win margins or under pressure. When you own your own restaurants, you can make those investments. How do you see your role as CFO changing in the next 10 years? Safe to say it's changed a lot in the past 10 years. How about the next 10? It has. I think it'll just evolve with the challenges. Again, I'm already fortunate that I've been able to get involved in real estate and supply chain. I spend time in a restaurant, spend time in suppliers, spend time in international as well. I already get to spend a lot of time in a lot of these areas. I think in terms of evolution, it's probably more a matter of the folks on my team, some of which are new to Chipotle in the last few years, some of which have been with us for a long time. Right. To help them rise up so they can take on bigger responsibilities. As we become a bigger company, everybody in the company will need to step up and take on bigger responsibilities. So my main goal will be to make sure that they're ready to take those on. What's the skillset that you think every CFO should be acquiring in this environment? I think being a digital savvy is probably the most important thing. Trying to stay, you know, keep up or even stay ahead of where technology is going. Not just in the next five years, but in the next 10 or 15 years. I think that's the most critical for CFO. What's the best advice for the future that you give to somebody a person who just got promoted to CFO today? I would say be really, really curious. Try to learn as much as you can about every part of the business. Every CFO knows how to read financial statements and go through what a CFO is supposed to do. But I think what you have to do is put those aside at some point. Go spend time in your business. Okay, spend time in restaurants. Spend time with suppliers. I think get to know how other people within the business, what their challenges are, what their opportunities are, what really makes the customer care about your brand or your business. And I think the more you do that, when you go back to the spreadsheets, you're going to be thinking about things.",https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dp8PhLsUcFE,5692,2022-10-22 19:27:36
17287," What really makes the customer care about your brand or your business? And I think the more you do that, when you go back to the spreadsheets, you're going to be thinking about things from a different standpoint. Your priorities might change a little bit. Right. And it might change how you make investments to make sure that the customer experience is better next time, rather than the margin is better. I mean, if you invest in the customer in a way where they become loyal to your customer, the margin will come.

17288," time at the middle of March of 2020 where the world changed and for packaged food in general, that was a great thing. For packaged food broadly, anything you could stock up for a meal time, it was an incredible run to the grocery store. The kind of volumes no one really ever expected, anything that is center store, shelf stable and the supply chain could keep up with it, food. Consumers stuck at home are finding comfort in comfort food and they're stocking up on snacks as new COVID variants threaten to create new supply disruptions. Mondalees, the maker of Oreos, Cadbury and many other iconic brands has been keeping a close eye on these developing trends. As we went through the pandemic, we started to realize, in our categories, biscuits and chocolate, the consumption is going up. There is the need for physical and mental well-being and chocolate and biscuits provide some sort of relief to these 10 stays. Few companies are better positioned to provide that relief than Mondalees, with a portfolio of more than 60 brands led by nine global powerhouses ranging from chocolate to crackers to cheese. And few snack food companies have a broader consumer base. Mondalees draws more than two-thirds of its revenue from sales outside the United States. But for the company to make the most of its opportunities, CEO DarkVandiput depends on CFO, Lucas Aramella, to cut through the clutter and keep this huge ship on course. When the pandemic started and when we started to realize that this was going to take on a global nature look as the CFO started to play a key role, make sure it was clear for everybody in the organization what the expectation was. I mean this is the most recent performance of the company. As you see most of the businesses doing quite well. Like every CFO in 2022, Zara Mella faces some headwinds, global supply chain challenges, inflation, and ongoing uncertainties around the pandemic just to name a few. But he brings experience and savvy that gives Mondalees executives and investors confidence in their chief future officer. He is like a walking encyclopedia of knowledge. If he doesn't forget anything, he has an understanding of the details of a business that I've very rarely seen in any person. Defining the CFO role as only finance is very limiting. I think the key differentiator is about understanding the business, knowing the business, making decisions and be selective about what you do, how you do it, and when you do it. When I talk about countries, it is because I visited them, I spend time on them and I know I work pro, that's I know I work people, I know our customers. Lucas Aramella has been at Mondalees since 1996, joining the company in his native Italy. Over the ensuing two decades, he worked in Latin America, Europe, and North America. They tell my daughters, I have three daughters, I always tell them that when they ask me what is your job, I study. I have a lot of studying in my role, I want to know what's going on in the countries, etc. It is about different products, different consumers. We tend to believe that all consumers are equal, they are not. The issues you deal with in the US are very different with issues in Latin America or in Europe. I think it's a huge benefit to have grown up in the company. I came from the outside, so the combination of the two us, that gives a huge strength to our business and the way we look at things. CEO, Dark Daniput, arrived at Mondalees in 2017 and a year later, Tepp Zaramela, to lead the finance team. I enter the company as new and you start to look for...",https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dp8PhLsUcFE,5694,2022-10-22 19:36:04
17289," later, Tapsar Amela to lead the finance team. I enter the company as new and you start to look for somebody that can really be your sounding board on what you're thinking. You can play ping pong, I call it, with him about ideas and so on. That started very early and it sort of grew over time. Our CEO, particularly, and our board, they are looking for someone that can understand the business, can drive decisions that are sound from a business standpoint. Especially for a company that has such strength in its local market management, it's that CFO role effectively gets reframed when everything's less decision making is inherently a little bit less centralized. If you're going to keep a P&L, whether it's a formal P&L, or it's a marketing P&L, you're going to measure something. You're going to do it in a local market area as opposed to a business style of globally that inherently creates a challenge that Louis has been able to solve. It requires more capabilities that maybe you wouldn't think of a traditional CFO role where you'll oversee a finance function. The ability to drive decisions became critical in 2020 when the jolt from the pandemic suddenly disrupted the company's traditional patterns of performance. At the beginning of the pandemic, I didn't really know what was going on with the business because you can imagine in places like India, for instance, the business came to a complete stop. We, India for us, is an operation that sells more than $1 billion a year and all of a sudden we went to zero sales. And I didn't know what was going on not only with our people, but with the business itself. I didn't know if we had cash and for how long that cash would support the operation. So, boost the consumption in the US, but then India closed suddenly and our sales went to almost zero. And so dealing with this variation around the world and how to make sure that as a global company, as a total company, we go through this in a way that would allow the best for every single country around the world that required a lot of attention as you can imagine from the CFO. I have to say we bounced back tremendously well. I have to say if I look back at the last couple of years and I look at the numbers, it seems like the pandemic didn't happen to our business at all. Mondalees revenues haven't missed a beat, rising year over year in both 2020 and 2021. The company projects even stronger top line growth in the next two years, but maintaining margins may be challenging with supply chains still under pressure and the cost of labor and materials rising. I've never seen physical supply chain disruption like this. Sure, normally you get cycles, you have to take some pricing to cover the cost inflation, but it's not like you can't get the products to the shelves. I think it starts with labor shortages around the world that's causing knock on impacts on freight costs, on ingredient costs, on physical movement of plants. I'm not necessarily worried about supply at this point. I'm more worried about prices and prices, particularly around logistics and around transportation, have been going worldwide. Are they hitting your margins or are you passing those on to the consumer? In the US, for instance, we just announced pricing of 6%, across the portfolio. That is a vote that, effectively saying this is not transitory, that if you're passing on those prices of the consumer, that's here to stay. Are you not expecting some of those input costs to go down then any time soon? I don't expect them to go down any time soon. I think transportation, for instance, has been quite high in terms of inflation for the last three years. I also know that packaging costs and costs related to some of our commodities are going up and have been going up. So far, despite the highest food inflation in decades, leading producers have been able to pass on costs to customers. Mondays, saw US retail sales, take a healthy jump.",https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dp8PhLsUcFE,5695,2022-10-22 19:40:22
17290," Food inflation in decades leading producers have been able to pass on costs to customers. Mondalees saw US retail sales take a healthy jump in December 2021 versus the previous year. When you pass those costs onto the consumer, you are confident that they can accept those higher prices. I am. And I also would like to say that it is not necessarily a straight price increase. We use what we call revenue growth management. That is optimizing the size of the packs that is providing multiple choices. For instance, based on consumer occasions, you might realize that you don't necessarily carry with you all the time a big pack of Oreo, but so making the product available in smaller sizes is critical. We optimize promotional spending. And so making sure that promotions in terms of that, which means the price benefit that you give to the consumers. And in terms of frequency, they are optimized. And so it is a full array of things that we are trying to leverage to make sure that there is the least amount of elasticity. But reality is if you look at the market, you see prices going up and volume going up. So the old concept of elasticity, higher price, lower volume is not necessarily there anymore. Mondalee set a long-term target of 3% organic net revenue growth in 2018 when it launched a new consumer centric growth strategy. And the company is not backing off that goal. Reality is I believe the 3% plus algorithm is achievable for this company. Also, we have been making acquisitions. We have been adding around about a couple of billion dollars of revenue of platforms that are high growth single digit in terms of the revenue potential. I think going forward, we now have a recipe. We are growing our global brands. We have developed local brands that play on the needs of the local consumers. We have found a financial algorithm that allows us to constantly increase the investment in our brands. Coming up, Mondalee has developed an appetite for M&A. Lucas Aramella tells me how the company makes sure that its acquisitions deliver maximum value. It is about yes, feeling geographical gaps, but it is also about ensuring that we feel gaps in our portfolio. This is Bloomberg.

17291," Company with old roots. It was created in 2012 in a split with craft foods, which dates all the way back to 1932. In its early years, Mondalees was a takeover target, attracting the attention of billionaire activists investors Bill Ackman and Nelson Peltz. Peltz pushed for a merger with PepsiCo, and when that failed, he later joined the board to oversee a cost-cutting push. He'd taken a chunk of shares, put pressure on the company, eventually took the board seat from 2014 onwards, and really just said, don't worry about the top line. If your margins, if your operating margins are only 12%, why are you worried about the top line? You've got to focus on improving those in order to create long-term value for the company. So, you know, with that in mind, they did exactly that, and for three or four years from 2013 to 2017, 2018, we saw monstrous margin improvement. So when Dirk van der Pooke came in, his remit was to get the top line going, and he did. It's because of the work that was done before I arrived that we were able to focus on growth after my arrival. Let's now focus on what drives our growth, building our brands, investing more in our brands, getting distribution in the channels where we were underdeveloped, building our geographical presence, and so on. Mondalease is also building through acquisition. Since 2018, the company has added about one and a half billion dollars in revenue, indials across a number of consumer segments and geographic markets. If you think about the latest acquisition of Gita, that is a platform that allows us to start competing in croissant with a seven-day brand. We can apply our brands to those portfolios that we acquire. It is about, yes, filling geographical gaps, but it is also about ensuring that we fill gaps in our portfolio. And particularly in the case of Bakesnext, we are very keen because it is a category that is massive. There is no consolidation in that category yet in terms of manufacturers around the world. It is high growth and we can apply our brands and now we know how to deliver cost synergies. I think what Mondalease has done is very small. They targeted areas that are still quite fragmented but growing and profitable. So areas like snack bars, areas like cakes and pastries, and I think the deals that they've made are pretty small. With a growing lineup of brands on Dilease. Profolio optimization is really ongoing. Priority is as a company, we have a lot of brands and a lot of local brands that mean a lot to our local consumers. So the Indian consumer and the way you reach them and target them is very different than the way you would reach and target an American consumer, for example. Yes, it is. Having said that, one of the biggest success stories in India is Oreo. And we have been able to sell quite a bit of Oreos in the last couple of years. I think we crossed the $100 million mark for that brand in India. And so there are a lot of nuances but there are also a lot of similarities. Our brands still have a huge runway of growth for its Oreo. So one of our biggest brands is growing double digit or close to double digit for a $3 billion brand that's pretty impressive. In 2020, Mondalees opened its new global headquarters in Chicago. One of the places Lucas Aramella spends a lot of time is this conference room where teams can display and discuss data, stay informed and stay connected. Here we can track and monitor the performance of our company throughout the world of our competitors. We can measure and take a look at balance sheet, cash flow, etc. And every month we spend three hours with the CEO in this room where we go through a Q&A session and where we analyze data, we point to things that are working very well, where we need to make further investments. But we also talk about things that don't work that well. And so we have follow ups with the segments and the regions and the business units about it.",https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dp8PhLsUcFE,5697,2022-10-22 19:49:05
17292," But we also talk about things that don't work that well. And so we have follow-ups with the segments and the regions and the business units about it. When Lucas Aramella isn't crunching numbers or working with his team to solve strategic problems, you can often find him on his bicycle. It's a pastime he tries to pursue every day. It is about performing well, but also having a strategy on how you compete with others. It is an individual sport, but it is also a team sport. And it gives me the opportunity to talk to a lot of people and see an always moving environment. Always on the stationary bike or do you have an outdoor bike? I also go outdoor and we are in Chicago. The temperature outside is around about 10 degrees this day. And I have to say yesterday I went out with my bike at freezing temperature and yeah, I prefer going outside if I can. They say the physical toughness makes you mentally stronger as well. Maybe that's part of it. I think cold is just a perception. If you don't think about it, you can go and exercise outdoor. Up next, Lucas Aramella shows me around Mondaleez's glittering new global headquarters. He tells me how he sees the future of office work. We want to give our people flexibility. And if anything, what we have learned over the last couple of years is that we can run the company effectively from remote. And helping a chief future officer is as much an art as a science. I think to be successful in a role like this, it is not only technical knowledge. It is about passion, it is about caring. This is Bloomberg. It's a really a reminder isn't it just how sensitive the markets are to any commentary about trade. We did see pressure on the U.N. We did see some pressure on the futures. That is now being reversed. Big, expensive cities have a lot going for them. But if you live in one, you probably notice that these big, expensive cities keep getting more well expensive. You could always move away. You might have just started working remotely so there's really nothing keeping you there. But then again, moving is a hassle. Well, what if someone paid you 10 grand to do it? What if they threw in free office space, a bicycle, or a gym membership? Programs and cities and states around the U.S. are doing exactly that. And they're getting a lot of interest. We've had over 50,000 applications. About 90,000 applications. We've had over 1800 applicants from all over North America. So are these nascent programs actually beneficial to their communities and the workers joining them? Or are they little more than flashy advertising campaigns for places looking for an injection of fresh talent? In 2020, Mondalees moved its global headquarters from suburban Chicago to a building in the city's Bumin, Fulton Market neighborhood. The roots of the company have been in Chicago. I think when I thought about opening a new headquarters, the main thing we were looking for was to make sure that we were in the middle of the consumers. And Fulton Market, where we are, is one of the areas in the U.S. with the highest number of millennials and generations. It has a percentage of the population. About 400 employees are slated to occupy these new offices, which were designed with productivity and community in mind. We wanted to have a lot of common areas and make working easier for people. And so we have a lot of light, as you can tell. We have a lot of shared areas. The meeting rooms you literally walk in and the computer who caps on the screen almost automatically. And so we wanted to make these a contemporary, fashionable place. And something that is easy for people to use as a space. But over the past year, the new space has been largely empty. It's grand opening postponed. As Mondalees, like so many companies, complies with public health guidelines and many employees.",https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dp8PhLsUcFE,5698,2022-10-22 19:53:23
17293," This has been largely empty. It's grand opening postponed as Mondelese, like so many companies, complies with public health guidelines and many employees work from home. How are you dealing with a still remote workforce, a labor force that is demanding flexibility? We want to give our people flexibility. And if anything, what we have learned over the last couple of years is that we can run the company effectively from remote. I still believe there is a lot of value, particularly for young people to come into the office and absorb a little bit the culture of the company. And I know for sure that many people that work for me, they would like to come to the office and have that social aspect of working that is somewhat missed. Do you think this flexible work from the office, work from home is with us to stay? I think it is with us to stay. I know for sure that many people don't like spending hours commuting. And I know for sure that it might be more productive if they spend that time doing something else, working or spending time with their family. So as a company, we embrace flexibility. If the future offers flexibility to workers, it also offers opportunity to businesses to assess their need for office space and potentially redirect some resources. It has been different country by country. And so there have been some countries where we have reduced the office space. And we are putting that money back into the business either by giving more opportunities for people to operate as they like and giving them the tools that they need, but also investing in our brands. It's all about investment for Lucas Aramella. And he realizes that patient long term planning yields the best returns. What's the biggest challenge in the next 10 years for you? The biggest challenge is about managing costs in a way that is sustainable. Because as a company, I don't think we can shift away from growth. And so that good balance between cost management and investing is something that is that is required. And sometimes I have to say it is challenging to cut costs in a context where as a company we are pursuing growth. Mondalease is also pursuing growth in a sustainable framework. The company targets a 10% reduction in emissions across operations and 100% recyclable packaging by 2025. I. S. Aramella, if these goals are achievable, just three years away. I think they are. A lot of companies are talking about it. But I can tell you there is a lot of belief in the management team specifically that these are the right things. And we have to do them because not only our consumers, because it is right for the planet, it is right for our children, it is right for futures and relations. What's the biggest change that a CFO role will undergo? In the next 10 years. I think it will be about how we as CFOs run the company. It is the role of the CFO. It as I said, the information availability is quite extensive these days. I think as leaders, we will keep on thinking about how we can make the company go better. But I also believe it is important that we spend time grooming our successors. And the role of a leader today is about thinking about what is needed for our people in the next five to 10 years and making sure we equip them to be successful in five to 10 years. And it is completely different than what it used to be. What then would be the biggest piece of advice you'd give your successer? I think to be successful in a role like this, it is not only technical knowledge, it is about passion, it is about caring, it is about making sure that the future generations have something in their hands that was built over time by people like us. They have to love Orioms, right? They do. Lucas Aramella clearly loves what he does.",https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dp8PhLsUcFE,5699,2022-10-22 19:57:42
17294," It's built over time by people like us. They have to love Oreos, right? They do. They do. Lucas Aramella clearly loves what he does. He believes in his company's products, and he's using that passion, along with a whole lot of data, to better its financial prospects. That's what makes Lucas Aramella a chief future officer. I'm Taylor Riggs. This is Blinberg. I'm going to name a couple of your babies. I don't know if I'm asking you to choose amongst your children, but some of the most recognizable buildings by you, of course, the Millennium Bridge, London City Hall, the Reichstag, and the Great Court British Museum. What was your favorite project to do? The Reichstag does stand out, because, first of all, it's an energy manifesto. So it transforms something that was dependent on fossil fuels. It uses all the technology to produce something which is essentially carbon neutral, and there's a public building. That's a statement. It's a symbol of a city. It's a symbol of a nation. It incorporates works of art. It's recycling and existing building, which, as I mentioned earlier, is the ultimate in sustainability. If you can give a new life to a building. It also creates public space at the roof level. It's the most visited parliament in the world, so it puts the public above the politicians who are answerable to them. And that, of course, was made possible by the politicians. So it's a demonstration of democracy in action.

And I think we've moved from this attitude, from its indulgence, a waste of time, almost an illness that needs a cure. For something as universally important to human life as sleep, mysteries surrounding its necessity and utility have only just been recently uncovered. Some of our biggest discoveries were in the 1970s or 1980s, and so it makes that a really exciting field because it seems as though we're uncovering new insights each and every day. Some scientists are going further to find out how sleep and what happens there can be harnessed to further expand our understanding. It's easy to memorize things. That makes you smart.

So before you invent pioneer disrupt, before you change the world, Bloomberg. So who is my guest this week? The Grand Slam tennis champion Andy Murray. The career span of an elite athlete can be short. But this British tennis player has already packed a hell of a lot into his 35 years. Three Grand Slam wins and a former World No. 1. He's battled injuries to remain on the court, bagging tens of millions of dollars along the way. But for the greatest UK player since Virginia Wade, it's always been about more than the money. He's turned down endorsements and done things his own way. From his early years when some of the public were unsure of him, he's now ranked by pollsters as the most popular tennis player in the world.",https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dp8PhLsUcFE,5700,2022-10-22 20:02:00
17295," Andy Murray from your children. I know we're talking ahead of Wimbledon, of course. Do you have to go in believing you can win again? Yeah, I mean, I think that's part of the motivation to still be out there competing. I know obviously that's going to be unbelievably difficult thing to do, but, um, you know, I do still believe that I've got great tennis in me. Um, I know it's going to be even harder to win Wimbledon than it was five, six years ago. Um, but yeah, I still believe and, um, I'm still working and training as hard as I can to try and achieve that goal. Yes. Well, I mean, we should say, in case people don't know, you've had a lot of pain, injuries, particularly around your hip. And, you know, I read that you're inspired by the likes of Muhammad Ali and sport stars who make big comebacks. Is that part of the psychology? For me, I came back to play tennis because I love it. That's why, um, I came back to play. Um, it's been something I've done since I was a really young kid and, you know, pretty much since my sort of teenage years, it's been the main thing in my life. And I've dedicated a lot of time to it. And I kind of realized when I was going through all of the injuries and pain and wasn't able to compete like how much I did love it. And, um, yeah, probably wish it at times, certainly earlier in my career that I appreciated a bit more and enjoyed it a little bit more than I did. Yes. Well, I mean, I'm fascinated by how individuals do cope with pain. I actually live with a condition called endometriosis. So I'm quite regularly in pain. Of course, everyone's pain is very subjective to them. And in your case, it stopped you at many moments from doing what you wanted, what you dream of, what you train of. How have you coped with pain? Well, I think as athletes, you're used to sort of always having a certain level of pain from, you know, the training and the matches that you do, you know, and that's kind of normal. So I think you, most athletes probably have a relatively high sort of pain tolerance. But then, went with my hip, um, and I dealt with this comfort and my hip for probably six or seven years until it basically from one day to the next, went from, you know, I was ranked number one in the world at the time to, I literally can't walk properly anymore. And, you know, I couldn't extend my hip and was in constant pain every time, you know, even when I went to walk the dogs. And I think initially that's obviously difficult to deal with. But I think over time, it's the consistency of the pain. And it just being every single day that sort of sort of wore me down and I filmed a documentary during my sort of rehab and all the injuries and the surgeries and stuff. Yes. And when I watched that back, I kind of realized which I didn't, whilst I was going through it, like I was in a pretty bad place. So I probably didn't deal with it particularly well, um, you know, in the end. But it had been going on for a long time and it was stopping me, you know, from doing what I love as well. And I cannot wait to see you back at Wimbledon. I really, really can't. I did think about, though, when you were in that state and I know about that film, I've watched that film that you made. I was thinking about whether you'd got to a place, but maybe it's premature to ask you this. But have you thought about how you will be happy or satisfied if you never win another grand slam? Yeah, I mean, like I don't expect that to happen. I still believe that I can do it. But, um, you know, I got to a point before I had the operation that I had to contemplate not playing tennis again and I was fighting and battling with that as well during the, the injury troubles and, you know, I knew that when I had the hip resurfacing that there was a chance I might not be able to play again. And I had to come to terms with that once I did. You know, I feel fine. I know that I'll be fine if I had to stop playing tennis tomorrow. You know, I'll be absolutely fine. I've got a great family. I would obviously miss playing tennis. But I have lots to look forward to, you know, away from the tennis court. You're a fashion designer now, right? You've just been doing a photo.",https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dp8PhLsUcFE,5701,2022-10-22 20:08:28
17296," But I have lots to look forward to away from the tennis court. You're a fashion designer now, right? You've just been doing a photo shoot, I believe. A model and fashion designer. Your sportswear, right? Andy Murray. Let me get this right. Andy Murray Castor. That's your new calling, right? Yeah, so I mean, I wouldn't call myself a fashion designer. I don't know a whole lot about fashion, to be honest. But I try and get involved as much as I can in terms of the way the clothes perform on the tennis court. That's something that interests me a lot. So I try and help with that. I test a lot of the kit and everything before, obviously, have to perform on it and give feedback and try to make improvements to where I can. But yeah, let the fashion designers take care of the fashion side of things because I don't know a whole lot about that. We can underestimate the power of clothes. And for you, I suppose, it's something you wrap yourself in. It's a bit of an armor at the same time. Yeah, I mean, it's really important for us. And the shoes as well, it can't make a difference to your performance. And certainly, the clothes and extreme conditions, like we play in Australia where it's 40 degrees. And in places like Miami, where it can be 85%, 90% humidity. So you need to make sure that the materials and stuff that you're wearing are appropriate for the conditions. So yeah, it is important. Lots happening on Wall Street. I think Chey Powell said things that were independent. Need to catch up. This is Bloomberg Wall Street week. I'm David Weston. We've got the information and insights. We think that's the next second shift. From business's most influential and instrumental. It's knocking it out the bull path. It's a challenging dynamic. This is a level of uncertainty that we've ever had to deal with. Bloomberg Wall Street week, live Friday with replays all weekend on Bloomberg Television and Radio. No one covers the world like Bloomberg. Because Trustedomics is being dismantled, and peas behind the scenes are asking, what's the point of having her at the top? In the strong dollar, amplified the world's risks of instability. She didn't mean that complete reunification must be realized. With unmatched reach in resources from more than 120 countries, the moment news breaks 24 hours a day. Bloomberg, your global business authority. A lot of the satellites have propulsion systems. They can kind of move to get out of the way of each other or change their orbit a little bit. It's a service that you guys offer to help these companies know how to maneuver their machines. Yeah, we offer a collision avoidance service. It's a subscription service. We'll send you an alert up to seven days in advance if your satellite's going to come dangerously close to a piece of debris or another satellite. Companies have been doing that for decades moving satellites around, but it's sort of like a harder problem now. The risk of a collision is a lot higher now. Just because we've installed so much more hardware into space, you have a big collision. It creates a cloud of debris. And now all the other satellites are flying through this whizzing mess of debris as we add all of the new satellites into space, the risks of a collision, the likelihood of the collisions going up. I just had to say I talked about watching you of course, as a Brit, I feel I've lived many moments with you. You know, on my knees standing up, hiding behind the sofa, willing you on to win. But one of the things that I wanted to ask you was about your kind of fist pump that you do, on that roar that you do to the crowd. What's going on there? What are you thinking about when people like me are watching you do that point after point after point? Yeah, I mean, I think it's just... A little bit is obviously trying to encourage yourself. But then yeah, there's moments in a match where you're trying to engage with the crowd. They're coming there to watch the tenors, hopefully be entertained but to support...",https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dp8PhLsUcFE,5702,2022-10-22 20:12:49
17297," And yeah, there's moments in a match where you're trying to engage with the crowd. They're coming there to watch the tenors, hopefully be entertained, but to support one of the two players out there. And when people come to watch sporting events, they want to see that, that emotion, you know, hopefully, you know, it's positive emotion, but sometimes, you know, for me, it's, you know, it's negative as well. You know, I wish I was able to control the negative emotions that I have, you know, when I'm playing better, but I feel like when I do, you know, to the crowd and fist pump and, you know, get excited on the court that, you know, I'm trying to engage the crowd. No, no, and it's great to, of course, have crowds back and feed off that energy. Do you, what do you make of groaning and grunting whilst playing? Do you, do you, what do you make of that? Some spectators find that not the best, but I wonder how it is as a, as a player. Yeah, another spectator's love it. I remember growing up watching Monica Salis, for instance. There's a certain level that I think is okay and almost like natural when you're putting lots of effort into something, but when it's at a level that is sounds and seems unnatural, then that's when it's maybe a little bit off-putting and then some players are maybe doing it, like, so long that the balls already getting hit by the opponent, you know, whilst they're grunting and that, you know, is not good because, you know, it's, it should, should be a hindrance, really. Yes, it's not their ball very much at that moment. No, I can only imagine. Well, we're just speaking about, of course, again, with regards to Wimbledon ahead of it. You will be very aware of the controversy going into this Wimbledon surrounding the decision to ban Russian and Belarusian players. You've acknowledged how complicated this decision is. You chose your words very carefully and you have sympathy for the players who can't play. And the authorities who have done this, it's a really difficult one, this, isn't it? Well, my sympathies first and foremost are with the people in Ukraine and what they are going through. And, you know, in the grand scheme of things, like, whether some tennis players are not able to play in an event or not and whether there's, you know, ranking points on offer in the grand scheme of things is kind of irrelevant. You know, obviously, no quite a few of the Russian players and I'm friends with them and I feel for them that they're not able to compete. I can appreciate that it may seem unfair to them, but I can also see Wimbledon's side and their point of view in the perspective that they have and it's very complex, but at the end of it, you know, there's a war going on. You know, that's, you know, what people should be focusing on. And, you know, we want that to end as quickly as possible. And, you know, a tennis tournament isn't really that important, I don't think. No, I think that's obviously that the context and a very important one to do. And I know you're an ambassador for UNICEF. I know you're also donating the proceeds of any of your payments or winnings this year too, the effort to support children in particular in Ukraine. But I think what's very striking about you, Andy, is you have been outspoken about a number of issues over the years. You know, before almost not that it was fashionable, but the people in sport perhaps taking positions, whether it's about the mental health of young players to sexism in sport as well as something I know you care deeply about. Do you get more confident to share opinions as you get older or less? Does it become easier or harder? I think in some ways it becomes easier because you're maybe... I don't know, when you're in your early twenties, you don't really know much about anything really. And I'm not saying I know lords now, but I know a lot more than that. I did that and then maybe trust my views a little bit better than I did then. And, you know, I also feel as well since I had children that I want to make sure that I support things that are important to me and that hopefully will maybe help the world that my children grow up in as well. So in some ways, yes, it does help as you get older. So maybe it becomes a bit easier to share your opinions, but at the same time with everything that goes on online now.",https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dp8PhLsUcFE,5703,2022-10-22 20:17:05
17298," maybe it does help as you get older and maybe it becomes a bit easier to share your opinions, but at the same time, you know, with everything that goes on online, nowadays and everything, like, you know, online abuse and, you know, those sorts of things, at times you think, well, what's the point? I was just saying nothing because, you know, it's an easier life that way as well, and, you know, I want to focus on my time and energy, on my family and on my tennis, and, you know, when you do get involved in certain topics and subjects, you know, attracts more attention, more questions, more time, you know, more comments online, and that can be quite tiring as well. Companies now, they're getting hundreds, maybe even thousands of applications, so software has come in to automate the process. You want to write your resume for robots, not for humans. The only job your resume has is to be comprehensible to the software that is reading it, because that software or robot is going to decide whether or not a human ever gets their eyes on it. These things are programmed by a certain segment of the population that might not be totally inclusive or not be, you know, fully aware. Concerns about how this technology could exacerbate discrimination. For the FTC, I think foremost, the FTC needs to be making sure that we're fully understanding this technology. We don't trust companies to self-regulate when it comes to pollution. We don't trust them to self-regulate when it comes to workplace comp. Why on earth would we trust them to self-regulate AI? Yes, well, I mean, you mentioned your family there, of course, as well as three daughters in the sun. You've been very influenced by strong women in your life, not least your mum, the pro tennis coach, of course, Judy Murray. And she recently wrote an article, and I actually, I remember reading it when it came out, and you know, it's a terribly shocking but horribly familiar story to quite a lot of women I have to say. She wrote about being sexually assaulted at an awards dinner by a man sat next to her. I just wondered, did you know already that story, and did she tell you she was going to share it? My brother was aware that I wasn't, my mum did message me at the time to let me know that there was an article coming out about it. And yeah, I was obviously really upset for her. You know, I was I was pretty angry, but also didn't I didn't know quite exactly what to say. And obviously, I you know, I messaged my mum, I called her the following day to talk to her to make sure that she was okay. And yeah, like you say, it's obviously it's a familiar story for a lot of women. And yeah, that sort of behavior shouldn't shouldn't be tolerated anywhere. Yeah, I mean, she also wrote as part of this, which is a big part of what your your mum has done, is, you know, women are made to feel the world of sport is not for us, and our presence is neither welcome nor important. And what I mean by that is your mum has done a lot of work to try and change that, you know, to be a big part of the world of sports she is. I wonder when you have thought about sexism and how women are perceived. You've of course also had a female coach yourself. That was a big story at the time, even though it shouldn't have been in many ways. How do you stop those men? It's not all men in sport, of course, but those men in sport making women feel like your mum described. That's a good question, which I probably don't don't know all of the answers to. I think some of it probably comes from education, some of it probably comes from having more women around, so that it's not something that it seems out of the norm.",https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dp8PhLsUcFE,5704,2022-10-22 20:21:26
17299," So that it's not something that it seems out of the norm. I certainly, like you mentioned, I got a taste of that when I hired a female coach. And that was very rare, like on the men's tour and the women's tour. There's very few women coaches. And I didn't think much of it at the time when I hired a female coach. I'd never personally in my early 20s thought about it because I'd always seen all of the top players all working with male coaches. I had a conversation with Darren Kehoe, who's one of the top Australian coaches and said, well, you know, what about speaking to some female coaches? And I was like, yeah, I mean, why not? Why wouldn't I do that? I then went down the route of employing Amelie Marismo, who is a former world number one, a women's world champion. And even when there was rumors about me potentially working with her, the comments that I was getting from fellow players, fellow coaches was something I'd never experienced before. And that was when I realized that there was quite a big problem. And I think that until it becomes the norm that there is more than just the odd one or two female coaches on the tour of, you know, two or three hundred, I think that it's probably always going to be an issue. But I mean, hopefully things are changing slowly. Yes. I mean, I suppose when we look at the world of sport, and I know I'm broadening this out slightly, but I know you will have seen this that recently, Jake Daniels became the first active footballer to come out as gay. A lot of people have said that was very brave because of football and how football is perceived and how it is to be a footballer when it comes to being open about your sexuality. I wonder when we talk about the world of sport, what was your reaction to that? And do you think it is getting better in being more reflective of the wider population and not the world? It thinks it should present the world as it is. I do think it is getting a bit better. And I think that that was really positive that he felt comfortable enough to come out and from what I've seen most of the coverage has been extremely positive about it. In the media, that will play out football grounds up and down the country. That will be, I guess, a bigger test and hopefully his experience is really positive as well. But yeah, you would think that, you know, certainly in tennis, there's been no male tennis players have come out as gay, whilst they've still been playing. So you would, you know, if you have come out post-career, so, you know, we maybe have to ask the question as to why that is the case and why, you know, they still don't feel comfortable to come out of whilst they're still active. But I would hope that it would be, if you positively buy all of the players and that's certainly been the case on the female side. So I didn't actually know that about male tennis players. I hadn't looked into that. That's also interesting. I mean, is it a particularly behind the scenes? I don't know when you're on tour. Is there a lot of bravado and having to be macho and I say that in inverted commas? You know, sort of being one way. Do you think that's what it's about, the conformity, perhaps? I haven't seen it in terms of like sexuality, I think, in sport, there is always, or certainly in male sport, like, you know, about being like a man, like tough and being a real man, you know, not showing any emotions and those sorts of things and whether something like that would play a part in it, I've certainly found it difficult times, early in my career to open up to the cultures and stuff that were around me because I don't know, like showing emotions and these sorts of things were, you know, always seen as kind of being a weakness. So I've seen it in that sense, but not, you know, in the locker rooms around someone's sexuality. Yeah, but I mean, you've also spoken a lot about mental health and how younger players in particular do need more support, especially to try and be themselves when they suddenly find themselves in the sport like,",https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dp8PhLsUcFE,5705,2022-10-22 20:25:52
17300," more support, especially to try and be themselves when they suddenly find themselves in the spotlight. You mentioned their emotions and how you were early on in your career. I did spy just before we started to talk a recent Instagram post of you. Smiling very broadly, holding a cup of coffee, saying after years of being miserable and incapable of smiling, I wish I'd known that all I needed was a coffee. Is it fun owning that view that some people had of you that you didn't really see that happy at first? Well, I wasn't that happy in certain aspects, but no, I didn't feel comfortable in front of a camera. You know, my life changed. You know, almost overnight from the first time I played in Wimbledon as an 18-year-old and got to the third round. And I wasn't ready for that. I wasn't prepared for that. It's difficult, I think, to prepare anyone. To have that, to sort of no one in the streets knowing you. And you know, just playing tennis and playing in front of 10-15 people to all of a sudden playing on the centre court. Wimbledon, with millions of people watching on the TV and getting followed by paparazzi back to your house and those sorts of things and seeing you face on papers and everything and comments and things that you might have said to your friends that you've maybe made the mistake of saying in front of a camera, you know, all of a sudden you're getting a cent of abuse. People saying stuff to you up in the streets and these sorts of things and it is really difficult. And you know, you then would, I think, actually go into your shell and not want to open up and just put up a bit of a shield and that's certainly what I did. And you know, was not that happy being in front of a camera and did not feel comfortable in it. And I, you know, it's my responsibility how I deal with, you know, that side of things. But yeah, I don't think the media helped me through that period and I don't think that probably enough is done to help young athletes prepare themselves for the spotlight such a young age. I am praying that you're going to win. Wimbledon. Thank you. Me too. Are you praying or are you training? A bit of both. I'm training. I don't pray. Okay. I'm not sure I've put it quite into prayer but I am really hoping. Let's put it like that. And when you roar with each fist pump, I'll be thinking of what you were saying about all of this and it's a pleasure to talk to you, Andy Murray. Thank you so much. Thank you very much. And thank you for being with us. Until next time, stay safe and goodbye. Bloomberg has enhanced search on the terminal to deliver what you need when you need it.

17301," The tag on the product may read made in the USA, but the sign on the CEO's door often says made in India. AlphaBets Sundart Pichai, Microsoft Sacha Nadella, IBM's Arvind Krishna, Micron Technologies Sanjay Mayhotra, and that's just the start. Added in the chief executives of Adobe, Deloitte, Gap, VMware, and that doesn't count Indians running companies all over the world. Why have so many Indians risen to the top? For no coastal points to India's incredibly competitive education system, if you can survive the pressure it takes to get into one of the Indian Institutes of Technology, it gives you confidence to handle American universities and later the business world. Meanwhile, the belief in India's ability to produce so many tech wizards is reinforced every year. Indians make up about three-fourths of the immigrants receiving coveted H1B visas for the US, and it's a safe bet that some of them will eventually find their way to the C-suite. Welcome to the Earthshot Prize Innovation Summit. I'm Francing Lackwai here at the Plaza Hotel in New York City. This event powered by Bloomberg featured finalists selected by the Earthshot Council, launched by Prince William, is a global initiative that drives innovation on solutions to climate change and environmental issues in the following categories. Protect and restore nature, clean our air, revive our oceans, build our waste-free world, fix our climate. So over the next half an hour we'll bring you all the highlights from this most important gathering. This is Bloomberg. Protecting the environment was of course close to my grandmother's heart, and I know you should have been delighted to hear about this event and the support you're all giving our Earthshot finalists, the next generation of environmental pioneers. Together in this room are the people and organisations who will help us to achieve the Earthshot mission, to repair, restore, and rejuvenate our planet within this current decade. That mission is not simple. Just as President John F. Kennedy so famously said, as he challenged the United States for America to unite behind the goal of putting man on the moon, we choose to do these things not because they are easy but because they are hard. I know that the world is an uncertain place right now, that many families and communities across the globe are facing unimaginable challenges, from conflicts to energy crisis and food shortages. While addressing these in the short term, we must also remain resolutely focused on tackling the greatest challenges that threaten our tomorrow. Because if we don't, the changing climate will only serve to entrench these immediate challenges into fundamental global issues, severely impacting the lives of each and every one of us. That is why our collective mission is so urgent, but there is huge reason to be optimistic. The 2022-21 cohort of Earthshot winners and finalists is evidence that we can succeed. That we can protect our world for our children, our grandchildren, and the generations that will follow them. These pioneers exemplify the leadership needed in this decade of change. They include inspiring activists, brilliant innovators, a forward-thinking city, and even an entire country making a real difference. But they cannot do it alone. This must be a team effort. We must come together behind their innovative solutions to ensure they reach their full potential with pace and scale. While my message today is one of gratitude and encouragement, I also acknowledge that you cannot succeed in isolation. As governments, we have a responsibility to create the incentives and the space for you to flourish. We must acknowledge that you are a collective, a receptive environment for change and the accountability that comes with guardianship. Many nations, the foundation for this approach has been laid for us long ago if we choose to listen.",https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dp8PhLsUcFE,5707,2022-10-22 20:34:29
17302," with guardianship. In many nations the foundation for this approach has been flayed for us long ago if we choose to listen. Where I come from, I'll tear our New Zealand a beautiful place you must visit. Our indigenous people hold a world view that every single living and non-living thing is connected. Our people, our plants, our animals, descendants of Ranganui the sky father of Papatu and to our Nuku the earth's mother and their children. And so it follows that people and nature are kin, are family. And we must care for one another in the spirit of Kaitiaki Tanga, which translates into guardianship by the people of the land for the next generation. In short, Kau aho te taiau, kau te taiau, kau aho, I am the environment and the environment is me. Our life source, our economy, our future. Now I've seen this in action first hand many times, not least in my own backyard the Pacific where the ocean is a source of protein, income, culture and connection. Now that it is a source of challenge as it rises up and begins to inundate small island nations. It can be confronting to hear and see the stories of just how real these challenges are, but none of us are here because we have given up, but because we believe there is a way to change the future. We are not only part of the nature, but we are nature. Nature is living element. For indigenous people, nature is whole. Our planet is alive. The rivers are her blood. The trees are her hair. The soil, her skin, the wind, her breeze. And indigenous peoples, our planet they know, they are the doctor. We are protecting 80% of the world's biodiversity. Because our way of life do not harm nature at the opposite. We are strengthening ecosystems. We improve biodiversity by cooperating with the birds and trees, listening to the winds, observing the cloud, learning from even the little insect. We protect nature by setting up our own limits. We don't take more that mother earth can give and we give back. We protect the sacred trees. We don't destroy the field of the medicinal plants. We choose, precisely, the animal that we can kill to just keep the balance of the ecosystem. As all of us know in this fight, no one can afford to sit on the sidelines. No one can claim that climate change is somebody else's problem or shrug it off for future generations to address. We are all affected by a warming planet. We see that every day. And decisions being made right now will determine our shared tomorrow. So we must choose and we must act as united nations ourselves. Our progress depends on collective action. On collective ingenuity. If we stick together, we can make fixing the climate the greatest project and greatest achievement of our lifetimes. We have the science, we have the solutions. Now all the world needs is political will. Together, we can create a future where rampant carbon is removed from the atmosphere. Where green buildings and green business transform the legibility of communities. Where easy access to renewable energy enables greater equity. Where sustainable agriculture feeds a growing global population. The needs are urgent. And the costs of inaction are worse than any nightmare. But let us not be driven by, let us be driven by hope not fear. By optimism not despair. Because hope is not passive. Hope is the ultimate source of renewable energy. We are pushing us forward every day to try and try again.",https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dp8PhLsUcFE,5708,2022-10-22 20:38:52
17303," Hope is the ultimate source of renewable energy, pushing us forward every day to try and try again. Today, the Earth Shop Prize Innovation Summit in partnership with Mike Bloomberg and Bloomberg Philanthropies will ask each and every one of us what we can do to accelerate progress to repair our planet this decade and offer solutions on how to collaborate to drive this ambitious but essential climate agenda. We will continue to drive impact around system changing climate solutions and amplify the Earth Shop Prize's call to accelerate progress to repair our planet through collaboration and innovation. But most importantly, we will remind ourselves what can be achieved when we turn pessimism to optimism and optimism into action. We will never break, we will never break, build on our foundation strong enough to stay. We will never break, have the water rises and the mountains shake all our will remain. We will never, no, no. We will never break, have the water rises and the mountains shake all our will remain. Welcome back to the best of the Earth Shop Prize Innovation Summit. The guests featured ranged from heads of state to leaders of grassroots environmental organizations. Well, amongst them was philanthropist and Microsoft founder Phil Gates. Yeah, it's too bad you can't do things overnight in either mitigation adaptation. When I last went through Europe, people were the leaders were all saying, hey, give me technologies so I can tell Putin to get lost. I said, hey, in five years, you're going to be able to call him up. They were like, no, we'd like it. No, it's a year alone. Okay, that, how's your planning permission regime and all the planning for that future grid? Seeds typically between the timing start and they get out in the farmers fields is about eight years. Now, we have a pipeline of innovations. We've been funding the CG system for 20 years now. It's funded about a billion a year. It's if people care at all about adaptation, that thing will be funded at two billion a year. I mean, there won't be anything close to the impact of climate related seeds, climate related maize, rice, wheat, sort of a millet. And thank goodness because of human genetics, we know how to do the editing. Thank goodness because",https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dp8PhLsUcFE,5709,2022-10-22 20:43:08
17304," A's rice, wheat, sort of a millet. And thank goodness, because of human genetics, we know how to do the editing. Thank goodness, because of AI, we know how to find the alleles. Because of drones, we can measure stuff in the field. So there's huge advance in terms of how the whole seed ecosystem moves at full speed. The timing is very tricky here. The warming doesn't stop the day you get to zero emissions. There's a lag in this system. It's about a 20-year lag. So you haven't seen that Earth temperature is not equilibrated to the atmospheric CO2 content. So when you get to zero, it's not like 2051. Take my air conditioner away. No, it starts quite a bit later. And so you have to look at what the peak is. And you can't just plan for OK, 2030, 2030s where your main production in central Africa is down 25%. By 2050, it's down 70%. And you will have switched in most of those areas from a fairly heat-sensitive crop to sorghum. Now sorghum productivity is super low. So we'll get people to do better maize for these next 15 years. And then they are going to have to switch to sorghum. It is tough. When you see the floods impact us down, I mean, nobody expected that. If the goal of climate was to make us pay attention, wow, that is way beyond expectation. So some adaptation money literally will just be disafferable recovery money. The boundary of what's also pretty confusing. I mean, what is food aid? If climate's causing some food production losses, all world-proof program money is that all climate adaptation money? It's certainly the need for it's going up. That's a system that's about 6.5 billion a year. So relative to the systemic solution, which is the research piece, it's relatively larger. But the demand for that piece, which is the acute half a Pakistani rice got flushed away. And so you're going to have malnutrition problems if you don't go in for that. That's also a type of adaptation. And so I do think we're going to bring some rigor to this because the pressure now, the goal of doubling the adaptation money from, they say, 20 billion here, to 40 billion here. The pressure on that is the problem. We still peanuts. No, it's very small. I mean, literally, yeah, if you start sticking food aid in there, you can use it up very quickly, rebuilding after hurricanes. I mean, we had hurricanes before, but the costs there are absolutely gigantic. There are ways of stopping wildfires. There are ways of dealing with sea level rise. So the innovation agenda, not just on seeds, the innovation agenda is going full speed on mitigation. That's where there's 100 companies break through energy is funded. And by mitigation, you mean mostly energy? You mean everything to do with energy? You mean generation of energy? You mean batteries? You mean transport? You mean all of the new? And there are some renewables that are already traditional, but more that need to come on. So that's the package that you're talking about mitigation. Or are you also talking about agriculture as mitigation? Yeah, so every area of emissions, the world tends to focus on past and your cars and electricity. That's not a third of emissions. And so the focus on the easiest third, now 4% of new cars are electric. So that's the field that we're further still long. About 4% of energy generation is wind and solar. And as you triple the size of your grid, you want that to be say, some people would say 100%. Other people might say 70% to 80%. The amount you have to build, we're not within a factor of 5 of the build rate of those. But those are the easy sectors. Cement, clean cement costs over twice as much.",https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dp8PhLsUcFE,5710,2022-10-22 20:47:43
17305," were not within a factor of five of the build rate of those. But those are the easy sectors. Cement, clean cement costs over twice as much as the way we make cement today. And it's not, it's partly the heating energy. It's partly the basic thing, remembering chemistry. When you take calcium carbonate and heat it, you get calcium. That's what makes cement. But the thing that goes away, that's CO2. And so we have to have a way of making cement, which a number of these innovate. And a steel and iron. Yep. There's a whole family of hard to obeyed sectors. That's true. If you get a dead industrial sector, if you get green hydrogen that's cheap enough, it actually solves quite a large number of those. Some of the industrial processes should go straight to electricity. And some you go through, you do your reduction using the hydrogen, where you would have used some hydrocarbon concept before. For steel, we actually have companies doing both. We have electricity steel and others doing electricity is the way of replacing the blast furnace. And then we have others that take hydrogen. And if you get the hydrogen cheap enough, you get the super-magic thing, which is that the green product doesn't cost more. That's called green premium equals zero. And then your adoption scale is utterly different. If we tried to subsidize steel and cement, say rich countries say, OK, we want to get rid of that, which goes to our 15% of emissions, that's greater than all foreign aid budgets put together. And so over 200 billion foreign aid never will pass that number. It's just not politically possible. It's a number that's at about 170 and going down today. Coming up, more from the panelists and finalists here at the Earth's Shop Prize Innovation side. This is Bloomberg. MUSIC Hydrogen has a very special place in the universe. It's the first element on the periodic table. It is the most abandoned element in the universe. And when clean energy advocates think about what can we find, which would be as easy to use as fossil fuels, they think about hydrogen. The fuel that will, when burn, only produce water. MUSIC We like to imagine that if we just built enough of these and these, we could ditch fossil fuels and save the planet. Unfortunately, it's not that simple. There are some things where you just need a good old-fashioned combustible fuel. Now startups around the world are betting that hydrogen can become the fuel of the 21st century. Welcome back to the Earth's Shop Prize Innovation Summit. Finalists of the annual award appeared alongside special guests, including worldwide business leaders, philanthropists, and non-governmental activists. Now, while the 2022 finalists have been announced, have their eyes on the future, and here's what they have to say. This is the Earth's Shop Decade. We are in a race to repair and regenerate the planet. Some will focus on policy. Some will focus on activism. We are focused on supporting the game changes, the innovators, the entrepreneurs.",https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dp8PhLsUcFE,5711,2022-10-22 20:51:55
17306," on policy, some more focus on activism. We are focused on supporting the game changes, the innovators, the entrepreneurs and the problem solvers. We believe in the power of human ingenuity, grit and determination to create solutions that if scaled could repair the planet. We have only 8% of the ocean protected today. Our earth shot is 30% by 30% of the ocean at least. 30% of the ocean protected by 2030. We know that if we protect the right 30%, not only will we prevent the extinction of many marine species, but also we will produce more fish. There's going to be these protected areas going to produce a spillover that will exceed the foregone catch. So we're going to have more fish to eat, food security, livelihoods for people. And we know that for every dollar that we invest in a protected area in a marine reserve that produces $10 in economic output and creates more jobs. So it's a triple win for marine life, for food security, and for climate, and of course for the economy. So that's the goal, the mission, to in the next 8 years, and that's where the earth shot is pretty crazy. In the next 8 years, we need to quadruple all the ocean protection that has ever happened in human history. Are you optimistic that can be done? I am optimistic, there's no choice. I've seen firsthand the potential that a breakthrough idea can hold. And if we start seeing more of these transformative solutions across all the challenges facing our planet and suddenly our earth shot won't seem so improbable, but the work will be difficult. It'll take extraordinary resources, determination, partnership. But we've got all the essentials right here in this room. So what is the challenge? It's the speed, scale, and cost of making these green hydrogen generators. Well, that's exactly what we are working on. Because to make green hydrogen the fuel source of the future, it needs to be cheaper than fossil fuels. And that means, electrolyzers are going to need to be really, really cheap. If you want to take a solution around the globe as quickly as possible, you need to make it standardized, mass-produced commodity. A product that is easy to make and quick to build and cheap as well. And so, while some believe electrolyzers need to be large machines, we believe the electrolyzer should be a standardized, mass-producible product that can make green hydrogen anywhere for anyone. In 2030, we imagine millions and millions of projects on restore, and not just places on earth where we see nature being brought back, but all of the other nodes that are key to ensuring success. So the technology providers, the nurseries, the seed banks, the funders, the government incentive programs, so that we have an ecosystem that really allows us to leverage the many, many connections within the nature-based solution space. And in 2030, we have been focused on another key area, which is cities, and cities require data and insights to take action on climate and to preserve nature, to create more nature and tree canopy. So we've set a goal that we want to- We have more nature in cities, exactly. Exactly, right. And so we've been partnering with cities like Los Angeles to give them insights utilizing AI and geomapping on where all the places that you can create more tree canopy, which reduces urban heat islands, improves air quality sequesters carbon. So we want to bring data and solutions to bringing nature into cities, as well as, of course, preserving and restoring nature. And so one of the goals that we've set is, we want to enable over 500 cities around the world. I know we're going to hear from the mayor of Paris after this to reduce a gigaton of carbon emissions by 2030. And so that's through data, tools, and sites, whether that's evolving transportation systems or planting new tree canopy. So that's a big bold target that we want to see achieved by 2030. Anyway, I guess I'm in the wrong place. I came here to invite all of you to the Grouch Convent.",https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dp8PhLsUcFE,5712,2022-10-22 20:56:20
17307," Anyway, I guess I'm in the wrong place. I came here to invite all of you to the Grouch Convention, but it turns out you're all about my least favorite thing, helping. Oh. You've got me, Oscar. I do like helping people learn how to reuse, repurpose, and recycle. Together, everyone in this room can build a world where nothing goes to waste. And that includes even you. Me? Sorry, my guy. I got to get going to that convention, but just between us. Yes. I do have a recycling bin right next to my can. But no, I think it out OK. It'll ruin my image. But my father believed in the power of the idea. And over time, the vision, the purpose, the courage, it embodied has inspired each generation to take on its own challenges. Not because they're easy, but because they're hard. President Kennedy understood that the effort to land on the moon would bring out the best in us that everyone would have to contribute, that it would require innovation, creativity, teamwork, commitment, and faith. And that world would be better because of it. The Earth Shot Prize has inspired the same spirit of optimism and ingenuity on a global scale to tackle the most pressing challenge we now face, repairing the planet. My family and I are so excited that the Prince of Wales will honor this year's Earth Shot Prize winners in partnership with the John F. Kennedy Library in Boston, a city that is committed to scientific excellence, environmental justice, and the fight against climate change. We're proud that President Kennedy's moonshot legacy still inspires hope. And we look forward to welcoming all of you who are working to ensure a better future here on Earth. And that's all from the Earth Shot Prize innovation summit. You can find complete coverage of the event, including full interviews and articles on bloomberg.com. I'm Francing Lackwap from New York, and this is Bloomberg. So as you look back on your career, what would you say is the best investment advice you've ever received? Probably the best investment advice that I never received, but that I've lived my whole life around, is surround yourself with really good people. I thought about it just today. Like I do many times, what makes a great investor? A great investment firm is comprised of people who are optimists and pessimists and realists. Because in the intersection of the debates that go across that wide range of personalities is where you find truth. It's part of the reason I'm so focused on freedom of expression. I see it my own four walls, the robust and fulsome debates around how we commit our capital, what defines a good idea, what businesses to build or pursue. That's what drives the success at Citadel. And I've been very fortunate in life to have always had a group of friends who really push me, who make me better. And here, I get to work with 3 1,000 colleagues who in their ways make me better each and every day and collectively as a team, we've had the opportunity to have an incredible impact on the financial landscape around the world. Japan's critical role in the global economy is changing as the world recalibrates.

You foresee two-thirds of the crypto hedge funds will disappear. Are we close? The European Union will support and defend Ukraine's territorial integrity. With unmatched reach in resources from more than 120 countries, the moment news breaks 24 hours a day. Bloomberg, you are global business authority. We will never break. We will never break. Build on a foundation strong enough to stay. We will never. So in real life, you're the CEO of Roblox, but on Roblox, you're a builder man. You know that name? We just thought it up when it was maybe two weeks after we launched. And we were all picking our own user names. And everyone picked one. I just said, do you have the same avatar since 2004? That's right. That's awesome. Do you still play? I do. I wish I could play the whole day. I have to be a CEO. So how often do you play? I'm probably on every day, but not as much as I would like. I have four kids. I have a nine-year-old son who's on Roblox. A lot. He said, his favorite games are the tycoon games? Oh, lumber tycoon theme park tycoon. I love all of those. I love all of those. I have a bit of a theory. I have four kids. Oh, you do? Yeah, they're now, they've grown up watching me do this. Yeah. And other, they're pretty savvy social media people, but I'm optimistic someday. They're going to be using Roblox for some other reason, like communicating or more working or something like that. And then they're going to be like, oh gosh, that's like forest to be on Roblox. It's a portmanteau of Roblox and blocks where users can build and play games in a 3D world. Roblox has boomed into a global online gaming juggernaut that kids are obsessed with to the tune of 10 billion plus hours a quarter. In fact, Roblox was building the Metaverse long before Mark Zuckerberg claimed a new name for Facebook. But what does the future Metaverse really look like? And how do we cultivate a civil digital society within it that keeps kids safe? Joining me now on this edition of Bloomberg Studio 1.0, Roblox CEO and co-founder David Bizuki. David's so great to have you here. I really appreciate it and it's wonderful to be with you. Well, I'm a parent, I'm a mom, and so I've been really excited to have this conversation. For parents and anyone out there who still doesn't quite understand, what exactly are kids doing on Roblox? Yeah, kids on Roblox aren't just playing, they're learning, they're hanging out together. When they can't be together in real life, they're hanging out on Roblox. They could be playing hide and go seek. They could be pretending they're running a store or a pizza parlor. They could be making the next big game or adventure. So it's really a wide range of things and it involves doing things together, pretending you're together. So right now it's mostly games or experiences. Four kids, by kids. How old are these players? How old are these developers? We have young players who are getting interested in coding, who are getting interested in designing things. But more and more of the community on Roblox has blossomed into this super rich ecosystem. Thousands of developers making a living on the platform. Some of these developers are making tens or 20s or 50 millions of dollars a year. So how many of these developers are really kids? And how many of these developers are now grownups? Yeah, well, think two million plus developers. A lot of them are grownups and more and more. In addition to the natural organic people that started on Roblox, we're starting to have studios come in on the platform as well. Professional game developers who are developing on other platforms, starting to take a look at it. So our developer demo naturally leans a little bit older, although we've had kids. So we've had kids.",https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dp8PhLsUcFE,5714,2022-10-22 21:05:06
17309," who are developing on other platforms, starting to take a look at it. So our developer demo naturally leans a little bit older, although we've had kids as young as 13. Is there something about preserving the ability for young kids to be able to make games for other kids? I mean, because obviously if you have fancy studios muscling in, does that change the dynamic of the platform? I think it does. One of my favorite experiences is natural disasters. It's been on the platform forever by one of our early developers. It's not the kind of thing that I think a normal studio would ever think of, but when developed by a young creator, we're going to be hanging out together and there's going to be a hurricane and we've got to run away from it. Or there's going to be a lightning storm. Like that kind of stuff, we see a lot of that creative gameplay coming from the younger developers. What were you into as a kid? Were you a gamer? I was kind of a nerd. When I was a kid, I was studied really hard. I luckily grew up in Eden Prairie, Minnesota. At the time, it was out in the boonies from Minneapolis, Minnesota. There were sand pits. And so we did a lot of model rockets and we built go carts. And it was kind of one of these idyllic childhoods. The one key thing that happened to me very early on is we had a computer lab in the school. And then my parents bought me an Apple II at the time. And that kind of got me interested in this. I also heard you were the captain of your high school TV quiz team. Yeah. So think of Minnesota in the 1970s and 80s where every weekend, two different schools compete for students from each school. You know, in a really funny four by four configuration on a quiz bowl thing. And so, yeah, Eden Prairie had a pretty good quiz bowl team. You eventually made it to Silicon Valley. You went to Stanford. You started a company called Knowledge Revolution in the 80s where users could create and test physics experiments. That's right. So the science kid in you coming to life. Yeah. You know, went to school, had a couple hard years with jobs that weren't really that exciting. Took a few months off. And I got really excited about there's this whole blossoming educational software marketplace. The Macintosh had just been introduced. And it was just really interesting and exciting. I did a survey of all of that. And a lot of the educational software was very pre-canned. So when we looked at physics, it was a whole different idea. Could we make a wide open laboratory where you could build anything, any physics experiment, bring it to life, measure it, see what it feels like? You sold that company, made some money, became an investor. And you invested in a friendster. Oh, yeah. Wow. I had a friendster account. I'm dating myself a little bit here, but I had a friendster account. I'm curious what you learned from the early days of social media. Yeah. So one thing I learned is it was really fun to invest, but it's not my sweet spot. Like my sweet spot is trying to build and create things. I remember I think having account number 79 on friends there. And just seeing that wonderful thing of finding other people, friend of friend, playing around with that early user interface. It's a little bit almost thinking of interactive physics where we were simulating the world and then friends there, seeing how important social is. Those are a couple of the components that have come together in Roblox. So when you started Roblox in 2004, what was the idea back then? The feeling of this new category, for me, started feeling almost inexorable. It's a category that people have been talking about in sci-fi for many, many years. We've seen futurists talk about it. We've seen a lot of movies. We were thinking, yes, immersive 3D co-experience. Kids flocked to Roblox during the pandemic. You went public in the middle of the pandemic, 2021, $45 billion market cap. We spoke on that day. Even you have said that kind of growth won't keep up. What kind of growth can we expect from Roblox in normal times? We believe it's going to be a part of all of our lives. It's going to be the way we communicate how people get to go to school and they can't get into school. So they're going to go to school in Roblox? If I happen to be taking my science class and I can't get into the classroom and we're dissecting a frog, we'll probably dissect the frog in something like Roblox and a simulation, which I think is going to be very, very...",https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dp8PhLsUcFE,5715,2022-10-22 21:09:29
17310," into the classroom and we're dissecting a frog, we'll probably dissect the frog in something like row blocks and a simulation, which I think is gonna be very, very powerful. And for our company where there's a lot of people that are gonna end up working all around the world, some of us will be in the office, some won't. Having a common 3D place where we can have those water cooler conversations where everyone has a desk, but we get that serendipitous thing where we both happen to go over and chat. I think also is gonna be very big. Your goal is to build an entirely new category of human co-experience. How do you moderate that on such a massive scale? A lot's happening on Wall Street. I think Cheypahal said things that were indefensible. Need to catch up? This is Bloomberg Wall Street week. I'm David Weston. We've got the information and insights. We think that's the next second shift. From businesses most influential and instrumental. It's knocking it out the bullfrog. It's a challenging dynamic. This is a level of uncertainty that we haven't had to deal with. Bloomberg Wall Street week, live, Friday, with replays all weekend on Bloomberg Television and Radio. When you think of cutting edge technology at sea, you might be thinking of stuff like this. But there's an incoming revolution on the high seas that isn't quite as sexy, but could be significantly more impactful. Container shipping is the key component of global trade. About 80% and 90% of all the world's goods are transported to sea at some point. But there's a significant unseen cost to the modern era of global commerce. About 3% of all the world's CO2 emissions come from shipping. 3% may not sound like a lot, but that's roughly comparable to the entire CO2 output of Germany. Since reducing trade isn't a likely option, what about a technological improvement to help reduce the emissions from these well-stocked maritime behemoths? Everybody is talking about the metaverse as something that's going to happen in the future. But there's an argument to be made that Roblox has already built a metaverse. What do you think? I think we've started. And it goes back to how exciting it is to have a company in this space that I think has ultimately got so many years of growth to it and is a new category following other types of technologies. There's still so much innovation to be done. And there's so much invention to be done in this category that it's mind-boggling. The critics think that metaverse, the term, is just marketing. How do you respond to that? This type of technology is much more difficult than the net or the web, which was another huge thing that we saw predicted and has started to come. But I think we're seeing early signs of it. When Mark Zuckerberg announced his plan to own the metaverse and change Facebook's name to meta, as if it was something new, did that kind of bother you? No, of course not. It's really hard to predict in five to 10 or 20 years. Where do the companies that really figure it out? And there's so many elements of innovation that are needed. Having a UGC community, one of our strengths. We think that's like a huge starting point for us, but we're early in our quest for innovation here. Roblox has built a huge business selling row bucks. Does this evolve into a much bigger marketplace? It was this revelation that people would ultimately make a living on platforms like this that started this digital currency. It's very Roblox-centric in that we're a systems company or a utility. So it has formed this robust economy. It's allowed us to keep Roblox free for the vast majority. Would Roblox ever partner with some of these other companies working on the metaverse, whether it is meta or unity or epic or Microsoft? The core technology of how are we going to ultimately support 50,000 people in real time on a phone, going to a concert together and waving at your friends? I think that's going to be a lot of engineer.",https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dp8PhLsUcFE,5716,2022-10-22 21:13:46
17311," You know, how are we going to ultimately support 50,000 people in real time on a phone, going to a concert together and waving at your friends? I think that's going to be a lot of engineering work that each company is going to be working on and it's going to be really hard. As far as ultimately can an avatar go from one place to another, I think there'll be lightweight ways of starting to think about that. So what role do you think Apple and Android should play in the metaverse? Or would their policies need to change to really support this vision? The biggest thing we would take advantage of if it were to happen is a change in those store fees. We stay out of it. We let Google and Apple kind of run their businesses. But when we think about more and more developers making a living on platforms like us and having to build stuff, if those store fees were to change, we would move most of that money back to our developers. Our goal is to build an entirely new category of human co-experience. The next phase of human interaction. How do you moderate that on such a massive scale? Yeah, it is. And are you doing a good enough job? In the third week when we were live, you can go imagine Eric and myself back in our small office. Eric and I said, oh my gosh, safety and civilities, we're going to have to do it. We had maybe 100 people at the time chatting on Roblox. We saw a few, not that egregious, but early signs. And we just made the call. This is going to be the foundation of what we do in the early years of Roblox. As we've gotten bigger, we've gotten to the point where there's thousands of moderators, every image that goes on our platform gets human-reviewed. We filter texts very stringently, especially for 13 and under players. It's a lot of AI and ML to help do this. We're always getting better, but it is a key thing for us. How optimistic are you about AI and tech being able to do that? I'm really actually optimistic. We would never compare to the real world because our standards are so much more stringent. But I do believe this will just keep getting better and better. And I think over time it'll get to the point where if a six-year-old is on our platform, it's literally as if the parents wanted to be there. With them watching everything, we'll be able to offer that type of thing. Now a lot of parents are terrified. They're terrified of a future metaverse. They don't understand the parental controls. Do you understand that feeling? We do. We actually have to, I think, create a higher standard for us because I think we can't assume every parent is going to get that involved with their kids. There have been some serious content challenges, you know, stories about roadblocks being a playground for virtual fascists. There was just this story about Kim Kardashian's own child seeing an ad for a game that claimed to have a sex tape of her. What happened there? That was very unfortunate. There was a text blurb at very shortly that very, very few people saw. We took the place down, we moderated that user and they're off our platform. It was not the video was never on our platform. There was no imagery on our platform. It was a very short mention, but very unfortunate. Well, you know, our vision is to be the most civil place for everyone. I asked him to arpeachai the CEO of Alphabet in Google this question about kids and tech habits and screen time and he said it's something that even stresses him out. You know, this is the guy who runs one of the most powerful technology companies in the world. I have four kids. You have four kids. Did it stress you out? Like, how did you deal with your kids? I think it highlights how much it's a responsibility of both platforms like us as well as parents. You know, we're all trying to figure this out. I think the one thing that we're very encouraged is that the time spent on roadblocks tends to be more like hanging out together or being on the phone together or doing stuff together and a lot less of it is isolated, either consuming content by myself or grinding away at something by myself. So we do like the fact that most of this is either social or involved in creation. What about entertainment? Would roadblocks ever make a Netflix show?",https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dp8PhLsUcFE,5717,2022-10-22 21:18:05
17312," all then creation. What about entertainment? Would Roblox ever make a Netflix show? No one covers the world like Bloomberg. Because Trussonomics is being dismantled, MPs behind the scenes are asking, what's the point of having her at the top? Can the strong dollar amplify the world's risks of instability? She didn't think that complete reunification must be realized. With unmatched reach in resources from more than 120 countries, the moment news breaks 24 hours a day. Bloomberg, your global business authority. You've been investing in high fidelity graphics. What is the end game here for more human, more realistic avatars? I'll look way out like a science fiction writer and talk about it. And what I'm talking about now is super difficult. The end game, sometimes we talk about, we would go together to a rock concert or whatever concert you like. We would be there with 50,000 other people. It would feel like a movie. It would feel like real life. So are you pushing towards something like meta horizon worlds? Does that sound more experiences like that for adults? We sometimes think of Roblox ultimately as fading into the background as a utility like the electric grid. Even though it's photorealistic and there's all these awesome avatars and connection and identity around the world, the things we start seeing built on this are a wide range of things. So you imagine this not just for kids, but for everyone, adults too. Absolutely. What about entertainment? Would Roblox ever make a Netflix show? We would love it if one of our developers made a Netflix show. So we would feel much more authentic if one of the creators on Roblox who's coming up with avatars and stories and ideas and characters, we want them to be in the limelight. Roblox shares took a dive on the back of Netflix results, which obviously plummeted. Our investors reading too much into the connection there. I think our company is somewhat unique. And what is very exciting to go to work and be the CEO is being in a market like this, where we think ultimately billions of people are going to use this type of technology. And the other exciting thing about this market, there are so many big inventions that still have to happen. It feels like we're pretty mature, but inside our company, we realize there's six or seven big inventions we need to make to get to that next step. Would Roblox ever consider more in-game advertising? Yeah, there's a funny trivia note I would share to all the Roblox fans out there. There was a time, the very first way we monetized was advertising. And then there was also a time when we had pre-roll video on Roblox. That's all gone now. It's gone for a couple of reasons. We didn't want it to interfere with the user experience. And also our virtual economy has become such a powerful way to power this, that we are able to take that down. In the future, though, I think there's a certain type of advertising that is kids safe, that is immersive, that doesn't get in your way. And how do you make sure that doesn't take away from the ethos of what makes Roblox great? Yeah, I think the people on Roblox, they're there to authentically connect with their friends. And as long as what we're doing with these brands is very clear, non-deceptive, appropriate for those ages, I think they'll figure out the balance of how much time do we go into a store.",https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dp8PhLsUcFE,5718,2022-10-22 21:22:20
17313," What we're doing with these brands is very clear, non-deceptive, appropriate for those ages. I think they'll figure out the balance of how much time do we go into a store versus how much time do we go to a crazy adventure tycoon and build an amusement park together. So either way, this could be a huge new revenue stream. I believe it's an awesomely huge revenue stream. And at the same time, we've been very gentle towards it. So as you look ahead, what do you think are the biggest challenges Roblox will face? If our vision plays out, which we hope it does, and we have people of all ages on the platform and we're around the world, I think maintaining that civility as we grow, as we have older people who might want to go to a political rally, thinking ways to do that in a systemic way. That's a big challenge. It takes a lot of thought. I think thinking through the technology, I really like we're very technology driven company. So it's fun to be running a company where we have to do these seven big inventions. And what we're doing right now isn't going to cut it. So knowing that technology challenges, super interesting. We do a little rapid fire section just to get this. No, you will know better. I'm just trying to be as spontaneous as I can. First question, what's your morning routine? Wake up. Go outside on my porch. Do a crossfit workout. Take a shower. Go to work. Where are you most productive? At home or office? Both. Different types of productivity, homes, and state flow state at time, office, connecting, being together, brainstorming. What's your favorite show right now? What are you bingeing? Oh my gosh. If you looked at my YouTube history, it's this weird mechanical stuff, off-road vehicles, and rockets, and ships, and big waves. Best life hack. I think it all gets down to the joy of health, really. Like, if I'm not feeling centered, both sleep, exercise, die, and all of that, everything else just completely falls. You used to have a talk radio show. Yeah. Now that I've met you in person, I get this. No way. I see how you'd be. You've been pretty fond to listen to, yeah. What was your style? Like, what was your jam? So my jam was, I would say, starting in college when I would have insomnia at 2am, I would turn on talk radio. And all those famous KGO people, Bill Wattenberg, and Ray Taliaferro, all that just listened to the people calling in. So after knowledge revolution was acquired, and I had a year, I had a little time to dabble. My jam was really trying to talk about outrageous topics, gambling, other controversial things. It was in a small market in Santa Cruz. I would typically, it was really hard to get people to call in. Yeah. I feel like calling your mom was calling. So it's really scary if you're a DJ. No one's calling it. I made it really controversial. I have people come on and debate interesting topics. If you could have dinner with Steve Jobs or Walt Disney, who would you pick? Both. You can't pick both. I guess I would have to slightly lean Disney, just because he was not just the usher of the innovation, but actually was kind of part of the sum of the innovation. But I think Steve leaned much more on finding the people to drive that innovation. Best advice for your 20s. Don't freak out if between the age of 22 and 25 everything is a disaster. Best advice for your 40s. Life is short. It's such a valuable commodity. Every day, what you do, your friends, your time, your family, it's so important. So how do you define work life integration? I don't like the word balance. Yeah, I would say, can I make my Roblox job better than anything else I would do? Like, can it be better than retiring? Can it be better than a hobby? Can I figure out what my unique job as a CEO? Every CEO job is different? Like, I like doing it. So can I figure out what my role is? You mentioned your co-founder, Eric Castle, earlier, who died tragically of cancer in 2013. If he was here today, what do you think he would think of the Roblox that Roblox has become? Wow, I think he'd be proud. It's a good question. Like, I think he would, you know, his, both of his sons have worked at the company of it.",https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dp8PhLsUcFE,5719,2022-10-22 21:26:44
17314," Be proud. It's a good question. I think he would, you know, his, both of his sons have worked at the company a bit. So yeah, I think he'd be very proud. It seems like you miss him. He's just such a brilliant partner, yeah. And he also set the standard for taking the long view on how we engineer things. A lot of the technology at Roblox is still, like, you know, his vision lives on. And it goes back to your advice for your 40s life is short. It is. So in five years, will the metaverse exist in the form that you imagine or is it going to take much longer? Like, what's the time horizon? Well, it's really interesting, right? Because we're right in the middle of it right now, in a sense, with 50 million people every day on our platform, it's already here. And at the same time, what is ultimately going to be possible could be 5, 10, or 20 years out. So the metaverse really has existed since online dial-up muds, really 2D, very simple text. You could call that the metaverse. It existed in multiplayer gaming, world of warcraft. It exists now with more people. And in 10 or 20 years, it'll exist photorealistically with 50,000 people. You clearly have so much passion for this job. Is Roblox your final stop on your journey? Well, it's definitely my final stop. But I think there's a lot of time ahead of me here.

For something as universally important to human life as sleep, mysteries surrounding its necessity and utility have only just been recently uncovered.

17315," and what happens there can be harness to further expand our understanding. spit back a lot of facts. when and how and why to use that information and that's what you bring figures out while you're sleeping. Water represents one of the biggest threats posed by climate change. That's because rising seas stronger storms and heavier rainfall could massively increase flooding by the end of the century. It's already starting to happen and it's very likely to get worse. Had a traffic flooding in Western Europe after violent storms and powerful flood waters destroying entire towns. It's easy to feel overwhelmed looking at footage like this. It seems like no one has any idea what to do about this problem. So we're just going to see more and more damaging floods year after year. But there is one place where it's possible to imagine a very different future. When you look at the city of Rosadam, the water is in our genes you could say we are already working for a thousand years on this topic. Keeping the water out isn't a new challenge for the Netherlands. It's a battle they've been fighting for centuries. So when the effects of climate change started to crop up, they were like, yeah, let's do this. We're ready. We traveled to Rosadam to find out how this city is getting ready for the future and whether the ingenious stuff they've come up with will ultimately be enough to save them. And hopefully the rest of us too. When you look at Holland or the Netherlands, the name of the Netherlands already says that we are a low-lining country. One third of this country is below sea level and two thirds is vulnerable to flooding. Back in the day, the only things keeping the water at bay were the dicks, which are basically just raised mounds of earth. Once every few decades, the water would overwhelm the dicks and cause catastrophic flooding. And that was just the way things were. Until one day in 1953, all that suddenly changed. It was a disaster. That was five years long and not only on the farm. There was no radio. So people didn't know. They were in war. A powerful storm struck the southern coast, overwhelming dicks that had been badly damaged in the Second World War. On the morning of February 1st, 1953, coast's father and brother woke him up and told him what had happened. They said, oh, everything has water and your mother and sister, I don't know how to see. In 1953, almost 2,000 people died. And that was the moment for us we said this can never happen again. That's the time we started making our first barrier. The flood galvanized the Dutch government to build the world's most powerful flood defense system, the Delta Works. It was a series of modernized dams and storm surge barriers that took more than 40 years to complete. And the final act of the Delta Works is the barrier over here, the Maaslan barrier. Made to protect Rotterdam. We're looking at the biggest, movable storm surge barrier in the world. This is the same size the eye for tower. So you look again in an eye for tower laying on its side.",https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dp8PhLsUcFE,5721,2022-10-22 21:35:18
17316," We're looking at the biggest movable storm surge barrier in the world. This is the same size the Eiffel Tower, so you're looking in an Eiffel Tower lane when it's sight. Most of the time, the barrier stays open so ships can pass through. When a storm comes along, it snaps shut, preventing the storm surge from traveling up river and flooding Rotterdam. The movable design was radical when it was completed in 1997 and it's inspired similar structures in flood-prone cities around the world. It looks as if Petersburg or Russia, a small version of this barrier has been made over there. And maybe in the future, in front of Manhattan, you're thinking about a way to protect that also. So this was the first one, and now smaller versions are coming all over the world. But the barrier on its own isn't enough to keep Rotterdam from flooding. Talking about climate change, we see an increase of more intensive rainfall. We already are facing now intense more skilled flooding, so we need more places where we can store this water. Our nowed Molinar is also working to keep Rotterdam dry, not by keeping the water out, but by giving it a place to go. This is the water square, and it is actually a symbol for our approach, how to become climate adaptive. Under normal circumstances, this square can be used as a well-known well-fledged field. But on days like this, its stores access rainwater and keeps it from flooding the streets. It's a multifunctional solution. We want to add quality to the urban space, but in this way we are also adding water storage. This is the first water square that we have been developing, but it's part of a bigger package of measures. An interesting one close by here is what we call the Duck Park, or the rooftop park, which is a kind of a long levy of one kilometer, and on top of it a huge green park, its storing access of rainwater because of the green roof. Looking at the challenges to climate change, a lot of people think it's going to cost us a lot of space and money, and we try to show that we can also use it to work on a better city. In some ways, the Dutch are just as baffled as the rest of us about climate change. For one thing, there's the question of what happens when sea levels rise beyond a certain point. The Maslant barrier was built to withstand one meter of sea level rise, and a redesigned barrier could potentially handle even more than that. But there's only so much that even Dutch engineering can do. Beyond two meters, it's difficult. We are working on new scenarios, supposed to be more than two meters, four meters, five meters. Then what people ask me, will you be moving on a certain moment and time to the higher grounds in the Netherlands? I can't imagine that that will be a decision. For survivors like coasts on the other hand, it's not so hard to imagine the worst. Nobody will realize that there will be end of nice life here, I think. The old will be refugees. I think in 300 years, rather than we'll still be here. But when sea level rise four or five meters, we all have to find additional solutions. Any idea what does it be? Maybe on a larger scale, invest in floating districts, floating cities. And that brings us to our final and most radical solution.",https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dp8PhLsUcFE,5722,2022-10-22 21:39:38
17317," Maybe on a larger scale, invest in floating districts, floating cities. And that brings us to our final and most radical solution. My name is Kuhn Oldhouse. I'm an water architect. For the last 15 years, we've been building floating homes in cities that face climate change and sea level rise. So we have the floating home, which has a floating foundation, and it can move up and down with the fluctuation of the river. But to keep it on one spot, we have these kind of stilts. The water will come up, you will see it at the house, will move up, up, up, up. And if the water goes down, it just guides us back. 100 years ago, you see cities start to grow up with high-rise buildings because they saw the space in the air. Well, we see the city has to grow in the water. It's not only about houses, it's about floating apartment buildings, floating roads, floating parks, all the kind of urban components you need to make your city more waterproof. Who knows? Maybe someday we'll all live in floating houses. Or maybe something entirely new will come along. Preparing for climate change is a tough challenge, but for the innovators of Rotterdam, it's a process of adaptation that never ends.

17318," The ground began to ship 32 million people here in Tokyo braced themselves for the worst. 8.9 magnitude. Now we know that's a big number. It was the fifth largest earthquake in history. But the real damage comes from the ferocious tsunami that was unleashed. In some areas, the waves reached 40 meters in height, sweeping up everything in its path, including cars and ships, unable to withstand the strength and the power of the surging water. Japan is located in the Pacific earthquake belt. This means the country is struck by some of the strongest earthquakes in tsunamis in the world. In the past decade, about 30 tropical storms have also hit the country each year. These natural disasters kill on average 100 to 200 people per year and take a huge toll on the country's economy. But learning from painful experience, Japan has built one of the world's best natural disaster response systems, which includes regular disaster preparedness drills and early warning alerts. Japanese engineers and architects have also pushed the boundaries of technology and design to create resilient disaster proof buildings. This is Tokyo Skytree. At 634 meters, it's the world's tallest tower. Design for broadcasting and observation, the base of Skytree occupies a relatively small plot of land that isn't ideal for such a tall structure. Adsuo Konishi and his colleagues designed a steel-trust tower, so instead of fighting against the wind, it can simply pass through the gaps between the traces. To stabilize the tower, the team used a traditional Japanese design called Shimbashira that dates back over a thousand years. This is the flexible central pillar of a Japanese pagoda, which stabilizes the tiered wooden structure during an earthquake or typhoon, in a similar way to a tree trunk supporting its branches. A Shimbashira has been found at the center of the world's oldest wooden structure made from a tree filled in 594 AD. For Skytree, the team designed a 375 meter tall concrete core column, connected to the tower's steel outer frame by a series of flexible oil dampers, devices that control unwanted vibrations. The swaying of the core column and outer frame in opposite directions reduce the vibration of the entire tower by up to 50% during an earthquake and 30% during strong winds. This is the center of Shimbashira, which is quite a large part of the top. This is the concrete Shimbashira. This is the tower of the iron structure. This space is used to put Shimbashira in the tower and make the entire tower move. This roof pump has a roof cover, so that the sprayers could be pass through the entire tower. The油 damper is accorded with water, but thanks to the discussion, I would like to give you a chance of the summit",https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dp8PhLsUcFE,5724,2022-10-22 21:48:26

Japanese architects are also experimenting with unconventional building materials for high rises. Skyscrapers are usually built from concrete or steel, because they're strong and cost-effective. But building from wood is more environmentally friendly. Compared with the production of steel and concrete, production of timber consumes less energy and releases less carbon dioxide. New trees can also be planted to absorb emissions. But building tall structures with wood offers up its own engineering and financial challenges. That didn't stop Japanese construction company Myida from trying, though. I'm saying wood is strong, protecting mud.

With a president trying to rescue buyers at the gas pump, earnings trying to rescue troubled markets and a British government just plain needing a rescue period. This is Bloomberg Wall Street Week. I'm David Weston. This week, Special Contributor Larry Summers is on having to make hard choices to get inflation down. If your deficit projection starts to get out of control and your real interest rates start to rise, you can get into a kind of do-lue. And Debra Lair of the Pulsen Institute on whether President Xi's ideology can get China's economy growing again. Xi's facing a lot of headwinds when it comes to the economy. It was a tough time on Global Wall Street, but nowhere was it tougher than at number 10 Downing Street, where Liz Truss is on her way to becoming the shortest serving Prime Minister in British history. Forced to resign after concluding she just couldn't get done, which she'd set out to do. I cannot deliver the mandate on which I was elected by the Conservative Party. I have therefore spoken to his majesty, the King, to notify him that I am resigning as leader of the Conservative Party. It wasn't easy for President Biden, either, as he continued to fight high gas prices for which he largely blamed the oil companies and counted with yet another release from the strategic petroleum reserve. The Department of Energy released another 15 million barrels from the Strategic Petroleum Reserve, extending our previously announced release through the month of December. The markets spent the week looking for some form of rescue from earnings, and they did get a bit of it from companies like Netflix with read hastings giving thanks. Well, thank God we're done with shrinking quarters. So that's a big feeling of we're back to the positivity. But Tesla didn't help much by disappointing on sales, though Elon Musk predicted it would make it up in the fourth quarter. As our factors ran, we're looking forward to a record-breaking queue for. So it's really talking off and wide. It looks like we'll have an happy end of year.

And at the end of what was a wild week, the markets did find similarly finally with the S&P 500 up 4.74 percent for the week, while the NASDAQ was up 5.22 percent. And it was all pretty much driven by anticipation of where the Fed is heading, as the yield in the 10-year climb for much of the week, but after peaking over 4.33 percent mid-day on Friday, it fell to 4.2 percent to end the week. And the two-year, well the two-year fell 13 basis points on Friday alone after speculation grew that the S&P might just slow its rate hikes after November. To take us through the week in the markets, we welcome now Yuri and Timmer. He's director of Global macro for Fidelity Management and Sinal Desai, CIO for the Franklin Templeton Fixed Income Group. Welcome both of you back to Wall Street Week. Good to have you here. Sinal let me start with you because so much of this week I think was driven off of fixed income, particularly those treasury rates. So what did we see this week and why were there so many apparently violent moves up and down? So you know, David, I think that we're going to continue just, it was a crazy week, but it's been several crazy weeks. I think until the market gets a sense of where the Fed is going to go and stop, we're going to keep getting these wild bouts of volatility. We've been expecting it for a while. In a sense, you know, there was not that much of news in the Fed saying that they're close to being done. Well, of course they are. We already know that we're going to get up to five, maybe five point two five, maybe a bit more, but quite early in the new year. It's pretty clear that they will be getting close to an end. We get a 75, maybe we get another 50 after which do we get another 50 and another 25. I think the more interesting thing is what happens after that.",https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dp8PhLsUcFE,5728,2022-10-22 22:05:43
17323," We'll be getting close to an end. We get a 75, maybe we get another 50, after which do we get another 50 and another 25? I think the more interesting thing is what happens after that? Once the market feels that they know that the Fed is not going to pivot on a dime, I think we might get to a point where we stop seeing these wild back and forth because these are truly massive moves in the Treasury market. And I would just note that every single data point is going to carry with it this level of gravity in terms of moves that we see until we get to the stage that the market buys what the Fed is selling. And that is they're going to raise and then they're going to keep it high for a while. And you're in where are we headed? Where is the Fed headed? Because I look at my Bloomberg right now, the Fed futures rate looks like it's about 5.05. At one point this week was up close to 5.2 in terms of a terminal rate. Yeah, so when you look at the so-for-curve, it peaks at around 5% and you look at the implied terminal rate, it's around the same. You know, the markets have been in a relentless mode of price discovery this year, right? And the glass has been half empty for the last nine months where every time we think maybe the markets are bottoming the Fed's going to be close to being done, that moving target starts to move again in the wrong direction. But I do think we're getting to a more glass half full mode and I think that's what the stock market is starting to signal here that at this point, the expectations for the Fed are so bad in meaning they're going to go so far that the possibility of a surprise may start to go more in our favor. So maybe the Fed doesn't have to go all the way to 5. Maybe only needs to go to 4.5. Financial conditions have tightened significantly. So maybe the Fed is closer to being done than we think. But as Sunal mentioned, that's only half the equation, right? Even if we know with clarity where the Fed's going to go and when, whether it's 4.5 or 5 or 5.5, we don't know what the path will look like after that in terms of reverting back to a neutral policy. And we don't even really know what neutral is. Is it 3% is it 3.5? But I think the Fed is pretty committed to getting inflation back towards its target of, let's say, 2, 2.5%. And we're a long ways from that. And so I think the risk is not so much that the Fed overshoots or undershoots in the near term, but that it's going to take longer to get back to a neutral policy after it gets to that terminal point. So you're in. We were talking about this earlier today. And when I listen to what you're saying, I can't help but feel that for most in the market, there is this desperate desire to believe that we have the Fed, that we've had for the last 17 years. And we can't, because the environment is so different than it has been, maybe not last 17, because the last year and a half has certainly been this new world we're living in. But don't you think that a part of the volatility is markets which have become used to dramatic V-shaped recoveries and asset prices? So you miss the trade. So people keep jumping in, suddenly realize it's not going to happen yet. Come out. And so you see these bouts of extreme volatility largely because markets been trained to expect that the Fed is going to step in when it gets too shaky. Yeah, now I agree. And since the financial crisis, the Fed has been able to not so much put the inflation mandate on the back burner, because I don't think it ever is. But it was able to spend most of its time dealing with the full employment mandate. And then when financial conditions were tightening, they could exercise the Fed put, as we call it, of course, and ease conditions and get the economy going. And inflation was never a clear and present danger.",https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dp8PhLsUcFE,5729,2022-10-22 22:10:04
17324," the Fed put, as we call it, of course, and ease conditions and get the economy going. And inflation was never a clear and present danger. And of course, now it is. And ironically, now the Fed is in the position where it needs to not only maybe tolerate a higher unemployment rate, but even have that at its goal in order to compensate for the overstimulation that clearly was happening a year or two ago in the economy with that combination of fiscal and monetary policy. So that Fed put is either gone or out the money. And that does create a different response function in the markets. And so, and again, to the point I made earlier, knowing with clarity, which we don't know anyway, where the Fed's going to go, and whether it's going to overshoot because it waited too long to start tightening policy in the first place. So now, instead of doing too little, too late, it's doing perhaps too much too late. But even then, we don't know how quickly the Fed will be able to go to a neutral policy. And I do think that that factors into valuation, because as you know, short rates, the Fed's terminal rate, real rates are important drivers, not only, of course, of the bond market, but of equity valuations as well, perv the discounted cash flow, and calculating that present value of future cash flows does depend on where rates go, and how far they go up, and how quickly they go back down is going to be an important factor. So now, let me jump in here with a question to you. Is the Fed put ever truly gone? Because we thought maybe a BOE put was gone over the UK, but when the things got really rocking in the guilt market, it had to come back in. What about what happened in the UK? And what does it tell us potentially here as well about the fragilio markets and maybe the need for a sentiment to step back in to give support? So I think that the UK, I'm not going to say the UK historically, we always use that phrase, right, Canary and a coal mine. However, I think in this particular case, the UK, what happened there, is emblematic of what can go wrong. The immediate cause, certainly, was the mini budget, which was quite disastrous, the combination of spending and tax cuts clearly was, it was the wrong time for a budget like that. But we tend to forget it was 17 years again in the making. We've had a very extended period of extremely loose monetary policy, and that forced the UK, where you have a higher proportion of defined benefit, pension plans. The UK is in a different position. Let's put it that way, which is not to say that the US and other countries should not look at the UK and worry about the unknowns. We don't know where markets will break. And the reality is, we are in a position where there is some possibility that something breaks. Will the Fed put, has it gone away? I think the Fed might be left in this completely internally in coherent position that the Bank of England is in, where it's simultaneously buying gilts, but will continue to raise rates. You're in, where it's going to take a little sense. Sorry, go ahead. And exactly, the Fed put, maybe gone for the stock market, but I think it will be coming back for the bond market. And, you know, actions have consequences, right? And policy actions have consequences. And we only have to look to the Bank of Japan to see an example where, you know, they have, you know, the Bank of Japan owns half of the JGB market and has completely tamed the bond market. You know, the annualized volatility of long JGB is three. In the US, the long treasuries have an annualized volatility of about, I think, 12 or 13. And so if you're going to make, you know, fiscal decisions that have wide ranging impact, you know, and you're a central bank that has really dominated, you know, the bond market, as, of course, the Fed has, as the Bank of England has, as the Bank of Japan has, you know, you can't really leave that market. So I think that's how the Fed put is going to reappear, but just in a different market. So now one more here, maybe the Bank of Japan has tamed the bond market. It sure hasn't tamed the FX market. And then on Friday, we got that news at a Nikkei, at least, that they are now intervening to support that yen, which it will be.",https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dp8PhLsUcFE,5730,2022-10-22 22:14:24
17325," Here, maybe the Bank of Japan has tamed the bond market. It sure hasn't tamed the FX market. And then on Friday, we got that news at a Nika at least that they are now intervening to support that yen, which we can so much. We've got the BOJ next week. Tell us about that. What does that mean? Is the yen broken? So, you know, what we're seeing is something we haven't seen in a very long period of time. We have the EU, Japan and the U.S., all the dramatically different monetary policies. You know, so I think about this. And when times were good to, you know, all good markets, functioning markets look the same. And all of these markets, as they're breaking, they're breaking in different ways. And I think that is, that could just, it could, it's never been more apparent than what you see in Japan. The reality is, the yen is moving in line with interest rate differentials with the U.S. You look at U.S. 10-year yields and you look at where Japan's yen is. And I continue to move. Can the bank of Japan actually be, actually, can they control the yen? I have my doubts. You know, they might take some of the air out of it, but ultimately this is a global system which is very interlinked. And the interest rate differential is simply too extreme right now, to simply intervene, to fix it. The other issue, of course, is Japan does not have the U.S.'s inflation issue. And speaking to the size of the bond market that is held, the U.S., depending on what bonds you're looking at, the fair loans between 25 and 33 percent of the bond market, right? So it's huge, it's a huge impact. So now the side, and you're in Timber, are going to be staying with us as we turn to what investors should be doing in these uncertain times. That's going to be next on Wall Street Week on Bloomberg. While Tesla's in the like make for good headlines, the reality is that even if every car on the road today went electric, it wouldn't be enough to curb global emissions to avoid catastrophic climate change. Greenhouse gas emissions from transportation account for about 29 percent of total U.S. greenhouse gas emissions. So what about the other 71 percent? Building across America burned fossil fuels to operate. What we want to do is make that all electric. Instead of burning oil and gas to give us the energy and electricity we need, we want to do 100 percent clean energy, all electric. We want to turn buildings into Tesla's. Just like a Tesla or an electric vehicle is all electric with no fossil fuels, we want to do that with our buildings. If we can do it in one building, we can do it in all buildings, and if we do it in all buildings, we'll reduce 30 percent of U.S. greenhouse gas emissions. Does Governor Reagan now concede that it would be inflationary if we just cut federal taxes and didn't cut federal spending? I don't know whether he does or doesn't, but that's not his program. His program is in fact to cut taxes significantly 10 percent a year over the next three years each year, but also to restrain the growth in federal spending. That of course is Lewis Rokhizer talking with a pre-chairman, Alan Greenspan on Wall Street Wait 1 minute...",https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dp8PhLsUcFE,5731,2022-10-22 22:18:44
17326," each year, but also to restrain the growth in federal spending. That, of course, is Lewis Rukhizer talking with a pre-chairman, Alan Greenspan, on Wall Street Week back on October 24, 1980, back when Alan was simply part of Townsend Greenspan and company. It was just before Governor Reagan was elected president, and the concern back then was about tax cuts without spending cuts, something that, frankly, we're still talking about today. The top movie back then was Goldie Hahn's private Benjamin, and Woman in Love. You remember it? By Barbara Streisand, top the billboard, Hot 100, Chart for the Week. Still with us, Arsenal Desai of Franklin Templeton, and you're in Timber of Fidelity Management. So, let's start with you. What's an investor to do in this environment? Where we do have inflation that seems to be broad, maybe entrenched, we have a Fed that's on the move. What does an investor do? What's overpriced? What's underpriced? Well, you know, the good news is, in a period where there isn't very much of it, is that both the 40 and the 60 side of the 60-40 paradigm, I think are now, you know, really attractively valued. I mean, you can get a 10-year yield at a 10-year note at 4.2, a two-year note at 4.5. You can buy the S&P 500 at around 15, 16 times forward earnings. Now, that PE is only as good as the forward earnings, so we will find out whether the earnings hold so far they have. So valuations have had a tremendous reset from the overvaluation days, you know, following the COVID lockdown when the Fed basically repressed interest rates down to much lower levels than they really deserve to be. And that raised asset price inflation in the stock market, because again, interest rates are an important factor in valuation. And so it's been a very painful nine months during which neither the 40 nor the 60 has worked. That's a very unusual environment to be in. But I think, you know, the good news is that if the Fed does overshoot, I think the 40 will really present a lot of value at 4% plus yields, and maybe the 40 will start becoming negatively correlated again to the 60. And if our recession is averted, then the 60, I think, will do well because earnings then will likely hold up. And valuations are now much more reasonable. So for me, the glass half full, you know, view here is that at least one of those two engines is going to start working. I can't tell you which one it is, unfortunately, but I do think it's not going to be any longer this monolithic market where basically nothing works. So now, when will the bond market be the engine that starts working? Are bonds getting cheap enough now? There's time to go back in. They're beginning to look interesting. I'll just put it this way because if I look at investment-grade bonds, I look at short paper, you know, we just discussed, her interest discussed that we were talking about 4.4, 4.5. I think we're getting to interesting levels. We're seeing something, finally, that we haven't seen for, again, close to 17 years, fixed income, delivering income. What a concept. I think income becomes more and more important as we look forward. I do think that 10-year yields are likely to still go up. But having said that, it does start becoming attractive. So over the coming weeks and sorry, coming weeks and months, I think the first step would be areas like investment-grade because you're getting paid healthily to hold good credit. And our baseline is not to have a steep recession. We'll have a recession, but I think we might be able to avoid a steep one, which means that fundamentals can still look good. And furthermore, if I look in areas like high yield and emerging market, we are now getting paid between 18-10% in these areas, which means that finally, liquid fixed income starts becoming a very decent alternative to alternatives, which up till now have really been the only area in the last multiple years that could deliver those style of return. So I actually am also gloss-hawful at this point for the first time in quite a while. You're in just coming back to you and just kind of cash flow away of looking at stock valuations. As I understand it, in fact, you've taught me. In fact, the Fed has been buying bonds, but they've also been buying tips. Is that skewing that?",https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dp8PhLsUcFE,5732,2022-10-22 22:23:01
17327," In fact, you and discounted cash flow way of looking at stock valuations. As I understand it, in fact, you've taught me. In fact, the Fed has been buying bonds, but they've also been buying tips. Is that skewing that as a measurement? Yeah, it's interesting you mentioned that, because I'm trying to figure that out actually in my latest research, because the Fed owns 33% of the Bloomberg tips index. So that may not be all of all tips. So the overall number will be less than that. And so it makes you wonder whether there's any price signal left. But when I compare, for instance, the tips break even to the inflation swap market, which is a direct swap, I don't really see a tremendous amount of price distortion from the Fed owning so many tips. And of course, the Fed owns a bunch of nominals as well. So maybe one cancels out the other. So I think the jury is still out, but clearly the tips market is saying a different message than the headline inflation numbers are, because the tips break evens are around two and a half across the curve. And that's totally different from an 8% CPI. It's a great discussion. I really owe it to both of you. Thank you so much. That's Sinalda Sy, a Franklin Templeton.

It's time to look ahead at next week on Global Wall Street, starting with Juliet Sally in Singapore. Thanks David. China's closely watched party congress wraps this weekend and investors will be awaiting the likely release of GDP and activity data that were delayed during the meetings. When the reports finally land, Bloomberg economics expects them to show an anemic third-quarter recovery. Elsewhere, the Bank of Japan will likely stand pat on its ultra-low interest rate and asset purchases, despite a plunge in the yen that's driving up import costs. And in Australia, the central bank's preferred measure of core inflation is likely to hit a 31-year high. It is a big week for European earnings. It's an even bigger week for European bank earnings. We've got a whole range of numbers, including HSBC, UBS, Unicreddit, Standard Chartered, Barclays and Deutsche Bank. But the big one really comes on Thursday with the numbers that we're going to get from Credit Suisse out of Zurich. But the numbers are not going to be the focus. The focus will be the upgraded strategic plan. The management is also expected to announce on Thursday.",https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dp8PhLsUcFE,5733,2022-10-22 22:27:37
17328," But the numbers are not going to be the focus. The focus will be the upgraded strategic plan. The management is also expected to announce on Thursday in Zurich. In Frankfurt that day, we have the ECB on deck as well. We are expecting the ECB to hike by circa 75 basis points. We're also potentially expecting the ECB to deliver some changes to other policies, including the cheap loans it offers to banks in the form of teletros. We could see some shifts there as well. Friday, we get the industrials, we get Airbus, and we get Volkswagen. More than 160 members in the S&P 500 are scheduled to report earnings next week. That includes big tech companies, Apple, Microsoft, Alphabet, Meta, and Amazon. There will also be earnings from UPS, Chipotle, General Motors, Kraft Hines, and McDonald's. Economic data include the U.S. government's first estimate of third quarter GDP. Crost domestic product did contract in both the first and second quarters of the year, but is projected by economists to have reversed that trend, rising by more than 2%. The week rounds out with Friday's release of the personal consumption expenditures data, which the Fed uses for its inflation target. That data expected to show a continued re-exceleration in consumer prices. David? Thanks to Julius Sally, Guy Johnson, and Romaine Bostic. Coming up, what ails the Chinese economy, and does President Xi have what's needed to fix it? We're going to talk with Deborah Lair of Edelman Global Advisory. That's next on Wall Street Week on Bloomberg. I think that it's hard to put your head around any narrative. Let's just be honest. We've had sort of a shift in, are we in some sort of circulation fears? Moments people were talking about that all day yesterday. So what's the best investment advice you've ever given by anybody? The compound interest, the compounding of returns is an incredible miracle of business, finance, and human existence. Everything you learn is additive every day, and if you keep at it and don't quit, it's an incredible miracle. And it's not just interest. It was always said about compound interest returns, compound business returns, compound human returns. They're all very additive because you learn every day. And if you keep at it, it's very, very helpful. In your observation of investors, what do you think is the biggest mistake that average investors make? Selling it the wrong time. And they sell when the prices go down? Yes. Or not keeping, but people have conviction, or they invest for the, if they invest for the right reasons, just keep at it.

Bloomberg crypto Tuesdays. 10 Years of Remarkable Growth 10 Years of Remarkable Growth. That's what President Xi Jinping of China focused on in his speech to the party Congress last Saturday. What's he talking about? A historical rise.",https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dp8PhLsUcFE,5734,2022-10-22 22:31:50
17329," Growth. That's what President Xi Jinping of China focused on in his speech to the party Congress last Saturday. It brought about a historical rise in China's economic strength. In the past decade, China's GDP has grown from 55 trillion to 114 trillion and come to account for 18.5% of the world economy. It's a bad track record during Xi's time in office, but if President Xi had been willing to go back to before he was President, the story is even more dramatic. Since Deng Xiaoping initiated the Open Door Policy in 1978, China's economy has gone from under $150 billion to nearly $18 trillion last year. Now that growth is slowing down, with possible repercussions for the rest of the world, according to the head of the WTO. With China's economy continues to slow, the way we are seeing that will have a big impact on what happens to the world economy. And US officials like Deputy Treasury Secretary Wally Adyemo say that the Open Door isn't as open as it used to be. In addition to having resilient supply chains, we want to make sure that American companies are competing on a level playing field with companies in China and around the world, and that's why we've taken actions like restraining the ability to ship some key components. The bridge waters Ray Dalio, who's been back and forth to China over the last 30 years, insists that despite all the problems, he wouldn't bet against Beijing over the long term. I think the longer term picture in China is still bright, because I know the people and I know the culture and I think it's good, but they have major issues now. And when it comes to China, the person we turn to here at Wall Street Week is Debra Lair. She is the CEO of Edelman Global Advisory and Executive Director of the Pulse and Institute. Debra, welcome back. Good to have you. We are all focused on President Xi and what's going on over in Beijing this week. Give us your sense about what we're learning. It strikes me that one of the biggest challenges he has is the economy and growing the economy. And yet I'm not sure we're hearing much about his economic policy. I hear a lot about politics, a lot about security. That's right. I mean, Xi Jinping gave his all-important work report at the beginning of the plenum. And it gave a few previews of how he's going to start to look at the economy. One of the things that he's emphasizing is common prosperity, his slogan about how he brings greater equality. One of the things that he's looking at is also how the party can continue to play an important role in the economy. And also he did give reassurance to foreign companies that they will continue to push for market opening in key areas. So will we get a sense from the personnel that surround him of where it might be headed? Because as I understand it, eventually we will see him come out from behind the curtain. We assume every day assumes that he will get his third term. But there's going to be a critical question of who's with him as he comes out. Absolutely. The important thing, and we're all watching for this weekend when the new party lineup is going to be announced. There's a lot of rumors starting to fly around, although not as many as there usually are. But it's a big guessing game because that will give us really our first clue into what the third term is going to look like. And I think there are three important things to watch. One is going to be what happens to Lika Chang, the current premier. Does he continue to stay on the standing committee? He's turned out of staying on as the premier, but could they make him the number two in head of the National People's Congress? Two, who will be in the lineup to then take the premier position? And the two leading candidates appear to be Wang Yang, who's viewed as being more open on the economic issues, and Wang Hunyeng, who really is an idiotia log. And the third to watch is what happens to Liolkhah, who's currently the vice premier, who's in charge of the economy and finance. Does he stay? He has good relations with many foreign firms, or who really comes in to take his portfolio. Debra, one of the things that we watch in the West, and we may be right or wrong in watching it, is the extent to which the markets in some way play a substantial role in economic policy over there. It strikes me that it's possible to interpret President Xi thus far as moving somewhat away from the markets. A lot of what he emphasis right now is idiotia log.",https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dp8PhLsUcFE,5735,2022-10-22 22:36:00
17330," substantial role in economic policy over there. It strikes me that it's possible to interpret President Xi thus far as moving somewhat away from the markets. A lot of what he emphasis right now is ideology. And I think it's what he came out of more than perhaps we've seen in the past. Absolutely. We're seeing much more emphasis on ideology under Xi Jinping. And if we look back under Jackson Min, Jackson Min was saying the party is big enough to include business. Xi takes it in a different way. He says the party is all encompassing and it should be forced into business. And so ideology is playing a much bigger role. Also we need to keep an eye on how Xi's favorite slogan, common prosperity is going to be implemented. China, surprisingly, is actually much more unequal than the United States. And one of the things that he's trying to do through this common prosperity slogan is to say there should be a cap on executive salaries. We should be looking at big companies, particularly the private sector giving back to the community. And how that's going to be implemented at the same time when he's trying to grow the economy, when he's trying to encourage entrepreneurship and create jobs is going to be a very tough thing for him to balance. Well, I was going to ask exactly about that, Debra, because through history, a lot of people have said we should have more equality, less inequality, whether it's income or wealth. But a lot of attempts to get that done actually do get in the way of growth overall. Absolutely. I mean, in China, and we've talked about this before, the overwhelming majority of Chinese companies are small and medium-sized enterprises. It's up into the 90s. They are responsible for about 60 percent of China's growth and about 60 percent of job creation. And so if you can't create the right atmosphere for them to grow, you're going to have a significant impact on China's ability. And right now, she's facing a lot of headwinds when it comes to the economy. He's got issues still to deal with with the real estate market. It's one of the only places that Chinese people can invest. And obviously, housing prices are going down at the moment. The world is facing a global recession, and she is still very dependent on exports to grow the economy. He needs to find a way to unlock consumer spending. And that's very hard to do when you don't have confidence in the path of the economy, and particularly when you don't have the kind of social safety nets in place, particularly around health, that make people feel comfortable enough and have confidence to spend their money. If you put it in the longer course of Chinese history, because you've been really very active in China for a good long time now, are we seeing something of a turn back toward Mao in a way from a Deng Xiaoping? Well, certainly we're seeing a difference in the way that she is governing the economy. The Chinese Communist Party has about 93 million members. And to put that in context, that's 10 million more people than the whole population of Germany. And he used this as the way to govern the economy. And so therefore, the party is involved in every aspect. As we look at this new leadership coming in, watching the ideology versus the technocrats is going to be really important and give us a sense of what the government appointees, which will take place next March, will look like, and how they're going to approach the economy. Is there going to be this emphasis on a more socialist economy? Or are they going to be more emphasis in what they call the socialist market economy? The fact that they didn't put out the GDP numbers this week on time, I think is very disconcerting. For the world's second largest economy to place politics over just the standard transparency of publication of data is not an encouraging sign. Debra, looking into your crystal ball there, what do you think this might mean for U.S.-China relations? I mean, it strikes me at least that, going back five or ten years, a lot of it was about economics. It was about trade, things like that. Only from Beijing, but also from Washington, when they talk about one another, it's about geopolitics. It's about Taiwan. It's about Russia. It's about security in the Asia area. Well, national security definitely dominates the headlines. And there are some very serious issues that we're dealing with. I was just in the UK and they were telling me Taiwan didn't even use to really be on this. Because it wasn't a great solution when it wasakan, when the Sweden community did a great deal.",https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dp8PhLsUcFE,5736,2022-10-22 22:40:25
17331," He definitely dominates the headlines. And there are some very serious issues that we're dealing with. I was just in the UK and they were telling me Taiwan didn't even use to really be on their agenda. And now they're spending about 75% at their time. These are the China experts focused on this. So those are absolutely definite, important issues to watch. But I think the real story here is gonna be what happens with the economic and trade relationship. Traditionally, it's been the foundation of the relationship. And it's created the people to people ties and built some levels of trust. Without these exchanges with Western companies reconsidering both because of the politics, but also because of the state of the Chinese economy and the complications that have come with dealing with COVID-0, they're reconsidering their strategies. And not having that level of trust, I think really is going to have an impact and ensure that there are going to continue to be fraught relations between the United States and China. Do you have Deborah Hoap's, if not expectations, that after we're through the party congress and maybe actually after they meet in the spring and confirm that he's president of the country, that that will free President Xi up to reach out to the United States or will it embolden him to become even more assertive? Well, I think once we know what the lineup looks like, I think it's gonna be easier to answer that question. I think whatever happens on the political front, Xi Jinping needs to find a way to grow his economy because his power both internally and internationally stems from their economic might. China right now is the largest trading partner to 70% of the world. The US used to have that role 20 years ago. And in order to maintain that, he has to show that he can grow the economy and he can't grow the economy through ideology. He has to grow it through basic economics. Okay, Deborah, it's always such a pleasure to have you here. You are really our China expert, that's Deborah Lair, and she is CEO of Edelman Global Advisory. Thank you for having me. Coming up, we'll wrap up the week with our special contributor, Larry Summers of Harvard. This is Wall Street Week on Bloomberg. Beat the applause for入東京音一个 Okay, so you're moving in on me quick. Just stradzing me with your fancy hands. I'm going to deal with your night because it's really bothering me. Ah, my night. Yeah. He's a troublemaker. Yeah. What did you get up to this weekend? You know, just robot stuff. A lot of chess. I was practicing for, uh, for you. I know you're pretty good. Ooh, I don't like that. I will take this. Oh, put it over here here. Not cool. Not cool.

So thank you so much for being with us, Larry, once again. Much of the week was consumed with the...",https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dp8PhLsUcFE,5737,2022-10-22 22:44:46
17332," The truth on Wall Street Week is Professor Larry Summers, of course, former Treasury Secretary. So thank you so much for being with us, Larry, once again. Much of the week was consumed with the drama over the United Kingdom, which is good and serious business for people who are living in Great Britain. But what lessons might it have for the rest of us? Look at one level, Britain is unique. They went through Brexit. They've had some unique political challenges that have taken place within their Tory party. We've rarely seen the kind of extreme incompetence that was represented by the original trust proposals. But I think there are two lessons that policymakers around the world need to heed. The first is that things can change extraordinarily fast if you lose credibility. Just as it takes a long time to grow a forest, but you can burn it down very quickly, something similar is true with respect to credibility and confidence. And I think at a time of rising government debts and rising interest rates, that's a lesson to be careful that policymakers in many different countries need to take a counter. I would say the second, more specific, lesson just goes to the potential instability in government debt markets. And that's got both a macroeconomic aspect that if your deficit projection starts to get out of control and your real interest rates start to rise rapidly, you can get into a kind of doom loop. And it also has to do with liquidity in the markets. And the possibility that you'll get a situation where they'll be selling, but there won't be buying, which will be get a kind of liquidation cycle. And I think given the magnitude of the increases and interest rates that you're seeing in other parts of the world, that's something that policymakers are going to have to be very careful of. And Terry Yellen was right to warn about issues around illiquidity in the U.S. treasury markets. I think we're going to need to be watching our own fiscal projections in the United States very carefully, because I think they're going to look different with current market interest rates. If you factor in the recession, it's likely to come. That's going to have some significant effects. If you factor in all the different steps that are being taken, whether it's the student loan debt relief or the emergency funding that's going to take place because of the hurricane in Florida or the increases in national security expenditures that I think are almost inevitable. Given what's happening in other parts of the world, I suspect that the fiscal issue is going to need sooner or later to be back on the table in the United States. So I think that we can be amused, those of us who don't live there by some of the things that are happening in Britain. But if we think of it as an experience that's entirely outside of any kinds of concerns that other countries could have, that would be a real mistake. Well, and Larry, as you say, we have to perhaps pay much more attention to the fiscal side, be a bit more responsible. That's at the same time that many people, and you included, are warning that we may well be heading to a recession here. In the past several years, it's thought that if there's a recession, we can just write some fiscal checks for it. If we don't have the ability, that way it turns out Liz Truss did not have over in the United Kingdom, what does that mean of our ability to pull out of it? What is the prospect that when we've had so many years of feast, we may be handed for some famine on higher interest rates, lower growth and lower productivity increase?",https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dp8PhLsUcFE,5738,2022-10-22 22:48:57
17333," What is the prospect that when we've had so many years of feast, we may be handed for some famine on higher interest rates, lower growth and lower productivity increase? Look David, there's always a tendency at the beginning or in the early stages of very problematic periods to assume that everything is going to be resolved much more quickly than actually proves to be the case. Think about COVID. I was early on your program and was very worried about COVID, but I certainly didn't envision that it would be something that would still be on people's minds going into the winter of 2023. And I think it's a mistake to think that all of our economic challenges are going to be met quickly, particularly if we heed what I think would be the dangerous advice that are coming from the erstwhile members of Team Transitory that the Fed can back off already and not carry through on the increases that the market is now expecting. I think for that to happen would be to almost guarantee a protracted period of stagflation as we had both we lacked both price stability and confidence. I think we need to remember that apart from anything we do with discretionary policy, we have a whole set of natural stabilizers that kick in in our economy as the economy goes down, tax collections go down as unemployment crosses certain thresholds, their increases in unemployment insurance payments. But unfortunately, I think we fired the fiscal canon so strongly that there's going to be limited room for discretionary fiscal policy if we have another recession. Finally, Larry, one of the other events of the week was the release for the release from the strategic petroleum reserve by President Biden, who swears this is not a political issue, but could you give us the economic potential effects of those sorts of releases? David, I think the initial sprow release was a powerful thing that over the last months has done a lot to contain oil prices. And I think the Biden administration was exactly right to do it strongly, do it for a long time, do it in coordination with others. I think it's much less clear how much scope there is for that policy to work further going forward. In part, that's because of the many of the constraints are on the refining side. In part, that's because what it's a little bit like QE for the Fed, whatever you put out there, you're going to have to get back in at some point. And that's going to have the opposite impact on oil prices. So I think you've got to be careful about that instrument from here. And I think that we've all got to be very apprehensive about the degree of confrontation that now exists between the United States and what might be called the Russian Saudi axis. This is going to be a very complex time. And I hope that we get through it while avoiding oil price spikes. My guess is that that's going to happen. But I think that's a major downside wild card from here, both with respect to inflation and with respect to recession. Okay, Larry. Thank you so much once again for joining us on Wall Street Week.

17334," Coming up, what's up and down with Great Britain? Bloomberg Stephanie Flanders gives us one more thought on a wild and wacky week for the British government and the economy. That's next on Wall Street Week on Bloomberg. How ever you get your news. This is Bloomberg Daybreak, but thanks. On Bloomberg Daybreak. Welcome to Daybreak Australia. This is Bloomberg Technology. I'm the Bloomberg Crypto. On TV, radio and the web. This is Bloomberg. When US jobs numbers are released, Bloomberg brings you crucial data at terminal speed and instant expert analysis. Nobody covers jobs day like Bloomberg. Markets are preparing to close, but the day is not over yet. Talk that is now up about 45%. A lot of volatility, right? You need the power of the Bloomberg terminal to get you market moving data before anyone else. You need a much higher than expected. Operated today to overweight. You need top analysts to bring you exclusive global insight into cross-asset markets. The mini bond market. Titan is a really big focus. This one ain't playing along today. It's going to be a short term. Bloomberg markets the close weekdays on Bloomberg. Only one more thought. I think Liss Trust started off with the right idea, which was the UK has been held back by Brexit and Britain. Something that wys一些 has put in place. households through a massive energy squeeze as we approach the winter. I think the problem for financial markets is that the government showed no willingness to engage with the difficult trade-offs that all governments are facing in this environment where they want to stimulate growth, they want to help households face rising energy bills, but they don't want to make it harder for the central bank to bring down inflation and they don't want to be building up a lot of debt just at a time when we know the cost of money, the cost of borrowing all around the world is going up. So it was not what she did, but the way she did it and the kind of gay abandon with which the government was proposing tax cuts that were not funded by any form of spending constraint and not targeted to the people who in this particular environment needed help the most. And then we also saw in the UK there had been this nervousness in financial markets that maybe dates back to the Brexit referendum that some of the constraints, the institutional constraints on policy makers in the UK that had prevented silly politicians from doing silly things that those have been worn away in the years in the tumult since Brexit. I think what happened when you saw the new Chancellor installed, the seventh since 2016, you saw potentially those institutional constraints come back, but the Treasury, the Bank of England, is still in charge. That's the message to markets, even if politicians are still messing around at the edges. There's a lot of Shadden Freude, potentially, and certainly there, but for the grace of God go high.",https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dp8PhLsUcFE,5740,2022-10-22 22:57:47
17335," the message to markets, even if politicians are still messing around the edges. There's a lot of Shaddon Freude, potentially, and certainly there, but for the grace of God, go I, central bankers and treasury officials around the world, they are looking at the UK and wondering what's happened to this previously great nation, but they should also be looking at potential pitfalls that they too will face as we go into this environment in which interest rates are going to be higher, the cost of government borrowing is going to be higher, and potentially strains are going to be put on financial markets. We saw a particular investment strategy, the liability driven investments in the UK, which are particular to the UK, mess up the pension market, force the Bank of England to intervene, but we know we saw similar fragility in the US treasury market back in March of 2020, and there may be other things out there that we should be nervous about. As we see this very significant shift to a higher interest rate environment. That does it for this episode of Wall Street Week. I'm David Weston, this is Bloomberg. See you next week. This is a market that over the past few weeks has made it clear it wants to go higher, and it's going to be a big deal. Imagine simply climbing a cable into space. The concept is known as the space elevator. Not only could it significantly change how we leave planet Earth, but it could also completely transform humanity's relationship with space. And there are scientists who think we could have already built it. We have the material, we have the technology, we have the lasers, we have the climbers, we have all of it. If a private entity wants to build it, or a government, they can build it. It'll change society. We have no clue how colonizing in the space, how really spreading on the space, really changed our society over the next 50 to 200 years. It'll be completely different. How are you? I think that was more last year. I don't think so, but I think it's like any time that frankly it's when a lot of other people get into crypto, right? Other audiences too.

Katie Han soon realized this new technology was much more than a tool used by criminals. She dove deep and became a crypto convert, swapping her prosecutor hat for a board seat at Coinbase. It became the first female general partner, Adventure firm and recent Horowitz. Han, now a prolific crypto investor, recently launched her own fund with one and a half billion dollars to deploy. It's the largest fund ever raised by a single investor. Joining me on this edition of Bloomberg Studio 1.0 CEO and founder of Han Ventures, Katie Han. Katie, it's so great to have you. Great to be back here in the studio with you, Emily. I want to start with a vibe check. Okay. What's the state of the crypto cycle are we in right now? It was hot. Yep. And then it got pretty cold. Well, look, Emily, zooming back because I've been in crypto for a decade, if you can believe it. We've seen crypto be really hot and then all of a sudden not. And so we've seen this before. However, I think one of the things that's a little bit different now is with each new crypto cycle, more and more people come into it. And so it's more and more pronounced each cycle. And I would push back on it's not. I think it depends on what area of the ecosystem you're looking at. We think developers think crypto and Web3 is still really hot. I am seeing a lot less of those. We're all going to make it hashtags. I am seeing a lot less of them too, although I am spending less time on Twitter. So maybe that's why. But with each cycle, there are new acronyms. What hasn't happened is a crypto winter in the midst of kind of really serious global macro conditions. So we have inflation kind of at record highs for our generation, in our lifetime. And then we have also a war that's broken out in the Ukraine. And we have a number of other factors going on here. So that's very different. There was some serious carnage out there. Yeah. Socius, Luna, three-houros. What's been your takeaways from all of that? I don't want to sit here and tell you that algorithmic stablecoins are bad. Because I actually think they're really interesting. However, I think what happened is you had, in this case you mentioned, Luna and Tara. You know, that was an algorithmic stablecoin that was getting pretty widespread adoption relative to what the tech could do. I didn't realize you spent your teenage years living in Egypt and learning Arabic. Yeah. Tell me about your upbringing. I was always uprooted. My dad worked for a large company and we were always moving just when I would get comfortable in one space. And I think actually that's pretty important if you fast forward and look at my career, I'm comfortable being in uncomfortable situations. You know, I didn't know a lot about venture when I got into it initially. I didn't know a lot about crypto when I got into it initially. And I was okay asking questions. I was okay not knowing the local acronyms or the Namanclature of a particular field. And I'm, you know, I'm taken right back to my teenage years in Cairo moving from Houston, Texas one day to downtown Maddie in Cairo the next day. You studied law. I did. You clerked for Supreme Court Justice Anthony Kennedy. That's right. You became a federal prosecutor. You were taking on prison gangs and the mafia. That must have taken a really thick skin. I was doing it at age 25. And now if I kind of take a step back and you know, I think that happens at different points in your career. Like, whoa, if I would have analyzed that a little more at the time and I'm kind of in some ways glad I didn't. I just dove right in because I felt fascinating. There was a human aspect to it and people's stories. And I felt like those stories mattered. So I was drawn to criminal law and became a federal prosecutor. And I did cases involving violent crime. But then really mistriing cases, being back in the courtroom, being before the grand jury. Like the prosecutor you would see on TV going to try those murder cases. Doing those two hour closing arguments. That's right. And so moved out here to California.

Outlaw motorcycle gangs, hostage taking, bank robberies, armed bank robberies. There was really not a kind of criminal case by that point in my career. I hadn't done it. It was right around that time, 2012. One of my bosses came in and said, let's have that same energy that you brought to those gang cases to those murder cases. And let's go ahead and have you investigate this new criminal technology that we really need to look into and possibly shut this down. So you created the first cryptocurrency task force. How would you describe it? Fortunately, several of us in the government realized at the time it's not possible, also not desirable. Because Bitcoin is not an entity. It's not a person. Right, it's a protocol. And it would be like saying, let's go shut down cash. Let's go shut down the internet. It's not possible. Probably wouldn't be a good idea either. I was using crypto and technologies like the Bitcoin blockchain, because that's all the things that existed then. This is 2012, 2013, to actually uncover criminal activity. So I didn't think that that technology was bad. Frankly, it was a tool that helped me uncover the various activity. And by the way, it was a step level function improvement better than compliance by banks. I'll just go ahead and say it. That's a little bit controversial, but I had spent a decade subpoenaing large financial institutions. And five times out of 10 didn't get back what I needed. One case I worked on, and people always say, oh, you shut down the Silk Road. What actually happened? I was looking into something completely, not having to do with anything at all of the Silk Road and came across some, what looked to be some kind of odd activity. And it turns out that a couple of federal agents on the Silk Road Task Force out of Washington, DC, were cropped. And that is the case that I ended up in dining, and I ended up prosecuting those agents, and they both went to prison. So that's the aspect of what Silk Road case that I worked on. I would never have been able to uncover that criminal activity by those agents, because they were federal agents. They knew how to cover their tracks. Had they not used Bitcoin blockchain. So that technology right there, if they had just used wires or cash or bank wires, we would never have uncovered that. Just how hard is it to launch a crypto fund from scratch?

We make it very transparent to the shopper before they accept an order. What's the order that's going to look like? How much work are going to pay them? And how much consumer is paying them? And so they can decide whether they take an order or whether they refuse it. And that's the kind of flexibility that our shoppers really value and the kind of transparency that they want. Are you seeing a labor shortage right now? And what are you doing to combat that? It's different in different places. All demographic of shoppers is completely different from food delivery and our right sharing, where 70% women and half of them are moms. And that's because a lot of the job at Instagram is very different than just being in a car with strangers. It's about like going to the store, doing a good job of customer service of really picking the right product for the consumer. And we are seeing that being very appealing to women. So you became kind of a crypto convert after this. You joined the board of Coinbase very early on. How did you and Coinbase and Brian Armstrong come together? I hosted an event here in San Francisco at the Federal Reserve Bank. And I believe it was there that it wasn't.",https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dp8PhLsUcFE,5743,2022-10-22 23:10:45
17338," you and Coinbase and Brian Armstrong come together? I hosted an event here in San Francisco at the Federal Reserve Bank, and I believe it was there that it wasn't just Brian, it was a lot of what I'll call legitimate actors and crypto who wanted to usher in this new wave, this new ecosystem, and then we brought together the heads of all kinds of agencies. Really an effort to kind of talk about building bridges, the government and the crypto industry. We're never gonna see eye to eye on a lot of things, but we did think there were some commonalities. Coinbase is a company that has suffered, they've been losing share, the valuation of the public markets has plummeted. Why do you think that is, and how do you think it can be fixed? Yeah, well I think again, a few things it's tied to. One, a large aspect of Coinbase's business now, of course, is trading revenue, and that's down when prices are down, and you know, the company's been very transparent about that long before going public. I mean, also if you look at its S1, it specifically identifies that, and just how volatile crypto cycles are. So I think that's part of it. It's judged by public markets as a technology stock, or as a financial services company. By the way, I think it's both. I think it's not just a financial services company. I think it's so much more. I think it's really a portal to this whole new ecosystem. You were also on the board of OpenC, until recently, there's an insider trading situation or accusation going on there. Coinbase has also had employees accused of insider trading. How much is this happening within crypto companies and within the industry, and how big a problem is? Yeah, I think crypto is under the microscope. So where you have a case, two cases, three cases, in crypto ecosystem, which now is a trillion dollar industry. I think multi-billion approaching trillion dollar industry, you're always gonna be able to find examples like that. So I don't want to make too much out of a handful of cases. That said, the company, Coinbase, OpenC, take these things incredibly seriously. Along with your position at Coinbase, you became a partner at one of the most storied venture capital firms in Silicon Valley. That was Andrews and Horowitz. What was your experience at A16Z-like? There I met Chris Dixon, and I met Ben Horowitz, and I met Mark Andrews, and I had worked with them for just about a year, maybe a little bit over when they asked me to come and co-run their crypto funds at Andrews and Horowitz. Again, I jumped at that chance, and I think really that speaks to the fact that, as I said before, things are a hell yes or there are no, and it was a hell yes for me. So Andrews and Horowitz is the kind of place where if you make a partner, you don't leave. How did Mark and Ben respond when you said, yeah, why don't you leave to start a crypto fund? Of my own. As you might know, Emily, they're an anchor. They're an anchor check into my fund, and I'm very grateful for that. Mark and Chris and folks like them are also personal LPs. So I felt very supported when I shared that decision. And I will say that it was not running away from Andrews and Horowitz. It was running to another opportunity. And you know, crypto is not, what do they say it's not a spectator sport? It's like, you're in it. It excuse very young. It's 24-7. It's global, and it's hustle. And that's a trade-off. It's a life trade-off. And at this point in my career and in my life, if I was going to continue to make that trade-off, I just wanted to do it and do it in a way that was really true to me. So you struck out on your own to launch on ventures. What gave you the courage to do that? What was the spark that lit the fire? Yeah, that got you to say, I need to do this and do this now. Sure, what I set out to do was to continue to invest in this ecosystem that I think is so broad that decision was very purposeful, and the timing was very purposeful. We have an early stage fund that does seed stage, series A, even series B, and then we have what we call an acceleration fund, which is not a growth fund, it's a crypto growth fund. And I think those are different things. But it's later stage. It might be crypto-publics. Certain kinds of public tokens were set up to hold tokens and participate in the token ecosystem. Or later stage companies. I mean, there are now several crypto, many crypto unicorns. The space has become really competitive. Even though you say, you know, crypto's had its kind of ups and downs. The thing is, a lot of people in some of those last cycles have seen the kind of venture style returns that can be having crypto. And so you've had a lot of new funds enter the space. And that's driven up competition. So what?",https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dp8PhLsUcFE,5744,2022-10-22 23:15:08
17339," Scene, the kind of venture style returns that can be had in crypto. And so you've had a lot of new funds enter the space, and that's driven up competition. So what differentiates on ventures then? From all of these other crypto funds, or even more traditional venture capitalists, like entries in Harowitz or Sequoia, they also have crypto funds now. Well, I think a lot of traditional venture capital funds now have crypto funds. It used to just be like a regulatory designation. It was like, are you an RIA, which is registered investment advisor? I would say for crypto founders today, it's not enough to just be an RIA, right? They, frankly, I don't even know if a lot of them care. That's a regulatory designation. What crypto founders today want to know is, do you live and breathe crypto? Do you inhale the discourse? Are you part of the community? Do you participate in governance? Are you going to be staking these kind of crypto verbs out there? And if you're not really in this space full time, I think it's very hard to run a successful crypto fund. We don't have a hedge fund component. So we're not sitting here buying and trading and selling. That's a hedge fund structure. And there are crypto hedge funds. We're not one. We're making seven to 10-year bets. Just how hard is it to launch a crypto fund from scratch? You know, it's hard, but it's not impossible. We don't have a crystal ball. I don't know. I can't predict cycles, but I knew that we were in a cycle where you saw so much for an excitement around the space. And I already talked about what makes this different. But I think one thing also is we are a nimble strike force. We don't fish in the same pond. We have the crypto natives. We have a fishing execution. We have operators, seasoned operators, who really know how to stick the landing. And I think that's reflected on our culture. I would say the only thing that's changed in our strategy as a result of the market correction is really more of a focus on early stage. But we still have our late stage fund. And when we see valuations, which I think will still see correct, spoiler. I think we'll continue to see some corrections. And so we might deploy our later stage fund a little bit more slowly. It might not be on an even 50-50 cadence. And that's okay. Long-term, our strategy hasn't changed. Long-term, we're committed to this space. How much do you think valuations are going to correct? You know, it's just, I can't give you a one-size-fits-all answer because crypto is not a monolith. You have some crypto companies that really follow more of an enterprise-sass business model. You have others that are layer one protocols. You have still others that are consumer-facing applications. And I think one of the things we're seeing right now is the infrastructure layer. And that's where we're spending a lot of our time, by the way. And we think more and more use cases will come about when the infrastructure layers in place. So my own view is we are not rushing to deploy. We're certainly not getting caught up. You do get VC FOMO. I try not to. Avoid that. You know, look, I think it's very easy to get into that mindset. Right? It's because it's a competitive sport. It's a competitive space. And I think I'd be lying if I said that that doesn't influence anyone. I try to, what I do, and I think I do differently, is I try to take stock of that. Oh, that's the FOMO mentality kicking in. That's bad. Again, you don't want to over-correct, though. What we look for is we look for amazing founders. It doesn't matter if I think valuations will correct. If there are amazing founders, there's a huge tam. We also look for what's your regulatory plan. If you're launching a token, what's your plan to comply with the law? What's your plan for security, by the way? We've seen a lot of hacks in the space. We want to really dive in there and make sure that the founders have been thoughtful about, especially if they're custody and customer funds, keeping those funds secure. If it's a cross-chain bridge, what are the exploits? Have you changed your strategy at all, given the downturn? What? Have you backed out of any deals or decided not to do certain deals? Because the conditions have changed since you raised the fund. We have decided not to do certain deals. We've never backed out of a deal. We have decided not to do a few deals. Because we think that pricing was ahead of progress, candidly. And we might have been wrong about that, Emily. We might have been wrong about that. But I think if we were wrong not to do a couple of deals, better that we might have been right. Because if we were wrong about that, I think we can find a way to still invest in those projects later. Well, one thing I'm hearing is that a lot of dry powder has just sacked up. Because all these funds raised a lot of money. Yeah. raised the biggest fund ever for a single person, not just a woman. Yeah. Anyone? Yeah. Are you confident you're going to have a place to put all that money? I am, but if I don't have a place to put it, I'm not just going.",https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dp8PhLsUcFE,5745,2022-10-22 23:19:27
17340," The biggest fund ever for a single person, not just a woman. Yeah. Anyone? Are you confident you're going to have a place to put all that money? I am, but if I don't have a place to put it, I'm not just going to go willing, nearly deploy it. One of the things that we told our LPs, even during the period when we raised our fund, which was when crypto was undeniably still on a bull run, we said that we are going to be pretty steadfast sticking to a tier deployment cycle. And I think one thing that's changed is that might have lengthened. It certainly hasn't. But we will, again, we have, we feel very good that we have the capital to back great teams when we see them. So you think we're going to fall behind the United States? I think we already are falling behind. Fall behind. And we're falling behind. And we're falling behind.

We are going to increasingly live in a digital world. And I happen to think that if you live in a digital world, you're going to want to own digital goods in that world. You're not just going to be satisfied to rent them, which is what we do now. We buy our content from walled gardens without digital scarcity, which is what NFTs unlock. You don't really own anything. You're subject to the whims of a platform. And I think NFTs and digitally scarce goods fundamentally change that. I think you'll see NFTs back again. But we are spending a lot of time in the infrastructure layer. Like I tell you, zero knowledge, technology, scalability, we think of that as the plumbing, if you think of the fiber-optic cables. Remember, you couldn't have had YouTube and Netflix with dial-up. You couldn't have streamed content. The same is true of crypto use cases. We think that there will be a lot of new use cases unlocked when the infrastructure is there, when it's more efficient, when it's more user-friendly. And so we're spending a lot of our time there. President Biden issues this crypto executive order. There are a number of ports that are coming due. What do you want to see from the administration when it comes to regulation and are you optimistic that we will get there? Yeah. We were so delighted to see that executive order. It's not something you should normally be delighted about. But why we were is because it was to us a real recognition that this is a US government saying, this field isn't going anywhere. This field is growing. It's growing so much that we are going to direct every single agency in the federal government to come up with a plan here. I think we take a step forward, but then you see, we're a big government. We're a big system. We have states. We have local entities. So we take a step forward with the EO. And then we take some steps back sometimes, too. And I think what I see as crypto founders are confused by that. They're starting to think, well, I could go to this jurisdiction where there's a single regulator. And you don't have 50 states with different rules. It's the US government that needs to start taking stock of the fact that right now, Emily in China, there's a quarter of a billion, ECNY wallets, a quarter of a billion. We're still talking about whether there should be a government central bank digital currency. We're still studying that. So you think we're going to fall behind the United States? I think we already are falling behind. Fall behind China. And we're falling behind. What are the dangers?",https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dp8PhLsUcFE,5746,2022-10-22 23:23:49
17341," I think we already are falling behind. Fall behind. And we're falling behind. What are the dangers of falling behind China? And the rest of the world. This is years ahead, so I don't want people to take a headline and say, oh, I think the US dollar will be, you know, no longer the global currency. Reserve global currency. I'm not saying that now. But fast forward decades. And if you no longer need to use the dollar because you have an alternative, I think that's a real problem. What would we use instead? Well, I think that there are going to be stable coins out there that people who have access to a smartphone will use. There is a demand for it. We see a 285% year of your growth with stable coins. So people are clearly liking the idea of this. Now, again, there have been some spectacular failures too, but not all stable coins are created the same. But I think the important thing is that we really do need to not just quash innovation. What do you think of how Gary Gensler, the chair of the SEC, and how he's approaching it? One of the things that I hear from founders is that they're very confused because they get told, come in, register. Just come in and talk to us. But you have the one company who's done the ultimate act of going in and registering coinbase, filed an S1. And still, you know, there's a lot of saber rattling still going on, I think. And again, I don't want to single out the SEC, you know, and I don't want to suggest that anything they're doing is bad. I do think, though, that right now there's a lot of confusion. And one of the pieces of confusion stems from the fact that, you know, and it started with the ICO, Mania back in what 2016, 2017, I can't even remember which year now, where the SEC was very loud about securities. A lot of them were securities, but the space has changed. And so to still view it through the ICO lens, when so much has happened over the last five years in the space, I think is a mistake. What do you have to say to the skeptics out there who just don't believe in the future of Web3? And don't see where this is going. Yeah. I would say don't judge the current state of innovation by the end state of innovation. I hear from a lot of these skeptics. And by the way, I'm friends with a lot of these skeptics too. I don't only want to live in a crypto bubble. They want to see the use cases, especially if they're not technical. Well, when am I going to use it? What will I use it for? And I think one of the things that's not appreciated is how quickly the infrastructure here is catching up. And once you have kind of a, once you have really scalable blockchains that can handle a lot of throughput and are very efficient, I think that unlocks a whole lot of use cases. People are spending more time on screens. That curve is up and to the right. Whether we like it or not, that is the future. I mean, those who have kids know that kids spend more time online. They want digital things too. And I think to dismiss it, it is a bit generational. I do find. Not always, but it is a bit generational. If you talk to kids about being able to have money online, they instantly get that concept. They're comfortable not having to hold something in their hand to think it has value. Take us to the end state. Do Google and Amazon and Facebook and Apple still exist? I believe they will still exist. I mean, it depends what you talk about when you talk about the end state. I mean, I think that, you know, I think for decades, those companies will still be around. But the important thing is I think this new ecosystem is going to represent a challenge to them. I do think that those entities, decentralized forces are coming. And we'll cut into those entities, profits and revenues. So we have a little rapid fire section. If you could belong to any altcoin tribe, the 20p. Gosh. There is no way I'm answering that because I will get trolls on Twitter by every other altcoin tribe. I'm a crypto maximalist.

17343," Family Man Restaurant tour and real estate investor who's endeavoring to have more impact with his businesses than he's had against quarterbacks in the NFL. It's a simple concept of like I don't want to be at the top of the pyramid or be amongst the 1% and be there by myself. I want to bring other people with me that are like mine didn't want to work with them and when you have the opportunity to help other people at the same time it's a smart business decision. Why not create both. Done! For someone who is so single-minded on the field seeing Sioux in his native habitat, it's a bit startling and not just because he's a dad. From his home office bouncing from zooms to calls to text he's methodically creating an empire. It includes investments in tech companies like Quip and Ember and hospitality investments including restaurants in Portland and beyond. But the primary focus for Sioux has been real estate. Of the past decade much of his investments have been focused on multi-family and commercial projects. So tell me your business philosophy like in a nutshell like how do you distill it down. Just understanding that investing and social impact can go without question-hand to the hand and I think you can impact other people's lives and do good but at the same time make smart business decisions where as I've always seen it as a true give-and-take relationship versus just someone always taking and I think that's what that capitalistic mindset that majority of America lives in. It's a short trip from where we're sitting to see where Sioux came from. His home in the offseason is here in the Irvington District of Portland and his house is only a few streets away from where he grew up. This hoop's been here for ages oh my gosh and the family that own this house their son actually played the NBA. There used to be at the far end we called our little who we'd have our main death contest. What was Portland like like when you were growing up me now it's seen as this like boom town right but was it like that 20 years ago? No Portland was very very small everybody knew everybody pretty much. Growing up in Portland Sioux is surrounded by sports Nike's headquarters was just 20 minutes away and he still works out there when he's home. His older sister in Goomsu also became an elite athlete. She'd end up going to the 2004 Olympics as a soccer player playing for their father's home country of Kimmeroo. Oftentimes in a family especially when you have multiple superstars it's clear that like this family's in the business of growing superstar athlete. My parents could care less about. They wanted us to be in athletics and have that fulfillment of being in sports but hands down education was a number one and my sister's super smart she got a degree in kinesiology and biological sciences. Su's parents divorced when he was two but stayed close. His mom was an elementary school teacher and his dad owned an HVAC company. As a young kid I enjoyed going to work with him. I got to spend a lot of time with my dad on job sites and it's really what got me into the business. As I got a little bit older towards middle school it would be me going to the job side and being out and saying you can earn $5-10 towards your bike. He just wanted to see if I'd be willing to get up at 6 o'clock in the morning. This is my dad's house that we grew up in. We bought the building, we lived on one side and rented the other side and that's where we really started to learn about real estate or how I started to learn about real estate. From those early days Su's fascination with an ambition in real estate only grew especially as a pro football career gave him the means to hide bigger and bigger projects. He's been buying and building property in his hometown of Portland as well as across the United States including luxury residential, office and hospitality space and affordable housing. All with the mission down.",https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dp8PhLsUcFE,5749,2022-10-22 23:36:41
17344," building property in his hometown of Portland as well as across the United States, including luxury residential, office and hospitality space, and affordable housing. All with the mission to help build generational wealth through real estate. And real estate is one of the most tried and true places to store and grow wealth. Buying an owning property, commercial or residential, when done right, can be a source of income as well as a crew value over time. That's if you choose projects wisely and have patience. Over the past few years, the pandemic both increased demand and lowered the supply of housing, leading to skyrocketing values. At the same time, low interest rates made acquiring the capital needed to purchase properties even easier. More recently though, rising mortgage rates and new supply have begun to change that picture and rents have been increasing at historic levels. Oning real estate has the additional benefit of influencing maybe even transforming the neighborhood and the community around you. That's an idea passed down to Sue from his father. He assembled a handful of different lots and projects and this is one of them that has been, I won't say a unicorn, but it's been very, very profitable. If you look at the building, you have the exterior, so we gutted everything inside and kept the exterior facade and then built on top of that. It was originally a chop shop when we first took over. At night when I was growing up in the 90s and early 2000s would not walk up and down these streets by any means. You see it's live, you got great restaurants up and down, coffee shops further down, you got everybody probably knows assault and straw, they're right up the street. There's no way they would be here back in the 90s. So my dad had a great vision and focus for seeing where the city was moving. Athletes investing in real estate properties in order to renovate them isn't that remarkable at its face. It separates Sue, his fluency and the details of the business. He learned that on the job of his dad as well as in the classroom. Big expensive cities have a lot going for them, but if you live in one, you probably notice that these big expensive cities keep getting more well expensive. You could always move away. You might have just started working remotely so there's really nothing keeping you there. But then again, moving is a hassle. Well, what if someone cade you 10 grand to do it? What if they threw in free office space, a bicycle or a gym membership? Programs and cities and states around the US are doing exactly that and they're getting a lot of interest. We've had over 50,000 applications. About 90,000 applications. We've had over 1800 applicants from all over North America. So are these nascent programs actually beneficial to their communities and the workers joining them? Or are they little more than flashy advertising campaigns for places looking for an injection of fresh talent? You will shed light on dark matter. You will make aging optional.

So before you invent pioneer, disrupt. Before you change the world, Bloomberg. Top experts, great questions. Disruptive defensive player in college football. The most dominant player that I've seen this season. Hevily recruited athlete. He opted for the University of Nebraska, which has not only a great football team, but a highly regarded construction engineering program. I knew leaving high school, I wanted to get an engineering degree because my ultimate goal was to come back here to Portland and build another division to my dad's company.

17345," In engineering degree, because my ultimate goals come back here to Portland, then build another division to my dad's company. Granted, that didn't necessarily happen because other things transpired. But like going, bro. Yeah, like going, bro, yeah. I think I get it from both my parents, but primarily my dad. We've always been somewhat calculated and focused on what we want to accomplish in building and connecting with the right people, and then also just learning from others. Lincoln, Nebraska may not be the first place you'd think to meet some of the world's most influential business people. The Portland Metro area alone has more people living in it than the entire state of Nebraska. But his play on the field allowed him to meet and maintain relationships with future mentors in his business career, including the Oracle of Omaha himself Warren Buffett. I loved the old regional story last year that called you a secret finance nerd. Let's talk a little bit about that because it's more important. Ever since then, we've been close friends, confident, and really a true mentor, being able to bounce a bunch of different ideas off, and then also understand how he envisions the world. Although he's not fully into real estate, and he's changed a little bit because he now has a brick trial, a half the way home, you know what not. That long-term vision and that being able to buy and hold is one of the greatest things ever that I learned from him. Sue also met with one of the most interesting people who has split time between the locker room and the boardroom, Joe Moglia. Moglia's career began in the coaching world, but he would rise through the ranks to lead TD Ameritrade as CEO from 2001 to 2008, and Chairman from 2008 to 2020, navigating the company through the global financial crisis and its aftermath, as well as its eventual combination with Schwab. He was around my entire senior year, and one pay, I just asked him, you always leave every Friday before our games, and come back Saturdays ready to go. Where do you go? It's always like a black car going out. It's like I go to New York, I go take care of business with TD Ameritrade, I'm the chairman there, and then I come back and obviously have my role here with you guys. And I was like, well, that's pretty interesting. I'd love to learn more. So he said, well, make sure you follow it with me after the season. All right, so I asked him this exact same question, check out what Joe had to say. So our first step, our first step is going to be, I want you to come down to my office. The season was over, and I want to see the budget that you would put together. So he comes down, it's about a month later, and I got to tell you, I was impressed. He comes into my office with a suit on, tie on, he looked great, and we sat down, he showed me his budget. The budget was about $60,000. Now, we've talked about that a little bit, two or three months. He was going to get a pretty significant contract, and he was going to make a shitload of money, and $60,000 budget with regards to all the different things that people is going to be interacting with is probably not going to quite work out. Yeah, that's exactly right. He's like, man, you're going to be spending anywhere from $20,000, $30,000 a month. And I was like, there's no way I'm in college right now. My rent's like $1,500, yeah, I didn't imagine ever getting there. Along the hole I'm there, so. There was of course one other pivotal person he'd meet and cultivate a relationship with during his college days, his future wife, Kacya. I have only been a champion. It is beautiful. Lady in my life. We met all the way back in 2009. I was a women's basketball player, and he was a football player. And the best way that I like to explain it is he ran after me a lot, and would always try to kind of say he's going to break my ankles, or what do we play one-on-one, and I was like, uh, hi, who are you? And so after some time, I finally gave him a little chance, and I got to know him, and truly he became my best friend. The two have had a whirlwind past few years. They moved in together in 2018. They were engaged in 2019 and had their then traditional zoom wedding back in 2020. In February of 2021, Indomacan would win his first Super Bowl with a Tampa Bay vuccaneers, and just a few months later, the two would welcome their twin sons, Kari and Kingston. When the two aren't changing diapers or doing the latest TikTok trend, their business partners, working together out of the same home office for much of the off-",https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dp8PhLsUcFE,5751,2022-10-22 23:45:29
17346," and Kingston. When the two aren't changing diapers, they're doing the latest TikTok trend, their business partners working together out of the same home office for much of the offseason. We really both listen to each other's calls. We kind of have what's going on in the mornings after workouts and when the boys are doing breakfast, we'll be like, what's your plan for today? How many calls do you have? When are your calls? Are the ones that I can listen in on? Are the ones that he's like, you know what? I want to be a part of that. I want to participate or just listen in. The two also work together on the Sue Family Foundation, the charitable arm of Sue's business ventures that focuses on empowering people with resources for long-term success. One issue they're working to address is financial literacy. Right now, there is no financial literacy requirement at all at any level and to me, that's mind-blowing. It finances our in our life. From the minute we are born to the minute we are no longer here. And so to not have a requirement of how things run, how to properly use your finances is to me quite insane. And while many athletes can back to their community, the Sue's extend that notion to all of their business enterprises as well. Looking not only at how they can impact the bottom line, but impact their communities and one of those spaces has been restaurants. MUSIC Japan's critical role in the global economy is changing as the world recalibrates. After decades of stagnation, Japan's leaders are forging a more innovative and sustainable path forward to revitalize the nation. Corporate giants, policymakers and pioneers tell us how they're doing just that. Every week on Japan ahead, we're right here on Bloomberg Television. No one covers the world like Bloomberg. The pressure cooker just got far too hot in banning them for the government to handle. You foresee two-thirds of the crypto hedge funds will disappear. Are we close? The European Union will support and defend Ukraine's derrige rural integrity. With unmatched reach and resources, from more than 120 countries, the moment news breaks 24 hours a day. Bloomberg, you are global business authority. MUSIC One of Sue's restaurant investments is here in downtown Portland. A fast-casual restaurant called Bees Fry Chicken, he started with a previously successful Portland-based restaurant tour named Mike at Camden. To understand it, I ordered a chicken sandwich for myself for journalism. Tell me about where we are. We are in downtown Portland. This building was built in 1882, so that's an old building. You don't get much older than that in Portland. We got the Fry Chicken Challenge. We got the chicken strips. It's easy, it's approachable, it's super great quality. When we opened this up, we went straight to organic on all the chicken, which was awesome. It was very, very juicy, so be careful. But good food and a good location aren't guarantees of success in the restaurant world. Restaurants are tricky businesses for athletes, seemingly easy to understand, but complex to conceive, operate, and market. Actually, they're hard businesses for anyone, even food pros. While Micah himself has had successful ventures with restaurants like Fox or Ramen, Little Big Burger, and Blue Star doughnuts, in 2016, he had just shut down a previous attempt at a Fry Chicken restaurant. Restaurants are high risk. What's appealing to you about being in this particular restaurant business? It's one, this is a foodie town. I got amazing chefs, people that enjoy quality, high quality food, and kind of giving back to my community is something that was missing. And then also, you come out and see there are an pandemic. A lot of people are supporting people in their nevers. The last few years have been far from the solid days for the restaurant industry. The pandemic altered dining, living, and-",https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dp8PhLsUcFE,5752,2022-10-22 23:49:43
17347," and see there are an endemic a lot of people supporting people on their networks. The last few years have been far from the solid days for the restaurant industry. The pandemic altered dining, living and working habits and everything from lockdowns to labor shortages have plagued the food business. Bays opened this location only a few months before the global pandemic shut down much of the country and George Floyd's murder led to a reckoning around racial inequality. As protests and counter protests swept the country, Portland became a focal point. Images of property destruction by protesters, who themselves were often the victims of violent attacks by extreme right-wing groups, as well as Portland police, ricocheted across social media, giving rise to a flood of disinformation by opponents of police reform. It was ground zero. Right out of our front door was ground zero for the night we protested it went on for three or four months. Thankfully enough, this community knew that this this location was owned by Sue and then we didn't get stuff on door windows, you know stuff like that. But the attention that was brought to Portland via those protests hit its cause, it hit its nerve, and it started the conversation that is still going on today. Portland has in recent years been an almost cartoonish example of a liberal stronghold. And while coffee shops and breweries are a thing here, the real Portland is a complicated place in a state of near existential crisis facing issues around affordability, the unhoused, and crime. People of color in Portland have been historically disenfranchised, especially when it comes to one of Sue's biggest businesses, real estate, and development. Like in many cities across the U.S. nearly a century ago, redlining practices allowed white neighborhoods easier access to capital, and excluded black and immigrant communities, including Sue's home in the Northeast of Portland, where Irvington was, quote, still desirable, just a few blocks north, Alberta was considered, quote, hazardous. And while redlining was made illegal in the 60s, its effects are still being felt. Investment in areas like Alberta, where Sue and his father-bought-a-property have helped revitalize neighborhoods. But it's also led to gentrification, driving out home prices and pushing people of color out. Through his development company HMS, Sue is hoping to change the traditional narrative. We are down on Alberta, further down from where we're at before, but this is 30th where we are creating Alberta Alley, which is going to be a nice collection of BIPOC type of restaurants. Beyond creating a space for black, Indigenous, and people of color owners of restaurants, Sue has also brought in more black investors, including another profile player with Portland Roads, named Brennan Scarlett. We went to take a look, but as you might expect, we had to go inside. Let's go inside. Right now, Alberta Alley is still very much work in progress, but the intention is to create a space for multiple restaurants and eateries in a communal, well-alley type experience. Currently, they're working to bring a Latino-owned expansion of puppies chulos and another base for a chicken location to the space. You guys are native sons, you know, sort of putting a different mark on this city. Tell me about, you know, your process of being an owner and not just a, like, participant, not just a customer to sound like. Yeah, Portland's an interesting place and has a long history of racism, of marginalizing certain groups. Like the house that I grew up in on the deed, it says that a black person couldn't own that house, right? But my dad, you know, purchased that house back, you know, in the 90s. Right now, you think about, like, purchasing commercial properties like this, right? Under black ownership, and then also, you know, the cycle of having tenants here and being intentional about having tenants here that are represented that may have historically not been able to have an opportunity to be represented. When I grew up here, it was predominantly a black neighborhood and a lot of different people just kind of starting out their businesses here, that's really in the bipop space. And so a lot of justification moved those things out and brought up new developments and not really looking for a way.",https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dp8PhLsUcFE,5753,2022-10-22 23:54:02
17348," Bringing out their businesses here, that is really in the bipod-based space. And so a lot of justification moved those things out and brought up new developments and not really looking for a way to bring those people back in. And so this is an interesting way to fold them back into having that opportunity of kind of getting kicked out and now not coming back and hopefully being successful and finding ways to help them be successful. We have a very altruistic view when it comes to our real estate endeavors and have multi-family units and be able to create them and mix-use developments. I think one of the most things I'm gonna be proud of as we're getting this journey and started is our allied project, the TANABL living initiative where we really want to have the ability to afford a TANABL living for everybody and we're starting here in Portland. There's never been a greater need for housing and yet it's almost impossible to get housing done and developed. Sue's partner at HMS is Joel Anderson, a third-generation contractor and developer based in Portland. And while the two have developed a portfolio of everything from high-rise residential to industrial, one of the common threads is their vision of the social impact real estate can have. Both Sue and I have been very fortunate and worked very hard. Some lucky bounces that they went our way and there's a whole bunch of people that we interact with in our communities that just didn't have those same opportunities and have never had access to invest in commercial real estate. While real estate investments have been a great place to store wealth, the recent housing market has left many unable to participate, especially when it comes to BIPOC communities. And I think one of the ways that we can do that with all the cap as we call it is giving them the opportunity to not only pay rent and understand those other pieces and keep it afloat, but also give them the opportunity to be a part of it. And one thing you know about people, when they have ownership into a building, they take care of it not much more better. All of these people are really important. Affordable housing, which about half of Americans say their community lacks, is a hot button issue long-fraid with racism. Some say they oppose it over perceived increases in crime, erosion in the tax base, and increased traffic. Sue and Joel believe they can ultimately flip the script by better knitting residents into the community economically, by affording everyone a stake. El Turista Capital, AltCap, it's very intention is to bring people in that have been excluded. If we take an accredited investor, somebody and say, okay, you're gonna invest $100,000 in this project. They'll, yes. But you're only gonna get credit for 95% of that. And $5,000 or 5% of your investment is gonna go to a nonprofit AltCap Community Reinvestment Fund. And we say to them now, okay, you can participate from $500,000 to $5,000. And for every dollar you invest, we will match you through the AltCap Reinvestment Fund dollar for dollar. And so if you have somebody who invests $500, they now have $1,000 investment into this project. They've effectively doubled their return. It may seem complicated, but Joel and Sue believe that programs like AltCap can give people who've long been excluded from real estate and attainable investment option. While some investors might balk at giving up some of their economics, proponents of this shared ownership believe it's long overdue. If we can get real estate transactions to include everybody, you're talking about trillion dollar industry that has the ability to engage everybody in a micro fashion earned at a disproportionate rate, you can transition the wealth of our country in short order. Of course, undoing centuries of economic disparity and systemic financial bias, that's a long game. For Sue, it's his life's work. And he'll be able to devote even more time to it once he leaves the game of football. How do you think about the idea of transition, especially given everything that you've already done in business? Yeah, the transition to difficult one for me. I look at it consistent and have over the last couple of years from a standpoint, especially since the boys came into my life. If I want to spend this much time with him and not miss out on things. How do you balance like the economics versus the emotions? I mean, this is a deep analysis. This is one of the most important decisions you'll ever make. Yeah, I think the analysis is very straightforward. It comes down to numbers in a lot of ways. But then also, just do I believe I have more to offer it without question? And do I aspire to being that Hall of Fame? No question. Do I want to do?",https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dp8PhLsUcFE,5754,2022-10-22 23:58:25
