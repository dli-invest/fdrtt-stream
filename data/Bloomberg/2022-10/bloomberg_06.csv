Patagonia began donating 10% of its profits to grassroots organizations in 1985 this later became the one% of sales that she and odd labels and earth tax It's for Andrea. It's rent for us living on this planet While Patagonia was creating the blueprint of how to be a socially conscious brand it was also turning a profit It even made ink magazines list of the fastest growing privately held companies. So every time the company makes a decision to do something socially environmentally active. Any other leaders of the company The more money Patagonia made the more it gave away under its philanthropic program. Between 1989 and 1991 the payroll group by 40%. But trouble was on the horizon. Oh, I think for 1991, we are looking at a recession. The question is, how deep that recession is going to be and how long will be in it? Sales fell flat and the bank called in the company's revolving loans. A company that prided itself from taking care of its own laid off 120 people roughly 20% of its workforce When we decided that we're gonna start doing things differently. We're gonna start running the company as if it's going to be here 100 years. With a renewed sense of purpose Patagonia was ready for what it called business unusual. It started with the costly move to recycled an organic materials before launching a clothing repair service to discourage fast fashion And Patagonis influence was growing.

By the environment, by your employees, by your community, and that to me was like the most holistic vision of business that I'd ever seen. So right now, Patagonia has a team of about 20 people Consumers are paying much more attention to the social footprint of companies and where they buy their goods. So, what's happened is all this is good business for Patagonia in the past 10 years. Revenue and profit at the company are Quadruple it's private but estimates are it does about a one 1 billion dollars in annual sales which is sizable And that's part of the reason why it's been such a fortune cycle as it's ramped up it's activism and become more vocal on these things It's resonated with the market Has the company brunched out into other areas including adventure capital fund for environmental causes and sustainable food revenue reached a new peak of over one 1 billion dollars in 2017. But this was still small change compared to fast fashion heavy weights like Nike who made 37 1 billion dollars that same year Patagonias Conscience hasn't always been reflected in its customer base either.

For instance, you know, people in finance where the Patagonia Go to the office and that's because of the image that the the brand projects and so they have to leave with the fact although they you know preach for the environment I want to stand for good Things of the wrong success. Patagonia set sales records in the first 3 years of the Trump administration. Now, in 2020, things have changed.

I think if you don't you were sowing the seeds of your long term decline and I learned that really early on in my career now if you're investing In an industry like this and trying to do truly transformative things by definition everything can't succeed and so by definition you should have the metrics and data and milestones to assess is it working or is it not Because if everything's working or if you think everything's working, I would say one or two things are wrong. Either you're not reaching high enough. You're not being honest enough with yourself about the pace of breakthrough whether you're gonna get there. So, to me, Natural part you know kind of a sister To investing for long-term growth is actually thinking about how are you doing with the risk that you're taking stack rack them and figure out what's at the bottom so you can redeploy those resources to the top they go together actually and so I find the narrative it's They go together and you have to think of them as actually empowering one another.

In terms of whether it means they scale back the extended further rate hikes possibly or it could mean a scale back the extended tightening they're due but I think you do just do need to see fairly big stress in the market considering more than what you've got at the moment to get the fed to move away from his current course current course ,https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dp8PhLsUcFE,79,2022-10-05 05:22:52

Still not certain exactly how many winners there were of lucky 349 bottle caps but we know that Pepsi printed over 600 1000 of them Pepsi realized very early that there was a problem Hundreds of people started arriving at their bottling plants with their lucky bottle caps They realized something was seriously wrong Perhaps he tried to solve the problem by offering a small token donation to anyone that brought a lucky bottle cap To their bottling plan.

They're smaller. Can you give us a sense of how many are out there in our solar system We know that there are a lot of asteroids in our solar system. They number in the billions. Most of them, however, are between Mars and Jupiter and what we call the main asteroid belt. This is a region of space where most of the afternoons in the inner photographs are solar system live and they stay there for many billions of years. There's another Somewhat close to the earth. And we call these near earth objects. We think that there are millions and millions of nearer objects that are out there in the total population. As of today, we know of the sort of around 2025, 1000 something like that. When we first spot an object, we we really know very little about it. We just see something moving across Sky. So, all you get is just sort of a handful of snapshots, just enough to be able to tell that this isn't an asteroid that we've already seen before. And then once we can calculate the distance to it, we can now start to make predictions about it. Is it large or is it small So we have a lot of information that we have to get pretty quickly to really understand what's going on. Finding asteroids is just one piece of the puzzle. Planetary scientist are extremely skilled and determining the orbits and speeds of asteroids based on relatively small amounts of data.

Simulations and and AI can those things fill in the gaps where perhaps telescopes and and other imaging tools can't. Absolutely. Since the observations get more complex. The physics gets more complex and it's a physics to get more complex. The mathematics becomes more complex. And at some point you can't solve your problems analytically anymore. And then this where the computer comes in. Now we have this train neural network. We have a way of calculating in a fraction of a seconds. Whether or not an estroid is potentially dangerous or not and therefore deserves more attention Or or more time to spend on for for really finding out if it is dangerous. When it comes to hunting asteroids time is critical. What we can do about a potentially hazardous object depends a great deal on what we know about it and how much time we have before the encounter We really like to find the one there decades away because the more time you have, the more options you have. And the less energy it takes to to move an object to side. It also means we might not have to resort to launching a nuclear warhead as an asteroid. Until recently, pretty much our only choice.

It was a vision initially introduced by them prime minister Lee Quan Yu in 1967 to make life more pleasant for people and today Singapore is one of the world's greenest cities in terms of urban vegetation. Campum admiralty the community center that contains health facilities and social spaces now provides more green space than the plot of land it was originally built on It's topped by a roofscape of staggered terraces covered in local plants which functions as a community park. And a village green in the center that contains farm plots for residents to tend to. Park royal on pickering was designed as a hotel in a garden that doubled the green growing potential of its site.

One of the potential advantages of wave energy is that it could act as a complimentary source of power. Compared to other renewables on the grid if Scaled up to commercial scale. For decades engineers have been trying to convert wave energy into electricity. But a host of technological and financial challenges have complicated their efforts. In the years from around 2006 to 2015 there were To bankruptcies in the sector and this was largely because of a lack of kind of continuous Proven projects out at sea with reliable electricity generation. Since then companies have been trying to develop the technologies at a steadier pace and with a smaller cash burn. With the same questions remain 10 companies developed devices and technologies that actually work Is wave energy just a novelty or something that can become a major renewable energy source. BC is a very challenging environment within which to operate a car project. So sea water is creative and conditions are very rough so this means that power projects don't have a very long lifetime and it increases operating and maintenance costs. Partly because of that many early wave energy projects hit rough waters such as the palamus wave energy convert it in portugal and the isla limpit project in Scotland But that hasn't stopped others from trying. ,https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dp8PhLsUcFE,225,2022-10-05 16:02:10

But the filters come a long way in recent years and with the right engineering solutions this new power source could eventually become competitive with more mature renewables like solar and wind. I would have a lot more confidence in the success wave energy companies today as opposed to like 20 years ago but in the next few years or maybe the next couple of decades it it will be more likely to be used in remote locations like islands that are otherwise dependent on expensive Or out at sea on gas decommissioning rigs or for parring underwater or Thomas vehicles. So definitely wave energy can compete with other renewable energy sources but I personally believe that this is not a competition. In order to have a 100% renewable energy friendly world we need all renewable energy sources to work together ,https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dp8PhLsUcFE,227,2022-10-05 16:10:42

They played golf together. They were going holiday together. We found out that a number of them were members over the West Ham supporters club in London.

Now this is just astounding because this land is owned by the nature conservancy. They do not clear cut land that they've bought through philanthropic donations. So this scenario that they've put forward to get carbon revenues is not really plausible And what that means is when you have Disney coming in and buying these credits When it eventually lowers its carbon footprint because of these credits well that won't be incredible or truthful claim by Disney. So this is this is an organization that truly understands the the threat of the issue of of climate change and is wanting to do its part to address this.

So where What place do you think hydrogen is likely to have in the future energy mix globally? Hydrogen this incredible solution for us is we look to decarbonize because it's a perfect solution in areas that are hard to electrify.

That sounds great that it can be used for such diverse industries. At the end of the day though, how much Going to cost.

It's brand, it's reputation, which is essentially what it's business is based upon. Is Airbnb grew like way too big for them to be able to take all these calls alone they developed a team of 100 highly specialized agents that handle the worst of the worst cases Course of my reporting I've talked to almost 50 former employees at Eddie BMB and you know seven or eight of those work directly on this elite unit these safety agents many of them come from military backgrounds or trauma backgrounds the a trained to handle traumatic situations and to try and you know help people who are Through what what may be you know the worst day in their lives.

They didn't have a policy around key exchange. They didn't tell their hosts how they did or didn't have to hand keys over to guests as they were arriving. So for Airbnb they also you know they wanted to know what was gonna be set in court they wanted to know if any media were gonna pick up on the story And they wanted to know what the illegal liability potentially could be. Later the alleged rapist was indicted and the supreme court in New York and Airbnb sent a staff member to find out if the company was gonna be mentioned in any of the court records And it wasn't. It wasn't mentioned in the police report. It wasn't mentioned by prosecutors. There's no mention of your BNB really in any public record. This case is never been reported until now.
